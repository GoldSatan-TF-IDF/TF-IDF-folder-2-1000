mark chadbourn the hounds of avalon chapter one cant get there from here these are the times that try mens souls thomas paine the final days of the human race started as they would end with sapphire lightning bolts lashing back and forth across a stark hall it appeared to the assembled group that a furious electrical storm was raging within the room the air suffused with the smell of burned iron eyes shielded from the glare by sunglasses the four men and one woman stood in awe behind the plexiglas screen they had the universe in their hands and they knew it standing at the back of the group was hal campbell at first ignored now forgotten twentyeight years old bagcarrier coffeemaker officially titled chief clerk to the ministry of defence bookish quiet and always watchful sometimes hal was happy in the obscurity with which nature had blanketed him at others he yearned to be involved in the great affairs he saw around him every day but he knew it would never happen there was no bigger barrier to this than his character which shunned risk wallowed in nostalgia was overly sentimental and romantic and found security in the routine after seven years climbing the career ladder in a world of quiet voices and filing cabinets he knew he had now reached as high as he could go another bolt of energy almost crashed against the plexiglas window and the front line of viewers took a step back as one before laughing nervously hal observed their faces transformed into fantastic visages by the shifting shadows of the flashing blue light at the front exuding authority was the general he was known simply by that title as if there was only one but his full name was clive parsifal morgan though in his late fifties he still maintained the boyish floppy haircut and superior demeanour he had developed at public school honed at welbeck college turned into a fine art at sandhurst hes coming he said simply how can you tell i cant see anything past all that damned flashing david reid pressed his sunglasses against the bridge of his nose and leaned towards the protective window as he did so his jacket fell open and hal caught a glimpse of reids handgun in its holster slickedback black hair piercing blue eyes expensive dark suit still thinks hes james bond hal thought next to reid catherine manning stood icily aloof hal knew shed been an investment banker in the city before the fall not much call for her occupation since the crash but somehow shed managed to find a place in the reformed government hal was impressed by her always impeccable appearance long black hair gleaming lips and eyes madeup despite the increasing rarity of any beauty products she wore a smart pinstripe jacket and skirt and standing next to reid hal noted how alike they were in manner and dress the final observer was the governments chief scientist dennis kirkham hal knew little about his past but kirkham was certainly well respected in current government circles he was a greyfaced man quiet and intense his thick glasses magnifying an unblinking stare that made hal uneasy all eyes were fixed on the giant bluestone that dominated the hall proud and inspiring even torn from its context it was still covered in lichen and clods of earth from stonehenge hal couldnt help feeling a twinge of sadness to see it there for around years it had stood guard over salisbury plain but once the higher authorities had decided that they had another use for it it had been uprooted and transported unceremoniously to its new location his attention was suddenly jerked from the megalith to the depths of the light display in the infinite blue he could have sworn he fleetingly saw a face looking back at him even more disturbing it appeared to have his own features hal knew it was just a trick of the coruscating energy at play but even so it left him with cold sweat trickling down his back hes there i tell you the general tapped forcefully on the plexiglas shield cant you see his outline coming through over there everyone turned their attention to the few pieces of electrical equipment that had been used to jumpstart the bluestones residual energy the red and green lights of a computer terminal were just visible through the sizzling blue glare hal still couldnt see anything but catherine manning had become animated yes i see him hes made it lets not get too excited yet kirkham cautioned his face set of all of them he was the one who most understood the risks hal recalled kirkhams briefing when glenning had been selected they had laughingly dubbed glenning the psychonaut a name that had since buckled under the weight of its own accumulated mythology the chances are you may not be coming back kirkham had warned glenning as they stood before the lecture hall whiteboard covered with kirkhams convoluted diagrams the knowledge encoded in all the old stories makes it quite clear what will happen to mortals who venture where they shouldnt hal was jolted from his memory by a shimmer of blue light in the shape of a man near the spot the general had indicated yes catherine said her fists bunched in triumph phasing in kirkham muttered to himself he checked the set of monitors on the desk next to him ozone level high ultrasound emf spiking this is it so you dont have to be at one of the nodes after all reid mused as long as you can manipulate that energy you can do it anywhere think of the implications yes just think the general said sardonically all you need is a fourton megalith strapped to your back a soundless explosion of blue light forced them to shield their eyes despite their sunglasses when it cleared the crackling bolts of lightning had gone and glenning was standing near the bluestone still wearing his raf thermal flight suit hal could instantly see that something was wrong the pilot was shaky on his feet disoriented his skin as pale as snow but it was his eyes that would haunt hal in the coming months buried in their depths was a terror so vast that it appeared to be consuming glenning from within this was a man who had personally seen the very depths of hell someone who knew that his life was already over and that what was to come would be worse glenning stared at them all through the plexiglas window and desperation carved its way into his face he reached out one arm opened his mouth to plead and then he simply disintegrated it was as though hal mused later he had been a statue carved out of sand collapsing under its own weight a pile of grey dust was all that remained in the sterile atmosphere of the hall hal couldnt quite believe what he had seen one second glenning had been there living and breathing and human and then unbelievably he wasnt hals mind rebelled at what his eyes were telling it gradually though his incredulity became dismay at the loss of a man in such an inhuman way another failure kirkham said levelly checking his monitors jubilation drained from catherine mannings face leaving behind a sickened horror oh my god she said her voice dry whats happened to him the only way were ever going to cross over is by defeating that fatal flaw in our makeup that selfdestructs whenever we try to pass through the barrier kirkham continued ignoring the question we know that some people can do it the general said we need to find out what theyve got that we havent gladly kirkham said if we had one i could examine what about glenning hal couldnt take his eyes off the pile of dust yes poor bastard reid replied somebody is going to have to tell his wife in his office filled with antique furniture and books that had not been opened for many a year the general lit a small black cigar and offered the others whisky from a crystal decanter hal distributed the drinks on a tarnished silver tray i dont believe we can afford to wait any longer general reid said once they were all seated around the large desk hal retired to a shadowy corner invisible but watching i agree the general swirled the amber liquid in his glass and then inhaled the honeyed fragrance thought so for a while now to be honest but as you know the pm is a cautious man theres no great urgency catherine manning said theyve left us alone in recent months in fact intelligence hasnt reported any sightings of them anywhere she looked to reid for confirmation make no mistake the tuatha de danann are still out there reid had a file filled with the latest briefings from his men and women out in the communities and the things that came along with the old gods are certainly still a threat villages in the yorkshire dales being terrorised by some creature that turns people to stone something with blades for hands cutting people up in liverpool the national parks the fells and fens whole swathes of the country inaccessible unless youve got a squadron of heavily armed men the tuatha de danann are the root of it all the general said firmly without them none of these other things would be here but were still not adequately equipped to fight them manning protested how can we be expected to go up against gods they are not gods the general stressed uneducated barbaric peasants centuries ago might have thought them gods when the tuatha de danann first ventured here but were above such primitive nonsense yes they have immense power yes they can do things beyond our current understanding but they are not gods and they can be defeated we have to use our intelligence our resilience and the other abilities given to us by himself the real god manning sipped her drink quietly but hal could tell that she was not convinced the general turned to kirkham review what we know einstein postulated the idea of a parallel universe other dimensions of course theyve always existed in myth the home of the gods asgard avalon now we know in this as in so many other ways that the old stories have a greater degree of truth in them than we suspected but the roots are also there in solid science youre not about to go off on one of your interminable incomprehensible rambles are you reid said wearily the general waved him quiet kirkham was unperturbed by the interruption it all comes down to string theory complicated physics i know but bear with me in nineteen ninetyfive edward witten at the princeton institute for advanced study came up with what he called mtheory which implies the existence of higher dimensional shapes called membranes or branes for short kirkham as always was not about to be rushed or deterred branes can be as large as a universe indeed a brane might even be a universe and we could be living in one right now and the point is reid enquired rudely the point is that reality is not as clear cut as we were taught growing up witten described string theory as twentyfirstcentury physics that fell by chance into the twentieth century were at the cutting edge of science here is the otherworld of celtic mythology another brane are the gods the inhabitants of that brane as we are of this one is it possible to leak between the two in the same way that mtheory suggests happens to excess gravity strength bottom line you still believe we can find a way through to their homeland the general asked we know that the tuatha de danann can cross over at will kirkham replied we also know that some human beings can pass back and forth albeit only at certain locations the mechanism is not clear at the moment but with enough time and resources youll get all the resources you require the general said time is a different matter the tuatha de danann may have left us alone since the battle of london but we have still been invaded the country is under enemy control and we have no idea when they will attempt to begin cleansing weve waited long enough already sir hal ventured the others looked up sharply theyd forgotten he was still there shouldnt we be working alongside those who fought off the original invasion at the fall the brothers and sisters of dragons from the intelligence weve gathered we know they can cross over without any harm ive been asking for one of them to question for a long while kirkham said to the group his frustration plain are we sure theyre not just urban legends manning asked i mean five men and women in what their twenties who somehow mysteriously banded together and stopped the invasion from crushing us completely how do you think the invasion was stopped at the fall the general said it wasnt us our forces were paralysed decimated why did the gods decide to sneak off into the woodwork after the battle of london when theyd already demonstrated that they could wipe us out any time they wanted yes but five people manning continued incredulously ive heard the stories the same as you oh they exist all right reid said we had two under surveillance at salisbury but theyve since eluded us the five who fought at the fall were jack churchill an archaeologist ruth gallagher a lawyer ryan veitch a career criminal and laura dusantiago and someone who went by the name of shavi two aimless drifters no more than that as far as we can tell not exactly hero material is it they were empowered in some way by that blue energy we saw down in the lab kirkham nodded in agreement cant explain that at all it seems to have come with the fall after the battle of london reid continued the ones who survived disbanded drifted off the information i have is that a new five is now in the process of being formed the two we were observing in salisbury were the first of the new group he paused choosing his words carefully apparently that blue energy is supposed to choose these champions seems to have a thing about the number five too manning snorted at the implication in reids words what about the original five the general said two of them are believed dead reid replied the two women are missing the fifth is located at some college for mystical loons in glastonbury so why havent you picked him up if you know where he is manning asked hal noted her barely restrained pleasure at reids discomfort reid set his jaw weve sent out several operatives to contact the individual but none has returned the general sat back in his chair smoking thoughtfully this new group therere just two of them so far theres been no sign of any others as yet reid confirmed weve got people stationed at all the liminal zones the standing stones the henges the ancient sacred sites just in case anyone attempts to cross over ive heard nothing what is all this nonsense manning asked five champions somehow i can deal with the notion of an invasion of extraterrestrial biological entities but this its like living in a bloody fairy tale come on reid said impatiently no one knows what were really dealing with here suddenly there are all these new rules we need to get hold of those two you were observing in salisbury immediately the general said yes sir reid shifted uncomfortably in his chair clearly he didnt think it was going to be as easy as the general was implying finally manning said if these brothers and sisters of dragons do know how to cross over perhaps we can actually show the tuatha de danann that weve got some teeth that is my intention ms manning the general said im going to the pm with a new proposal weve had our heads down for far too long this is the time for action he turned to hal mister campbell find hunter he should put a team together immediately ill tell him at once sir hal slipped out quietly anticipation mingling with queasy apprehension this was it then the war was finally about to be launched the oxford night was balmy as the heat of the june day gradually leaked away hal made his way from the ministry of defence offices and staff apartments at magdalen college into the cool dark of the ancient deer park it was a walk he took every night to clear his head he loved magdalen its nearsixhundredyear history the great tower the chapel the cloisters so beautiful in the snow but sometimes the tiny rooms and ancient corridors grew claustrophobic too much gossip too much backstabbing too many rumours whichever way he looked at it though oxford was still better than london all the old colleges now housed the government departments that had fled the capital during the fall they still inhabited the same grandeur they had all enjoyed in whitehall and the palace of westminster but it felt like a fresh start and that was a good thing as he slipped off his shoes to feel the deercropped grass the shock of glennings death finally hit him hard and he took a deep juddering breath throwing his head back to stare at the sky the stars were comforting but after all they had been through so were the citys streetlights and the golden electric lamps that still blazed in many of the windows around the college amazing isnt it startled hal spun around to find samantha standing behind him hands on hips smiling in the way that always made his spine tingle her ashblonde hair was tied back with an elastic band and she was dressed in a wellworn tshirt and a pair of tracksuit trousers the sweat of her run still gleamed on her forehead youre jumpy she said laughing had a bit of a shock earlier hal took another deep breath to calm his thumping heart and i dont suppose you can tell me about it ultra top secret as usual you know how it is hal shifted uncomfortably he wished he could tell her glennings death was one thing he desperately needed to get off his chest it is amazing though isnt it samantha moved closer to hal and he was suddenly aware of the notunpleasant aroma of her sweat mixed with the fragrance of whatever perfume shampoo or other aromatic she used electric lights a few years back youd never have thought what a wonder they would be they still are for most of the country mustnt forget were only blessed with them here because its the new seat of government samantha laughed again what hals cheeks coloured blessed with them indeed you talk so strangely sometimes she was still smiling when she slipped an arm around his waist and gave him a gentle squeeze a different kind of heat ran into hals face dont get me wrong i love it youre a breath of fresh air around here hal hal would have liked to respond with an arm around her waist perhaps a kiss but it wasnt the time it never was and a part of him wondered if it ever would be any idea where hunter is holed up he asked changing the subject samantha rolled her eyes lets draw up a list of the worst dives in oxford and ill guarantee hes in one of them hes banned from all the good places i heard he was thrown out of stanyards last week hal nodded caught in one of the toilet cubicles with a girl by her boyfriend between them they wrecked the place before the landlord managed to toss them out and the government wouldnt be here if not for his strong right arm samantha said sarcastically thats what he tells all those floozies and they all fall for it you dont like him very much do you i loathe him and i cant understand why youre his friend not in a million years what have you ever got in common i ask myself that some days hal glanced up just as a shooting star burned its path across the arc of sky visible above the city lights see that he said its an omen samantha grew serious the fightback starts soon you know i cant answer that hal looked towards the dark unruly city beyond the grand historic colleges id better find hunter drag him out of whatever mess hes got himself into this time ok hal ill see you tomorrow samantha gave him another warm smile before jogging off hal watched her until she disappeared into the shadows a braver man would already have made his move but hal couldnt until he was sure one hundred per cent that she wouldnt say no deep in his head hed always considered himself a romantic a counterbalance to a life lived in the dusty hereandnow to which he had been consigned or rather to which he had consigned himself and hed known pretty early on in their friendship that samantha was the only one who could truly make him happy not love at first sight exactly but near as dammit the first time hal had seen her she had been giving her lunchtime sandwich to a young girl begging on the side of the street when hal mentioned it to her later samantha had denied her act of charity which had only intrigued him more but the one moment the one shining moment that had changed everything for him had been in some dingy bar after work when drunk and argumentative shed clubbed hunter around the head and then minutes later given an a cappella version of california dreamin that had sent shivers down his spine there was no reason why it should have affected him so deeply but it had been an alchemical experience fuelled by magic and mystery in the banal crucible of everyday existence he would never forget how shed made that gold from the base lead of his life it was too valuable ever to risk losing the brothel on st michaels street had become a thriving if frownedupon establishment ever since the new government had moved to oxford and saved the city from ruin from the outside the building looked abandoned but the majority of government employees knew its location and for many of the men in the lower ranks it provided a welcome release from the numerous pressures of trying to lead a country thrown back to the dark ages hal knocked discreetly on the unmarked door which was opened by an elderly lady with an icecreamcone mound of white hair piled on her head and a little too much makeup on her face is hunter here mrs damask he asked yes jeffreys inside mrs damask replied in her lyrical scottish brogue would you like to wait for him you know he doesnt like to be called jeffrey hal said as he entered the baroque entrance hall with its atmosphere of incense and classical music playing quietly in the background and thats why we call him it mrs damask whispered with a conspiratorial wink she led hal up three flights of stairs to a long corridor with doors on either side various human noises of pleasure and pain emerged from behind several of them mrs damask motioned to a row of chairs where hal could wait once she had gone hal listened selfconsciously at hunters door and when he was sure there was no activity within he knocked quietly there was a grunt that hal knew to be a signal of admission hunter was lounging in the middle of a kingsize bed beneath black silk sheets smoking from a large hookah that bubbled on the bedside table there were two blondes with him twins from the look of it probably in their late teens both were sleepy and clearly worn out want a go at my sloppy seconds hunter asked lazily hal always thought he looked like errol flynn in captain blood the heavy gold earring the long black hair tied back with a black ribbon the devilish goatee no government operative would have been allowed such selfexpression in any other time and few even in these dark days but hunter had special dispensation you can get away with murder when youre good at what you do hal thought you really are disgusting he said hunter saw the serious intent in hals face and tapped the girls on the shoulder waving them out of the door not bothering to hide their nakedness they skipped out with a giggle and a backward glance at hunter hunter noted hals disapproval with weary disdain in times like this youve got to celebrate life have some fun but you wouldnt understand that you like wallowing in your misery he swung his legs out of bed and started to pull on his clothes before pausing with a wrinkled nose i need a shower the general wants you to put a team together for a retrieval that swaggering git always wants something when its my night off theyre going after a couple of those brothers and sisters of dragons hunter raised an eyebrow finally i was starting to think they were scared of them or something theyre beginning to feel backed into a corner glenning didnt make it he was a stupid bastard for volunteering hunter paced across the sumptuous rugs stretching his lithe body a large black tattoo of a snake rose up his spine from somewhere below the waistband of his trousers to the nape of his neck slithering as the muscles beneath it rippled how can you be so hardhearted hal protested glenning sacrificed himself for the sake of the country hunter stared at hal in disbelief dont start falling for the propaganda its not good for your health he pulled on a loosefitting red silk shirt that masked his hardness with a dandyish air glenning was a drone who jumped through hoops whenever anyone higher up the pecking order shouted at him that mission was always going to fail you know that someone has to try yeah hunter shrugged why were at war fighting for the existence of civilisation everything weve achieved and what have we achieved exactly theres no talking to you when youre in this mood hal marched to the antique sideboard and poured himself a glass of vintage wine from a crystal decanter it shows our resilience as a race that were still clinging on after all weve endured in recent times the basic rules of science shown up for what they are just one way of looking at the world and not the most important by a long way society turned on its head you say all that as if its a bad thing hunter flopped on to the edge of the bed and pulled on his boots its amazing that weve managed to establish a new government here in oxford after what happened in london weve even got the power back on instituted some semblance of normality a year ago no one would ever have thought that would have been possible you said it yourself were clinging on whats the point in trying to hang on to the old days theyre gone the way we lived the things we believed in theyre all part of the past weve been presented with a whole new set of possibilities we should be reinventing ourselves to live now to create a better world not just repeat all the old mistakes simply because it makes us feel comfortable its not that yes it is were all terrified of change especially the big change death so we try to pretend that theres some permanence in this world that change cant influence its all metaphors and symbols i thought you were the smart one in this friendship you know that nothing has meaning on the surface the surface is just a clue to whats locked underneath i didnt come here for a philosophical discussion hal drained the wine in one go theres no talking to you when youre in this mood hunter mocked but gently weve got the chance for a good thing here but well never see the benefits do you know why human nature forget the gods and the monsters were our own worst enemies its hardwired into us someone will come along to fuck things up for the majority just to get a shot at making more money or gaining more power for themselves wait and see why do you do this hunter hal said hitting back in the only way he knew how what all the women the drink the drugs youre just trying to run away from who you are cant face life as the big scary hunter its childish you know yep hal sighed dont you have any selfawareness nope thats it isnt it hal said morosely i do all the thinking and you do all the doing he sagged on to the edge of the bed hunter laughed and clapped him heartily across the shoulders come on lets get tooled up while hunter went to his flat to get a shower hal wandered the maze of quiet streets in the ancient quarter between cornmarket and longwall streets in the long shadows cast by the divinity school and the bodleian library it was possible to imagine he was back before the fall and that sooner or later he would bump into some students making their way home after a latenight party as he rounded on to catte street and approached the radcliffe camera he was met by a strange sight although it was night four thrushes sat side by side on a wroughtiron fence silent and immobile while a fifth hopped around in a circle on the pavement hal came to a halt curious at the birds antics but he was even more surprised when the bird on the pavement appeared to notice him it hopped up to his foot and stopped before raising its head to stare at him hal looked from the strange visitor to the four birds on the fence and back all of them were staring at him or so it seemed he waited for the bird at his feet to fly off even shook his leg slightly to encourage it but the longer it remained the more his curiosity gave way to an unsettled feeling in the end he walked off himself ten yards away he glanced back the birds were still where hed left them but they had turned to watch his departure hal laughed it off but the unnerving sensation clung to him like autumn fog soon after it was compounded on the first storey of a building on the high street five windows in a row were lit but one had a blind halfpulled down further on four bicycles leaned against a wall while a fifth lay on its side in the gutter coincidence his rational mind insisted yet an ageold instinctive part of him couldnt help feeling slightly uneasy at this pattern manifesting itself in the most mundane things his mind conjured an image of the universe as one living creature breathing slowly like a man at rest an entity that had at that moment chosen to notice him in particular and to communicate some incomprehensible but vital message to him alone shaking his head at the odd turn his thoughts had taken he continued along the main thoroughfare suddenly a man lurched out of a darkened alley his tattered clothes were filthy from a life lived on the streets his skin so black with ingrained dirt that his eyes stared out wide and white his hair and beard a matted mane of mudstained grey and black he reeked of engine oil and urine hal stepped back instantly on his guard the man held out one filthy hand fingers splayed four stood erect the thumb was missing a ragged sore seeping at the joint involuntarily hal ran not stopping until the comforting lights of magdalen burned off his fear he told himself how stupid hed been but nothing would have convinced him to return to the dark maze of ageless streets that night hunter sat at the back of the auditorium alert and serious hal knew it was only a front for his superiors six other men were scattered around the rows waiting silently all of them former sas or sbs their cold inhumanity scared hal they were prepared to do things no normal member of society would consider hunter always insisted hal go easy on them he was allowed to sleep peacefully because men like them existed hal could see the logic of that argument but in truth he didnt think hunter really liked any of them either the general stood at the front relaxed and confident hal knew that the military had been pushing for more direct involvement in daytoday events for a while but they had always been restrained by the intelligence corps and the politicians who feared showing the governments hand too soon but the power base appeared to be shifting in the eternally baffling subtle machinations that thrived in the shadowy corridors of the government headquarters some background the general began the mission on which you are about to embark is to seek out and capture one of the group known as the brothers and sisters of dragons you will recall the first stories of their appearance at the time of the fall we discounted them as rumours and concentrated on a traditional response to the threat facing us his face grew grim a mistake the brothers and sisters of dragons were instrumental in preventing a catastrophic defeat the powers arrayed against us were held back some the worst fled after the battle of london others adopted a watching brief but are still a threat they did us a favour said a man at the front his face marred by severe acne scars our advisors tell us that they are some kind of champions chosen by the forces that are active in the world at present hal could see that the general was uncomfortable dealing with concepts that were alien to him forces gods magic they are empowered by some kind of subtle energy that runs through the planet it gives them certain abilities his voice trailed off maybe it doesnt hunter smiled a wry smile maybe theyre just better than everyone else you dont have to be special forces to be a champion the general stifled a hint of irritation and continued one of the abilities they do have is to cross the barrier that separates us from our enemys homeland if we want to strike at them where it hurts we need that ability our advisors suggest this energy may be intelligent in some way that these champions appear where or when theyre most needed take that as you will sounds like a load of bunkum to me but it doesnt have any impact on the mission at hand all you need to know is that a new group of five is being formed two have so far been identified how dangerous are they the acne man asked the five who fought at the battle of london sound like nutters dangerous is a good word for them grieg particularly so in the case of these two the general replied the first one goes by the name of mallory christian name unknown hes a mercenary most recently he sold himself to the church a sneering murmur ran through the assembled men except hunter and hal who listened intently dont make assumptions or youll pay the price the general warned the church what remains of it is based in salisbury cathedral where theyre training up a new bunch of knights templar forget your history these are fighting men hard well suited to the times we live in well trained in swordplay archery survival techniques and they had a good teacher blaine the blaine grieg asked the general nodded indeed bloody blaine of belfast so dont underestimate mallory if you dont have your wits about you youll be dead before youre within three feet of him is he travelling with the other one hunter asked yes a woman the general checked his notes sophie tallent special abilities she can manipulate that subtle energy in some way has certain supernatural powers hal found himself wondering what chance they had if the military couldnt accept the profound changes that had taken place across the world the supernatural was a fact of life strange creatures bizarre powers hidden rules everyone knew it theyd all seen the signs much of the evidence lay in the cells of the highsecurity wing below brasenose college not far from the lab where glenning had died are they lying low hunters face had a strange expression that hal couldnt quite read they dont realise that were aware of them the general replied let alone searching for them they should be relatively easy to locate our last reconnaissance placed them somewhere in the vicinity of sparkford in somerset it appears theyre searching for something though without much luck so far can we use the chopper hal flinched at hunters request with no new fuel being produced vehicle use was rarely sanctioned but the general acceded without hesitation hunter winked at hal get them back here as quickly as you can get them back in a state we can use the general said firmly and dont come back emptyhanded outside magdalens main college buildings hal waited for hunter in st johns quadrangle in the shadow of the porters lodge hunter had stayed behind after the generals departure to brief his men which hal knew usually meant threatening them with genital removal in the event of failure hunter called it motivational therapy hal wasnt wholly sure it was a joke ive got a funny feeling about the way things are going at the moment hal said when hunter emerged for once hunters response wasnt glib were at a turning point no mistaking he forced a grin lets hope the leadership are up to whats expected of them you dont have much time for anyone do you not really that way you never feel let down he cracked his knuckles uneasily i cant get this damned rem song out of my head the one about the end of the world youd think wouldnt you no another one an older one hunter paused as samantha emerged from the buildings that housed the staff living quarters shed showered after her run and her hair was still damp her face lit up with an open smile when she saw hal but became instantly guarded when her eyes fell on hunter hmm fresh and squeaky clean he said as she approached samanthas eyes flashed i gather youre about to depart on an extremely dangerous possibly lethal mission dont hang around here on my behalf samantha youre the reason ill be back you give my life meaning he winked at hal see you mate put the champagne on ice samantha watched until hunter had disappeared from view and then turned to hal and said he gives sleazy a bad name you know you like him really hal joked and was surprised by samanthas indignation how can you say that her tone was unduly sharp i was just well dont she softened listen have you heard the latest gossip hal allowed himself to be dragged conspiratorially into an alcove the security forces have captured a god what hal said suddenly uneasy although he didnt quite know why i dont believe it its true they used some supersecret weapon apparently anyway hes been brought in for interrogation brought here is that wise samantha looked at him puzzled i know weve got secure cells theyre already holding some powerful things down there samantha said i know but not a god how can they contain a power like that hes not a real god you know what they did to london besides even if we could hold it thats got to attract the attention of all its kind do we really want all that coming down on our heads a flicker of disappointment crossed samanthas face it stung hal harder than he would have expected were at war hal she said gently we have to take risks for the sake of everyone she gave his arm a reassuring squeeze as if he was scared for his own safety dont worry if i hear any more ill let you know she flashed him a smile and headed towards the refectory for a latenight meal hal stood in the silent quadrangle for a long moment turning over what she had said he wished hunter was still around he needed to discuss it with someone it was too big to deal with himself but there was no one else and with a mounting sense of disquiet he headed out into the night after everything that had happened that evening hal felt distinctly out of sorts glennings death had shaken him profoundly and the random numerical manifestations of five minus one still haunted him he tried to pretend that his mind had only noticed the similar numbers because it was already troubled but he couldnt shake an overwhelming feeling that it meant something although he couldnt begin to divine what yet he found no ease in the moonshadows of the deer park the night was too hot and appeared to be growing warmer by the minute his sweatsodden shirt clung to his back but it wasnt the temperature that continued to turn the screw on his psyche with mounting disorientation he looked around at the cityscape visible beyond the ancient rooftops it was like looking at the city through a heat haze a transparent curtain of shimmering sapphire light rippled back and forth and through it oxford appeared transformed the medieval buildings and their modern counterparts merged and flowed into more fantastic structures towers reached up into the night some constructed from gleaming bluewhite stone others seemingly of brass and gold loftyroofed halls and gargoyleriven battlements arching bridges steeples and spires and domes the illusion came and went with every eyeblink fantasy and reality reality and fantasy so that in the end he couldnt tell on which side of the line he stood with it came a tingling in his fingers and toes energy drawn from the ground itself curling up his spine like the snake that slithered across hunters back hals breath was taken away with wonder while his rational mind ran wild in search of understanding yet he was distracted after only a few seconds by a figure emerging from the haze as if it was slowly gaining solidity from a phantom existence it was a giant of a man at least eight feet tall his long black hair and beard and the dark coals of his eyes reminded hal oddly of the disfigured tramp he had seen earlier that evening though his height was daunting it was the mans clothes that instantly set him apart he wore a rough brown shift fastened at the waist by a broad belt his left forearm was bound with a thong from which several maliciouslooking hooks gleamed hal thought it prudent to retreat to the safety of the buildings as quickly as possible but was sickened to discover that his legs wouldnt obey his thoughts yet despite the strangers foreboding appearance hal felt no sense of threat instead it was almost as if he was in a dream watching the scene through someone elses eyes i have searched for you across the worlds for time upon time upon time the giant began and now i find myself summoned to the place where you stand existence weaves a pattern that none of us can see who are you hal asked the taste of iron filings numbed his mouth i am the caretaker i am the lamplighter in the darkest of the dark i ensure that a single flame burns in the midst of chaos i ensure that the home is kept safe and secure something supernatural hals sluggish brain thought one of the gods are you causing all this hal gestured towards the shimmering phantom city that kept overlaying itself on the oxford skyline no but it is serendipitous slowly the caretakers words wormed their way into hals consciousness youre looking for me i come with a warning of greatest import something has noticed you what hals mind fumbled for meaning the caretaker raised one huge hand and pointed up to the sprinkling of stars out there on the edge of existence it has seen you and it is coming hal stared dumbly into the deep black depths of space whats coming the blue haze began to fade and the true outline of oxford started to emerge into sharp relief once more when hal looked back at the caretaker the giant had retreated several paces though hal had not been aware of him walking away it will be here soon now very soon the caretaker continued in a low echoing voice it may even be here already you must be prepared the brothers and sisters of dragons must be united but know this one of the five has already fallen and without the correct number their effectiveness is dimmed he stared towards the few lamps still burning in the windows of magdalen there is little hope soon even the last light may be extinguished and then my job shall be done the caretaker continued to fade drifting across the grass becoming more insubstantial the further from hal he got war the giants words were breaking up there will come an ending why are you telling me this hal called the caretakers response was lost to the night breeze a second later he vanished and the blue haze along with him reality was hard and fast all around but inside hal the dread that had been mounting all night had now crystallised he had been noticed and something was coming chapter two the call of ancient days the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways the point however is to change it karl marx give us the sword the skinhead wore a fixed dead stare but it was the shotgun the thug was pointing casually that held mallorys attention in the distance smoke from the burning village clouded the blue sky its not very fair is it mallory said sword shotgun you should have thought of that when you were choosing your weapon the skinhead let out a gurgling laugh then looked around at his gang as if he had said something clever the gang clustered closer smelling blood physically mallory and the thug couldnt have been more different mallory with his shoulderlength brown hair and calm intelligent eyes the skinhead clearly unintelligent his arms a mass of tattoos the flag of st george a skull and crossbones the names of girls who had long since faded from his memory but mallorys attention was drawn by the one thing he shared with his opponent a uniform mallory still wore his distinctive knight templar garb of a black shirt with the red templar cross against a white square on the breast and right shoulder the skinheads black shirt had a large red v running from shoulders to waist what is that mallory said nodding at the tshirt im seeing it all over and the insignia wasnt just on the clothing of the gang members who were increasingly visible around the countryside it was also painted on walls abandoned cars doors graffiti with an odd air of menace hes killing time one of the other gang members said just kill him instead more laughter ensued but mallorys calm in the face of his impending death was clearly destabilising the group a strange expression briefly obscured the brutality in the skinheads face mallory decided it was almost like awe were followers of the lost one the thug said the others grew sombre nodding in agreement mallory considered a glib response then decided it probably wouldnt be in his best interests whos that then the lost one the leader said again vehemently this time he disappeared in the battle of london his name is veitch ryan veitch mallory recognised the name instantly the traitor one of the five brothers and sisters of dragons who preceded him they hadnt been heard from since the fall but their presence still loomed large over the population mallory heard their names wherever he went the leader ignored the implication in mallorys words denial or acceptance mallory wasnt sure which he was the one who saved us not the other four when he comes back to us hell lead us out of this mess were in hes dead mallory said hes not coming back or so the stories say the stories are wrong no ones seen a body he showed us how to act how to survive you do what you have to and thats what were doing just get his sword and have done with it another gang member prompted mallory gripped the hilt of his weapon more tightly though he had no idea what he could do against a shotgun and fifteen brutes armed with knives razors and clubs you know this isnt just any sword he said mallory turned the blade so that they could see the faint blue glow emanating from the steel itself and the dragons carved into the handle it comes from the otherworld the leader hesitated the others grew uneasy sensing that he had them mallory continued quickly remembering the words of the god who had given it to him its one of the three great swords the first is the sword of nuada airgetlamh you know that one right mallory didnt even know it himself but his confidence convinced the leader to nod the second is lost believed corrupted we wont be seeing that one again but this one this is llyrwyn and well basically mate you dont stand a chance mallory wished he was telling the truth but while the sword endowed him with a degree of prowess it certainly wasnt powerful enough to take out the whole group the gang had grown edgy like most people since the fall they had quickly learned to assimilate the supernatural and the terrible dangers that surrounded it but mallory knew it would only be a matter of time before they tested his bragging he braced himself ready at least to take off the leaders smirking head a small spot of joy before he died a sound like the billowing of a tarpaulin disturbed all of them as the gang looked around for the source of the noise a shadow swept across the green fields and descended on them mallory saw what it was before any of them and he just had time to throw himself to the ground and cover his head before a murder of crows blazed out of the sky to attack the gang blood spattered all around the birds darted in tearing flesh with beak and talon their dark wings smashing against faces and throats the gang scattered some screaming with eyes missing others terrified and cursing the corvids didnt relent until only mallory remained in the centre of the lane as quickly as they had come they flapped away to lose themselves in the fields and trees as mallory scrambled to his feet he looked around for the familiar face and there she was her long brown hair flowing behind her as she strode through the tall grass of the nearest field her eyes blazing her hippie dress swirling with the determined motion of her legs mallory could see her irritation but the fire in her only made her more attractive to him you are such a moron sophie snapped when she reached the stile me i could have lost an eye in that bird attack a thank you would be nice for saving your worthless life she stepped lithely over the stile i told you to approach the village with caution sorry i forgot you were queen of the whole bloody world stupid bugger mallory grabbed her she playresisted before overpowering him with a passionate kiss but you still havent got this role thing down mallory said when they broke im the knight the trained killing machine im the one whos supposed to be protecting you in your dreams her warm smile eased the dull throb of the aches and pains he had developed on their long hard journey from salisbury battles with looters and selfstyled lawenforcement officers potential rapists and horsestealers and all the nightmarish things that crawled out of the dark in the lonely stretches of countryside theyd crossed oddly he found it easier to deal with all the supernatural predators than with seeing his fellow man preparing to commit some inhuman act they werent your average looters she said mallory stared past her to the now furiously burning village i didnt think they were weve seen them all over i thought they were just some sort of movement like the celtic nation trying to fill the void in society but that v on their shirts you know what it stands for veitch sophie stiffened in his arms kept her face pressed into his shoulder ryan veitch its like they worship him some sort of saviour whos going to come back and make everything all right sophie pushed herself away from him uneasy now there are myths building up around all of the five but the wrong ones are building up around veitch he was the traitor sold all the others out jack churchill the leader died because of what veitch did these morons think thats some kind of plan for living then that only shows what a responsibility we have existence the universe god the goddess whatever you want to call it it selects five people to be the champions of life at any one time five people from all the multitude the last five saved us from extinction after the fall and now weve got the job sophie heard the familiar note in his voice you still dont want it its not as if i have a choice but it would have been nice to have been asked salisbury still preyed on mallorys mind even though he had left it behind six months ago his time there at the cathedral had been one of hardship and suffering as the church desperately attempted to cling on in a world that had grown largely immune to its teachings when he had arrived at the cathedral gates a mercenary looking for employment in the newly formed knights templar mallory hadnt believed in anything the church leaders had accepted him eagerly and his training had made him hard but he had still been directionless it was his meeting with sophie and his recognition of his feelings for her that had given meaning to his life sophie was not only his moral compass in a world where the distinction between right and wrong was increasingly blurred but also the sole thing that mattered to him he knew that she loved him but he suspected that she had no idea how much he loved and needed her in return discovering that they were a brother and sister of dragons had only strengthened the bond between them they were united by some great power that coursed through the earth and everything on it a blazing blue energy that had entered both of them mallory didnt care that it meant they were both champions of life to him it was a sign that he and sophie were meant to be and so he had agreed to follow her when she had insisted on embarking on a quest to find the remaining brothers and sisters of dragons and to discover what their destiny really was she spoke of responsibilities and obligations and a higher calling mallory only heard her voice but despite the inner peace he was feeling for the first time in his life mallory knew that all was not right the emptiness in his life that sophie had filled still echoed somewhere in the deepest part of him it was characterised by an image that haunted his nights and was always there on the periphery of his thoughts during the day a flash of fire in the dark he knew in some way that it signified his death but rather than being a premonition it appeared to be some fragmented memory how could that be sophie had helped him come to terms with it at salisbury and for a while he thought he had put it behind him but in recent weeks it had returned in force the ghost that refused to let him forget but would not let him remember either fire in the dark and death what did it mean why wouldnt it leave him alone to enjoy sophies love and his life with her what was the terrible secret that he knew lay just behind that unsettling image in the late afternoon sun cadbury hill cast an enormous shadow across the somerset lowlands majestic in scale the terraces and cuttings of the iron age hillfort hinted at hidden mysteries artificiality layered over the natural so that it was impossible to see where one ended and the other began mallory and sophie stood on the edge of the umbra and surveyed the wooded slopes where birdsong echoed pleasingly wild flowers grew all around wood spurge and spurge laurel the scent of summer promise its bigger than i thought it would be mallory said you can see why its been identified with camelot for more than six hundred years sophie replied it inspired the medieval romances of lancelot and guinevere galahad and the holy grail cant you feel it theres something in the air itself as if its radiating out of the heart of the hill so its the right place it has to be sophie took a deep soothing breath finally happy to be at the destination that had plagued her ever since they had left salisbury at christmas the first hint had come in a dream an imposing hill in a green landscape a crow telling her to take heed it had all the hallmarks of a communication from the invisible world and the image had stayed with her potently for days when she had used her craft to commune with the higher powers for answers the response had been cryptic and teasing as always but as the weeks and months passed the clues had mounted finally leading them here its not just the feeling she continued the mythic symbolism is perfect we know that the arthurian legends are a code they all identify places of power where the walls that divide dimensions are thin where theres a doorway to the otherworld tir na nog the land of always summer you see i was listening when you were telling me about your crazy religious beliefs king arthur is a code for the energy that runs through all things the blue fire mallory chanted with mockweariness the pendragon spirit mallory tried to pretend it was all a joke but hed seen the evidence of the power felt its euphoric effect it was the thing that linked the brothers and sisters of dragons across millennia and though he would never have mentioned it to sophie he was humbled to be a part of it so what exactly are we looking for he asked something important something that ties in to the whole reason why we were chosen her eyes were filled with passion and just the briefest hint of apprehension they spent the next halfhour fighting their way through the wildly overgrown lower reaches of the hill it didnt look as though anyone had been there since the fall the largest butterflies mallory had ever seen in his life flitted in and out of the trees and there was an abundance of wildlife rabbits that were almost tame even a fox slinking like a russet ghost through the vegetations shadows can you see anything yet sophie asked him as he hacked through the undergrowth its hard to concentrate when im having to chop and thrust every six feet mallory paused to rest on his sword just give me a minute to catch my breath once he had rested he tried again just as she had been teaching him during the last six months the perception wasnt easy to reach or to sustain sophie had described it as like looking at a magic eye picture but when he did finally achieve it he was shocked by what he saw lines of shimmering blue appeared on the ground as if power cables were glowing just beneath the surface they ran backwards and forwards in a grid pattern across the whole of the hill and on the flat summit he could just make out a spike rising up to the clouds like a gigantic radio antenna bloody hell he said awed its like a giant battery sophie took his hand and tugged him to the left this way as they carved their way through brambles and long grass with renewed vigour mallory said ok but why this place of all the arthurian locations because this is one of the most special legend says its hollow like the one at glastonbury tor which is unquestionably special at the summer solstice its supposed to turn into glass so that you can see all the secret caves inside aha and it would be what a coincidence that we just happen to be here at the solstice she smiled enigmatically and whats supposed to be in these secret caves according to legend arthur himself and all his knights who are sleeping until england calls on their services again more symbolism she shrugged theres more the legend goes on to say that every seven years on midsummers eve a giant gate opens in the side of the hill allowing entry to that place mallory surveyed the imposing hill thoughtfully looks like were in for a night of surprises for a while the flow of blue energy faded in and out of view but eventually mallory found himself picking out stronger arterial routes leading towards a focal point as he followed the more potent lines of force he was overcome by a strange sensation of distortion leaves and branches moved too quickly shadows lengthened at an alarming rate it felt as if time was accelerating and when he checked the arc of blue sky visible through the foliage above them he was unnerved to see the colour shifting to magenta as clouds hurtled overhead the sun shifted from yellow to red and rushed towards the horizon he gripped sophies arms call me jumpy but i reckon we need to reach our destination by nightfall or something bads going to happen any particular reason a gut feeling increasingly he found that his instincts were rarely wrong as though he was becoming more sensitive to subtle warning signs sophie nodded and picked up her speed as the darkness washed in from the east gloom rose up around the trunks of the trees and the sounds of the hillside became eerily magnified every windborne rustle became a predator at their backs every footstep the thunderous beat of a buried heart fifty yards ahead the energy flows congregated just below the lip of the hills flat summit as night fell they began to run in that same instant a whispering rose up from the trees echoing across the deserted hillside they couldnt make out the words but there was something in the sound that made them feel sluggish and gloomy they slowed to a walk then stopped and looked around for the source what is that mallory asked i can feel it in my head sophie said she swayed mesmerised and suddenly overcome by melancholy mallory grabbed her and forced her to look at him dont listen he propelled her onwards as fast as she would go scrambling over humps tumbling through nettles stinging and winding themselves the unsettling whispering continued unmistakably growing closer its hunting us sophie gasped what is it just concentrate on running mallorys eyes darted around the hillside but it was impossible to see clearly in the gloom they emerged from the trees and bushes on to a grassy slope where they had a clear view of a surging and spitting whirlpool of blue fire ahead that must be the entrance sophie said gasping for breath the whispering was now so loud it felt as if it was filling mallorys head and pressing in on him from all sides with it came a black despair urging him to give up as he struggled to fight it off a shape loomed out of the shadows of the trees mallory grabbed sophie and pushed her behind him as he drew his sword what is it sophie said mallory couldnt answer it looked like a walking corpse a tall thin man with otherworldly almondshaped eyes whose body had been broken on a rack the skeleton showed through at the ribs and the forearms and on the left side of its jaw at first mallory thought it was brandishing a sword in each hand but as it marched towards them mallory realised that the swords had actually been embedded in the things wrists the weapons were now a part of it a luminous purple mist drifted from its mouth and ears and eked out of the corners of its eyes it was the source of the whispering that was making them feel so despairing now would be the time for a good spell mallory said you know it doesnt work like that sophie replied i need time ritual space the warrior bore down on them weaving its rusty bloodstained swords in an intricate attack pattern mallory attacked it vigorously it responded instantly parrying and then thrusting mallory jumped back athletically and avoided the dual attack as the creatures weapons cut rapidly back and forth like a baconslicer they battled for several minutes but the warrior didnt appear to tire and mallory began to wonder if it was actually an animated dead thing and its strength was astonishing the twin blades crashed down on him like piledrivers jolting him to the bone only his knight templar training and whatever innate power lurked in his sword kept him alive as he manoeuvred to avoid another attack his foot caught in a rabbit hole and he went down hard the warrior poised to swing a sword towards mallorys head in that instant mallory saw an opening he managed to swing his sword in a short arc hacking through the warriors left ankle the thing continued to attack as it fell but it had been thrown offbalance even so the flat of its sword still clipped mallorys temple stunning him when he came around sophie was attempting to drag him up the slope from further down the hill he could hear the sound of riders crashing through the undergrowth towards them mallory lurched to his feet his chest burning from the exertion of the fight he tried to push sophie towards the blue fire but her head was bowed and when she looked up her eyes were crackling with sapphire energy its all right she said this place is like a battery i can draw on it mallory was unnerved by what he saw in her face a primal fury about to be unleashed coruscating energy erupted out of her in a flash when his vision cleared there was a massive scorch mark across the slope and the warrior was nowhere to be seen but from the trees the sounds of the riders drew closer magnified as if their steeds were as big as rhinos come on sophie said ive only bought us a few seconds as mallory and sophie neared the whirl of blue fire they heard the riders break from the tree line mallory turned to see three more of the hideous undead warriors this time riding huge beasts that resembled horses but had scaly hides and cloven hooves just as mallory was preparing to make a last stand the ground trembled and there was a sound like an avalanche as turf and soil tore back in a shower of earth and pebbles in the gulf that opened up before them was revealed a majestic stone arch big enough to encompass four men standing on each others shoulders around it the blue fire licked and sparked but the centre of the arch was as black as space mallory had no time to contemplate it for sophie put one hand between his shoulder blades and shoved him into the gateway pain made mallory black out again as his ribs smashed against something hard when he came around he knew instantly that he was somewhere far removed from the slopes of cadbury hill he had expected the air to be dank but it had a sharp fresh tang that was physically invigorating he could smell tarsmoke from a torch more acutely than anything he had ever smelled before he was lying on smooth stone flags icecold against his cheek levering himself up his first impression was that he was sprawled in a temple almost egyptian in its scale and grandeur with stone columns soaring into the shadows overhead and wall murals of breathtaking detail the blues golds and reds glowing in the flickering light of torches mounted at regular intervals all around sophie was at his side just as mesmerised incense drifted in their direction and sophie stirred are you ok she helped mallory to his feet he winced no couple of cracked ribs from the fight ill have to take it easy where are we i dont know feel up to having a look round sophie took one of the torches from the wall and led the way the atmosphere grew more oppressive as they progressed into the heart of the temple they couldnt shake the impression that they were being watched that someone or something was going to come upon them suddenly from behind there was a disturbing hallucinogenic quality to everything the edges of their vision were distorted and fragmented the pounding of their hearts rose up and faded echoing both within and without their path was blocked by an enormous cat easily as big as sophie with staring eyes as round and large as plates mallory and sophie stopped sharply but the cat didnt move it simply stared at them as if it could see right into their heads mallorys hand went to his sword but sophie stopped him wait she whispered that is the creepiest thing ive ever seen mallory said under his breath beyond the cat the floor ended abruptly three paths moved away over the gulf each one barely wider than a human foot its a test sophie whispered whatevers in there theyre not going to let just anyone enter we have to prove were worthy it could be a test mallory agreed or it could be a booby trap to take out anyone who comes near the place you get halfway along one of those paths and the thing crumbles under your feet thats if we can get past mccavity there why dont you walk up to it and see what it does why dont you mallory considered drawing his sword then decided sophie was probably right whatever the thing was and it certainly was not a cat despite its appearance there was no point in antagonising it sophie pushed past mallory and walked tentatively towards the cat when she got within six feet of it its hackles rose and its mouth opened to reveal gleaming teeth the huge eyes still didnt blink sophie came to a sharp halt mallory walked up beside sophie the cat glared at him and made a deep rumbling warning sound in its throat still sure i shouldnt use the sword he asked sophie hushed him he could see she was deep in thought after a moment she said how can we prove to it that were worthy to enter that were not a threat mallory considered her question then quickly drew his sword the cat leaned forward spitting those huge eyes filled with malice before it could leap at him mallory threw the sword behind him the cat instantly calmed and returned to its original watchful position i hope youre right about this mallory said in a way that masked his implicit trust of her he got down on his hands and knees and crawled towards the cat his tension eased a little when he realised that it was not making any threatening sounds or movements it simply stared at him with those eerie eyes when he reached the cat he rolled on to his back and bared his throat there was one brief moment of connection when mallory saw a flickering alien intelligence in the saucereyes and then the cat lunged jaws gaping wide sophie screamed mallory screwed his eyes shut waiting for the pain as his throat was ripped out he felt hot breath on his skin the prick of teeth and then nothing when he opened his eyes the cat was holding his throat in its mouth poised gently it could have torn him to pieces in the blink of an eye it remained that way for a few seconds while mallorys heart thundered then it withdrew and turned its attention to sophie mallory scrambled past it and beckoned for her to follow suit when sophie was standing by him shaking after her experience with the huge beast he held her close for a second and then they turned and walked to the edge of the precipice beyond the abyss fell away into deep shadow far below which one mallory said sophie took a deep breath to calm herself she didnt need mallory to tell her that they would probably only have one chance they all look the same she said but there has to be one true path mallory said thats how this works in all the old stories so how do we know which is the true one sophie closed her eyes while she pondered and after a moment a smile came to her lips what mallory asked close your eyes mallory did as he was told ok now what go calm feel really feel with your senses you know which one is the right path now dont you at first mallory couldnt understand what she meant but gradually the realisation crept over him the lines of blue force that had crisscrossed the hill also ran through this place though at that point they were invisible but mallory could feel them even through the soles of his boots buzzing gently soothing him with their caress he stepped forward following the faint sensation it led directly to the righthand path so weve got to trust that the freaky blue fire is leading us to the right one he said thats the point isnt it were showing trust and humility two qualities that mean were worthy to find what lies ahead im glad one of us has got it all figured out as he prepared to take the first step on the path sophie took his hand and squeezed its the pendragon spirit mallory think of what it represents her words reassured him and tentatively he edged out on to the precarious path it felt like tightrope walking he had to hold his arms out to keep his balance not looking down moving one foot in front of the other only when he was sure he was secure and balanced sophie followed in his footsteps when theyd gone about twenty feet mallory realised that the other two paths had disappeared theirs was the only path leading into the gloom ahead mallory was soon sleeked with sweat his concentration so intense that his head hurt he didnt say a word to sophie for fear of distracting her but every time he heard her foot skid slightly on the stone his heart beat wildly he didnt know how they carried on each step became a mountain to climb each movement a mantra of whispered prayer but finally they reached solid ground and collapsed on to the stone flags hugging each other in relief when they had recovered they found themselves confronted by two stone doors an image of a dragon eating its own tail was carved in the stone lintel over the point where the doors met i think this is it sophie said with barely restrained excitement she stepped forward and cautiously placed the palm of her hand on the centre of the dragon circle with a fizz of blue sparks the doors slid open with a deep rumble to reveal a row of iron railings and within them a gate sophie pushed it gently it swung open with a reverberating creak to allow them entrance to an inner sanctum more incense smouldered in one corner and the torches on the walls burned more dimly imbuing the chamber with a reverential air small stone platforms each one big enough for a man to lie on lined both walls and at the far end a similar platform stood alone raised up to waistheight intricate carvings of serpents lined its base oh sophie said quietly what is it this is where the knights should be sleeping waiting to be awakened she gestured at the low stone plinths and that larger one is where the king should be i thought you said that was a metaphor it is but look its obvious sophie replied confused nothing is obvious as mallory walked towards the stone dais at the end of the chamber the torches in that area burned more brightly to reveal a space beyond if theres no hero waiting to come back when england really needs him what does that mean sophie said oblivious to mallory has something happened to him is there no hope look at this mallory was supporting himself on the raised dais one hand clutching his injured side he was looking into the area beyond where a brazier burned with the cool blue flames of the earth energy in the middle of the flames lay a stone round and grey with no discernible markings is that why we were brought here sophie said disappointed it doesnt make any sense never judge a book by its cover see i have a cliche for every occasion mallory steeled himself although he knew the blue flames didnt burn like ordinary fire it still took a leap of faith to plunge his hand into their depths as he leaned in a column of blue fire surged up to the ceiling high overhead for the briefest instant mallory saw a face in that blazing pillar but it was gone before he could register its features but it left him with one piece of knowledge the object in the fire was called the wish stone mallory retrieved it quickly and the column of fire instantly died away at the same moment the wish stone came to life on his open palm crackling blue light sprang out of it forming an image in the air of two men crouching next to a stone tomb with a woman standing nearby the picture which mallory thought resembled a hologram hung over the stone for a few seconds and then winked out whats that all about mallory said no idea but its got to be important there was a note of doubt in sophies voice i think that just about defines anticlimax night of the living dead outside throat nearly ripped out in here almost fall to my death down the crack of doom the prize a fucking rock lets get out of here sophie said we can sort out what this means later mallory slipped the wish stone into his pocket im going to get my sword back now and if that big mouser is sitting on it im going to use this stone to all right so youre a big man sophie said lets go the day after briefing hunter and his team the general moved along the corridors of brasenose with a renewed vigour ever since the fall it had all been about logistics getting the supply lines in place ensuring that the base was secure developing policies and plans finally he felt as if they were in a position to take the first steps towards a campaign that would drive out the invaders he marched into kirkhams suite of laboratories and eventually found the scientist in a darkened room far away from the main area of activity labouring over a model of a town laid out across a large map table illuminated by a single light overhead so this is where you get away from it all to play with your toys the general said sarcastically kirkham was unruffled its a model i can see that a model of reality the general masked his puzzlement in case it was construed as a mark of weakness and leaned over the table to get a better look it was a facsimile of any small town central shopping area streets of suburban semis rows of terraces a few mansions and grand residences dotted here and there i created it for my next briefing to the joint board the concepts are quite difficult to communicate to he paused to find the right word the uneducated thick soldiers no try it on me kirkham blinked through his thick glasses clearly uneasy about going down that route go on tell me about reality kirkham could see that the general had the bit between his teeth there was no backing down he began hesitantly as i said these are difficult concepts understanding the nature of reality is key to the situation we now find ourselves in i talked earlier about branes and string theory and their possible relationship with parallel universes thats one view there are others youll forgive me if i begin by delving into what seems to be mysticism just get on with it the general continued to be engrossed by the model town reality material reality such as you see around you is regarded as an illusion in the hindu religion kirkham began they have a word for it maya the veil of illusion ironically many of the ancient spiritual philosophies are actually quite close to current scientific thinking he peered at the general do you understand that of course the general said curtly all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream go on kirkham relaxed a little then lets take things a step further a hypothesis what we perceive as reality is in scientific terms a network of quantum waves which have become phaselocked and act as a single entity in the same way that a group of photons become phaselocked in a laser yes random light particles frozen so that they appear to be one object youre saying that everything we see around us is not in its natural state its just become locked in this form and we accept that as the norm but its not exactly kirkham couldnt contain his excitement at the generals receptiveness now imagine if this phaselocked system could be affected as a whole by a human mind concentrating on one small part of it in the same way that all systems are affected by a change of one tiny aspect that could be perceived as magic by those who do not understand the system that lies behind the illusion so youre saying that one mind could therefore alter the whole reality in this hypothesis the general picked up one of the houses from a suburb so where does the town fit in kirkham took the house from him and carefully replaced it all that ive said so far is background this is a model of our phaselocked reality consider that every house is a universe or a dimension some are mundane others ornate in some little happens that we would consider unusual the father comes home from his day at the factory his dinner is on the table in others the family has access to technology the previous father cannot begin to comprehend from his limited life experience we know from our intelligence there are at least two adjoining dimensions this one and the otherworld the general began to see the model in a new light as the ramifications of kirkhams hypothesis began to reveal themselves to him the place the celts called tir na nog exactly kirkham continued the two are apparently very different places but consider this what if there are other dimensions just like our own so alike that you can barely tell the difference he tapped a row of terraced houses the only differentiating factors being a picture here an ornament there you could go from one to another and not realise you were in a different place perhaps thats what happens when you die i think that would be delving too far into the realms of mysticism kirkham wandered around the table looking at the town from different angles but who knows really when you get to this level who knows anything we have our hypotheses but no way to test them the general examined some of the imposing mansions on the edge of town one of which had the creepy appeal of the addams family home then he looked towards the edge of the table and the gloom that lay beyond and shivered kirkham however wasnt finished what if someone decided to knock down his house and rebuild it in a different way or add an extension as we discussed earlier one mind concentrating on a part of the phaselocked system thereby altering the whole of it kirkham nodded encouragingly you know sometimes i get the strangest feeling that the world wasnt meant to be the way it is the general mused its odd unnerving i have this idea that i was living another life and then everything changed do you ever get that kirkham didnt answer the generals initial curiosity had been replaced by uneasiness at the overwhelming enormity of what was being shown to him this wasnt the reason why i came he said abruptly changing the subject have you heard anything about one of the enemy being brought in for interrogation one of the gods the general nodded because if its true i want you involved if you can discover their true nature it would help us a great deal a great deal ive not heard anything kirkham said mister reid isnt always forthcoming until hes sure hes covered his back front and both sides curse of the intelligence profession shits all of them ill make some enquiries kirkham pressed his glasses against the bridge of his nose a nervous reaction the general turned towards the door adding almost as an afterthought if you find anything out report directly to me i want this matter and my request kept strictly confidential understood it wont go any further one last question the general paused on the threshold and looked back at the tiny town you talk about reality being phaselocked is that a random occurrence or was it made that way kirkham stared at the general for a long moment then said simply i cant answer that the general nodded thoughtfully but as he slipped out kirkham glimpsed an unsettled look in the military mans eyes sophie helped mallory out into the cool night air on the slopes of cadbury hill his face drawn from the pain in his ribs he leaned over to brush the hair from her ear and whispered im not going to be much use if those freaks are still out here can you do anything sophies face was ghostly in the moonlight breaking through the clouds i can try she whispered theres a way of making us hidden in plain sight i dont know if those things will be able to sniff us out anyway but she shrugged i just need some time to concentrate the words had barely left her mouth when there was a disturbance in the trees just below the scorched grassy area her earlier spell had made mallory drew his sword illuminating his face with the thin blue light emanating from the blade but instead of one of the warriors on the bizarre horses a man ventured out he was wearing camouflaged combat trousers incongruously and pointlessly matched with a red silk shirt i dont know how you managed to disappear off the face of the earth but you gave us a right old runaround the man said two minutes from picking you up and then poof gone nice trick if you know how who are you sophie said mallory stepped in front of her sword at the ready the names hunter and i am well words dont do me justice he approached them confidently id put that down mate he said to mallory youll have somebodys eye out tell you what mallory said take one more step and ill have two eyes out i dont think so all right boys hunter made a comehither gesture and six men emerged from the trees all around mallory eyed the circling men looters he said though that didnt sound quite right actually we have the stamp of officialdom and the full weight of the government behind us hunter nodded and the men drew their guns theres no need for any nasty stuff im sure weve all got the same interests at heart to clear out all the monsters and freaks and get our world back ive come with an invitation for you to help us you know who we are mallory asked beside him sophie rested her chin on her chest and closed her eyes silently her lips moved i know youre a brother and sister of dragons mallory was taken aback by hunters words it was only very recently that hed learned of his destiny how could this stranger possibly know too chief shes doing something an acnescarred man barked sophie continued to mutter under her breath her eyelids halfopen the whites gleaming in the dark you can stop that right now hunter said firmly mallory could see that hunter knew exactly what sophie was capable of doing before hunter could act the acnescarred man raised his gun and moved in swiftly mallory whirled sword at the ready but the pain from his ribs left him offbalance dont do anything stupid he snapped shut it the soldier shouted a low whispering rolled out from the undergrowth spooked hunters team turned guns cocked scanning back and forth for the source come on we need to get out of here hunter said to mallory quickly tell him to drop his weapon mallory nodded at the acne man who had moved in even closer to sophie deep in her trance she was oblivious to what was going on around her youve no need to be afraid of us hunter said were on the same side he fell silent as one of the riders burst from the bushes in a trail of purple mist gunfire erupted from all sides but neither the rider nor its mount appeared to be harmed come on her trance broken sophie grabbed mallorys arm insistently you called it come on bones shattered with a sickening drywood sound as the reptilian horse smashed into one of the soldiers the others continued to fire at it futilely knowing no other way to deal with it the horsecreature lowered its massive head pulled its jaws wide sending saliva everywhere and then proceeded to rip and tear at the fallen mans stomach blood and flesh rose up in a cloud in the confusion sophie and mallory had managed to skid a little way down the scorched grassy slope before the acne man appeared to one side his gun aimed at sophie stop he shouted sophie glanced back and saw that the soldier was shaking as if gripped by some kind of internal battle the eerie whispering was clearly affecting him deeply his wavering selfcontrol was echoed despite his training in the gradually worsening tremor running through his arms hunter came running up dont shoot you idiot we need them the snapping and snarling rose up in a frenzy as another man fell to the horses crushing jaws the acne man glanced in horror at the beast and its rider who was whirling a doubleheaded axe then turned and saw sophie pulling mallory towards the trees finally succumbing to the allpervading despair his eyes glazed over in surrender and he fired just as hunter slammed into him knocking his aim awry the force of the bullet smashed sophie over the edge of a hollow and she rolled into the trees gone no sound or movement followed mallory had one second to call her name before something crashed into him and he plunged into unconsciousness he awoke with a sense of movement and a deafening whupwhupwhup sound all around cold wind blasted against him mallory began to lever himself upright the pain in his side now electric he could barely breathe and was too dazed to think straight a gun pointed into his face dont move one of the soldiers said gruffly but his white face gave away his fear at what he had just witnessed they were on a helicopter rising slowly the large side door was open revealing a square of cloudy predawn sky hunter crouched framed against it peering down at the receding hillside theres a group of them what the hell are they he asked concerned three other soldiers sat further down the helicopter the acne man was one of them but he kept his head turned away from mallory wheres sophie mallory said weakly his memory still disjointed but when he locked eyes with hunter the reality hit him with force im sorry hunter said with surprising compassion shes dead hunter glared at the acne man who refused to meet his gaze he shot her if the bullet didnt kill her straight away shell have lost too much blood by now for us to save her we couldnt find her and didnt have time to search with those bastards on the loose he looked out into the night avoiding mallorys devastated gaze i am sorry he added quietly no one was supposed to get hurt mallory laid his head down on the floor of the helicopter and closed his eyes bloody hell whats this hunter reached a hand out of the doorway where the gusts buffeted it white flakes streamed past snow in the middle of summer chapter three season of ice we are the masters at the moment and not only at the moment but for a very long time to come lord shawcross the compound lay in the lower levels of brasenose and lincoln colleges which had been linked by new tunnels hacked out within days of the governments arrival in the city in addition to housing kirkhams research facility enemies of the state were incarcerated there troublemakers traitors anyone attempting to block the slow progress of a society getting up off its knees yet this lowlevel prison was only a small part of the compound larger by far was the highsecurity section access to which had always been beyond hals clearance hed heard rumours about who was imprisoned there but since the fall rumours were all anyone had and none of them could be trusted it was a sign that events were coming to a head that he had been issued with a pass inside yet hal was too preoccupied to get excited about the generals decision to ramp up his responsibilities the call had come fifteen minutes earlier in the thin dawn light at the end of a long day and sleepless night of tearing himself apart over his confrontation with the caretaker at first he had considered reporting the manifestation what the caretaker had told him was surely of importance but the more he vacillated the more he pulled away from that route hal comforted himself with the thought that once he had decided what it all meant he would make a full disclosure at the cabinet office yet he knew quite powerfully that the caretakers message was meant for him alone if he could ever decipher its meaning and so he had sat quietly in his room turning it over and over in his head for a loyal public servant like hal his inaction felt like a grand betrayal and the guilt ate away at him constantly the guard at the main door checked hals pass and directed him along a maze of corridors to a section sealed off with a steel gate the guards here were hardfaced clearly capable of shooting him in the blink of an eye and losing no sleep over it in the highsecurity section the doors were thicker and lacked the small shuttered window usually provided for the warders to check on the inmates disturbing sounds emanated from the unseen inhabitants from one cell came a howling like a wild animals cry accompanied by frenzied clawing at the walls and in another something wet and sticky lashed back and forth hal found reid and manning deep in conversation manning had a touch of glamour that belied her home office position but reid was always the perfect spy ready to fade into the background at any moment beyond them workmen were adding even greater electronic security to one of the cells manning and reid stopped talking when they saw hal the general sent this urgently hal handed over a sealed envelope to reid your eyes only reid opened it and gave a brief triumphant smile were on our way manning was distracted by the work taking place in and around the nearby cell hal thought he sensed a touch of uneasiness about her whos in there the words came out before hal could stop them and he waited to be reprimanded for breaking the departments rule of no questions any time but manning was oblivious to protocol she continued to stare at the cell as she gave her distracted answer prisoner zero hal was not enough of a neophyte to probe further tell the general well both be around for the interrogation reid said to hal well do it in fouronefour theres a twoway mirror got it as hal turned to retrace his steps a disturbance broke out just ahead a guard staggered backwards out of an open cell door his sa spraying bullets all around he was wearing an abc isolation suit a red arterial spray gushing from a ragged tear down the front of it suddenly the corridor was filled with the most terrible sounds jungle shrieks haunted moans insectile chittering and a low chilling susurration the prisoners had smelled the blood hal was rooted by the sight for a second too long just as he was about to run back up the corridor a small black shape bounded from the cell on to the chest of the stilltwitching guard at first hal thought it was a spider the size of a small dog then some kind of lizard finally he realised he was looking at an imp that would not have been out of place in a medieval woodcarving it was the glossy black of crude oil and covered in gleaming scales its body had human proportions but its head was oversized like a babys a pointed tail lashed back and forth take that the devil said with a swipe of razorsharp talons for presumption and that for stupidity and this simply because it is my nature the talons became a blur of rending and tearing and then the imp stopped sniffed the air and turned its head in an oddly mechanical way towards hal hals blood ran cold as the devils red eyes fell on him aha the imp said with jubilation it sounded like a throaty old man fresh meat it leaped from the seeping corpse so fast that hal couldnt keep it in his vision bouncing off the walls and ceiling it hit hal full force in the stomach he fell to the floor winded as the imp did a little mocking dance around him before hal could lever himself up the devil jumped to squat on his chest with surprising weight now now it said with a malicious grin no running before we exchange pleasantries it hooked one talon in the corner of hals mouth and pulled his lips into a grimace the finger tasted gritty and vinegary a thin covering on fragile bone the imp continued what a strange and ineffective design but then it paused puzzled and sniffed the air over hals face what is this the imp grew oddly uneasy the stink of righteousness the rank odour of life it pressed its face close to hals so that its burning red eyes filled hals entire vision its spoiledmeat breath nearly making him retch the pendragon spirit hal was too terrified to read anything in the imps manner at that moment but later on reflection he would believe that he had seen a hint of fear a second later the creature was wrenched off his chest four guards in abc suits lifted the imp into the air before clamping around its neck a metal collar with an attached chain the imp let out a highpitched agonised scream thrashing wildly as if the very touch of the collar burned it as the guards dragged the imp back to its cell the cacophony from the other cells grew even louder the cumulative noise now tinged with fury and hatred hal pressed his hands over his ears and staggered to his feet to catch his breath the imps cell door clanged shut followed by several resounding thuds as the creature threw itself at the door the other occupants continued to rage until a strange sound reverberated from the far end of the corridor where manning and reid were being protected by other guards it had the organic tone of a voice but sounded to hal something like a tolling bell immediately whatever creatures lay behind the closed doors fell silent and the quiet that followed was infinitely more disturbing breathless and frightened hal stumbled out of brasenose and into the high street where two men were grunting and sweating as they attempted to fix the wheel of a cart he was instantly hit by a wind sharp with the bite of winter a flurry of snow stung his face puzzled he looked up to see grey clouds now obscuring a sky that had been blue when he had entered the building snow in june even the final few things they had been counting on were fading away fastening his jacket he turned into the icy gale and hurried towards queens college just after am he found samantha buried behind a mound of paperwork in her tiny office in the ministry of intelligence no one kept regular hours any more her repeated complaints about deadlines and a possible sacking fell on deaf ears and eventually hal convinced her to take an early breakfast shivering they made their way to one of the pubs that opened before dawn for the market workers at that time theyd be able to find a quiet corner away from the usual gossiping cliques from the government offices i cant believe this weather samantha sipped a herbal infusion which everyone now drank instead of tea everythings gone mad everything went mad a long time ago hal replied samantha caught his flat delivery and asked him what was wrong hal enjoyed the concern in her eyes cautiously he related his meeting with the caretaker and the mysterious transformation of oxford i will report it he said soon samantha wasnt listening something is coming she repeated hesitantly thats what he said but what i dont get is why did he tell me it was as if he thought i could do something about it maybe you can im a glorified librarian samantha im barely any use in the job i do do im not like hunter stop going on about hunter samantha said sharply the caretaker was talking about the brothers and sisters of dragons as if i had some way of contacting them they need to be brought together he said but one of them has already fallen brothers and sisters of what you know the five who fought at the fall oh right theyve been in all the recent intelligence reports you should know that its your department you dont think they actually let me read the files do you i have to look the other way while i stick them in a drawer youve not heard reid say anything hal drank his herbal brew but wished hed ordered a beer he felt the urge to get completely drunk no but then ive not been listening she paused stared at him curiously do you want me to you could lose your job do you want me to she repeated hal took a deep breath then jumped straight in only if you can find anything out without putting yourself at risk i cant believe im asking you to do this hunter doesnt reckon ive broken a rule in my life samantha smacked his thigh so hard it stung then laughed at his startled expression sorry he said abashed dont make me do it again she finished her drink id better get back ill do what i can just dont expect miracles i never expect those he said morosely then another thought struck him there was something else you know all those cells in the highsecurity wing under brasenose where they keep the prisoners so they say no prisoners no human ones i think theyve captured a whole load of the things that came with the fall and they didnt sound very happy samantha blanched god if they got out one of them did while i was there nearly killed me but thats not the point it spoke to me it said it could smell the pendragon spirit on me does that mean anything to you samantha shook her head blankly i dont know whats going on any more he said the only thing i can think of is king arthurs surname in the legends king arthur she mused before adding hesitantly yesterday mister reid asked me to pull some files they all began with the codename grail her voice trailed off arthur pendragon hal turned the words over thoughtfully then king arthur the grail its got to be a coincidence in this day and age you cant rule anything out hal samantha said halfway back from somerset hunter had to order one of the men to render mallory unconscious the knight was as strong and potentially lethal as the general had intimated during the briefing once hed fought his way past the pain from his broken ribs and realised that his girlfriend had been killed he took out two men in as many seconds one with a chop to the larynx another with a punch that sent his victim the length of the helicopter the blows were delivered with a cool equanimity but hunter could see the familiar ice in mallorys eyes every raw emotion the knight felt had been bound up and battened down to fuel his singleminded response it was a look hunter had seen in many a soldier in difficult circumstances there would be no dealing with mallory now the knight would be like a beartrap get too close and youd lose a limb maybe an eye possibly your life and hed never be satiated he wouldnt deal wouldnt help they might as well just lock him up until it was all over not so smart now is he the acnescarred grieg said hunter could see that he was considering giving mallorys prone form a kick you wont be so smart when i give my report to the general hunter stared out of the window past the blizzard of white towards the glittering lights of oxford in the sea of darkness below i had no choice theres always a choice one of the targets is dead the other is next to useless now youve ruined the mission what use is he anyway hunter turned to him if you had a brain grieg youd be halfway to being dangerous as it is youre just a psycho who shouldnt be let near loaded weapons you were tooled up and ready to kill something the moment you came out of the briefing he just wanted to hit back at something chief porter the one mallory had knocked down the helicopter sat nursing an aching jaw you can understand that after all the losses we took during the fall hunter nodded to mallory he might be the only chance weve got to hit back at the fall we lost every battle we engaged in we didnt even have the weapons to make it a competition that means we have to be especially clever now use whatever resources really work fight back with the new rules not the ones we impose on ourselves the attitude of this idiot here hunter jerked a thumb at grieg is just going to mark us up for extinction the new dinosaurs lumbering around till were just fossils hunter turned back to the window at times like this he was ready to quit hed never felt as if he really fitted in couldnt remember how he had ended up in the job in the first place all his performance reviews noted his attitude problem inability to follow orders and blatant disregard for authority yet somehow he kept rising through the ranks before the fall it had been bad enough with every request for a transfer refused now he couldnt get out if he wanted to the helicopter came down in the deer park hunter climbed out beneath the thundering blades with his men carrying mallory on a stretcher behind a cluster of people were silhouetted against the bright lights of magdalen he motioned for the men to take mallory straight down to a holding cell where the medics could check him over and then sauntered as nonchalantly as he could manage in the direction of the crowd the snow was already starting to settle on the grass running to meet him was reid and two of the shifty faceless men who populated his department he stopped the stretcher and briefly searched mallory before hurrying up to hunter weapon he barked whats this a wordassociation game if so ill say penis a big one did he have a weapon there was a flush of excitement in reids cheeks that made him oblivious to hunters attempt to rile him hunter didnt like the look of it a sword in the chopper there we go again with the word association that freud bloke really had it sorted didnt he im taking it down to my department for tests if you want to mark that in your report theres a stone in there too makes pretty pictures in the air reid had dived into the chopper before hunter had time to say anything else the general came up next accompanied by a small coterie of seriousfaced advisors what does he want he asked suspiciously peering after reid typical spooklooting the general nodded leave the chopper here youve got fortyfive minutes for debriefing and to grab a bite and then were off again trouble well see the general marched away into the snowstorm with his coterie hurrying behind him like a gaggle of geese hunter watched them go strangely unnerved and his instincts never let him down when he turned back to the helicopter hal was standing beside him bloody hell will you stop creeping up on me we need to talk hal said hunter walked quickly forcing hal to skip to keep up it was a game hunter liked to play youre like a bloody ghost natural stealth abilities you should be doing this job instead of pushing paper around an intray or whatever it is you do to waste your time somethings up theres always something up hunter noted the concerned tone in hals voice and relented whats wrong it was the first time he had looked his friend full in the face and he was surprised to see the depth of the worry there all right hunter said if you dont mind watching me shovel food into my face you can talk while i eat hunter and hal sat alone in a corner of a sprawling refectory once used by students hunter listlessly played with a plate of cold lamb and mashed potatoes while he listened to hal relate the pieces of the information he had started to put together afterwards hunter said the mission ive just been on was to cadbury hill old stories say it was the site of camelot all rubbish of course but he took a mouthful of potatoes and grimaced as he swallowed they can never get the bloody lumps out but its a hell of a coincidence he finished whats going on i dont bloody know mate but ill tell you this that caretaker bloke didnt choose you at random hal put his head in his hands and thought for a long moment i dont want this i went straight from university into the mod for a quiet life shuffle a few files eventually carry the odd ministerial briefcase when he raised his head the look hunter had seen earlier had grown even more intense you can sum up my life in two words nothing happened and thats just the way i like it safe secure no risks attached whats gone wrong you know what they say if youre not living youre dying maybe this is just what you need like hell hal thought for another moment and then said what do i do go to the general no chance hunter said vehemently never trust anyone in power havent you learned anything while youve been working here theyll either lock you up in one of their little cells while they investigate you for three or four years or theyll bang you up for being a potential traitor well im not supposed to deal with this myself am i im not you the man whos seen every country in the world and shagged all the women and drunk all the booze he tapped his belly getting close to eating all the pies too listen you can do anything you want youre in charge of your life hal shook his head no look youre not in this alone im here we can figure this out together when i get back from my little jaunt with the general well have a chinwag put two and two together theres an answer somewhere the caretaker said something was coming that wed been noticed im worried something really bad is going to happen me too mate hunter shoved his plate away from him me too sophie felt as if she was at the bottom of a deep dark well in the tiny circle of sky visible high overhead she could just make out the morning sun behind clouds but she couldnt feel her body at all floating in the water she thought she could float there for ever sister of dragons you must hear me the voice was insistent but mellifluous and soothing despite her desire to continue drifting sophie found herself rising up the well until she was looking into a womans face at first the features appeared to run like oil sophie thought that she was in the presence of some famous artist whose name she couldnt quite recall then a wise woman from a camp she had once passed through as her perception cleared the sense of familiarity faded the woman was beautiful and sensitive her dark eyes flashing in a pale face surrounded by long black hair that shone in the light of the moon who are you sophie was surprised by the weakness of her voice your kind once called me ceridwen amongst many other names the woman replied her gaze left sophie to dart around the dark hillside with apprehension sophie wondered briefly if she was dreaming for it appeared to be snowing it was only when she attempted to move that she realised how numb her body had been pain shot through her as if she had been stabbed she looked down to see blood staining the whitening grass do not move sister of dragons your light burns low ceridwen said you have little time left for the fixed lands unless your wound can be staunched sophie let her head flop back her vision swimming mallory she whispered ceridwen was doing something at her side from where the pain emanated on the edge of her vision sophie saw a soothing blue glow and the pain eased a little there ceridwen said that will hold for a while but you need to rest and heal i was shot hush we need to leave this place something terrible is happening the lamentbrood are here only a few of them but if they find us they will corrupt us both yes even i even a golden one ceridwen lifted sophie as if she weighed nothing at all where are you taking me sophie said weakly far away from this place of sorrow the words caught in ceridwens throat though in these bitter times even the far lands are tainted with misery before she could utter another word the soft unnerving whispering of the lamentbrood rolled across the hillside sophie raised her head enough to see the riders on their reptilian mounts emerging from the trees what are they sophie asked agents of the void ceridwen replied the abyss has beckoned sophie began to slip back into the well ceridwen backed away from the approaching riders but there was the sound of others approaching to close off their retreat theres nowhere we can go sophie muttered theyve got us when ceridwen didnt reply sophie knew she was right the last thing she heard before she slipped into darkness was the sound of the horses hooves thundering across the hillside towards them hal walked with hunter along the empty ringing corridors and out to the deer park where the helicopter waited neither of them felt like speaking the snow gleamed crisp and even across the grass in the morning light with only one trail of multiple footprints leading to the waiting chopper the general and his men were already on board hes keen hal said what the bloody hell is up with this weather hunter snapped i hate snow i hate it he turned to hal and his familiar rakish grin had returned keep the home fires burning and dont talk to anybody all right dont do anything dangerous like thinking for yourself do what i say i will nodding his goodbye hunter ran towards the helicopter ducking low beneath the blades that had just started to whirr hal waited until it had disappeared and then turned back to magdalen with a heavy heart inside the ancient buildings it was unusually deserted most of the staff was in the new library which had been converted to an operations room for whatever the general had been planning hal was to report there later for a briefing as he made his way to his room for a rest he heard footsteps approaching for some reason he couldnt quite explain hal felt the urge to step out of view he slipped into one of the darkened offices and waited with the door ajar a few seconds later catherine manning marched forcefully by the echoes of her heels clackclacking off the walls she was talking to herself if i can get close to the pm i think i can turn things around she said although hal could see no sign of a radio or mobile phone manning acted as if she was having a conversation with someone unseen all it takes is a little manning paused suddenly a few feet past the door behind which hal was hiding and then turned to look back hal slipped away from the door before she saw him where she snapped hals blood ran cold he backed further into the room banging against a desk top stifling an instinctive cry and grabbing the edge to stop the desk from grinding across the floor quickly he ducked underneath it he was just in time for the door swung open silently at the touch of mannings fingertips hal could see her legs as she stood there silently for an unbearable few seconds then theres no one here hal only breathed again when he heard her heels disappear up the corridor the troubling questions came thick and fast to whom had she been talking how had she known that he was hiding there why had she mentioned the pm who was ensconced in his war bunker at balliol and rarely seen by anyone outside the cabinet it left him with the feeling that some deep dark plot was being put in motion and overriding it all was the sense that hal could no longer trust anyone strong winds buffeted the helicopter from side to side as they flew over the scottish border counties theyd already been forced to put down for several hours to avoid bad weather and the mood on board was strained snow encrusted the edges of the windows making it difficult to see more than a few feet out though there was nothing at all visible in the nightdark countryside below hunter stared out into the snowstorm lost in thought the general had refused to say what they were going to see but his demeanour suggested it was not good in the days since the fall electric lights had been missing from much of the countryside at night so hunter at first assumed the glimmer he saw on the horizon to be just an illusion caused by the snow but as they moved closer he realised it was fire and closer still the reality became apparent it was an enormous fire thats it he asked the general came to sit next to him i think so whats going on while we were plotting our strikeback the enemy decided to move first hunter gazed at the flickering flames the smoke billowed up into the snowfilled clouds thats a town lanark it doesnt make any sense the gods have left us alone for so long because they know were no threat to them they can pick us off as and when they like so why would they be launching a fullscale assault now nevertheless our intelligence says thats whats happening and as you know hunter in the absence of being able to do anything more effective we have at least established a firstrate intelligence network probably better than the one we had before the fall can we get closer well go as close as is safe the general sat back he was surprisingly at ease and when he next spoke hunter understood why ive spent months arguing for a chance to repel the invader months manning was too cautious reid was always after more intelligence more more more hell never have enough the others always sat on the fence because no one was big enough to take the really tough decisions so the pm was always swayed by those two now the balance of power has to shift we cant sit around and do nothing we need to mount a robust defence and then strike back with devastating force have we got any i know im devastating in my own way but i dont think id be much use against that we have things at our disposal the general looked away his body language suggesting that was not an avenue that should be pursued hunter ignored the signals conventional weapons you know theyve failed in the past you tried to use a tactical nuke during the fall didnt you hunter attempted to keep the loathing out of his voice though hed remonstrated loudly about the idiocy of his superiors down the pub at the time as i remember from the leaked report the bomb became wrapped in trees that appeared to have a life of their own and then somehow turned into a flock of birds some of the backroom boys have finally managed to adapt to the new rules we find ourselves operating under the general replied curtly even reid has made a few helpful suggestions in that area frankly id attack them with a handful of magic beans if i thought it would work hunters attention was fixed on the destruction below the pilot took the helicopter in from one flank to fly parallel to the wall of fire just above the level of the treetops every building in lanark was aflame a field of devastation that stretched as far as the eye could see but that was not what left him pressing tightly against the glass for a better look theyre establishing a beachhead the general said the enemy moved out of the fire relentlessly so thick on the ground that the white of the recent snowfall was almost obscured it reminded hunter of nothing so much as an ant hill he had disturbed as a boy how many of them are there he said with hushed awe some of the figures looked oddly human others were bestial moving from upright to all fours and back again a few resembled medieval siege machines yet they were alive somehow alien life forms clearly wearing their warlike purpose every pounding of their enormous limbs like the beat of a drum and all across the landscape a purple mist drifted swathing the figures as they made their slow purposeful progress across the land as the helicopter swooped nearer hunter made out a group of figures distinct from the others four bulky shapes surrounding a tall thin one the only details he could pick out were random images illuminated by the lick of flame yet there was something about them that made him feel sick to the pit of his stomach he felt instinctively that they were the ultimate threat theyre not like anything weve seen before hunter said what are they the generals eyes gleamed with a sickening light of anticipation are you ready for a fight he asked the helicopter shook briefly in a random gust of wind hunter grabbed on to the straps for support shivering as the temperature dropped another degree the pilot moved the helicopter away from the invading force heading back towards oxford the snow which was coming thicker and faster soon obscured all signs of the threat hunter shivered again this time not from the cold winter was coming in hard chapter four the final word the lamps are going out all over europe we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime edward grey viscount of falloden lime and lavender filled the air the scents cloying and a little sickly as if masking more disturbing odours the overpowering aromas filled sophies senses before she opened her eyes more heady than anything she had ever experienced before when her eyelids did finally flutter open she clamped them shut again immediately so bright was the light it took her a second or two to acclimatise and slowly conscious thought returned with the vivid sensations at first a simple awareness then puzzlement then concern cautiously she opened her eyes again shielding them with her hand as she took in her surroundings she was lying on a table of white marble slowly easing herself upright and swinging her legs off one side she saw white marble everywhere in the large columned room so that it appeared to blaze in the sunlight that streamed through glass skylights far up in the lofty ceiling it reminded sophie of drawings she had seen of the homes of the gods in greek mythology but there was a pleasing organic aspect to the straight lines with vines wrapping themselves around some of the columns and trees growing up through the floor to the ceiling songbirds fluttered back and forth amongst the highest branches nearby was a sparkling spring that ran into a reflecting pool with a soothing bubbling peace lay heavy all around welcome sister of dragons sophie started at the honeyed voice she turned to see ceridwen looking at her with a warm smile that had been absent the first time sophie had seen her face and with that thought came another rush of memory the strange twisted warriors on their reptilian mounts rushing towards her not dead then she said not quite able to believe it herself not dead ceridwen replied faintly amused with her was a man in scarlet robes the colour was shocking in the bright white of the room sophie experienced the same unnerving shift of perception she had felt when she had first seen ceridwen but after a second the mans face settled into a form she could comprehend he was hollowcheeked his nose aquiline his eyes a piercing grey set off by the red scarf tied around his head to hold back his hair his tall thin frame was a stark contrast to ceridwens voluptuousness this is dian cecht ceridwen said he has admitted you to the court of the final word the name felt like a cold breath on the back of sophies neck not in my world she said to herself knowing it to be true the moment the words left her lips dian cecht is the name by which he was known amongst the tribes of the fixed lands ceridwen continued he is a wise man a healer a maker of great things sophies hand instinctively went to her side yes sister of dragons i repaired you dian cecht said there was something in his tone that made sophie feel queasy but she attempted to show gratitude i could have died the shock brought another rush of realisation youre two of the gods that came with the fall then why are you helping me you are a sister of dragons ceridwen said with a note of puzzlement as if that should be explanation enough when she saw from sophies face that it wasnt she added existence is at a cusp the old ways are ending our ways dian cecht flinched at this but said nothing your ways are in the ascendant fragile creatures are poised to rise and advance to become something greater and the brothers and sisters of dragons will have a part to play in that you are important in so many ways ceridwen added warmly it is believed by the filid of my people that if fragile creatures do not reach their potential then all of existence may come to an end not all of our kind believe that dian cecht added coldly ceridwen came over and took sophies hand her fingers were cool and delicate up close it appeared that her skin exuded a thin golden light you are important sister of dragons to everything ceridwen led sophie to another room where there was bread and fruit on crystal platters and a decanter of water eat and drink freely and without obligation you must build your strength for we have a long journey ahead of us ceridwen moved into an adjoining room where she fell into deep discussion with dian cecht sophie was so hungry that she didnt listen to the conversation at first all her attention focused on the food but eventually it intruded on her thoughts is it true ceridwen was saying it is the devourer of all things is here the prophecies are coming to pass in these days dian cecht replied is that the end of this song the seasons have passed for existence and all things under it here in the court of the final word the very heart of existence has been probed dian cecht said secrets and mysteries have been laid bare know this nothing is ever truly destroyed and nothing new is created there is only change that is the one rule above all rules there was silence for a moment and then ceridwen said quietly and what of death then dian cechts reply was barely audible there is no death you say that even now the golden ones have always been strangers to it but in recent times ceridwen fell silent is there coming an end is there nothing we can do or will the devourer of all things abide another long silence then i have already taken steps and then dian cecht and ceridwen must have left the annexe by another door for after that there was only quiet sophie fell into a deep sleep and dreamed of dian cecht though at times it appeared to be more than a dream as if she had halfwoken and seen or spoken with him before drifting into sleep again in his red red robes she saw him striding across worlds taking a scalpel to the heart of the sun nothing could contain him he scared sophie deeply for she felt he would do anything to achieve his ends and that he knew more much more than everyone else secrets and mysteries mysteries and secrets and then his face filled her entire vision and he whispered the next time you see me you shall not see me it was still light when sophie woke she ate and drank some more maintaining the surface calm that had served her so well throughout the many devastating upheavals since the fall but inside she fought desperately for equilibrium in the face of gods and legends and the suggestion that she was something greater than the scared little girl she felt like in her worst moments once sophie had recovered enough to walk ceridwen led her through the court of the final word with a troubling degree of urgency dian cecht shadowing them for some unspoken reason he steered them away from certain corridors that led deep into the heart of the gleaming complex and eventually they came to a massive entrance hall constructed from more white marble here there were windows five storeys high all of them glazed with glass stained in various shades of red so that the hall appeared to be running with blood ceridwen turned to dian cecht and said are you sure you will not accompany us he shook his head they will not come near the court of the final word of all the great courts this one is immune to any attack ceridwen nodded all know what lies within a cold smile crept across dian cechts lips and once again sophie was afraid the court of the final word stands alongside fragile creatures he said to her but his words were hesitant go in peace and go with speed the far lands are no longer safe for any of us where are we going sophie asked ceridwen to one of the last bastions of the last hope for all existence sister of dragons ceridwen replied a place where we can make a final stand if needs be or to plot with our allies a way to save everything there were so many questions sophie wanted to ask but she could sense that it was not the time instead she focused on being patient until she could successfully find a way back to her own world and mallory as they approached the gigantic doors they swung open soundlessly to reveal a vista over a glorious countryside of rolling green forests and streams a landscape of romance and mystery that made sophies spine tingle it appeared to be late september still warm the leaves turning gold and red and brown in the hollows mist was rolling tethered just outside were two chestnut mares with bridles of onyx and ivory ceridwen motioned to sophie to mount one and then climbed on to the other mare easily go well daughter of the green dian cecht said to ceridwen the warmth in his voice made sophie reappraise him he was too complex to judge too unpredictable ceridwen smiled sadly and then spurred her mount down the path that led from the court across the countryside sophie followed glad to leave the court of the final word behind the path wound like a golden ribbon over the green but after a short distance ceridwen eased her horse off into the long grass we shall avoid the main byways she said and make our way through the quiet secret places the silent forests the mistfilled valleys the whispering heart of the land she flashed a comforting glance at sophie those places belong to me the wind traced liquid patterns in the grass as the two horses eased down the slope towards a stream that sophie could see glinting in the light at that moment the sun came out from behind a cloud transforming the entire landscape into a transcendent hazy temple the hairs on sophies arms prickled as the quality of light and the subtleties of scent and temperature worked their spell on her ive dreamed of this place sophie said to herself surprised at the force of the realisation when i was a girl this was always where i wanted to be the far lands stay in all our hearts ceridwen said it is the place from which we all spring and to which we all return eternally sophie understood in that moment how she had been shaped as a woman by the thoughts that had come to her during her childhood the yearning for a place where nature truly lived where mystery was a part of daily life and where there was a profound sense of meaning underpinning everything without truly knowing she had been on a quest from her earliest days and it was this land that had called to her the swell of emotion was so shocking that she couldnt prevent a fugitive tear this place is your home sophie asked it is our home now the golden ones are a race ruled by infinite sadness our true homelands are lost to us we may never return but the far lands and the fixed lands make adequate replacements so much has changed since the fall sophie mused images of the dark days following the gods return rushed through her mind the burning cities the failure of technology the riots the economic collapse the desperation of people unable to accept the new rules reality had thrust upon them in the end only a few had the ability to adapt and survive those defined by a particular worldview perhaps sophie wondered if the ones who were truly at peace since the fall were those who had been on the same inner quest as her in the newly reformed world she had an abiding sense of coming home despite all the upheaval and the suffering you talked about some kind of threat she said eventually there are threats all around us ceridwen replied enigmatically threats from within threats from without for my people the greatest threat is ourselves we are at war the battles rage even now across the far lands and no golden one is safe never would we have thought to see this day the devastation in her voice was heartbreaking why are you fighting each other ceridwen raised her sad face high so that the wind made her hair billow behind her because of you sister of dragons you and all your kind what do we have to do with it sophie asked baffled fragile creatures are at the point of rising and advancing of becoming like the golden ones gods some of my people think that is the way of existence we have always had a close relationship with your kind we would shepherd you to the next stage others the word caught in her throat there are those who think you should never be allowed to attain your potential that you should be eradicated as a race so that the golden ones can never be supplanted so the fate of the human race depends on which side wins ceridwens silence was all the answer sophie needed a chill crept over her for she sensed from ceridwens conversation with dian cecht that things were not going well for those who had sided with humanity what about the threat from without it is also the way of existence that our races are tested to the extreme crisis heaped upon crisis and the threat from without is the greatest crisis of all ceridwens horse carefully picked its way down a tricky bit of the slope where rocks and stones protruded from the grass at the bottom of the incline the stream trickled soothingly something has crawled up from the very edge of existence it is the opposite of everything that lives and it has noticed you fragile creatures it sees your potential and it does not want you to shake off your shackles and become something greater for to do so would make you a threat to its very reason for being a dark shadow fell over them both but when sophie looked up the sun still shone brightly what is it she asked uneasily it is an idea a notion of negativity where we see a threat some would see nothing at all for it is only defined by what it is not darkness and despair enfold it does it have a name many names but none capture its essence for how can you describe something that is not legends call it the void even now it exerts its subtle influence on the fixed lands attempting to eradicate all fragile creatures like an infestation it is greater than anything you can imagine yet smaller more powerful yet in the true and blinding light of the blue fire completely powerless and it was controlling those warriors who attacked us at cadbury hill the voids very nature is to corrupt to strip life and hope from a being and to control it the act of giving up personal freedom is to surrender to antilife even the gods are not immune sophie was lulled into a deep introspection by the motion of riding she knew how powerful the gods were had heard tales of them destroying entire army units with a wave of a hand if the void could take control of them what chance did fragile creatures stand but if its so vague how are we supposed to fight it sophie asked only the brothers and sisters of dragons may repel it the quincunx the five who are one but therein lies the problem what do you mean the answer to that question lies ahead of us and you will discover the truth for yourself but for now enough talk of dark things let us celebrate the life and the green that surround us they moved into a thickly wooded area the trees pressing hard along the banks of the brook their branches crossing overhead to form a cathedral roof of leaf cover beneath which sophie could feel the sanctity with every echoing splash of her horses hooves once the reverberations died away there remained an abiding silence too sacred to shatter and so they rode quietly with ceridwen leading the way and after a while sophie began to wonder if she had indeed come to heaven the journey along the winding course of the stream continued for more than an hour after the initial stretch where the trees bustled tightly against the banks the wood thinned enough to allow sophie a brief glimpse of a green world where fantastic fungi swarmed in ochre patterns over fallen trees and tiny gleaming purple flowers sprang up in a carpet of colour that shimmered in the filtering light but after a while the mist that had occasionally drifted across their path grew more constant until a heavy greyness lay over everything sapping echoes and distorting birdcalls the trees presented themselves like dark spectral figures before they were swallowed up again in the passing sophie shivered in the damp air and wished she had brought some warmer clothes with her how much further she asked she instinctively lowered her voice to a whisper that was lost in the mist a while ceridwen replied we will follow the course of the stream through the winding wood to the great plain and there beyond it we shall find the court of souls ease is that like the place weve just visited each of the twenty great courts has an atmosphere that is peculiarly its own but even so nowhere else is like the court of the final word ceridwens hesitant voice made sophie think this was perhaps a good thing the court of souls ease has been through a great many changes now though its destiny has been made plain the low mournful baying of a hound rose up somewhere away in the mist the sound made sophie shiver but she couldnt tell if it was near or far should we be worried about that sophie asked as soon as the words had left her lips another howl arose and then another until soon there were several dogs baying they are the hounds of avalon ceridwen replied also known as the hounds of annwn sometimes they join with the wild hunt pursuing lost fragile creatures through the night at other times they roam between the worlds questing for who knows what some say they hunt the answer to a question that could shatter existence but they are most active at times of greatest threat to your world the fixed lands our stories say that at the end of all existence they will be all that remains baying for what has been lost their howls will join together into one shattering note of despair so when the hounds of avalon come thats it game over ceridwens story made sophie feel sad and troubled but eventually the howling of the dogs faded away and sophie gradually forgot them twilight began to draw in though in the mist the only way to tell was by a subtle shifting of the quality of the grey by this time sophie was chilled to the bone and felt a deep urge for a warming campfire should we make camp for the night she asked ceridwen who had been distracted for a while shook her head there are dangerous things loose in these parts better to be on horseback ready to flee than trapped on the ground and forced to fight a battle we would certainly lose sophie did not like the feeling of powerlessness that had descended on her since she had awoken in the court of the final word the realisation that she had been transported somewhere else while she hovered between life and death had been destabilising and everything that had happened since only underlined that feeling she was operating in an alien world where all the rules were hidden from her surrounded by beings that had the power to eradicate her in the blink of an eye yet in her own world she had never felt powerless not before the fall and certainly not since when her use of the craft had become supercharged in whatever new state now existed silently she urged herself to take control the truth was her use of the craft had grown stronger by the day where once it had taken hours of ritualistic preparation she could now control and direct the subtle energies of the blue fire with a visualisation of sigils and words of power simple keys that operated in the secret language of the unconscious she wanted to know what was out there that was making ceridwen so uneasy sure that the simple act of knowing would give her a feeling of control over her environment but when she muttered the word that would trigger a shift in her perception she was surprised by the result there was the familiar sensation of her consciousness creeping out of a door at the back of her head the feeling of taking a step aside from her corporeal form and becoming like the mist that swathed them but as she drifted out from the horses amongst the ghostly trees it felt as though a drill was being driven into her skull she knew the sensation a warning but this was more heightened than anything she had felt before as she rushed back into her body she jolted with such a sharp intake of breath that ceridwen looked around what is wrong the god asked with concern we have to get out of here sophie replied breathlessly cant you feel it i feel something ceridwen looked around hesitantly then whispered they are masking themselves from me they know we are here as if in answer to ceridwens words all the alarm bells in sophies mind rang at once the mist along the brook began to thin out enough to allow her a view deep into the woods and then it retreated further still it was like a thing alive swirling around the boles rising up and over shrubs to pause briefly on the other side as if waiting but then just when it appeared it was going for good the fog stopped for a moment wavering as if breathing before beginning to creep back towards sophie and ceridwen this time though the mist was not empty here and there where it thinned and twisted around obstacles in its path sophie could glimpse small dark figures at first they kept low to the ground using the mist as a cloak but as they neared they stood erect sophie initially thought they were children then wondered if they were just tricks of her imagination for she would focus on one and it would seem to fade as the mist shifted something whistled past sophies cheek she looked around to see a crude arrow embedded in a nearby tree that must have been a signal for suddenly hundreds of little figures were swarming like insects towards the brook they were still partially obscured by the mist but sophie could see enough of them to realise they were ugly deformed little men nearnaked apart from ragged loin cloths their skin the dirty grey colour of things that lived much of their lives underground their hair and beards were long filthy and matted and they clutched primitive weapons stone axes lumps of wood with chips of flint embedded in them tiny bows the attackers were filled with a primal savagery that made sophie think of lost tribes devolving through years of interbreeding a smell of peat and urine rolled off them ride ceridwen shouted as the little men washed out of the woods towards them sophie spurred her horse raising a cloud of spray and a clatter of hooves on the pebbled river bed but it would be impossible to gain any real speed along the tiny meandering watercourse and the attackers were sweeping down upon them like a deluge ahead ceridwens mount moved with power and grace sophie pressed herself down along her horses neck urging it on ever faster the movement on either side seen through her peripheral vision filled her with a dread that harked back to the most ancient parts of her subconscious the men moved too quickly their smell too revolting and bestial arrows whizzed through the air all around but sophie could see that was not the enemys main thrust of attack sheer force of numbers was the way they would undoubtedly bring sophie and ceridwen down that thought made sophie consider what would happen immediately after when the razorsharp flint knives started dipping and diving she thought of skins and meat and the instinctive fear drove her to urge her mount on with even greater force an arrow slammed into her saddlebag but didnt break through to the horses flesh another missed sophies face by a hairs breadth by that stage the little men were almost at the edge of the bank and sophie had a clear view of their feral nature and then she was aware of movement as some of the nearest leaped several missed and fell under the thundering hooves of her horse but one timed it just right it hit her sinking long broken nails into her clothes the stink of it sour apples and raw meat filled sophies nose as it started to haul its way up her body so that it could attack her with the knife it was clutching between its broken teeth sophie tried to elbow it off while clinging on to the reins with one hand but it had the agility of a monkey those jagged nails clamped on to her thigh tearing through the material of her dress raising bubbles of blood from her pale flesh still weak from the gunshot wound sophie cried out as her flesh tore the little man dug deep to lever itself up further sophie shook herself furiously but the man would not be dislodged another hand snaked up to grab the saddle from the licks of flame that rose in its eyes sophie knew it now had enough of a grip to go for its knife yet strangely there was no panic an abiding calmness slowly descended on her and when she closed her eyes briefly the sensation was accompanied by a blue colour increasingly when she used her craft this was how it was as if some power was visiting her from without not arising from within through closed eyelids she experienced a sapphire flash every nerve in her body felt electrified and there was a smell of burned iron in her nostrils and when she looked around the little men had halted their advance a dark smudge of charred material ran down the saddle and across the material of her dress the attacker gone destroyed or fallen by the wayside with a feeling of exultation she leaned along the horses neck once more the wind whipping at her hair as her steed galloped onwards ahead ceridwen glanced back at her surprise turning to respect in her dark eyes the little men only fell back for a moment before the arrows started flying again but sophies defence had provided enough of a breathing space for the horses to gain some yards on the attackers the banks of the stream grew higher as they progressed until eventually the brook was running along the bottom of a gully at the top of the banks the vegetation was thick and overgrowing the edge so that it almost closed over the top it became as dark as twilight as they rode the obscured view meant that if the little men made it up to the top of the gully they would have trouble timing their drop on to sophie and ceridwen the sides became even higher the bottom broader and rockier as the stream grew in size but ceridwen never once slowed their pace finally they emerged from the gully and passed through a final stand of trees into open countryside where the mist had almost dissipated they were on the edge of green gently rolling downs running away from them to flat plains beyond here the meandering stream became a great river winding its way into the hazy distance from the cracking of wood and the cries of birds on the wing it was clear that the little men had not given up the chase ceridwen looked back to sophie and yelled spur your mount put the wind behind you they rode as if they were part of a storm adrift on a sea of green the long grass parted before them and the mist burned away in the fading sunlight with the thunder of hooves in her ears sophie allowed herself one look back and was shocked by what she saw swarming from the dark tree line were vast numbers of the little men an army of them stretching out on either side as far as the eye could see they didnt slow once even though they could see that they would never catch up and that their tiny lethal arrows were falling further and further behind their quarry to sophie they looked like an infestation insects disturbed from a vast nest beneath the ground surging up in ordered chaos to attack only after three miles or more did ceridwen slow down so that sophie could ride beside her what were they sophie asked breathlessly my people ceridwens voice was wrapped in darkness she did not look back but theyre nothing like you sophie said puzzled they are diminished they have chosen the downward path as they did once before i dont understand how can your people have turned into those things these are not the fixed lands here in the far lands everything is fluid the closer one gets to the core of existence the more mutable things are i told you that my people are riven those who stand against the rising and advancing of fragile creatures have their true nature revealed they become diminished sophie thought of all the tales she had heard of the little people when she was younger the exhortation to call them fair folk for fear they would torment any humans who did not treat them with respect the courts who have sided with them are attacking across the breadth of the far lands ceridwen continued the golden ones have never stood against each other before we were one people of one mind events have shown many of us that we do not deserve to stand above we are all alike fragile creatures and gods everything we believed in now lies shattered and there is a sense that an ending fast approaches sophie looked back anxiously will they keep coming they will always keep coming they will not rest until all the golden ones who have sided with fragile creatures are wiped from existence that is how deep the fault lines run how can you condone the destruction of your own people and stay close to the essence of what is ceridwen shook her head consumed by disbelief when she turned back to sophie her face had hardened we cannot stop she said they will attack relentlessly hiding beneath the dark of the moon or under the cover of clouds to come in the night and slit our throats while we sleep we must ride without rest are you ready for the challenge sister of dragons though she was already exhausted and hollow with hunger sophie nodded so much was at stake she would not be the one who failed and so they rode across the downs and into the night and in the morning they swept across the plains in a light rain their clothes plastered against their bodies through wooded valleys and by rocky foothills they continued without rest until everything became like a dream to sophie and she was convinced she was a girl once more in bed wishing herself to a land where anything was possible on the third day a fortress city of white marble presented itself to them gleaming in the sunrise it rose up the foothills so vast it seemed a hill itself the upper reaches lost in the low clouds on the edge of the mountains behind sophies breath caught at the sight of the aweinspiring assemblage of turrets and domes obelisks palaces keeps and dwellings all surrounded by a single monolithic wall along the ramparts golden flags fluttered in a light breeze majesty and wonder lay across the entire city here it is then ceridwen said the court of souls ease great gates of gold and glass soaring up for six storeys above sophies head swung open soundlessly as the two travellers approached once ceridwen and sophie were within the shelter of the walls the gates closed with a musical chiming all around tall thin impossibly beautiful people went about their business their skin touched by gold as ceridwen led the way up a winding sunlit street the passersby turned to smile reserving much of their pleasant welcome for sophie everywhere there was the peace of a lazy summer afternoon ceridwen dismounted in a cobbled square beside a fountain of gold glass and white marble the shimmering water gushing twenty feet or more into the air beyond lay an opulent palace the frontage ornately carved with beatific statues all dominated by a stylistic sun motif high above the entrance as the gates had done before the door swung open as ceridwen and sophie approached and several guards rushed out they wore armour that continued the whiteandgold theme with the same solar motif prominent on the breastplate though their helmets threw most of their faces into shadow their eyes glowed golden your brother welcomes you the captain of the guards said kneeling and bowing his head he requests your presence in the great hall to inform you of the current state of the war and to hear news of the court of the final word will you accompany us of course ceridwen replied it is a relief to be in a place of safety once more she breathed the air fragrant with the scent of clematis and said softly home sophie followed in awed silence until they arrived at an airy hall where sunlight streamed through glass skylights in the roof high overhead a group of people had gathered in the centre near a large table on which lay what at first looked like a map but as sophie approached was more like a hologram threedimensional moving alive the group talked and planned in quiet thoughtful voices overseen by a man who was clearly their leader his armour was white overlaid with the faintest gold filigree so that he glowed in the shaft of light in which he stood at first he had his back to sophie but when he turned there was only a brief moment of transition before her breath was taken away by his handsome features he looked to be in his early twenties with dark eyes and long dark hair framing a face that was both strong and sensitive greetings he said to ceridwen with a warm smile before his eyes fell on sophie and what is this another sister of dragons my court is truly blessed yes brother this one is known as sophie ceridwen turned to sophie and added in the days of the tribes the fragile creatures knew my brother as lugh at the second battle of magh tuireadh he slew balor the oneeyed god of death and saved the fixed lands from the rule of the dark and monstrous fomorii hello sophie said before mentally kicking herself for sounding so pathetic i stand alongside fragile creatures in the coming struggle lugh said it was not always so but i have reclaimed the wisdom that departed me he smiled at ceridwen again with no small help from my sister sophies mind was racing standing amongst the gods it felt as if she was at the heart of a massive electromagnetic field her ears buzzed so much that it was difficult to concentrate her skin tingled and her mouth felt as though it was filled with iron filings but as she fought to stay on top of what was happening around her one thing came through loud and clear did you say another sister of dragons the suite of rooms was grand by any definition and if sophie had not known better she would have thought it belonged to lugh it was high up in the palace with a balcony providing a breathtaking vista across the great wall to the sweeping plains beyond and further still to snowtopped mountains lying dreamily beneath a blue sky one room led on to another and another and another all with delicate tapestries lining the walls and furs scattered across the stone floors the furniture was designed for maximum comfort the sumptuous cushions and hanging drapes giving it the feel of some arabian nights tent sophie found the woman on the balcony her eyes closed as she let the sun play on her face in her late twenties she wore a long gown of a rich dark green but her hair was tied back with an elastic band an odd mundane detail amidst the otherworldly ambience she glanced over when sophie stepped out into the warm air and her attractive features carried the mark of a strong will but also a deep sadness that looked as though it cut to the heart of her is that how i used to look she mused softly to herself so strong and full of power the woman came over and took sophies hand warmly you dont have to tell me youre a sister of dragons are you here to have a go at me for letting the side down i just turned up here by accident there arent any accidents the woman said rule number one of the new age id better introduce myself then caitlin shepherd i used to be one of you sophie tallent sophie went to shake caitlins hand then felt an overwhelming urge to hug her two kindred spirits in a frightening land after a moment sophie pulled back and said you used to be a sister of dragons caitlin stepped away and leaned over the marble rail to survey the swarming citadel below one of the great defenders of humanity our last best hope and i threw it all away to try to save my husband and son for nothing they died the blue fire deserted me and i think i probably doomed the human race with that same decision i dont understand im only really just getting my head around it myself caitlin said but the abridged version is this the universe or whatever lies behind it existence as the gods call it has a lot of hidden rules and one of them is this there need to be five brothers and sisters of dragons at any one time numbers seem vital to the whole underlying plan on the one hand you could see it as a spell on the other an equation all the principal elements have to be there to make it work she gave a wan smile ive had a lot of time to think about this so without five we cant act as prophecy or legend or myth intended we either dont have the same power or maybe we dont have the weight the gravity to oppose whats coming so when it all goes pearshaped youll know who to blame her profound sadness was so affecting that sophie knew she would never be able to blame caitlin for anything anyone who felt so acutely could not have wilfully brought about the disaster she professed was about to happen sophie insisted on hearing everything and so they moved to the nearest chamber where the high breezes from over the citadel gently swept in through the open balcony doors cooling them in the heat of the day caitlin recounted how she had been working as a doctor in the south of england when a mysterious plague swept across britain sophie had seen signs of it but nothing on the scale caitlin had experienced the disease had taken caitlins husband and son and caitlins mind had shattered under the extreme stress of the situation gradually though she had come to some kind of sense and with a small group of friends had travelled to tir na nog in search of a cure for not only was the plague mystical but it had its origin in the celtic otherworld she had fought her way through hardship after hardship to a living structure called the house of pain on the edge of the far lands where she had discovered the reason for the plague it had been created as a weapon of the void but to be sure of success the void had to destroy the defenders of humanity the brothers and sisters of dragons by breaking their mystical number one would do just one and caitlin was it the house of pain had offered caitlin a choice to remain there as a queen in effect giving up her right to be a sister of dragons and in return her husband and son would live but it had been a trick and after giving up the pendragon spirit that made her a sister of dragons she had realised that she couldnt have her family either so i blew it in the worst way possible caitlin concluded ive doomed everybody the more sophie listened the more she felt a bond growing with caitlin they were true sisters anyone would have done the same in your situation anyone sophie insisted caitlin shook her head staring out of the window at the blue sky listen to me sophie said were supposed to be defenders of humanity to turn your back on your love for your husband and child would have been to give up on that very humanity you couldnt win whatever you did caitlin thought about this for a moment youre very wise she said a little brighter i wish youd been there with me lugh mentioned that there were other fragile creatures here after he told me about you sophie said changing the subject that detail had initially been lost in the excitement of meeting another sister of dragons two friends who followed me from our world to this one they think theyre my protectors caitlin smiled i reckon its probably the other way around caitlin described how she had made her way from the house of pain to the court of souls ease in the company of the two young men thackeray and harvey sophie sensed that there was a bond between caitlin and one of them but she didnt pursue it do you want to meet them caitlin asked theyre probably foraging for food and beer that would be fantastic and to be honest so would some food and beer sophie suddenly realised how hungry she really was halfway to the door caitlin paused and looked at sophie with a grave face what are we going to do now just wait for the end im not the kind of person who does that sophie said with a clear note of hope it was enough to keep caitlin happy but if sophie had been asked what possible course of action they could take she would not have had an answer chapter five learning the words of fools desperate diseases require desperate remedies guy fawkes hal had spent the day filing reports wastecollection targets guidelines for the establishment of a primary healthcare trust monitoring of food production targets and the local economy a request for extra funding from the local police at times he could pretend to himself that the fall had never happened and that the world of mundane things continued as it always had peoples lives ticking over no lows no highs just maintenance of a steady state of production and consumption but occasionally some document would leap out at him to shatter the illusion perimeterdefence evaluation reports for instance itemising the steps being taken to ensure that no supernatural creature made it into the city to terrorise the population and of course the everpresent energycreation management report detailing the current state of the local power grid it was the single thing that underpinned the slow clawback from the fall in those early days when technology had failed in the face of the resurgent supernatural they had all realised that electricity was the one thing that separated them as civilised beings from some relict man cowering in fear around a campfire one light bulb was the difference between home comforts and the dark ages so with one eye on politics and one on survival electricity had been the first thing the government had restored when it transferred to oxford after the battle of london the residents of the city had been almost pathetically grateful prosperity certainly flowed to the power base the government had access to the national oil reserves stored in some topsecret reservoir in the south plus experts in every field and a weight of employees to get the job done hal had heard how bad things were in other parts of the country oxford was a paradise in comparison no wonder strict laws had been imposed to prevent inward migration from day one when the last file slid into place in the cabinet and the trolley was empty hal knew he should have felt a sense of achievement but he didnt it was a job hed done all his life and at one time hed felt happy and secure in its mundaneness but it no longer seemed important that simple thought instigated a panic response if he didnt have his job what did he have he jumped as the door swung open with a crash hunter darted in wincing at his unintentionally noisy entrance and closed the door quietly behind him whats wrong hal said with irritation hunter stared at him whats got your goat nothing its just youre stopping me working hunter glanced at the empty trolley sorry to break your concentration he said sarcastically but we need to talk wrapped in thick parkas they made their way past the porters lodge and out into the high street hunter led the way to the botanic gardens across the road where he knew theyd have privacy and took a seat next to the fountain snow blanketed everything and more flurries were blowing in as they sat it was odd to see plants and trees in full summer greenery poking out of drifts the tropical greenhouses rose above the redbrick garden wall steaming in the cold hunter pulled a bottle of jack daniels out of his parka and took a long slug before offering it to hal its june hal look at it whats going on the end of the world hal muttered uninterested you know what i reckon it is hal gagged on the jd as he checked to see whether hunter was joking back in the day the royals used to look out for portents and if this weather isnt one then i dont know what is before hal could sneer hunter told him what hed seen on the helicopter ride to scotland were being invaded he said finally and ive got this gut feeling that whatever it is is worse than any of those socalled gods and devils and little fucking fairies that came with the fall when i saw those things in scotland i got a feeling hal he took the bottle back with undue haste then held it tightly as though for comfort theyre here to wipe us out get rid of the infestation once for all the balloons gone up apocalypse armageddon he snapped his fingers poof hal thought for a moment and then said angrily look at us what look at us why are we friends answer me that im a clerk i file files you kill people steady on mate a crisis in my day is if a document on taxation levels accidentally finds its way into l instead of t meanwhile youre slitting some poor bastards throat or shoving a screwdriver into his ear that would be an unfortunate use of work tools weve got nothing in common hal shivered in a gust of icy wind and huddled down further into his parka why are we friends hunter mused well apart from the fact that no one else will put up with you oh hunter considered his response then said well were friends because i know why youre talking about this instead of what we should be talking about were friends because in all the world youre the only one i can tell about slitting some poor bastards throat and know you wont judge me and were friends because im the only one who will sit and listen to you drivelling on about filing wanky polemics under the dewey decimal system and rats arse rates under a to z youre a boring fucker hal and no mistake but i love you for it hal snatched the bottle back and drank more than he should have in a single draught so its all coming to an end he snapped im inclined to say so what hunter jumped to his feet and leaped on to the edge of the fountain in danger of plunging backwards through the thin sheet of ice into the dark water beneath because this is the worst time for it to end weve got a chance to make a fresh start put everything right build the kind of world we should have were newborns hal and you dont sacrifice infants if its as bad as you say what can be done about it the pm the general you cant trust people in power how can you say that you work for the government they pay your wages they pay me to do a job and i do it but they dont buy me those in power always think theyre doing things for the people theyre not they do things they think they would like done if they were the people do you get me old song the public wants what the public gets beats some old philosopher any day and thats how the ones in power think what are you saying hunter hal asked wearily im saying mate that when push comes to shove it might be up to us to do something us hal said incredulously us you and me against the world now i know youve gone mad desperate times bring out the best in everyone pal and disaster is necessary if you want to be resurrected i dont want to be resurrected everyone does from the life theyre living to the life they should be living so what youre saying i should learn how to use a gun so we can go out like butch and sundance i get to be sundance he was the goodlooking one stop it hunter were going to do something hal and you dont have a choice i just havent decided what yet hal tossed hunter the bottle then set off down the path towards the high street without a backward glance they said nero was mad too hunter roared after him before laughing as if hed just heard the funniest joke in the world hal made his way along the high street in the face of the gusting wind night was falling earlier than he had anticipated it would have been much more sensible to go back to his warm room so perhaps he was as crazy as hunter after all the snow drifted against the shops and restaurants still closed from the days before the fall but close to coming back into use hal could see the occasional swept floor and fresh lick of paint and sense an almost painfully building anticipation human nature was intrinsically optimistic no one would imagine an even greater fall coming so hard on the heels of the last one hal picked his route randomly letting his subconscious drag him this way and that lost to his thoughts his mind turned naturally to samantha as if she was the only thing in the world that truly mattered he guessed in his world she probably was basically he was pathetic he decided when it came to any kind of emotional life he was paralysed stuttering like some monastic fool whenever he met a woman except this wasnt just any woman samantha made him feel special whenever he saw her but why couldnt he express it to her it was his parents fault obviously or his teachers some trauma during his formative years or perhaps he really was pathetic the city looked magical under the coating of snow the dreaming spires gleamed white against the night sky the domes and ancient rooflines like frosted cakes hal stood at the crossroads where the high street met st aldates and turned slowly in the deserted street surveying the city he realised how much he loved it it represented so much more than the agglomeration of bricks and mortar that shaped its fabric its history made it a living thing its dedication to centuries of learning made it something greater and he couldnt help but think that in some way they were spoiling it though he couldnt quite grasp how or why as he shuffled around in the snow raising little fountains of white every time he turned movement caught his eye something was heading along blue boar street it was near to the ground measured tiny sparks of light floating in the gloom hal hesitated thoughts of the strange dangerous creatures that now existed beyond the city boundaries dampened his curiosity but then a soft lilting song floated out across the drifts so light and organic it could have been a breeze itself it was hypnotic and before he knew what he was doing he had advanced to the end of the darkened side street the sight was stranger than anything he could have imagined a column of tiny figures was making its way along the gutter men women and children little more than eight inches high dressed in clothes that appeared to come from a range of different eras medieval elizabethan georgian some in victorian top hats and long coats hal even made out miniature horses and minuscule dogs in the sombre procession some of the figures carried tiny lanterns aloft on crooked sticks to light their path as they walked and sang a strange atmosphere hovered around them like an invisible mist into which hal had wandered it felt as if he was in a dream watching himself watching them the little man at the head of the column had a long curly beard and eyes that gleamed all black as if cast in negative he noticed hal and held up a hand the others came to a sudden halt all eyes fell upon hal what are you doing here hal said it sounded as though his voice was coming from somewhere else what are you doing here the little mans voice had a deep echoing quality i live here hal replied he realised that he felt drunk or drugged for he was responding to something that was inherently absurd yet it all made the clearest sense to him in a way that things only did when you were intoxicated these are not the fixed lands the little man said puzzled these are the far lands you are in faerie son of adam take care i dont think so hal replied the little mans face darkened and hal decided it would be best to change the subject where are you going from here to there and probably back again your song is very pleasant this compliment pleased the little man immeasurably we sing the winnowing as we walk the boundaries of our dreams he said proudly it is a song that came from the days when the worlds were new and we have learned it so deeply that it sings in our hearts even when we sleep why are you singing are you celebrating something the little man grew horrified at this celebrating celebrating he roared so loudly that hal took a step back we sing to save the worlds we sing to bind the weft to keep all existence from unravelling for if we did not who would i ask you that son of adam who would in these dark and desperate times when all is falling apart oh i see hal said not seeing at all the little man leaned forward to peer at hal curiously is it do my eyes deceive me a brother of dragons hal grew instantly tense i dont know what you mean he said edging backwards a brother of dragons the little man turned to his fellows and clapped his hands excitedly before returning his attention to hal then you join us in the defence of the worlds you stand on the edge of the great gulf to hold back the night the words filled hal with a terrible dread i cant do any of that the little man looked puzzled at first and then increasingly disturbed but you are a brother of dragons stop saying that hal snapped i dont know what any of this means with his heart thumping so hard that his pulse filled his head and drove out all thoughts hal ran from the side street slipping and sliding through the snow desperately searching for the life he knew the general sat in his office in magdalens presidents lodgings surrounded by books describing military victories in minute detail and sketches and paintings by war artists from down the years the crimean the heat and dust of the south african veldt in the boer war the swamping mud of flanders the march into berlin the belgrano going down kuwait with the burning oil fields in the background baghdad broken by cruise missiles and there at the end of the room facing his desk so that he would always see it a painting of the battle of london four fabulous beasts circling belching fire at a black tower while the capital burned in the background the greatest defeat in a campaign of many defeats a whole platoon wiped out by shapeshifting creatures in scotland the retreat from the lake district the battle of newcastle during which the city was razed to the ground and the entire raf obliterated and now this latest assault he would defend his country with every whit at his disposal but he couldnt help thinking that he would be the one in the long unbroken line of british military leaders who would preside over the complete destruction of the island nation on his desk were photographs of his wife and daughter taken before the fall these days they barely knew him their presences passing like ghosts at irregular meals or during the occasional function when he never even got time to speak to them would his sacrifice ever be recognised there was a knock at the door and the ministry of defence ministerial advisor admitted manning reid and the few other members of the cabinet who were not dealing with the immediate crisis the general didnt trust manning he had always been convinced that she didnt have the backbone to go the extra mile sooner or later she would let them all down most likely at the worst possible time reid was a thoroughly dislikeable human being but at least he was a perfect security officer the other cabinet members he could take or leave weak men and women not up to the job desperate to be somewhere else knowing no one else would do the job if they departed they gathered in the assembled chairs and waited silently i wanted to give you the opportunity to see the available intelligence before we go into the full cabinet meeting to brief the pm the general said there is a lot to take in its all gone pearshaped the foreign secretary intoned the general set his jaw there was a man without a job as a result of their inability to contact any other country since the fall and he was already preaching defeat we have a situation the general corrected an attack has been launched in the scottish borders the enemy is establishing a beachhead with the intention we can only assume of preparing for a fullscale invasion of the country the ministerial advisor drew the curtains and took up a position at a digital projector the general nodded and the screen hanging on the opposite wall came to life this film was taken by a reconnaissance unit and transmitted back shortly before the men were wiped out it was difficult to make out what was going on smoke billowed back and forth across the screen it was night and there were trees all around occasional bursts of fire flashed here and there and to all intents and purposes the image looked like a vision of hell sharp blasts of static blared out intermittently making some of the cabinet members clutch their ears and every now and then the picture was disrupted by jagged rips of white whats up with the sound reid asked the digital signal is repeatedly interrupted whenever the main enemy is near the general replied the research team suggests that their physical makeup may interfere in some way with technology every person in the room jumped as a figure lurched into view its shiny black skin looked like polished latex flecked here and there with red but as it approached the camera the skin ran away like oil to reveal a form constructed out of bone but this was not its skeleton in any traditional sense there were cow bones a pigs jaw human tibiae fibulae and a rib cage tiny bones that might have come from mice and birds plus more indistinguishable items of animal and human origin all topped by a horses skull it looked like a human figure built by a conceptual artist but it moved swiftly and with a reptilian vitality a purple light glowing in its empty eye sockets jesus christ the chancellor said in a hushed sickened tone the bonecreature moved like a rattlesnake to grab a soldier standing offcamera there was a roar like rocks falling on metal and the soldier was whisked aloft as though he weighed nothing bony protuberances rose mysteriously from the creatures body before shooting out rapidly to impale the soldier the screams were worse than the deafening bouts of static the camera wavered but the operator remained true to his mission once the soldier was dead the creature pulled his body close it looked like a hug for a departed but respected enemy yet within seconds it was clear what was really happening the soldiers bones gradually burst through his skin to be absorbed into the body of the thing that had killed him drawn almost magnetically into the depths of the form what remained was tossed aside with a soft squishing sound that the camera picked up with sickening detail the audience was rooted in horror the general who had viewed the footage twentyseven times searched their faces seeing the same emotions he had felt himself with each subsequent viewing a hand with long unnaturally thin fingers appeared in the middle of the screen it was apparent to everyone that it was made of insects and other small wriggling creatures a honey bee crawled near the wrist beetles and flies brown and amber centipedes wasps and midges all together in one seething morass the hand moved forward rapidly towards the camera lens a jagged flash of white then black silence fell on the room for a long moment then manning asked what kind of a defence can you mount against something like that her question was followed by supportive mutterings a robust defence the best we have the general replied without revealing the anger he felt at her defeatism what are you planning general reid was thoughtful unruffled his expensive pinstripe suit an echo of another time weve mapped the terrain and the location of the enemys force theyve made no attempt to hold a defensible position they dont care manning interrupted the general ignored her a direct assault could decimate them conventional weapons reid asked for the time being ive made no secret of my disdain for the socalled supernatural artefacts that youve been amassing since the fall if mister kirkham or anyone for that matter can convince me firstly that they work and secondly of their reliability in a battlefield scenario then i will obviously put them to good use until then we utilise the triedandtested methods they didnt work at the fall so why should they work now the foreign secretary looked as if he was about to cry the general tried to keep his rising anger in check but it was becoming difficult its a matter of application and strategy you tried a tactical nuke at newcastle reid noted the general gritted his teeth as i said if any of the socalled experts at our disposal can find an unorthodox weapon that works i will use it the onus remains as it has done since the fall with the ministry of new technology or the ministry of magic as the squaddies contemptuously called it the general thought it had proved a useless distraction from the outset nobody could get any of the artefacts to work effectively and it was unlikely they ever would if they were still functional there was a mechanics behind them that no one could grasp what about the local population manning asked do we need to arrange evacuation intelligence suggests that the enemy has already wiped out all civilians in the immediate vicinity theres a portion of scotland to the northwest under the control of an organisation called clan mctaff they used to be a group who dressed up in medieval garb and the like for battle reenactments of the fantasy kind the general shook his head wearily obviously they were extremely well equipped for life after the fall what are you saying that fantasy gamers shall inherit the earth manning noted with sarcasm the general ignored her theyve established a small sustainable community but they dont appear to be under any immediate threat the enemy seems to be directing its attention towards the south towards us reid noted a decapitation exercise would be standard practice the general said destroy the government all resistance falls apart youre ascribing them human motivations manning said how can you even begin to guess what theyre planning her eyes were cold hard and distrustful the general remained calm leave the military planning to me ms manning you concentrate on doing whatever it is you do best he checked his watch now i think the pm is waiting for my assessment i hope i can count on your full support what else can we do the foreign secretary said resignedly bang the drums loudly and off we go to war mallorys whole body ached from the wounds he had sustained on cadbury hill and then from his rough treatment at the hands of his captors but he had experienced worse particularly in the grim days during his training as a knight templar at salisbury cathedral when the church authorities had decided he was a troublemaker who couldnt be trusted to keep the faith hed survived then and hed do so now life had hardened him since his younger days the times to which his subconscious would never allow him to return before the death of the woman he loved would have left him broken and pathetic now his grief was an icy foundation deep inside him on it he piled cold hatred and bitter thoughts of revenge building a temple through which he would find an exit but even there in his bleak cell the miserable haunting image wouldnt leave him alone a burst of fire in the darkness like the breath of a fabulous beast it would break into his mind unbidden stirring the deepest recesses of his memory where all the nasty things lay hidden a notification of his death now tied inextricably to the death of sophie death was all around him all the time the emotions around the memory had grown even more intense as if sophie had helped him to keep them in check and now that she was gone the door had been thrown open wide sometimes he would pummel the side of his head to try to drive the desperate thoughts away or bite his lip until the blood ran and sometimes in his weaker moments he felt as though he was falling apart a hard focus on revenge for sophies murder was all he had to cling to the room was spartan a chair a chemical toilet a cheap collapsible bed he guessed it had been an office once before the powers that be had turned it into a holding cell there were others nearby every morning and night he could hear his jailers moving along the corridor silently distributing food yet the sounds that came from the other cells disturbed him immensely inhuman shrieks and cries an alien cacophony he was in prison with beasts was that how his captors perceived him the chains on his wrists suggested so though theyd only been put on after hed attempted to kick the door down and then headbutted a guard some people had no sense of humour mallorys face hardened at the sound of drawing bolts the door swung open to reveal the man who had led the team that had captured him the most unlikely leader of a security force that mallory could imagine hed heard the guards mention his name hunter but they all spoke of him with a respect bordering on fear despite his dandyish appearance here for the torture mallory said we dont do torture as a rule but keep asking you might convince me to make an exception hunter closed the door with a surreptitious glance into the corridor unofficial visit stand at ease mallory clanked the manacles attached to his ankles quite the comedian i like to keep the prisoners entertained raises morale hunter spun the chair around and sat on it backwards you know im not going to answer any questions with or without torture fair enough then you die with us mallory eyed hunter obliquely but couldnt read the truth or otherwise of the statement hunter stared at his boots for a second or two then said im sorry about your girlfriend i mean that she shouldnt have died the wanker who did it has been punished severely i know that wont make it right but i reckon that to the kind of bloke you seem to be it will mean something and how are you getting punished you were his leader i thought thats where the bucks supposed to stop the cold anger in mallorys voice made hunter look up sharply the two of them stared at each other measuring judging mallory saw some of himself in hunter but that didnt lessen his feelings dont come here talking about sophie mallory said eventually itll only make me want to kill you quicker all right i wont talk about her but i meant what i said you know what im sick of authorities messing with my life back in salisbury it was the church here its little boy soldiers who still think the rule of government means something have a look at the world out there its chaos everywhere youre just playing at this pretending its still like it was before the fall while reality passes you by mallory felt his repressed emotions about sophie fighting for release he forced himself to remain calm why have you gone to all this trouble to bring me here im a nobody youre just wasting resources youre not a nobody youre one of the most important people in britain at the moment mallory grew still he could see the seriousness in hunters eyes do you know what i mean hunter pressed when mallory said nothing hunter stood up to face mallory on his level cracked his knuckles then proceeded to pace while he spoke ive just come back from scotland weve been invaded i dont know what they are but theyre worse than all the things that came with the fall a friend of mine he was warned by some kind of higher power it told him wed been noticed mallory flinched hunter saw it from the corner of his eye and struck like a rattlesnake youve heard it too mallory considered not replying but it was pointless i met one of the gods on my travels she said the very same words weve been noticed something is rising up from the edge of the universe to destroy us well its here or at least the advance guard are i saw them things dont look too good you want the honest truth now that sophies gone i dont really care maybe it would be better if the whole human race was wiped out even after weve been taught a nasty lesson by nature were still venal malicious hypocritical backstabbing selfish killers thats just me dont judge everybody by the same yardstick hunter quickly realised that his feeble attempts at humour werent working and changed tack ok you say that now but i reckon that deep down you dont believe it im a good judge of character have to be in my job life or death decisions see not like meeting someone in a pub and i say youre decent someone whod do the right thing in any situation and what proves me correct is that youre a brother of dragons whatever power put you in that exclusive club is going to go for good men and women not a little bit good the best heroes thats quite a pedigree and id say its a huge burden to shoulder but youll live up to it or you wouldnt have been chosen in the first place see circular logic when you say it like that mallory lay down on the bed and closed his eyes suddenly he felt weary obligation responsibility thats all it had been for so long he wanted a rest another thing hunter continued this thing thats noticed us i reckon its the reason you exist the brothers and sisters of dragons defenders of humanity were created to stop this thing that wants to eradicate us make sense heres a little irony mallory said there are rules of existence you dont even know about patterns things have to be in place for everything to work like some big magic ritual and for the brothers and sisters of dragons to do their business there has to be five of us and youve killed one so congratulations when they take stock of who doomed the human race your name will be at the top of the list so what are you saying if there arent five of you its all over mallory could see hunters mind whirring what about the last five the ones who fought at the fall you know the stories two of them are dead but three of them are still around somewhere i dont think it works like that mallory was going to say more but he could see that hunter was no longer listening to him after a moment mallory continued so all this sophies death its all about the brothers and sisters of dragons because you shortsighted meatheaded pigignorant politicians and soldiers think you need to control us to get us to do the job charged to us by some authority much higher than you mallory had clearly struck a nerve theres been a lot of stupidity done in the name of politics dont expect any better of this regime hunter said as hunter stood up to leave something struck mallory forcibly whats going on here he asked this chat wasnt sanctioned was it if youd been sent here by your superiors you wouldnt have come alone thered at least have been someone taking notes youre not as dumb as you look hunter smiled giving nothing away and slipped quietly out of the door hunter raced through the empty halls he found hal drinking whisky alone in his room staring out through the frosted panes at the snowswept college grounds everyones looking for you hal said his words slurred the troops are shipping out tonight never mind about that hunter snatched the whisky bottle from hal and took a long draught ive got a job for you while im gone what refile your cd collection stop feeling sorry for yourself youre not the one going to his death dont say that hunter was taken aback by hals unusual passion i want you to use all the many and im sure there are many skills at your disposal to find out what you can about the brothers and sisters of dragons what hals face looked unnaturally white in the candlelight old members new members theres supposed to be five of them weve identified two see if you can dig up any secret files hal shook his head ill never be able to do it it was a lie samantha had already offered to help dont be so defeatist i know i love drama but this is for real its life or death im counting on you hal hunters eyes narrowed he could see something in his friends face what is it youre not telling me nothing hal looked back out of the window if you know anything about these people nows not the time to keep it from me i dont know anything hal replied firmly i just dont think youre going to have much luck finding the other three needles in a very big haystack for the first time hunter felt a barrier between himself and the man who had been his only real friend for the last few years he was surprised how sad it made him feel come on youd better see me off hunter said i dont want you developing a wilfred owen complex later so best get all the tears out of your system now they made their way out of the college buildings in silence the troops were preparing for dustoff in the deer park behind magdalen the stink of oil and gasoline on the night wind powerfully evocative in a way they would never have imagined a few years ago when it was commonplace there were twenty troop choppers lined up on the makeshift airfield the snowy perimeter marked by flares and burning oil drums not much of an army hal said this is just the top brass and intelligence hunter mentally checked off his ammunition and felt the weight of the pistol at his hip we had troops stationed in rochdale and barnsley and theyve already been mobilised should have made camp by now you think youve got enough men they both knew the fatality figures during the fall and thered been numerous problems with recruitment since we have what we have theyre well armed i dont know how you can be so optimistic hunter nobody ever achieved anything by aiming low the general marched past with his coterie heading towards the nearest chopper then paused and came back to hunter were counting on you i know the general met his eyes for a moment and hunter was pleased at the degree of defiance the general saw there what was that all about hal asked when the general had disappeared into the chopper im going to be leading a small team behind enemy lines once they start the frontal assault cut a few hamstrings that kind of thing youre mad thats suicide its my job i cant start moaning about it when it gets tough he shrugged actually its the job of the brothers and sisters of dragons but in their absence it looks like it comes down to me chief substitute for the saviours of the universe i suppose thats something hunter thought hal was going to cry before hunter could ask what was wrong he heard the crunch of footsteps in the snow behind him he turned to see samantha buried in a massive furtrimmed parka her arms wrapped across her chest she paused uncomfortably before him you look even more gorgeous than usual in that hunter said it wasnt a line the oversize parka made her features more fragile and beautiful and emphasised the intelligence in her pale eyes hunter expected to feel the sharpness of her tongue but all she said was i heard what was happening you cant keep anything a secret around here samantha visibly steeled herself then grabbed hunters head and planted her lips on his they felt full and hot and he was suddenly aware of a depth of emotion coming up through her skin like the heat from a fire when she broke off she stared deeply into his eyes for the briefest moment but it was enough to underline everything he had sensed in her kiss youd better come back hunter she spun round and marched away towards the buildings for the first time in his life hunter was lost for words she didnt even know i was here hal said but hunter was distracted by the jumbled thoughts rolling through his mind as he watched samanthas form become obscured by the swirling snow bloody hell i think she likes me he said amazed the choppers engines fired up one after another the whirling blades raising a snowstorm around them hunter ducked down covering his face with one arm and clapped hal on the shoulder his friend appeared dazed dont worry mate how can i not come back after that hal stared at him troubled and distracted dont worry im not going to hug you take care hunter hal forced a smile then ran for the cover of the college buildings hunter hurried keeping low to climb into the second chopper his heart racing he felt strangely out of sorts excited yet unsettled by the discovery of some so far unconsidered part of himself as the chopper rose on the unsteady currents he stared down at the snowswept field then at magdalen as it dropped away below him and finally at the disappearing city he could still taste her on his lips chapter six the politics of war it can only be done by blood and iron otto von bismarck the army had dug in along a ridge of hills southeast of moffat in the scottish borders but they were barely prepared for the neararctic conditions the ground was as hard as iron frozen to a depth of at least twelve inches underfoot and the wind that blew from the north felt harsh enough to take the skin from their faces overnight the temperature plummeted to minus ten worse with the windchill factor bloody hell hunter this is a nightmare clevis stamped his feet and clapped his hands as he circled the campfire little more than the tip of his broken nose visible in the depths of his hood hunter looked out over the tent city and the constellation of campfires spread across the hillsides each one trailing a thick line of black smoke up to the colourleached dawn sky you know what im thinking this is a new ice age its not bloody fair wed barely got over the fall when the plague came along and now this clevis sounded petulant but he was barely seventeen hardly trained emotionally immature and hunter had to take him on a potential suicide mission clevis shouldnt have been there at all but with forces so badly depleted they had to make do in many different areas even if that meant sending a barely trained youth on a special forces operation they needed the numbers to make the plan work and hunter just had to hope that the others would cover for the lad clevis really didnt know how unfair it was but hunter did and that knowledge troubled him deeply he liked clevis for all his faults the boy was decenthearted and truly believed in the cause for which he was fighting as hunter surveyed the snowy wastes stretching away towards the sooty streak of black on the horizon that signified the enemys location he realised that clevis was staring at him ive told you not to do that sorry clevis wiped the back of his hand across his dripping nose its just i was thinking well dont how many men have you killed captain one hundred and sixty seven i cant remember every face locked in place eye colour hair colour method of dispatch its a dirty business clevis but we do it so other people dont have to he would never forget any of them whats it like clevis asked hesitantly i mean when you actually do it stop asking impertinent questions weve got a job to do he prayed that clevis could escape any killing the act was like a worm in an apple getting fatter by the day with each mouthful it devoured nobody was immune hunter consoled himself with the knowledge that clevis would probably be dead before he had the chance to raise his weapon we begin operation clear skies at ohsevenhundred hours the general rested his two meaty fists on the trestle table in the conference tent and surveyed hunters team by that time you will be deep in the heart of enemy territory your mission is to cause as much disruption to the enemys lines as possible chaos and confusion are the order of the day let them know we are not weak that we are not going to roll over and die by the end of this day i want them reconsidering their decision to invade hunter cast a surreptitious glance across his team apart from clevis there were four others all hard men all aware of what potentially lay ahead for them bradley was from kent a scar running down his left cheek like an exclamation mark the result of an iraqi bayonet next to him coop was slight but more focused than anyone hunter knew he was from birmingham but with strong jamaican roots spencer was a hard man and silent ormston a sneaky little shit who was surprisingly reliable in a crisis both of them from some godforsaken industrial town or other in the north they rarely spoke about their pasts the present for all its misery was clearly so much more appetising it was ormston who raised his hand to speak first excuse me sir but do you have any idea what might be waiting for us over the hill i heard there was a film very poor quality you wouldnt learn anything from it that would help you the general lied even hunter hadnt seen the video but he knew exactly why it was being kept from them no one would venture over that hill if they knew what horrors were waiting for them but wasnt that the case in any war the frontal assault will give them hell the general said you have my word on that were throwing everything at them every weapon at our disposal apart from nukes he hesitated such weapons were clearly still an option for another time the strategy is for massive shock devastate their forces within the first twentyfour hours hunter fought the urge to smile if wishes were fishes theyd need a sea of batter god be with you the general said go into the fray with good heart it is a just fight for the future of our country and our people the general nodded and hunter led his men out they made their way in silence across the camp site until bradley stopped suddenly and exclaimed bleedin ell look at that the sky behind them was black at first hunter thought it was a whirlwind of dust but as it drew closer he could see irregular edges and rapid movement within the body of the darkness birds spencer said flatly crows coop looked at the approaching cloud uneasily now that aint natural bradley said in hushed tones the crows actions became even more unnatural as they neared initially their cawing was discordant in the early morning peace but gradually they fell eerily silent they descended in a wild flapping cloud over the hillside behind the camp settling on trees hedges fences filling the fields so that the snow was obscured by an oily blackness it looked to hunter like some horrible pollution was running down the slope towards them once they had landed the crows fell still it looked to all the men as though the birds were watching the camp with their gleaming eyes waiting hunter knew the symbolism and wasnt about to say anything but coop spoke up they used to say that crows gathered before battles waiting to feed on the dead as if they knew exactly what was going to happen yeah but look how many of them there are ormston said they must be expecting a right bloody feast he laughed loudly at what he thought was a great joke but he was the only one and eventually his humour drained away until there was only the soft whisper of the wind across the snow and the men watching the crows and the crows watching the men the chopper swung in low over the snowy wastes before hovering over the dustoff point hunter and the rest jumped the remaining six feet into the heart of the blizzard raised by the whirling blades they were already under the cover of nearby trees as the deafening drone of the helicopter receded behind them polar fatigues helped them blend in as they moved swiftly and silently along the hedge lines to a deserted farmhouse overlooking the enemy encampment hunter made his way quickly to a bedroom that still smelled of its former occupants and found a window that allowed him the best view with the hires binoculars but he only needed his eyes to learn the true meaning of encampment the enemy filled an entire valley lining the floor and the hillsides for a good ten miles packed so closely that not a single square of white was visible the scene was unspeakably eerie for there was none of the backandforth movement that hunter would have expected in a camp the enemy stood stockstill to a man resembling a chinese terracotta army all facing the direction where the government troops were preparing for the attack the chilling scene suggested that the enemy were machines that did not need to move or talk or eat or feel any emotion they were simply waiting for the moment when they would be unleashed to crush anything in their path clevis slipped in next to hunter and froze the moment he looked out of the window jesus christ we dont stand a chance hunter used the binoculars to get a better look at the enemy the ranks comprised many different types many different species tall willowy men stood next to squat brutish troglodytes things with a hint of the reptilian next to others that were almost as insubstantial as ghosts but all of them looked as if they had died and been remade weapons had been embedded into their bodies swords emerging from forearms nests of spears protruding from ribcages exposed bone visible everywhere and there was an odd purple mist drifting from their eyes and mouths even more disturbingly some of the enemy were human they looked very much as though they might once have been the residents of the area now transformed like all the others hunter could feel clevis shaking next to him without looking hunter said on the positive side i can only see swords and pikes a few axes spears see ormston brayed they dont stand a chance hunter pushed past them to carry out a weapons check and prep them for what was to come they had small arms and sas but their most effective response was the small but devastating plasma explosives they carried in their backpacks each one would take out fifty of the enemy at least a drop in the ocean compared to the thousands that lined the valley but if the explosives were used effectively they could make their mark coop took out his cross and chain and kissed it before slipping it back into his parka the rest of them looked to hunter still and silent with their thoughts he checked out of the window one more time then gave the nod ground zero was hell shells rained in from the distant batteries with barely a second between each explosion thick black smoke mingled with the strange purple mist blasting back and forth in huge billowing clouds the noise was as deafening as a foundry and the ground vibrated as if a permanent earthquake ripped through the strata body parts flew everywhere the detailed briefing had told hunter and his team exactly where the shells would fall their safe route was prescribed through thick tree cover but they were still close enough to the carnage to view the sea of arms legs and heads spread out across the fields earplugs protected them from the worst of the noise but it still felt as if their heads were full of a swarm of bees hunter gave his orders via previously arranged hand signals occasionally they would lose sight of each other in the sweeping smoke and at those times it felt as though they were already dead walking through some eerie purgatory towards judgment hunters mind had the calm of a pool at twilight he existed wholly in the moment seeing hearing reacting but not feeling in that state he gave himself up to the shadowfigure that rode the mare of his conscious mind the true hunter who had made him so good at being fearless emotionless inhuman in battle the hunter he hated the trees and the snow and the mist reminded him of the hills of bosnia the stink of the mass graves heavy in the air as he hunted serb mercenaries the thunder of the shells was baghdad all over again slipping in and out of the shadows of the sunbaked souk how had he ever got into it hed wanted to be a zoologist animals thats what he lived for endlessly fascinating natures little wonders from the aphid to the zebra and all points in between there wasnt a single wrong turn he could identify it was the cumulation of a thousand tiny steps each one insignificant in and of itself but all leading him away from the magic path into the deep dark forest to this place where body parts crunched underfoot he led the way through the trees into a culvert under a road then along the path of a trickling brook to a point where a sword of thick forest plunged deep into the heart of the enemy forces with skill they could move through the trees unseen releasing their explosives into the midst of the opposition their hot breath turned the air white as they gathered in the dense vegetation beneath the shadows of the branches hunter checked his watch nearly time the fields ran away from the forest down a slope to a road winding along the valley bottom when the smoke and purple mist cleared in a gust of wind channelled along the cut hunter saw the enemy still standing their ranks now mottled by circular blast marks he could feel the unspoken questions radiating from the men around him why dont they run why dont they attack why are they waiting to die hunter looked at his watch again and then signalled to the others quickly donning masks attached to portable oxygen canisters they dropped low though they were beyond the estimated blast area they still had to be cautious the shelling stopped in the disturbing silence that followed hunters ears still rang but he removed his plugs to listen for the drone of the approaching jet it was a tornado gr one of the few they still had left after newcastle when it was overhead hunter shielded his eyes the fuelair explosive was detonated fifty feet above the valley those immediately beneath the blast were vaporised instantly others nearby seared by the tremendous heat hunter and his team were far enough away that the shock wave didnt burst their eardrums or rupture their lungs the oxygen was sucked out of the air in the immediate vicinity of the explosion which would have been devastating for human troops but hunter doubted its effectiveness on this enemy he was proved right when the thermal winds cleared and he looked up on the periphery of the blast zone the enemy still stood waiting but there was now a massive hole in the heart of the force where flames raged out of control clevis and ormston highfived before restraining themselves but bradley spencer and coop were already coolly removing the explosives from their knapsacks equipped with what were essentially hitech catapults for launching the plasma bombs they moved like ghosts through the trees one after the other they emerged to fire and then retreated back into the forest depths before they were seen scores of the enemy fell with each blast there was none of the panic and chaos that the general had hoped to engender but at least they were cutting swathes out of the enemy lines the team continued with the guerrilla attacks for ten full minutes but as the blast from one of cleviss launches died away hunter saw that a change had taken place the enemy were moving but not slowly not like robots coming alive in some fifties science fiction movie in the blink of an eye they were suddenly in rapid motion up the other side of the valley weapons ready but still eerily silent hunter was convinced that he and his men had not been seen but some of the enemy had now turned to the trees where they were hiding he had the creepy feeling that the enemy didnt need to see that they had abilities far beyond anything anyone had imagined theres something back here in the trees coops voice had the first faint tremors of uneasiness there was no time to respond the enemy moved forward too quickly hunter faced an attacker resembling some overmuscled barbarian from a schwarzenegger film naked to the waist where a bloodstained animal fur hung he wore a twinhorned viking helmet on top of a matted mane of red hair and a long fiery beard half of his face was exposed skull and more bone could be seen protruding from his meaty forearms and muscular thighs both hands were welded together around an enormous broadsword bone and flesh merging directly into the metal purple mist streamed from his eyes and mouth as if a fire raged within him the closer the barbarian got the more hunter felt despair welling up inside him he realised instinctively that it was another weapon subtly inflicting psychological damage and it was effective he had to fight hard to stop himself giving in to its damp pull hunter switched to his sa the bullets cut a swathe across the attackers torso but didnt slow him for even an instant the barbarians shadow engulfed him and then the broadsword came crashing down hunter had a second to grip the gun with both hands and hold it ahead of him to block the sword he knew it was futile but although the gun shattered it did just enough to deflect the sword from splitting his skull in two instead the blade ripped flesh as it slid down his arm before slamming against his shoulder blade hunter was driven to his knees in pain but he used it to focus his mind as the barbarian came at him again hunter ripped open his knapsack pulled out one of his few remaining explosives and hurled it it was stupid to release it so close to him but it was a last resort the explosive hit the barbarian in the middle of his stomach and he dissolved in a mist of meat and bone hunter was thrown backwards ten feet and when he clawed his way back to vertical his head was ringing he muttered take that you bastard there was no time to glean even a glimmer of satisfaction ranks of purplemisted enemy moved towards the forest bristling with weapons and filled with a mute mechanistic savagery but as hunter ran back into the cover of the trees he saw a sight that hit hard on the tree line bradley stopped firing his sa and let the weapon fall slowly to his side in his face was a dismal acceptance of the worst that life had to offer hunter knew he had succumbed to the waves of despair that washed off the enemy a tremble ran through bradley the gun fell from his hand hunter yelled a warning but bradley was transfixed by a tall thin figure almost majestic with its golden skin and long hair blowing in the breeze the god languorously raised a hand with an arrow protruding from the wrist bone and then drove it into bradleys throat hunter was horrified to see that bradley even bared his throat slightly for the killing blow blood spouted from the wound and bubbled from bradleys mouth as he choked and bucked and went down on his knees the enemy withdrew the arrow with a ripping sound then grabbed bradleys head and twisted sharply still holding bradleys sagging head his killer leaned forward mouth wide and exhaled forcefully purple mist rushed out of him and with a life of its own flowed into bradley into his eyes his ears his nostrils his mouth within a second bradley began to mutate bones shattered and twisted breaking through his flesh though dead bradley reached out one twitching hand to grasp his sa when his fingers closed around the handle his skin and bone flowed like oil merging with the weapon seconds after he had died bradley was standing next to the god that had killed him moving with the same mechanical tread into the forest to search for his former comrades hunter searched through the trees for the others cursing to himself how could you hope to defeat a force that could turn even your own fallen to their ends the more they killed the stronger they got they didnt feel they didnt think their only purpose was to destroy hunter needed to get this information back to the general but as he sprinted through the trees ormston staggered into his path the transformation that had overcome him was unnerving his face was drained of all blood and his constant shivering revealed a man terrified of his own shadow theyve got clevis he said with a voice like a bird in flight all hunters training told him he should not be distracted from getting the vital intelligence back to his commanding officer but he couldnt get cleviss frightened face out of his mind the boy still had an innocence that hunter barely remembered but knew was worth saving show me he said ormston looked sickened at the prospect instead he pointed back through the trees and then zigzagged away frantically hunter knew ormston wouldnt get far in his state of panic behind him the enemy crashed through the thick vegetation at the forests edge drawing a knife from his boot hunter moved stealthily away from them in the direction ormston had indicated he soon spotted movement deep in the shadows amongst the pines with his breath clouding in the freezing air he hid behind a tree to steady himself before proceeding on his belly through a thick carpet of fern some kind of strange structure stood nearby raising himself up slightly to get a better look hunter saw something that looked like a doorway constructed out of meat yet it seemed to have grown out of the spongy vegetable matter of the forest floor when he looked through it he was shocked to see stars gleaming in alien constellations planets circling seething suns that had never been glimpsed by human eyes he recoiled sharply it felt as though something was looking back at him peeling his flesh and bone aside to get deep into the core of his mind the sensation made his skin crawl looking around he saw other similar gates situated randomly at other points in the immediate vicinity a cry rang out he recognised the voice as cleviss hunter moved as quickly as he could without revealing himself and came upon a scene that was even more shocking than anything he had yet seen a thing completely constructed out of bone was clutching spencer who flailed wildly his skeleton was being drawn out of him easing through skin and muscle as if they had the substance of water a pile of shapeless black skin lay nearby which hunter took to be the remains of coop and within a few seconds spencers pink skin landed next to it with a sickening plop with a disgusting flourish the bonething absorbed spencers redstained skeleton into its own mass when it had finished hunter could see spencers vacant orbits staring hollowly out of the centre of the monsters chest the bonething which was larger and more terrifying than any of the enemy hunter had witnessed so far was not alone in the gloom of the forest other equally imposing figures stalked around the area in ritualistic patterns as though they were drawing invisible lines on the ground hunter saw something that was alive with forest birds their flapping twitching bodies forming a kind of skin another figure was made out of snakes frogs newts and other lizards and amphibians green and slick catching the light as it moved the third had larger woodland animals wrapped into its frame rabbits foxes mice squirrels wriggling as if they were trying to break free from an invisible cage and it was this one that dragged clevis behind it as though he was a spoiled child refusing to go to school hunter had a split second to weigh the situation he was smart enough to know that any attempt to save clevis was hopeless yet even so he leaped towards the animalthing with a wish and prayer his only hope was that the fury of his attack would allow clevis to break free and that in the confusion they could both escape into the undergrowth but when he plunged his blade into the depths of the snapping snarling mass of fur to no effect he knew the game was up the animalthing turned towards him and stared with eyes made up of the multiple orbs of the creatures it possessed and then reached mousefingers for hunters face hunter clevis cried tearfully get me out of here hunter wrenched his knife free and staggered backwards a buzzing arose behind him the animalthing saw hunters interest in clevis and dragged the youth forward there was no sadistic glee or malice it acted with the neutrality of someone brushing away a minor distraction dragging clevis in tight against its chest where the fox and badger heads snapped and tore at his flesh cleviss cries were muffled by the fur but hunter could see his eyes swivel towards him pleading hunter attempted another attack but the buzzing was all around him now and before he could move he felt a seething at his neck that grew tighter and held him fast he could only watch as cleviss features were torn apart his lifeless body leaving a red smear as it slid down the animalthings torso to the ground choking hunter was lifted effortlessly off the ground and turned around the source of the buzzing was now apparent the thing that held him was made of insects in the same way that the others had used other kinds of natural matter to give them corporeal form the insectthing withdrew its grip but hunter was still magically suspended in the air it stood before him eight feet tall at least as it surveyed him once again there was no recognisable emotion not even curiosity hunter had trouble focusing on the creature for its body was such a writhing mass of insects that its outline appeared permanently blurred through movement bees flies wasps gnats beetles roaches all these and more crawled and wriggled burrowing or attempting to take flight without ever being able to leave the creatures gravity hunter stared into its insectile eyes and got the same feeling he had experienced staring through the meatdoorway an alien intelligence travelling back along his line of vision to examine his own mind forensically the insectthing held out one hand palm upwards and a swarm of insects rose off it sweeping towards hunter he closed his eyes turned his head away but they enveloped his head forcing their way into his nostrils and through his clenched lips the buzzing filled him followed by the sickening sensation of crawling creatures working their way into his nasal passages he fought the urge to choke and vomit and then suddenly all sensation was lost his consciousness was circumscribed by the insectile buzzing inside him outside everywhere and then he wasnt there at all insects crawled around the edges of his vision but he knew that it was not his eyes but his mind that was examining the fractured hallucinatory images he could see it took a second or two for him to realise that the creature was attempting some form of communication but it was so inhuman that there was no frame of reference the images shattered twisted out of shape moved from incomprehensible alien forms to pictures he could almost recognise it felt as if he was tuning across the wavelengths to find a channel he could understand the process came to a halt with an image of a wasp as big as a bus nestled in a strange irregular landscape that appeared to be made out of the same kind of meat as the doorways it buzzed up and down the scale insistently distractedly but the meaning was lost to him yet some form of comprehension began to grow deep in his subconscious a power as big as the universe had become aware of humanity its nature if that was the right word was to oppose life not only in its form but also in its essence what it meant in terms of positivity advancement connectivity hope goodness all the things that on his better days hunter dreamed life really was about this power this antilife was a gulf of nothingness that went on for ever yet could be constrained on the head of a pin trying to comprehend what it really was made hunter feel sick he forced his thoughts to move on but before he left the subject he realised its motivation the eradication of everything it was not the antilife could not rest until humanity was gone or circumscribed a name came and went not from the thing itself but from somewhere without the void and so it had come to earth acting through agents and generals and outriders who prepared the way for its ultimate ascension again hunter discovered names that existed somewhere but did not come from the void itself the zombiethings that leaked purple mist were called the lamentbrood the five creatures he had come across in the forest were the voids generals leading the charge against humanity they had no form in and of themselves they were ideas nothing more clothing themselves in the matter of the physical world negativity given shape and identity the lord of bones the lord of birds the lord of lizards the lord of flesh and above them all the force that would see humanity wiped away the king of insects hunter was not a religious man but childhood images of satan haunted him here he felt was true evil dispassionate relentless capable of causing death on a grand scale without any meaning at all a quote came to him from a sunday school class revelation then i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army the giant wasps message was clear there was no hope it really was all over and the world was about to be remade in the image of antilife hunter tried to imagine what that would be like but all he kept coming back to were those selfsame childhood lessons with their talk of hell and burning souls the wasp was so huge that it could not take flight and so it pulled itself forward obscenely on its spindly legs until its head filled hunters vision and he could see himself reflected a thousand times in its multifaceted eyes the wasp opened its maw wide trailing strands of sticky acids and lunged the stinking wet dark closed about hunter hard and he was sucked in and down and then he was hovering in the air once more before the king of insects wasps and flies crawling all over his skin across his eyes and lips skittering legs and wings setting his nerve endings afire as revulsion filled him it felt as if his time had come and he was pleased at how calm he felt those who kill for a living think about death a great deal he had once seen a man plead sobbing offering to give up his girlfriend in his place even though he knew it would do no good hunter had always hoped he would be brave enough to go with dignity but instead of delivering the killing blow the king of insects twisted its outstretched hand and then snapped it shut hunter felt a squirming in his belly rising up his spine growing faster until it reached the back of his head and then he shot out of himself as if strapped to a rocket hovering somehow amongst the tree branches he looked down to see his body still hanging in the air before the king of insects a second later an irresistible urge drove him up through the trees and into the grey sky hunter felt simultaneously detached and queasy as though he was in a dream on the verge of turning into a nightmare far below in the blasted valley hundreds of scattered enemy corpses formed fractal patterns in the thick snow gliding forward over the next ridge he caught the familiar wisps of purple mist drifting in the wind it had just started to snow again adding to the otherworldly ambience but when he had a clear view of the white landscape raw emotions broke through his detachment it was carnage worse than any battlefield he had ever seen the lamentbrood were a purpleedged wave swamping the feeble ranks of the army guns cut them apart but it took at least fifty rounds and as quickly as one fell six others took their place the enemy were brutally efficient rusted swords cleaved heads hacked off arms left trails of steaming entrails in the churned red snow spears rammed through flimsy skin and muscle arrows plunged into eye sockets the despair the lamentbrood engendered was a weapon in itself and many soldiers simply laid down their arms to have their bones snapped and life extinguished by dead but powerful hands it was a rout beyond any defeat the army could have envisioned as fast as men fell they were brought back to unnatural life to swell the ranks of the enemy going on to kill their friends and colleagues with vigour explosions roared flames and gouts of smoke high into the air as ammunition was detonated and batteries overrun fire raged in several of the tanks in the front line there were no tactics no weapons that would make any difference it was only a matter of time and just as that thought entered hunters head choppers carrying the general and other cos rose up behind the lines a retreat had been ordered but it was too disorganised to be effective men tried to pull back but the lamentbrood kept coming picking them off as they fled its all over hunter thought dimly grateful for the remaining detachment that still swathed him one final shell was loosed into the sky before the enemy swamped the lines it rushed towards hunter passed through him and came down beyond the ridge when the explosion resonated all around he suddenly felt as if a rope at his waist had been tied to a speeding car yanked backwards he flew over the valley and down towards the forest now blazing from the strike which had impacted right at the point where his body had been suspended chapter seven night falls in the dreaming city heaven cannot brook two suns nor earth two masters alexander the great there are times when the world feels like an irritating distraction even when buildings are collapsing blood is flowing and people are crying about the end of the world some things are more important hal understood that clearly as he made his way along the corridors of queens college all he could think about was the kiss samantha had shared with hunter how it had been a whole conversation in a single moment a complex communion of secret yearnings confused romance hope worry sexual attraction it had made him realise that those who live their lives in their heads as he did made it easy to deceive themselves the imagination is a trickster he thought tempting with illusions to drag you off the path so he can laugh uproariously at your rude awakening in his mind samantha had always been the one who would save him from his mundane existence and now there was no hope of that ever happening lost in his dreams he might have been but he was a pragmatist when faced with harsh reality he felt colder than the unnatural winter outside as though every thought he had was laced with frost so cold that he felt he would turn to ice then slowly melt away when the thaw came reids department filled a vast complex of rooms all sealed all silent a place of unspeakable secrets that gave no hint of their existence of quiet suggestions that turned the mind to horror of the brush of fingertips at midnight hal was met by an underling at the entrance to the sanctum sanctorum and led into an area he had never visited before and had never thought he would he was finally shown into a room with a security system that exceeded anything hal had seen throughout the extremely secure offices of government reid waited within talking in hushed tones to dennis kirkham with a troubled expression the chief scientist examined a sword suspended in a holding frame ah here he is reid exclaimed when he saw hal will you excuse us mister kirkham business kirkham disappeared in the silent manner that always characterised his comings and goings and reid came over to hal with a faint swagger to hal reid always appeared to be on stage pretending to be some spy he had seen in a sixties movie he had charisma and cool and a touch of arrogance but it felt as if it was all hanging loosely over someone else entirely look at this reid said indicating the sword we retrieved it from the fellow brought back from cadbury hill the brother of dragons thats the chap doesnt look much like a champion of the human race i must say but thats by the by i believe and certainly he believes that this is one of the three great swords of legend sir were frantically playing catchup here mister reid fumbled for hals name without any sign of embarrassment even though he spoke to hal several times a week campbell hal said reid nodded but didnt deign to use hals name the rules have changed as we all know the spy continued we can no longer sneer at the supernatural or magic those words simply define something we cant quite understand at this moment in time we know that myth and legend what we thought were simply fairy stories contain secrets coded into them truths many of them pieced together provide a secret history of what was going on behind the scenes of our illusion of a rational world do you understand what im saying hal nodded the difficulty is deciding what is true and important to us and what is merely embellishment to make them good stories that will carry those truths through word of mouth over generations a lot of it is symbolism one element representing another reid waved his hand with irritation not my department we have people who deal with that kind of thing but what i can understand is that its a code and were in the process of cracking it he returned to the sword one of the great british legends is of three powerful swords weapons fantastic earthshattering weapons one is called caledfwlch or by another name excalibur with which im sure youre familiar another was believed to be consumed by or filled with fire with an implication that its power was corrupted in some way and this is the third our brother of dragons was told its called llyrwyn but that isnt any name ive come across before and he also appears to be completely unaware of its capabilities if we can find out how to access that power imagine what we could do we certainly wouldnt be on the back foot any longer reids eyes gleamed for the first time hal looked around the room properly rack upon rack of cases were lined up like a futuristic library but they did not hold books there were more weapons axes a bow and arrows that appeared to be made of gold a spear and artefacts that ranged from the mundane to the bizarre odd lumps of rock jewels that glowed eerily a crystal ball in which fleeting images came and went a carpet a mirror with a carved frame of tormented figures amulets of all shapes and sizes caskets and boxes some plain some encrusted with more colourful jewels the skull of some beast with horns a stuffed figure of a tiny man with wings and those were only the items in hals immediate line of vision reid nodded when he saw hals expression weve amassed quite a collection havent we my men have been very busy since we received the first hints that the fall was taking place you remember what it was like the failing technology the seemingly ridiculous rumours of fantastic creatures then the deaths he shook his head in fauxsadness im not one to blow my own trumpet but i put this entire project in motion right then dont deny the evidence of your eyes i told my superiors adapt or die sadly they died but i moved quickly sending out agents to seize whatever might help us when the time came to fight back and it is a remarkable achievement some of these objects well theyd take your breath away if you saw what they could do some we will never take out of their security cases too dangerous even to touch were working on the others close to a breakthrough in some areas he said proudly hals attention was drawn to a lantern like an old miners lamp sitting on the top of one display case a blue flame flickered inside veering strangely at a sharp angle in one direction whats that hal asked reid examined it puzzled ive never seen that before and whats it doing out of its case dont worry ill get kirkham to secure it reid was dismissive but there was something about the lantern that resonated with hal even as reid led him away to a case on the far side of the room hal couldnt help but look back the lantern made his skin tingle and he felt as if there were feathery fingers probing gently into his mind youre probably wondering why i brought you down here reid said as he came to a halt before a case that contained an eightpointed silver star next to a stone hal assumed it must be the wish stone that the brother of dragons had retrieved from cadbury hill reid slipped on a pair of plastic evidence gloves and went for the wish stone before diverting to the star he plucked it out and handed it to hal this is an unusual item what do you think of it hal was surprised that reid was canvassing his opinion on anything he held the star up to the light which revealed an almost invisible gold filigree covering the star with strange symbols and runes the object felt oddly warm to his touch and while his eyes told him that it was an eightpointed star his hand suggested a different shape no idea hal said some kind of talisman where did you find it a site in cornwall weve puzzled over it for a while but thats a conversation for another day this is what i wanted to show you reid put the star back in its case and picked up the wish stone another artefact this brother of dragons was carrying when we found him hes refused to answer any of our questions about where he got it or what its for which suggests it has some importance but we believe he recovered it from cadbury hill it may even have been his reason for being there here hold it the moment the wish stone came into contact with hals skin crackling blue light surged out to trace a picture in the air of two men next to a tomb overlooked by a woman hal dropped the stone and reid caught it with a deft movement careful sorry it shocked me how does it work what was that scene hal felt as if he had seen it somewhere before we have no idea what it represents or what it means whether its something we should be studying or just a distraction why are you showing it to me we need you to find out what it is do some research youre good at that im told reids attention was already wandering he clearly didnt care whether hal found out what the stone was for or not do you want me to report directly back to you yes of course reid walked away stripping the gloves from his hands with a loud snap he turned raising his finger for emphasis dont say anything about this to anyone else do you understand hal nodded confused by the mixed signals he was receiving but the image from the stone was already tugging at his subconscious he felt instinctively that this was important the air had the summer twilight smell of a hot day cooling of rolling grassland and wild flowers and the tangy musk of distant forests sophie stood on the high balcony with caitlin at her side looking towards the west the reddening sun bisected by the dark horizon lay against a sky of shimmering gold and flaming orange far below them the court of souls ease was quietening as the residents hurried to their homes after a day of business in the bustling otherworldly city yet the evening was not entirely peaceful for a drone of activity came from beyond the sturdy walls sophie wrinkled her nose can you smell that in one hand she gripped a spear she had drawn from the armoury the tip gleaming silver the shaft hard wood branded with mystical symbols it never missed she was told smoke the fires are starting caitlins weapon of choice was a longbow and arrows the moment the words had left her mouth bursts of red and yellow flared up in the pooling shadows beyond the walls illuminating what at first sight looked like a mass of swarming ants surrounding the entire city as the firelight flickered and the shadows washed back and forth across the teeming multitude it became clear that it was an army of the little men who had attacked sophie and ceridwen on their journey to the court i came here for safety while i looked for an opportunity to get back home sophie said bitterly now im stuck here under siege mallory probably thinks im dead goddess knows what else is happening in our world i think being in the wrong place at the wrong time goes with the territory caitlin said quietly sophie cast a secretive glance at her in the four days since she had arrived in the court of souls ease she had got to know caitlin very well a deep sadness filled her but most of the time she managed to mask it behind smiles sophie could easily imagine caitlin as a gp back in the real world she cared deeply about everyone enough to swallow what must have been a toxic amount of grief to ensure that she didnt make anyone else suffer along with her that thoughtfulness alone would have been enough to win over sophie but caitlin also had an admirably quiet strength and resilience sophie thought that the two of them would probably become friends given time yet one great barrier lay between them sophie was a sister of dragons and caitlin was not not any more it tormented caitlin in many ways layering more misery on top of her mourning she feared that the whole of humanity would pay the price for what she saw as her weakness of character and the loss of that inestimable quality that set them apart as sisters of dragons was as devastating as if she had lost the use of her legs probably more so for caitlin had confided in her the previous night that it was as if she had been given a glimpse of heaven only to have it snatched away for evermore it wasnt just the strength and healing ability that she missed but the sense of being connected to the entire universe she was bereft in more ways than one dont jump we need you the brash birmingham accent had become familiar to sophie over the past four days harvey stood in the middle of caitlins quarters a workingclass youth as out of his depth as anyone could possibly get yet who still acted as if he was heading down to his local sophie liked him immensely beside him was his friend thackeray a deep thinker who liked to pretend he was a doomed romantic they had both found themselves accidentally caught up in the events that had brought caitlin to tir na nog but for their part had stuck by caitlin resolutely giving her the strength to keep going thackeray was easy to read every aspect of him suggested that he was deeply in love with caitlin and sophie had the feeling that caitlin returned the affection on some level though it was never discussed harvey shifted uncomfortably when sophie and caitlin came in from the balcony you two freak me out he said bluntly it was bad enough when she was going all wonder woman on us he nodded to caitlin now theres you as well wheres it going to end he loves it really thackeray said hes got this fantasy about amazons oi harvey punched thackeray hard on the shoulder that was the beer talking anyway you shouldnt be repeating what i tell you in confidence we found a pub the sun big surprise in a city ruled by a sun god thackeray said they give us free beer harvey said excitedly all given freely and without obligation the way we figured it mallory said we could either hang around here getting under your feet and offering less than useful opinions on how the siege could be broken or we could get pissed harvey finished not really a contest was it caitlin said as long as youre enjoying yourselves before you go castigating us weve got a message thackeray said theres a big war conference wrapping up down in the main hall and they want to see you two finally sophie said theyre going to break the siege so that we can get out of here and back home thackeray shook his head i think theyre just going to sit back and wait maybe whatever it is that makes us sisters of dragons attracts bad things like this sophie said to caitlin as they marched into the great hall lugh was waiting for them his solar armour burnished red in the light of the setting sun that streamed through the floortoceiling windows behind him ceridwen waited with a serious expression it is the pendragon spirit that shapes your days and nights guides you to be where you should where you are needed it is the power that binds everything together lugh said what did your war conference decide caitlin asked impatiently the hidden passage out of the court of souls ease is still blocked by the enemy lugh still had difficulty considering his own people a threat the only way out is through the gates so youre going to attack them head on sophie said we fear a slaughter ceridwen said many of my people would be destroyed that is not our way its the only way caitlin said its a waste of time trying to talk peace when the other side is determined to wipe you off the face of the land and you know they wont settle for anything less her words clearly rang true with both lugh and ceridwen but the weight of their traditions and culture kept them ambivalent the battle will come when it will we know that we have always known it but have been unable to face up to what was coming lughs handsome face was filled with a deep melancholy i regret that you have been caught up in our familial strife sister of dragons lugh addressed sophie directly caitlin flinched you should not be here you are needed elsewhere sophie noticed a concern in their body language that she had missed before whats wrong the final days have come the fixed lands are being consumed by the void whose true name is the devourer of all things the far lands will follow and all the lands beyond lugh said then its started caitlin whispered what has sophie looked from caitlin to the gods and back seeing sophies mounting concern ceridwen stepped forward the arrival of the devourer of all things has always been foretold by my people it was one of the stories we brought with us when we left the four great cities of our glorious homeland to become wanderers cut off from the source the devourer of all things shall come and consume the light that story is the sadness at the end of our own tale of dissolution you knew about this sophie asked caitlin i knew that the void had sent outriders to prepare the way but it could have taken weeks or millennia to turn up what are we talking about here some kind of monster sophie asked the devourer of all things is the underside of existence bound to it even while constantly opposing it lugh answered he held out his arms to indicate the wider world existence is everything all time all space all lands what then is the devourer of all things which is the dark reflection of existence a monster no it is immeasurable incomprehensible it is everything too sophie and caitlin stood quietly for a moment while they attempted to understand what lugh was telling them finally sophie said incredulously if its what you say it is why arent you doing something whats the point in being wrapped up in this civil war if everything is coming to an end lugh smiled a father explaining the ways of the world to a child how can you fight everything there are two conflicting stories the filid sing on the nights when we reflect on our beginnings ceridwen said one is that all we see and feel is the construction of a just and right existence and that we are all part of that the other is that all we see and feel is flawed and corrupted a prison created by a dark force to separate us from the true glory of existence the court of the final word has long sought the truth and evidence exists supporting both stories but consider this what if both are true what if existence has two faces continually turning and when one looks upon us the other is alerted and attempts to seize control so youre just going to sit back and let it happen sophie said the only way to stop the devourer of all things would be to use the extinction shears lugh said and none know where they now lie i dont care about any of this caitlin said furiously if youre saying that the worlds under some kind of threat we need to be there doing what we can i understand your desire ceridwen said for this is the reason the brothers and sisters of dragons exist is that what this is all about sophie interrupted she grabbed caitlins arm weve got to get back they need us they need you caitlin replied im the one who spoiled it all remember if there arent five of us were weakened we will do what we can sister of dragons but there is no path back to the fixed lands from the court of souls ease lugh said the war council will continue its debate and i will make your case for decisive action but in the meantime there is nothing we can do outside the great hall caitlin grabbed sophie by the shoulders and said passionately i want the pendragon spirit back ill do anything nobody can bring it back its a gift you know that sophie said sympathetically we can petition higher powers it must come from something right these gods they keep talking about existence as though its alive we could ask it you use the craft you could try i wouldnt even know how to start its too big caitlin trying to make that kind of contact would be beyond any mere human there are people here who could help caitlins face was filled with desperation will you at least try sophie couldnt refuse her all right ill do what i can but there could be risks theres always a price to pay and the more youre after the bigger the price ill do anything caitlin said ill pay any price sophie hoped those words wouldnt come back to haunt caitlin during her stay in the court of souls ease caitlin had kept her ears open to the whispers that washed back and forth through the city like a tide she had learned of the many wonders that existed there some obvious some hidden behind the scenes suggested but never discussed one such was the tower of the four winds night had fallen by the time they located the mysterious tower in the section of the court that resembled the moorish quarter of a spanish city white stone minarets ornate awnings and fragrant smoke blowing in the warm breeze it lay high up the hillside and when sophie turned to look back over the court spread out below her the sight took her breath away tiny white lights had sprung up everywhere like fireflies in the dark there were candles in windows and lanterns hanging over shops along the streets tiny suns holding back the night it was magical if the circumstances had been different sophie knew she could have whiled away many days in a place of so many wonders large and small the tower stood in a walled garden filled with palms and orange trees and small spiky shrubs a whitestone path wound through the vegetation more lanterns hung from the trees attracting moths in clouds the gate was unlocked caitlin caught sophies arm lets go carefully why guard dogs ive heard some strange things the one who lives here might be dangerous there are stories about him she caught herself lets just be careful do you want me to go first im not a complete invalid caitlin snapped instantly regretting her tone im sorry all this im on edge dont worry sophie smiled but she was growing increasingly concerned about caitlins desire to make amends for her perceived mistakes the tower was constructed from ivory glass and gold each element merging into the other with a delicate architectural sensibility that instilled a quiet wonder the path led to a mahogany door covered with iron studs a bellpull hung beside it caitlin hesitated and then grabbed the pull to announce their presence for a long minute there was no reply then gradually a rhythmic hissing rose up from the vegetation on either side of the path as sophie and caitlin waited with thumping hearts snakes slithered on to the path and headed towards them the serpents glowed so brightly that the women couldnt be sure if they really existed or if they were constructed of green and red light sophie removed her spear from the harness on her back though she wasnt at all sure it would have much effect on the snakes if it came to it the snakes moved quickly along the path and then split into two groups curving around on either side of caitlin and sophie they continued up the sheer slick walls of the tower and came together over the top of the door where they began to crawl into each others mouths the serpents merged becoming larger until finally one huge snake undulated down to bring its eyes on a level with caitlin and sophies they glittered red with a disturbing intelligence speak your business the snake said with a soft sibilance a sister of dragons and a fragile creature are seeking the wisdom of math caitlin said there was a brief pause before the serpent replied that name has not been heard since the days of the tribes but it still holds does it not caitlin persisted math great magician brother of the goddess don he was a friend to fragile creatures in times past there are no times past the snake hissed another pause then enter and prove yourself worthy to stand before the seer of the seven worlds with a fizz the snake dissolved into tiny balls of light that drifted away on the breeze a second later the studded door swung open releasing a heady aroma of incense i dont like the sound of that sophie whispered nor me when theyre not being pompous these gods are more than a little sneaky caitlin stepped over the threshold and made her way to a staircase that wound upwards around the inside of the walls it was lit intermittently by tiny lanterns but there were still many troubling pools of shadows the silence that filled the tower was not peaceful it felt as if some loud bell was just about to toll caitlin and sophie moved hesitantly up the stairs each trailing a hand along the cool wall for support when they had reached what they guessed was the halfway mark the atmosphere became oppressive can you feel it sophie asked somethings coming a sound like the wind through leaves echoed softly at first from further up the tower drawing closer caitlin and sophie waited with mounting apprehension until the first signs of something approaching were indicated by undulating shadows cast by the flickering lanterns more snakes caitlin said lots of them as they rounded the next bend in the stairway caitlin and sophie saw that these werent the lightsnakes they had encountered at the foot of the tower but hardscaled sharpfanged serpents that were undoubtedly real yet they had an otherworldly ambience that made them even more menacing several were as broad as sophies body their tails lost in the dim recesses of the upper tower but the majority ranged from the width of an arm to barely larger than a finger shimmering greens and scarlets and golds with strange black patterns along their skin that resembled runes there were so many snakes that they filled the stairway up to sophies waist a slowmoving tidal wave that would easily engulf the two women sophie grabbed caitlins arm come on we have to go down we cant caitlin said desperately this is our one chance if we go down hell never let us back up again she turned to sophie her face hard and determined you go you dont have to do this youre insane look at them the nearest snake had the hood of a cobra but strange alien growths like mushrooms lined its back it reared up to bare its fangs venom sizzling where it splashed on the steps youll never survive one bite sophie pressed caitlin surveyed the mass of writhing bodies almost close enough to touch now then she said firmly its a test math wants to see if were up to the honour of meeting him yes dead or alive it would seem the nearest snake moved within striking range caitlin made her decision and then lay flat on the stairs what are you doing sophie said incredulously he said we had to prove were worthy he wants us on our bellies supplicating youre mad sophie looked from caitlin to the snakes and then back down the stairs then she recalled what she and mallory had had to go through in the temple beneath cadbury hill and knew that caitlin was right cursing under her breath she threw herself down if i survive im never going to forgive you for this she closed her eyes and pressed her face hard into the cold ivory of the steps the serpents reached her a second later a writhing mass pressing down so hard that sophie felt she might suffocate the sensation of constant movement above her made the bile rise in her throat their skin was dry against her face forcing their way through her hair wriggling past her cheeks under her nose forcing her lips apart with their tiny bodies pressing against her eyes a minute later she was drowning beneath a sea of serpents her face crushed into the hard steps blood on her lips in her mouth in a desperate attempt to distract herself from the horror of what was happening she grunted rhythms in her throat made up tunes in her head anything that might take her mind away and then the claustrophobia set in and she began to choke but the weight above her was so great that she couldnt have lifted herself up from the steps if she tried panic rammed rational thoughts aside and she knew in that instant how easy it would be to go insane the snakes continued to come for what felt like hours until sophie couldnt believe there were so many snakes in all the worlds just when she thought her last breath was about to give out the mass above her grew lighter and then quickly receded finally she was on her knees choking and spitting unable to believe that she hadnt received one bite caitlin was beside her in the same state yet strangely smiling she grabbed sophies arm and indicated down the stairs in the direction the serpents had gone sophie looked around but there were no snakes to be seen anywhere youre not telling me that was all in my mind sophie choked it was real all right caitlin said and we survived after a moment gathering themselves they started back up the winding stairway the aroma of incense grew stronger and eventually the stairway opened out into a room that covered the whole floor at the very top of the tower four windows at the cardinal points looked out over the glittering lights of the dreaming city in front of each sat a creature that resembled an animal but had the same otherworldly quality as the snakes a gleam of intelligence in the eye or an odd movement of the mouth as if it was muttering to itself or an unusual size there was an enormous boar fat and bristling its piggy eyes green and furious a hawk that was almost as big as sophie a salmon again as big as a person sitting in a large wooden chair its tail flapping against the wooden floorboards and a bear watching them contemptuously all were fastened in place by an iron chain attached to a ring bolted to the floor the four beasts radiated an air of menace that made sophie and caitlin wary of venturing too close purple drapes covered with gold and silver magical symbols lined the walls between each window and the floorboards were marked with similar magical symbols a brazier gave off the heavy incense while other mystical objects stood around several lanterns burning with a dull red light hung on chains from the ceiling a brass telescope maps and charts lay on a table flanked by books and flasks of philtres and in the centre of the room nearly seven feet tall stood math long black robes covered his entire body and on his head protruding from a fourholed cowl was a brass mask with a different face in each of the holes a boar a falcon a salmon and a bear you survived the test he said from the mask of the boar with a voice that was strangely gruff i would have expected no less from a sister of dragons but from a fragile creature he tilted the mask towards caitlin it would have been easy to wilt under the cold eyes just visible behind it but caitlin held her head proudly we have come to ask a favour of you caitlin said a boon math was clearly intrigued by this for you the fragile creature for my friend sophie interjected who was once a sister of dragons too ah the brass mask nodded and sophie was disturbed to see the real boar at its window nodding in time maths hands protruded from the voluminous sleeves as he brought his fingertips together they were brown and scabrous as if they had been severely burned and what would this boon be i wish caitlin took a breath before steeling herself to continue i wish to have the pendragon spirit within me once again math grew rigid with a soft whisper the mask rotated so that the salmons features faced them when he spoke his voice had changed too and was now soft and liquid somehow you ask me to make you a sister of dragons again impossible that is a gift that can only come from existence you have to caitlins voice cracked the eerie mask turned again until the face of the bear appeared you dare raise your voice to me math roared caitlin took a step back behind math the bear was straining at his chain eager to break free to tear caitlin to pieces caitlin though was undeterred she looked to sophie with tears in her eyes please were sorry if weve offended you sophie said my friend didnt mean it she came here because she heard you were the greatest magician in the court of souls ease and if you cant help her no one else can there was a long period of silence that ended with the appearance of the falcons face i can petition existence on your behalf but there are dangers even for one such as me i will demand a fine price to take such a step there was a subtle slyness to his words anything caitlin said before sophie could stop her if she could penetrate the mask sophie knew she would see math smiling he turned his head in her direction i ask for very little he said but it is this a simple memory from a sister of dragons a precious memory a rare and unique thing but it will not be missed caitlin could now see the danger but it was too late im the one who should be she began but math waved her silent with a burned hand he pointed a long scarred finger at sophie and said you must agree one simple memory what does it mean if i give it to you sophie asked it will be gone from you for ever nevermore to be recalled but what is a memory an ephemeral thing sophies heart was pounding which memory sophie asked hesitantly the memory of your first meeting with the one you love oh no caitlin moaned sophie felt sick the image of mallory sitting with her in a camp in salisbury flashed through her mind the smells the sounds his expression the way she had felt disoriented and happy and sexy realising the nearinstant attraction all that gone for good it would be like losing a physical part of her but then she looked at caitlin and saw her desolation and thought of what good they both could do of the chance they had to save the human race she didnt really have a choice all right she said she was aware of another secret smile beneath the mask and then math reached out his fingers and brushed her forehead it felt like a steel hook was squirming in her brain as he pulled back his fingers there was a flash of intense pain and she screamed a blue spark followed his fingers math guided it to the table where he uncorked a flask he directed the spark inside before recorking it hastily sophie thank you caitlin said her face was filled with guilt but beneath it lay a desperate hope sophie didnt hear she was trying to recall her first meeting with mallory but there was a horrible black hole in her mind that refused to budge however much she poked and prodded it and she realised with a note of panic that she no longer knew why she loved mallory just that she did it felt like coming into a movie twenty minutes after the start math made them gather near to him within a protective circle candles guttered on the circumference in front of each of the windows the animals all strained at their chains slowly and with a voice that didnt appear to come from any of the faces math began a chant in a language sophie and caitlin didnt recognise it hurt their ears when they attempted to focus on any of the words the god continued for five minutes his voice rising and falling but growing continually louder by the end he was shouting so loudly that sophie and caitlin covered their ears a great wind blew into the room snuffing out the candles flames one by one each of the beasts began to make a terrible howling sound that could not have come from any animal the noise rose up to the roof until it seemed to have a life of its own and rushed around the room with the wind the beasts tore at their chains and threw themselves back and forth in a furious desire to break free math stopped his chanting and pointed out of the western window look he roared above the cacophony sophie and caitlin both turned and a second later not knowing what they had seen they plunged into unconsciousness when they awoke an uncommon stillness lay across the room the four beasts cowered against the windows and math was slumped in a chair at the table as if he had no strength left within him it is as i said the pendragon spirit cannot be brought into this fragile creature he said flatly through the falcon mask thats it caitlin said then this was all for nothing no math levered himself to his feet his power slowly returning there is still hope for you you are a child of existence and like all of your kind you have the potential to be greater the pendragon spirit shall come to you again sophie thought caitlin might faint at this news when she said desperately soon when you have proved yourself ready math replied caitlin thought about this for a second then turned to sophie i have to do what i can to prove im worthy dont stop me doing this all right not knowing what caitlin was planning sophie agreed but had a suspicion that she was not going to like it i know its possible for the gods to become a part of fragile creatures caitlin began you can enter us possess us some can math said i know this caitlin said and i know which one i want inside me i have a bond with her i know her power and i can use it in what weve got coming she took a deep breath and then said i want you to contact the morrigan and i want you to make her become part of me youre crazy sophie said you cant seriously be asking for that i can and i am caitlin said defiantly dont you understand shes the goddess of death war bloodshed and sex creativity new life caitlin countered impatiently you wont be able to control her shell control you shes the most unpredictable the most dangerous im very skilled in the craft but even im careful about calling on the morrigan trust me sophie weve got a bond her and me ive been to hell and back in my life i know exactly what the morrigan is about believe me this is my only chance to do something that might help as some weak fragile creature im worthless not true it is in the context of whats coming up you know thats right you know it youre going to need all the help you can get sophie relented a little i still think its a mistake youll change your mind were going to make a good team a witch and a warrior caitlin turned to math can you do it the dark sister might choose a host who has the pendragon spirit inside her but why should she bond with a fragile creature at its window the boar snorted and stamped its hooves impatiently tell her therell be blood and death on an epic scale therell be a war to end all wars and ill be in the thick of it math raised one twisted hand to the mouth of his boar mask in silent consideration and then turned to his table he selected two phials one filled with red dust the other with a granular black powder he took a pinch of each and flung them on to the brazier the stench of the smoke made sophie grip her nose in disgust it smelled of charnel houses of bonfires after the battle of iron and bone math turned to the west once again and uttered a word of power that left sophie staggering an instant later an unearthly silence fell on the tower dead air no echoes even when she dragged her boot over the floorboards an overpowering sense that something was coming gripped sophie but this was not the anticipation she had felt when math had called for the pendragon spirit this time she felt dread every fibre urging her to flee a cloud blacker even than the night sky was visible through the western window it surged towards the tower with a rising sound like thunder swept around it then rushed in through all four windows at once with a deafening wild movement crows hundreds thousands of them sophie threw herself backwards almost falling down the stairs the crows filled the room in a dense wall of black flapping wings from the floor her hands covering her head sophie caught occasional glimpses of caitlin it looked as if the birds were attacking her pecking at her eyes her face trying to batter their way into her stomach sophie called out to her but her voice was nothing beside the tumult after barely more than a minute the crows departed as she pulled herself to her feet sophie expected to see caitlins ragged corpse lying broken on the floor instead her friend stood erect and unharmed radiating a fierce beauty and a dark power that made her almost impossible to look upon on her shoulder sat the biggest crow sophie had ever seen its black beady gaze heavy upon her are you are you ok sophie ventured caitlin answered with a cold glint in her eyes and an even colder smile night had transformed oxford into a magical city as hal made his way into the centre candlelight flickered in many windows and the street lamps made the snow glitter on the roads and rooftops occasionally illuminating stray snowflakes drifting down one hour ago he had met with samantha hal had kept a brave face while she handed over notes on the brothers and sisters of dragons that she had copied from reids files they spoke of links to the arthurian myths and to a greater mystery that intrigued hal immensely samantha had risked everything to get the information and hal knew she had expected a greater show of gratitude from him but if he had released even a hint of emotion everything inside him would have come out in a deluge that he would have regretted for the rest of his life instead he had simply promised to hand the notes over to hunter as soon as he returned and then took his leave he couldnt go back to a room that now felt so small and cold so he had decided to walk off his sadness and now he was glad he had there was something magical in every aspect of the city and he felt as if he had been allowed a glimpse of the secret spark at the heart of the mundane he kicked up flurries of snow as he walked wishing hunter was there to experience it with him he couldnt blame hunter for samanthas action they were the two most important people in his life and if he was completely objective they probably deserved each other hal missed his friend for all his licentiousness there was a poetry to hunter that hal admired because he knew he lacked it himself he had the sneaking feeling that hunter always saw the secret spark while hal only ever saw the mundane he was worried for hunters safety there had been no official news from the front line but rumours had started to circulate that things had gone badly there were always rumours running wild in the incestuous government community and most of them usually turned out to be false but this one gelled with expectation some said that the general and the top brass had flown back from the front early and were now sequestered in the war room ensconced in the bowels of magdalens new library others said that the general had already shot himself with a silver bullet and the enemy was only ten miles from the city limits there was talk of mass casualties of a fifth column within the city itself even that the enemys commander had already agreed terms with the government and was preparing to take over his thoughts were disrupted by a sparkling trail that gleamed across the sky from one row of rooftops to another it looked at first like a jets vapour trail and as he watched the sparkles broke up and drifted away a second or two later another trail appeared further down the street and at the head of it was a glowing golden light moving slowly it turned sharply and moved towards hal yet hal felt no fear only an incipient wonder as it neared hal was amazed to see a figure about the size of a tenyearold boy at the centre of the golden light flying gracefully the boy swooped down and circled hal at a distance of a few feet examining him curiously he wore what appeared to be a baggy golden romper suit gloves and boots that looked to be as soft as socks with long toes that flapped as he flew over his head was a mask that looked like a nightcap that had been pulled down too far with eyeholes cut into it well i never the boy said in amazement a brother of dragons then please you must help me who are you hal was amazed that he had reached such a state that nothing surprised him any more i have many names like all who live in the land of always summer and as you are no doubt aware my name of names must never be revealed but you may call me petronus he bobbed on the currents growing more anxious come he gestured for hal to follow help me hal didnt sense any threat from the strange boy and so reluctantly followed him into a tiny alley between two shops at the far end was a tiny golden glow in the snow help her please petronus said desperately the fading light was coming from a tiny winged woman her eyes were closed and her breathing shallow a fragile creature attacked her petronus said desperately fired its weapon at her as she flew on the night winds one of the guards hal guessed they always had been triggerhappy what can i do you are a brother of dragons petronus said hal was on the brink of brushing the boy away but the tiny womans fragile state called out to him hesitantly he scooped her up to try to warm her in his hands as he did so a blue spark burst from him and crackled into the frail body instantly the golden light began to grow stronger you have saved her petronus sounded on the brink of tears the woman recovered quickly and soon she was standing on hals palm blowing him a kiss then she waved a cautionary finger at petronus and with a twirl shot up into the sky trailing stardust behind her hal was at first struck dumb by what had happened but then he quickly grew irritated look what are you he said how rude petronus swooped high into the air before drifting back down from side to side like a leaf falling from a tree im sorry hal said stamping his feet to keep warm the memory of the blue spark troubled him greatly but why are you here why why not this is my home oxford no silly i live beyond the furthest star on the other side of the mirror in the misty vale where the golden apples grow if you want to be poetic hal considered this comment for a moment sieving through the little he had gleaned of mythology the otherworld he asked eventually that is another name for it as is tir na nog there are names and names and names and when you are as old as i am youll realise that names are meaningless for they never really capture what a thing is but this isnt otherworld hal protested this is the world petronus laughed how ridiculous i am here so it must be the land of always summer hal looked around but its winter then that proves the matter for the otherworld is a land of contradictions petronus spotted the tiny womans glimmer of golden light high over the rooftops my friend i must go wait how do you know im a brother of dragons hal asked so many questions how does anyone know its as plain as the nose on your face youre a blazing blue fire like a little star come down to earth petronus pulled up his mask to reveal slanted eyes filled with the wildness of nature and pointed pixie ears he gave hal a wink pulled down the mask and then soared high into the sky and was gone though he felt as if he was walking through a dream hals mind was racing what petronus had said about being in otherworld gelled with what he had been told by the little people he had heard singing the other night what could it possibly mean it wasnt the only matter preying on his mind every time he heard someone or something call him a brother of dragons it filled him with an unaccountable panic those words hinted at a future where he would have to give up the quiet thoughtful life he had made for himself it was a future where chaos ruled and anything could happen where there were no certainties no breakfast at seventhirty no lunch at one no dinner at seven no sundays off or sitting back with a good book as twilight fell the name spoke of sacrifice and bloodshed and death and upheaval and all manner of unpleasantness of the kind of life in which hunter would probably revel and which consequently was anathema to hal if it was true that he had somehow been selected by a higher power to be a defender of humanity then that higher power had certainly got it wrong for he had nothing whatsoever to offer lost to his thoughts hal wandered down a side street off st aldates to cut through to one of his regular haunts it was a familiar route but this time he was confronted by a pub he had never seen before it looked oddly quaint and historical in a slightly unrealistic way as though it had been prepared for a film set through bottleglass windows filtered the ruddy glow of a fire and the gleam of lanterns with a great many deep shadows in the areas between them the warped glass did not allow a clear view inside though there were clearly many drinkers within their hubbub leaked out through the ancient scarred oak door the second storey overhung the first in a tudor style complete with the requisite black beams and white paint and from it hung a sign that said the hunters moon with a picture of a full moon partially obscured by cloud and what appeared to be a man with a wolfs head it looked surprisingly inviting and so hal ventured in without a second thought it was only when the door had banged to behind him that he realised his mistake the occupants of the pub were a strange otherworldly group there was a man as thin as a needle nearly seven feet tall wearing a stovepipe hat that made him even taller his fingers so long and thin that they looked as if they were made of stretched toffee a woman with long blonde hair that moved with a life of its own she had a seductive look about her but mad dangerous eyes a giant of a man wearing furs and a battered widebrimmed hat a string of conies around his neck and a blunderbuss hanging from his belt another woman as bent twisted and wrinkled as a crone from a fairy story black shawl and white cap a black cat perched on her shoulder her cackle like the rattle of stones on a coffin and more all odd and out of place further towards the back the revellers were even more bizarre hal glimpsed horns and scales and forked tails bless my soul its a brother of dragons the tall thin man said before hal could back out he was grabbed by numerous hands and dragged to the bar where the landlord loomed overweight and blackbearded his arms as thick as telegraph poles both of them covered with tattoos of disturbing symbols pour the lad a drink drogoff someone called another agreed raucously and the landlord reluctantly served up a tankard of foaming ale that was almost as big as hals head ooo it aint often we get someone like a brother of dragons in here the crone cackled wes honoured what is this place despite the dreamlike sensation that gripped him hal was beginning to feel the first pangs of incipient panic the big bear of a man with the blunderbuss levered himself out of his chair and loomed over hal why its the hunters moon good brother best inn in all of the far lands i dont know whats real or not any more hal said his route to the door was blocked by more strange characters crowding around to see the new arrival they were curious but there was also unmistakable good will towards him which made hal feel a little more at ease the only real stuffs in ere the crone said tapping the side of her head we make the rest of it ow we want it to be everybody knows that with shaking hands she grabbed a tiny goblet from the bar and knocked the contents back with gusto steady on mother the man in the stovepipe said the poor lads a bit disoriented you know how it is when they first venture into the far lands give him room to breathe the woman with the snaking hair glided forward her hypnotic eyes burning into hal even jack giant killer was adrift in his first days in faerie she said sibilantly she moved a rotating finger slowly towards hals temple until the blunderbuss man gripped her wrist tightly the woman hissed at him like a serpent then pushed her way to the back of the bar have to watch yourself round here good brother youre not at home any more there are many dangers if you dont know what youre doing the blunderbuss man clapped hal heartily on the back come on drink up he roared join in the fun im bearskin the fellow in the hat is shadow john and this is mother mary i dont understand whats going on hal said i was walking through my home town and then somehow i ended up here that happens sometimes shadow john said resting his longfingered hands on a silvertopped cane there are thin places between the fixed lands and faerie sometimes fragile creatures can just fall through without even making the transition not just fragile creatures a new person had appeared on the fringes of the group who resembled nothing so much as a medieval woodcut of the devil complete with redtinted skin horns a goatee beard furry animal legs and cloven hooves one day i dropped right out of the far lands i had to walk halfway across the fixed lands before i found my way back it was a close call i tell you they can be a savage lot when their ire is raised followed my footprints up hill and down dale they did before i managed to slip back bearskin thrust the tankard into hals hand and encouraged him to drink with the exhortation all given freely and without obligation everyone laughed raucously though hal didnt get the joke the beer was the best he had ever tasted with a vast complexity of subtle flavours and delicate aromas but after less than a quarter of the tankard he was already feeling heady yet while his conscious mind flirted with drunkenness it unleashed his subconscious to work overtime making connections that began to unveil a hidden picture hal decided that here was an opportunity he should seize to glean as much information as he could so much time and energy had been expended by several ministries in the search for the nature of the otherworld and what had happened in the days before and after the fall and they had found next to nothing all the knowledge hal gathered would be vital in the war effort and perhaps hal thought it would move him a few rungs further up the ladder he had languished at his current level for far too long so he began your world exists alongside my own the fixed lands is that right side by side beside it behind it and right in amongst it mother mary said didnt you listen to any of the old stories when yer were a kid we was always there amongst you sometimes seen more often than not not youve always exerted an influence hal said there were some who felt the need to shape and guide shadow john said and some who just liked mischief and menace bearskin added but make no mistake weve always been around played a bigger part in your affairs than you could guess invisible hal mused but always there that thought set an alarm bell ringing in hals mind but the reason why remained irritatingly elusive for the next hour hal asked many questions about otherworld the caretaker the invasion and while he received some answers of note many were couched in riddles that left his head aching then as he sipped on his beer a twinkle of light passed quickly behind the bar hal glimpsed drogoff the barman stooping low his face puzzled but after a moment he gave a resounding cheer what is it now the devil said with irritation a hero drogoff said with arms raised our young friend is a hero we know that shadow john said superciliously while hal buried his face in his tankard drogoff proceeded to tell the entire bar how hal had saved the tiny flying woman suddenly the attention hal received was even more glowing i always knew them brothers and sisters of dragons wos a good lot mother mary said drunkenly she dabbed at one eye to save one of us and a miserable lot we are thats just she couldnt find the words and so downed another drink i didnt really do anything hal protested the mark of a true hero bearskin proclaimed more beer drogoff and dont put any water in this one the rest of the evening passed in a haze of beer fragrant pipe smoke and stories that made hals head spin some were so unbelievable that hal wondered if the pubs strange inhabitants were playing games with him the feeling of being in the middle of a dream grew more potent the longer he was there and hal felt uneasily that the longer he stayed the more dreamlike it would become until he didnt want to leave it was compounded when he attempted to check the lateness of the hour for however much he screwed up his eyes he could not make out the time on his watch he put it down to the drink but the matter niggled away at him i think its time to go he said as he drained the last of his fourth tankard of beer a disappointed outcry rose up from the increasingly large group that had gathered around him during the course of the discussions but you havent yet told us any tales of the brothers and sisters of dragons bearskin protested we never tire of those about how the giant killer set up your brotherhood in the days of the tribes someone called out the one about the tomb in the forest of the night a kiss shall awaken him i remember that part said another im sorry hal replied but i dont know any of those you dont know said shadow john incredulously but its who you are the feeling that he was betraying some great heritage made hal even keener to go im sorry perhaps another time its getting late the hour is always late mother mary said with a cackle drogoff leaned across the bar stay the night young lad weve got rooms free a quiet one if you like or one where we can send all the pleasures you would ever need he nodded towards three incredibly beautiful women leaning against a post in the middle of the pub sipping drinks the colour of absinthe from long glasses they looked quite normal until one raised a hand to wave to drogoff and hal saw a third eye embedded in the palm it winked at him some other time he said with a shudder shadow john slipped a friendly arm around hals shoulders weve enjoyed your company young lad and for your act of great compassion you may call on us any time true too true bearskin said call on any of us who drink here in the hunters moon right lads and lassies loud agreement echoed around the pub bearskin grinned showing two rows of pointed teeth stained with blood call on us if you need any help any time were always ready to help out a friend and friends like us you caint do without mother marys shrieking laugh ended in a series of hacking phlegmy coughs how do i call on you hal asked bearskin and shadow john shared a secret smile before bearskin dipped into one of his voluminous pockets and pulled out a shiny red gem that glowed with an inner light this is a bloodeye he said stick it in your pocket youll forget its there until you need it then hold it and say far and away and here and whichever of us you need will be just around the corner far and away and here hal checked to see if bearskin was joking but he seemed quite serious aye its as good as any hal said his goodbyes and slipped out into the night it was even colder than it had been earlier and the chill was exacerbated by the beer overhead petronuss glittery trail darted back and forth hal pulled his coat around him and trudged in the direction of his quarters surprised that he felt more alive than he had done in years everywhere felt so magical the dreaming city alive with wonder chapter eight finding arcadia is man an ape or an angel now i am on the side of the angels benjamin disraeli fate has a strange way of intruding into lives its possible on occasion to trace back the compounded good fortune of a welllived life to one event that if whipped away would have changed everything that came after to such a degree that the life would not have been even half as well lived perhaps it would have been quite miserable the whole edifice of wellbeing built on one random incident hunter found the capriciousness shudderinducing walk a little slower indulge yourself with a more lingering glance at something that has caught your eye and everything could be different everything could be bad the only way it became bearable was if you believed that the universe inherently looked after the living creatures that inhabited it and that the mechanics of the system would always pull towards the best possible outcome hunter liked to think that was true he had enough evidence from many of the lives around him to consider it to be so but he was never sure case in point seven years earlier a late screening of its a wonderful life at the national film theatre on the south bank in london hunter had come out of a long meeting at the mi offices at vauxhall profoundly depressed for the first time it had felt as if his life was slipping into shadow there had been the incident in bosnia one terrible act committed for the greater good and then the briefing at which he recalled reid had been a very junior but highly ambitious attendee the list of potential hotspots was followed by details of hunters next three missions no feeling human being should have been asked to undertake them but hunter had accepted them without batting an eye it was simply the path he was on and so he had wandered lost in thought he could have gone into the nearest pub to drown himself in jack daniels and then on to the brothel in battersea which had been his intention but something made him pause outside the nft with its poster of jimmy stewart and donna reed a moment later he had bought a ticket and was fumbling in the dark to find a seat the film had washed over him his thoughts too bleak to take it in but on the way out he had been following a young man with a large briefcase that had burst open spilling files all over the foyer as hunter helped collect them up his barbed small talk and louche attitude had been deflected by the young mans intense nature hunter had felt some inexplicable but profound connection with the dark troubled depths in the strangers eyes and when he discovered that they both shared a government background hunter had persuaded the man to go for a drink as was hunters style one drink had become many and by the time hunter had left his acquaintance on the doorstep vomiting the basis of a friendship had been formed the young man hal had been hunters turning point towards a life well lived it would be too glib to say that hal had reset hunters priorities but certainly in hal hunter saw some kind of redemption when the fall came hal had been ahead of the game reading the signs briefing hunter on the reemergence of the supernatural while others in the government had laughed and protested that it was some sort of disinformation campaign to camouflage a terrorist attack and when the battle of london had finally burst with devastating ferocity it was hal who had convinced hunter to leave the city to the warring gods and monsters and to the monstrous beasts that had destroyed whole sections of it with the fiery blasts of their breath most of their colleagues had died in the atrocity that had befallen parliament and whitehall and as he had stood on hampstead heath looking over the raging fires and plumes of black smoke hunter had clapped an arm around hals shoulders and proclaimed that he owed his life to hal jokingly of course but he had meant it all the same they were like two very different halves of the same person each with their own individual quirks and characteristics which when brought together made a much better whole they both knew it and they both knew they were lucky to have found a deep and abiding friendship in the small details of their lives because it was quite obvious they couldnt exist without each other heat flaring intensely giving way to excruciating pain hunters thoughts jolted out of their deep introspection into a monochrome world white snowflakes drifting dreamily down against blackness white snow all around black patches obscuring it here and there heads legs arms and blasted tree branches chunks of rock and earth his thoughts swirled desperate to get back to the cocoon of memory someone was tugging at him come you cannot stay here the voice was like shattering glass where where am i hunter was surprised to hear how weak and sluggish his voice sounded as if he was coming out of a threeday bender come pain lanced through every part of hunters body as he was lifted effortlessly it cleared his mind enough for him to realise that he was shaking with cold and shock he blacked out instantly samantha was kissing him passionately and he was feeling emotions that had not been stirred for many a year hed always liked samantha but he would never have guessed she would ever trigger those kinds of feelings he wanted to kiss her again and again but the sensation was drifting away to be replaced by more white everywhere white hunter emerged into the harshness of the world still so cold that he could barely feel his body he was in a sheltered spot that protected him on three sides from the harshest blasts of the gale before him snowblanketed hillsides rolled away into valleys more snow was falling the battle the ghostflight the shell falling memories and all their accompanying sensations rushed back with such force that he jolted against the rocky outcropping that surrounded him once again he felt that instant of horrific realisation rip through him when he had appeared back in his body just as the explosion threw him through the air how had he survived hunter quickly checked his limbs all present and intact a miracle in itself but his fatigues were shredded and covered with an inordinate amount of dried blood the pendragon spirit is already healing you hunter started at the same breakingglass tones he thought had previously come to him in a dream the voice emanated from the direction of a deep snowdrift slowly his hand searched for his gun it wasnt there nor was his knife two red circles appeared in the snow they disappeared returned and hunter realised with shock that he was looking into a pair of eyes what he had taken to be a snowdrift rose up to reveal itself as a strange creature with a crabshaped head atop the body of a man it was clad in tattered rags that blew back and forth like the trailing appendages of a jellyfish both the physical form and the clothes were so white that they merged perfectly with the surrounding snow hunter bunched his fists though he didnt have the energy to fight i am a friend the creature said hunter weighed this decided it was probably true youre the one who dragged me off the battlefield i was walking the hillsides in my search when i saw you blazing like a blue star but your fire was dying i was freezing to death yes this world has grown very cold and your injuries were grave hunter checked his limbs again puzzled just scratches now but not earlier i brought you to shelter so that the pendragon spirit would have time to heal you right i grew myself some new limbs i always knew that skill would come in handy one day hunters mind was already racing ahead he had to get back to debrief all the information he had garnered about the enemy would be vital what are you he asked obliquely i am moyaanisqui sometimes called the white walker i search for the cailleach bheur she has unleashed the fimbulwinter in anticipation of the endtimes she is near have you seen her i have no idea what youre talking about thanks for saving me and all and not that im ungrateful but i need to get out of here hunter could feel his strength returning with each passing moment it felt like a trickle of electricity bringing life to his limbs and his thought processes there was something so clearly unnatural about the sensation that he paused to reflect once more on what had happened what did you just say the pendragon spirit the blue fire it burns within you hunter examined his hands a scratch he had seen moments before had now disappeared whats happened to me i met one of your kind in recent times the white walker said in the far lands but she had ice inside her where in you the fire burns clearly what do you mean one of my kind a human the far lands is that the otherworld his mind raced even faster yes a fragile creature she was the first of your kind i had met but she was not like the others with her she was special like you in the deep caverns of hunters subconscious something stirred the information the white walker was imparting was something he already knew instinctively although he had no idea how since my encounter with her i have learned more of your kind the white walker continued brothers and sisters of dragons you are one of the five blue sparks flared in hunters mind and for a second he thought he might black out again impossible he thought coincidence and a score more denials but he knew it was true suddenly the world looked a different place his whole life turned on its head he needed time to think about what it all meant glancing rapidly around he searched the bleak hillsides all roads had been obscured there was no sign of life can you help me to get out of here he asked i need to find the cailleach bheur the white walker said hesitantly hunter struggled to pull himself up the rocks to his feet he wouldnt be able to get far in his current condition the white walker reached forward with fingers that resembled hoarfrosted icicles and grabbed hunters hand the touch was so cold that hunter felt it sink deep into his bones come then the white walker said i will take you for how could i refuse such a source of wonder hunter found himself lifted effortlessly on to the white walkers back flickers of frost crusted hunters eyelashes the cold infused every part of his body until it seemed as though the whole world had turned white the white walker set off down the slope with a fast loping gait the scottish countryside fell by in a blur hunter clung on as tightly as he could with fingers he couldnt feel yet inside mysteriously his soul had started to soar they hadnt gone far when hunter saw a figure standing on a hilltop nearby it was indistinct at first but gradually hunter made out an old woman with wild hair like a black crow hunched over against the wind clinging on to a tall staff for support lightning danced around her so that it seemed as if she was at the heart of a storm that is the cailleach bheur known by some as the blue hag the white walker called above the wind the one i seek i will return to beg her to stop the fimbulwinter in that instant the cryptic comments the white walker had made earlier fell into place shes causing this weather hunter noted aloud and its not going to stop is it not until all the worlds are white and the only ones left are the cailleach bheur and me as existence falls into the dark the winter shall go on for ever hunter closed his eyes against the knives of the wind and clung on tightly urging the miles to fall away quickly events were turning bad faster than anyone had realised it was here hal stressed when he saw the condescendingly weary expression on mannings face she wore a long fur coat with a muffler and a tall fur hat like some russian aristocrat out of doctor zhivago hal had watched her warily since the night he had seen her talking to an invisible companion but since then she had exhibited no other unusual behaviour in the background four bag carriers and advisors in suits shifted uncomfortably in the biting cold mister kirkham reid stamped his feet as he indicated the bare brick wall on the side street where hal had said the hunters moon had been situated reid at least had taken hal seriously when hal had turned up at his office at am he had quickly arranged for a visit to the site kirkham examined the wall carefully he had an ultrasound probe a geiger counter and an emf monitor which he proceeded to set up in the thick snow that had been falling all morning i have to say in all our research weve never come across any buildings translocating or the appearance of any clear portals to the otherworld through which a mortal could travel he said doesnt mean it cant happen reid said bloody hell in this world right now anything can happen he clapped hands clad in expensive leather gloves when is this weather going to turn i swear its even colder than yesterday one degree lower according to the latest figures kirkham muttered as he examined a swinging needle on a display we cant stay here too long manning said checking her watch you havent forgotten the emergency cabinet session how could i reid snapped but after what happened up north any information we find here could be even more essential hal sensed a tension between reid and manning that had escalated since the last time he had seen the two of them together since he had joined the civil service hal had been aware of politicians jockeying for power and influence something that had if anything grown more intense since the fall but there was an added dimension to reid and mannings rivalry that he couldnt fathom i cant find anything kirkham said we could always put this position under surveillance in case it reappears or in case this young man gets drunk again and hallucinates another experience manning added tartly she turned on her heels and marched back in the direction of the main thoroughfare with the four assistants slipping and sliding to keep up while kirkham packed up his equipment reid said quietly to hal ignore her probably her period look i think this is vitally important information and i think you should take it to the highest level me the pm needs to know about this and it should come from the horses mouth not be buried in the middle of some report that he only has ten seconds to read or from some lackey he probably doesnt trust anyway this could be a turning point hal was taken aback the chain of command had always kept him well away from any minister not directly involved in his particular sphere and certainly never allowed him near the pm but reid appeared sincere whatever had happened in scotland clearly had everyone rattled how do i go about getting an appointment hal said leave that to me ill find a slot in his diary difficult at the moment with the war on of course but the sooner we can get you in there the better as kirkham finished packing up reid leaned in to hal and said even more quietly just keep this to yourself everyones plotting at the moment and i dont know who i can trust he searched hals face i think i can trust you is that right of course hal replied reid nodded curtly then strode away before kirkham noticed his interaction with hal hal was concerned by the spys parting words why didnt reid know who to trust surely everyone was pulling together with the crisis looming as hal trudged back towards magdalen he had an uneasy sensation of movement behind the scenes and threads being drawn closer together hal found samantha on his office doorstep her face unnaturally pale can i come in she asked with urgency sorry about the mess hal began motioning to the desk where piles of files had been stacked two feet high he had never been so behind with his work before have you heard the news she said breathlessly ninety per cent of our force was wiped out in scotland hunter samantha chewed her lip hes listed amongst the missing hal felt sick but he put on a brave face you know what hunters like hit him in the face with a hammer and hell keep coming back for more anyone who can survive the freedrink weekend at mrs damasks isnt going to fold up at the first opportunity when hal saw that nothing he could say would ease samanthas worries he said do you want a coffee ive got some stashed away for special occasions thats like gold dust samantha said and isnt it on the protected substances list youre supposed to hand in any supplies so some minister can have it for their personal stash hal caught himself listen to me i sound like hunter from the back of his top drawer hal pulled out a tiny jar wrapped in masking tape so that the contents couldnt be seen he shook out a few precious brown grains into a couple of mugs topped them up with water from the kettle suspended over the fire and handed one steaming mug to samantha thanks she said im glad youre here hal youve been a real friend to me its hard to find anyone in this place i can really talk to friend the compliment stung as much as if shed slapped him you know i never thought you really cared for him hal said neither did i until i realised i did about five minutes before he flew off hes a loudmouth a bighead a slut whos probably crawling with god knows how many sexual diseases and a drunk theres absolutely no reason why i should like him hal laughed quietly i know exactly what you mean we have nothing in common at all whenever i go out drinking with him im unconscious halfway through the night without fail he always gets me home though but theres something about him i just cant put my finger on it hes a good man once you get past the front hes got morals ethics hard to believe when you consider what he does i think he hates himself a bit which is sad hes complicated there are two hunters one you see and one you only catch glimpses of do you know what made me think he might be all right samantha warmed her hands on the coffee mug that youre his friend and i think youd only be friends with someone who was worthy thats a funny word hal stared deep into her eyes which were green like a cats immeasurably deep hes lucky hes got you in his corner youll make a good couple hal said and meant it samantha luxuriated in the taste of her coffee then she said do you know what one of the pas said to me the other day with all the strange stuff in the world today all the magic and the gods and the wonders were now living in a world where wishes could come true so tell me hal if you could wish for anything what would it be he thought for a moment and then replied nothing ive got everything i need you know i think i believe you youre so calm so centred and youd wish for hunter to be back here right now i think i probably would i want a chance to see if it could work you know she took a deep breath and to hal it sounded immeasurably sad though i might also wish for some music i miss the radio new songs old songs all right hal said the best old song wichita lineman glen campbell no argument do you know it samantha wrinkled her nose sounds like something my mum would like theres a line in it that goes and i need you more than want you and i want you for all time i dont think theres a better way of describing love anywhere she giggled youre such an old romantic yes he said with a smile i am in his cell mallory brooded and planned and waited for his moment he still couldnt bring himself to think of sophies name or what had happened to her every thought he had was channelled towards his escape hed tested his manacles and they were as effective as they should be in a highsecurity wing the guards always came around in twos with his food one training an sa on him but mallory knew he had two things to his advantage since sophies death he really didnt care if he lived or died and he knew his abilities and in particular the abilities of the pendragon spirit better than his captors did the training he had undergone at salisbury cathedral to become a knight templar had also pushed him to the upper limits of physical and mental fitness focusing the mind preparing for extreme hardship were now embedded in his system he had hated his time in the brutal regime but it had taught him to be a survivor all told he was ready and so when the guards came with his lunch mallory gathered himself bring it over here he said nodding to the tray with the plate of what appeared to be vegetable stew on it get lost the guard with the gun waved the barrel at him mallory knew the guards hated him they didnt know why they did but the fact that he was imprisoned along with all the other dangerous freaks in the highsecurity wing damned him by association ive had enough of all this the way you treat me i deserve better boo hoo the one with the tray mocked mallory took a step forward oi the one with the gun grew tense thrusting the weapon more menacingly back no mallory said ive reached my limit im not going to rot in this hole id rather die mallory continued to walk towards them the guards backed away a sliver of panic driving the contempt out of their eyes the one with the tray put it down and thumbed his radio section fourteen to base incident at btwentynine prisoner unruly send backup it wont do any good mallory said i can kill with my bare hands ive been trained back off the one with the gun shouted i will fire better do it mallory said because youre going to be dead in five seconds mallory rushed the guard without another warning acting on instinct the guard fired a short burst the rounds tore through mallory flinging him back against the wall hard slipping down to the floor in shock he watched his blood puddling around him there was pain and then numbness as the dark crept up on him the last thing he heard was one of the guards saying you fucking idiot youve killed him after samantha had cheered up a little she returned to her office leaving hal steeling himself to venture out into the cold he fought his way through drifts that built up as quickly as the street workers cleared the snow away and eventually reached the bodleian library its vast resource of books amassed over four centuries was one of the main reasons that oxford had been chosen for the new seat of government after the destruction of central london and the waste laid to much of the countrys infrastructure the fragility of humanity its knowledge and traditions was belatedly acknowledged the bodleian contained everything of value that the human race had ever achieved condensed into racks and shelves the holy grail of civilisation it was going to be protected at all costs hal went to the old library and entered the lower reading room he expected several hours of shivering at a table while the librarian brought the necessary tomes to him but it was as warm as a hothouse inside best place to be the chief librarian said from his seat behind the main enquiry desk weve got protected status so we can have as much fuel as we want for the heating system he appeared oblivious to everything else that was going on beyond his cloistered world he had a mound of snowy white hair and thick glasses that made his eyes appear unfeasibly large despite the heat he wore a heavy jumper with brash multicoloured hoops hal took a seat in the general reference and enquiry area where he could occasionally steal glimpses at the snow drifting down outside it also allowed easy access to the lower reserve to pick up the books dropped off by the librarian he was in for the long haul he had a vague idea of what he was looking for but it would take him a while to pinpoint it exactly hal was now sure that the strange blue hologramimage that emerged from the wish stone reflected a painting that much had emerged from the depths of hals memory but which painting and what it might mean eluded him completely he spent the next two hours wading randomly through art books before admitting to himself that he wasnt getting anywhere his methodical mind was exasperated by his methods but his basic information was too limited to begin any structured search the computer system was up and running one of the first non government systems to have been restored after the fall but even a scan of the olis online catalogue didnt give him any guidance as he sat and stared out of the window for inspiration his fingers found a strange object in his pocket he pulled it out and was surprised to see the bloodeye that bearskin had given him in the hunters moon the previous evening as bearskin had told him hal hadnt remembered he had it or he would undoubtedly have shown it to reid he thought for a moment and then held the jewel in the palm of his hand and whispered far and away and here hal didnt know what hed been expecting some flash of light or burst of coloured smoke perhaps but there was nothing irritated that he had allowed himself to be made a fool of he slipped the stone back into his pocket yet a few seconds later there was an overpowering smell of wet fur hal looked around to see if a dog had found its way into the library and was greeted by a low rasping laugh that sounded very much like an old mans unsettling with a hint of malignancy goose pimples rose up on hals arms hal looked around again and then almost fell backwards off his chair in shock when his gaze returned to his desk which had been empty a split second earlier a tiny misshapen man now sat there rolling his eyes at hal naked his wrinkled leathery skin was greygreen his ears pointed his teeth an unnerving row of needles and his fingers ended in broken but lethallooking talons cat got your tongue the little man said nastily youre here because i called you hal said hesitantly we all answer the bloodeye a friend in need is always to be answered though ive never seen a friend like you he bared his teeth at hal whats your name i have many names some ill answer to and some i wont and one is secret never to be told but you can call me maucus will you answer to that one well see wont we hal was unnerved by the little mans attitude and wondered if he might be better off and safer if he sent maucus away the little man appeared to read hals mind for he said you have nothing to fear when the bloodeye has called but do not come across me at other times for then i may not be so generous feeling a little more confident hal asked what are you my kind live in the book stores and libraries we drink the smell of paper and eat the joy of people who find a piece of information or a story they desire sometimes well hide books usually at the point when the one wanting them is reaching the end of a long laborious search just for fun were always there but your kind never sees us hiding on top of the stacks or behind the shelves you think were rats or mice or birds on the roof i want no maucus jumped forward so threateningly that hal rocked back on his chair dont tell me words that arent written down could be lies they disappear people forget what they said how can i tell you then give me your hand hal hesitated then extended his right hand palm upwards maucus gripped it with a strength belied by his size hal tried to wrench it back but couldnt maucus bared one of his talons and slashed a thin red line across hals hand as hal cried out in pain the little man smiled sadistically then bent forward and lapped hals blood hal was sickened by the sight but it only lasted a second before maucus bounded off into the shadowy depths of the library a few minutes later he returned with a book which he dropped on the desk it fell open at a picture of the same scene projected by the wish stone it was a romantic painting of three men dressed in what looked like togas crouched around a stone tomb a woman in luscious orange and blue robes looked on the men were pointing at an inscription on the tomb et in arcadia ego the scene was set in some idyllic rural setting on a hillside with trees against goldtinted clouds passing across a brilliant blue sky the light suggested twilight or perhaps dawn hal read the inscription underneath les bergers darcadie the shepherds of arcadia by nicolas poussin musee du louvre paris hal knew his latin the inscription translated literally as and in arcadia i or i am in arcadia too but hal had no idea what it meant more puzzling was why a seventeenthcentury painting should be revealed by a magic stone that must have been hundreds if not thousands of years older if it truly had been buried under cadbury hill clearly the picture must be very significant indeed for a unique and powerful object like the wish stone to have preserved its image but its meaning escaped him as hal examined the painting more closely he noticed that something wasnt quite right the picture is back to front he mused or the image is the stone shows the woman on the left the painting has her on the right and everything else is reversed as well the image doesnt show the whole of the painting either its cropped very closely around the characters ah but theres the mystery maucus said do i have to do everything for you yes please hal said tartly emboldened maucus glowered coldly and hal wondered if he had gone too far but then the little man disappeared into the library once more returning a few minutes later with a book about shugborough hall a stately home in staffordshire on the estate of the royal photographer lord lichfield once again the book fell open at the correct page only this time it revealed a photo of the reversed wish stone image of the shepherds but this was no painting the photograph showed a carved stone relief known as the shepherds monument that stood in the halls ninehundredacre grounds hal read that the monument and a mysterious inscription carved beneath it ouosvavv and underneath a d and an m had been a mystery for more than years charles darwin had been observed mulling over its meaning and josiah wedgwood had spent many hours trying to crack the code some believed that it held the secret of the whereabouts of the holy grail others that it was a memorial to a lost love of thomas anson who had created the estate in the eighteenth century there is a mystery here maucus said once again as if he could read hals mind but is it buried deep or does it lie on the surface where only one with the right vision may see it hal felt a surge of excitement at the puzzle that had been presented to him here was a conundrum in which he could immerse himself more he was sure it was something where he could finally make a valuable contribution the hint of longburied secrets made him feverish hidden knowledge dark wisdom the mystery hinted at both i need more information he said enough maucus spat if its slaves you need then look amongst your own kind do not insult me by demanding too much rather give thanks for the aid i have offered i do thank you hal said wary that maucus was on the brink of attacking very much but where do i go from here tread your own path coz you have had enough from me maucus disappeared so quickly it was as if the little man had decided he would simply no longer be seen yet his odour remained for a long while after and hal had the uneasy feeling that his former helper was still watching from some hidden vantage point weighing up whether or not he should teach hal a very unpleasant lesson it worried hal sufficiently that he packed up his books and dropped them off at the enquiry desk answering the librarians questions about his progress with a blank smile before hurrying out into the bitter day the mood after the cabinet meeting was desolate the general attempted to hold his head high as he marched out of the darkened room towards the ministry of defence offices but once inside he was crushed by the absolute devastation of his plans there was nothing good to report there was no hope that he could see hed attempted to put an optimistic spin on the debriefing but everyone had seen through it the pm had asked about the deployment of battlefield nukes and the fact that even the leader was considering such extreme action on british soil showed that they were approaching the last act general he turned to see manning who for once had not said a single word during the meeting catherine i notice you left a few details out of your report how long before the enemy reach oxford i omitted that strand because to consider it would be an admission of failure we will stop the enemy long before they reach oxford mannings dismissive shrug made the general burn inside but he maintained his surface calm battlefield nuclear weapons how many are you planning to use she asked how many have we stockpiled you suggested that there appears to be a nearendless supply of the enemy all flooding over from the otherworld i presume logically i dont concern myself with theoretical arguments there are several tactical options we havent begun to try how long general the general cursed under his breath realising why he disliked the woman so much we cant estimate anything at the moment the enemys advance has come to a halt just south of berwick we dont know how long theyre going to stay there or why but you have an idea the general chose his words carefully intelligence suggests that the enemy is eliminating any potential opposition so theyre eradicating the population as they advance pausing cleansing an area moving on berwick has fallen the general nodded we cant rely on conventional means general we have to put our faith in other measures no option has been ruled out catherine the general was distracted by a young assistant from his offices who was trailing snow behind him as he ran towards them general sir the young man said breathlessly as he skidded to a halt theres been a survivor sir from the rout in scotland hes on his way in by chopper now the general turned back to manning i have to go consider what i said general but the general was already doing his best to forget her and all politicians as he followed the assistant back to the ministry of defence offices all he needed was one break a single flaw in the enemys defence and he would strike back with maximum force if the survivor had any new intelligence he would seize it forcefully and then he would show manning and all the others exactly what he stood for hunter was in much better shape by the time the chopper touched down in the deer park his amazement at the healing ability of the pendragon spirit had been superseded by a long period of intense reflection on what it meant for him to have been chosen to receive such a power in one instant he had been forced to look at himself and his place in the world in a different light no longer could he pretend that he was just a foot soldier drifting from mission to mission he now had a purpose and an obligation if only he could decide what they were the general met him as he climbed down from the chopper i should have known youd be back yes sir and thank you for your good wishes the general allowed hunter some latitude as he always did but hunter knew he couldnt push his superior too far this time i hope youve come back with some useful information the general said i believe so sir well head straight to debriefing your men all dead hunters stomach twisted at the loss of those under his command the hardest to accept was clevis his uncomprehending face at the moment of his death was burned into hunters mind you look remarkably hale and hearty not even a scratch i have very thick skin by the time they reached the debriefing room where most of the top brass had already congregated hunter had decided what information he was going to reveal and what he was going to hold back he described in unflinching detail how the enemy took over the fallen and added them to its ranks and he watched as faces grew steely when he described the king of insects and the four lords leading the attack his account of what was really causing the arctic weather only added to the dark mood in the room but there was some talk of a potential ally when he told how the white walker had helped him to the nearest outpost where he had rested while he made radio contact and waited to be picked up but of the pendragon spirit and his role as brother of dragons he said not a word after the general had given hunter a days leave to recuperate hunter slipped quickly away and sought out hal who seemed to have transformed his office into an art gallery hunter cast his eye over the large and small copies of the same painting and said its a bit late in the day to pretend you have some culture hal smiled warmly i was starting to get worried i thought id trained you better than that hal suddenly came alive in a manner hunter hadnt seen before ive got something to tell you he said motioning to the pictures pinned all over the walls im investigating an artefact that brother of dragons brought back from cadbury hill hunter perked up at this go on it links to this painting and then to a monument at some stately home called shugborough hall i dont know what it all means yet but im sure its important he paused unable to restrain a grin more than important right hunter thought intensely for a moment youve got to keep me up to speed about that but dont tell anyone else before you tell me why weve discussed this i know best hunter replied hal shook his head wearily that brother of dragons mallory hes still around theyve not carted him off to some arseend of the country for interrogation he was shot hunter grew grave dead they thought so at first last i heard he was in surgery in the highsecurity section theyre fighting to save his life bloody hell they couldnt even take him out of security when hes at deaths door they must be scared of him whats all this about hal said with exasperation did you bang your head while you were out playing soldiers ive got something to tell you but you have to swear you wont tell anyone of course nothing would induce me to pass on the contents of your sleazy mind im serious ok you might not believe this in fact i can guarantee you wont im a brother of dragons the blood drained from hals face so rapidly that hunter was concerned for his friends health its not the end of the world mate youd better sit down the way i see it its a good thing hal listened while hunter related all he had learned from the white walker so ive got this power in me called the pendragon spirit he said finally if you could have seen how i healed bloody hell i looked like id been tossed around an abattoir after the battle now im back to my fantastically attractive former self what else does it do hunter was concerned at the intensity he saw in hal his friend looked as if he was close to desperation i havent worked that out yet but i reckon theres some kind of bond between the five i know i felt something when i met mallory like we had a lot in common as if id known him for years i need to talk to him again decide what to do youre not going to report this what and have them lock me up like him no chance the bottom line is everybody reckons the brothers and sisters of dragons are the last hope weve got for surviving this nightmare and having seen what happened in scotland i havent got any faith in the conventional forces ability to hold the line i have to do something what can you possibly do whatever this pendragon spirit is it doesnt make you some kind of superhero you go up against the enemy and youll be dead in a minute hals voice was filled with tension i dont know what i can do but i do know ive got a responsibility to do something hunter watched hals face fall and added dont worry im not going to go on some suicide mission i need to find the rest of the five but one of thems already dead you know that yeah but ive got a plan hunter gave a theatrical smile but when hal didnt respond hunter said whats wrong hal thought for a moment then said im scared dont be im going to do my damnedest to find a way out of this and now i feel as if ive got some kind of chance theres a reason i am what i am if it was all hopeless there wouldnt be brothers and sisters of dragons would there before hal could answer samantha burst in i heard you were back her smile said more than her words there was an awkward moment between the two of them hal pretended to shuffle through some papers on his desk until hunter said so do you fancy a quick one hunter saw hal flinch at the inappropriateness of the comment while the warmth drained quickly from samanthas face you really are a disgusting pig i just came to welcome you back and now that ive done it im going even after samantha had departed her frostiness still hung in the air hal said with exasperation why do you do that do what you know hunter act like a moron its my nature hunter was not oblivious to the offence he had caused in fact he had chosen his words carefully playing a part that would not raise any suspicion it also had the effect of keeping samantha at arms length hunter knew very clearly what was to come and suspected the eventual outcome and it seemed uncommonly cruel to let samantha think he might be coming back to her no fairytale romance for him things are going to change very quickly and i need you to watch my back hunter said change how i dont like change i know every file in its place but if we dont shake things up quickly theres not going to be any files left to file all right hal said hesitantly what do you want me to do i might have to go awol for a while youre mad theyll have you shot only if they catch me i want you to keep your ear to the ground if they start getting a lead on me while im away do whatever you can to muddy the tracks i know its dangerous of course ill do it you shouldnt have to ask but where are you going i dont know yet i dont know if i stand a chance of finding what im looking for better men than me have failed i might be going on a fools errand but i have to try it feels like duty hal dipped into a drawer and pulled out the file of notes samantha had passed on to him whats that hunter asked everything we know about the brothers and sisters of dragons might be some use youd better thank samantha for it the next time you see her she did the dangerous work hunter felt a critical mass building soon events would be running away from him and he would have to use everything in his power to keep up he worried about compromising hals position the government would not flinch from taking harsh action if it saw disloyalty or treason but he was convinced that hal had the strength of character to see it through even though he knew his friend didnt recognise that strength in himself hunter and hal shuffled around each other awkwardly before hunter clapped his friend on the shoulder the gesture didnt begin to match their strength of feeling but they knew each other well enough to comprehend all that was unspoken look after yourself hunter said and then he slipped out of the door and with a wink he was gone mallory came to consciousness in the room set aside as an intensive care unit he was numb from the drugs and strung out from the pain of his wounds and the operation but still the haunting death image played with his mind fire in the dark it might have been the drugs or his nearness to death but now he knew what it was a gunshot to the head suicide but if hed killed himself how could he still be there with an effort he thought through this cloying barrier to the surprising realisation that his plan had worked deep inside him the pendragon spirit was doing its work knitting flesh repairing organs when he had forced the guards to shoot him mallory hadnt known if his injuries would be beyond his healing ability he had long been aware that minor cuts and bruises faded fast that he fought off colds and viruses easily that exhaustion came much later than it would to anyone else but could major organ damage be repaired and could it happen quickly enough for him to see his plan through as he sat up pulling off wires to the monitors and removing a drip he was forced to acknowledge how bad he felt but he still had more strength than he should have in the circumstances though the next few hours would probably be agony with the prospect of causing himself even more serious harm he felt he probably had enough strength to see it through his vision washed back and forth drunkenly shakily he lowered his legs to the floor convinced theyd buckle under him after a few seconds rest he managed to stand up but then some stitches pulled on his abdomen and warm blood seeped into the bandages bound tightly around his middle yet the more he moved the more strength flowed into his limbs as if the act of fighting made the pendragon spirit come alive with an effort of will mallory forced his pain into the background and proceeded slowly to the door the corridor was empty but mallory knew it wouldnt be long before he encountered some resistance his footsteps echoed softly along the starkly lit passage but as he rounded a bend he noticed something curious the lights had grown dimmer with a shiver he realised that the temperature had also dropped several degrees and that he could now see his breath he advanced uneasily for there was no obvious explanation for the changes peering around the next corner mallory saw a lone guard standing outside a door white with hoarfrost it was from here that the cold was emanating and in the vicinity of the door there was a deep suffocating gloom the guard wore arctic fatigues thick gloves and boots a parka with the hood up and a scarf wrapped across his mouth from the measured rise and fall of his chest mallory could tell he was either asleep or close to it mallory weighed his options it was a long way back to attempt to find another route out but the chances of any path being free of resistance was slim yet he knew he still wasnt up to any handtohand fighting even if he could get close enough to commence it before he could make his decision he was grabbed from behind and pulled back up the corridor a hand clamped across his mouth to prevent him from making any noise then hunter stood before him one finger pressed to his lips mallory couldnt understand why hunter hadnt raised the alarm but he didnt have the strength to resist hunter pulled him through an open door and into a darkened empty cell what do you think youre doing hunter said in an attempt at mockery though he was clearly impressed youre dead on your feet and youre about to take on the british army come closer ill show you what dead means big talk but now that weve got the macho posturing out of the way we need to discuss something of importance i dont want to talk to you youll talk to me because you and i are cut from the same cloth mallory instantly saw in hunters eyes the unimpeachable truth of that statement that single moment of contact between the two men ran so deep that it changed both of them for ever what do you mean im a brother of dragons no mallory knew his denial was a lie the instant the word left his lips a veil had been lifted and he could suddenly see hunter as he truly was it was all there mallory could almost feel the pendragon spirit radiating out of hunter like a dull heat sorry hunter said looks like they let anybody in the club after his exertions mallory suddenly felt profoundly weak and had to lower himself into a chair i know it sounds like a coincidence there arent any coincidences mallory took a deep breath to steady himself the pendragon spirit the blue fire call it what you will it runs through everything its the structure behind the surface of the universe it arranges things so it made sure i was in the right place at the right time or wrong time depending on which way you look at it and it brought us together it puts the pieces on the board but it doesnt play the game thats down to us mallory cursed under his breath i cant believe its you i know theres a certain irony its more than that you killed one of us not directly but you brought it about and now i cant even get my revenge by killing you mallory caught himself theres no point talking about that now his shivering helped him change the subject whats up with that room with all the frost on the door its one of the prisoners theyve brought in recently some say its one of the gods one of the tuatha de danann i cant see that myself they couldnt even hold you how can they keep a god prisoner hunter noticed the bloody bandages around mallorys midriff youre bleeding ill heal i just need some time to rest are you up to getting out of here that was the general plan ive got another one mallory looked at hunter intrigued despite himself since youve been in here weve been invaded the brothers and sisters of dragons are the last chance we have of stopping the complete destruction of life on this planet but from what i hear its going to take five of us or the magic the power doesnt work thats the rumour were one down already hunter continued and we dont know who the other two are carry on youre not making me depressed at all hunter paced the room while he talked despite himself mallory was developing a grudging admiration for his new associate hunter continued but were not the first five the way i understand it mallory said throughout history for god knows how many centuries theres always been five when one lot completes whatever mission theyve been chosen for the power moves on to the next five hunter turned sharply hed reached the crux of his plan but does the power leave them completely when it moves on or do the old five just go into retirement ive no idea what are you getting at there were five brothers and sisters of dragons who fought at the fall everyone knows the story theyve become part of modern mythology theyre the reason the government expended so much energy looking for you mallory made a dismissive gesture so two of them died jack churchill the leader and ryan veitch the one whos supposed to have betrayed them at least thats how the stories go these days you cant tell whats truth and whats been made up hunter smiled like a cat two of them are dead three are still alive and were going to find them chapter nine four journeys we hear war called murder it is not it is suicide ramsay macdonald sophie watched caitlin stride out along the battlements in the predawn dark thunder and lightning given flesh though the gods lined the ramparts goldenskinned and beautiful tall and powerful caitlin was above them god and mortal combined greater than the sum of the parts as she passed a ripple ran through the gods in their shining armour eyes turned her way body language shifted whispers passed from mouths to ears how long is this going to last thackerays eyes were deep pools of concern until she gets back what she feels shes lost sophie said then lets hope she gets it back quickly harvey hovered uncomfortably behind his friend she scares me when you look in her face its like she could do anything but theres something about her thats a bit horny too thackeray glared at harvey who shifted awkwardly sorry just stating a fact do you think shes done the right thing thackeray asked sophie sophie could see that he felt he was losing the woman he loved at a time when she hadnt even decided if she loved him back what could she say no this is the worst decision shes ever made the morrigan will eat her up and spit her out nothing human can hope to contain the morrigans ravenous desires and epic emotions caitlins strong if anybody can do this she can she said and it was true sophie wondered if she could match caitlins drive to sacrifice anything for the common good she thought of mallory could she sacrifice him but whenever his face came up in her mind now it was misty and a weight of uncertainty hung around it the price she had paid to math was proving bigger with each passing day she missed mallory deeply and loved him immensely but increasingly it felt as if she was experiencing those emotions secondhand as caitlin returned from her walk along the battlements it felt as though an enormous battery was drawing near to them so charged was the air in her presence she was now dressed in the colours of her mistress a scarlet silk shirt was a blaze of bloody colour against the black of her trousers and boots the leather weapons belts that crossed over her chest and hung at her hips the black leather gauntlets her hair hung loose and that too appeared to have turned almost black but it was her eyes that struck everyone the most they now appeared to be almost all pupil as if two black holes led into the depths of her head theyre going to attack later no mistake it was caitlins voice but it was laced with a frostiness that made them all shiver sophie peered over the battlements into the sea of shadows that washed away across the plain from the walls in it numerous bonfires burned as far as the eye could see it gave the illusion of stars blazing in the inky night sky how many of them are there harvey asked fearfully so many that were never going to get out of here again thackeray replied with a quiet desolation sophie had seen the extent of the army the previous evening just before the sun had set thousands of little people dark and hairy like rats swarming over one another in anticipation of the feast ahead it was impossible to believe they had once been like the stately gods of the court of souls ease before their base desires had devolved them amongst them were huge weapons many of which sophie didnt recognise others resembled medieval siege machines though on a grander scale they had been brought from their own former courts or looted from the courts that had fallen before them this is all so pointless sophie said with frustration theyre fighting over the evolution of humanity meanwhile were getting wiped out by something they could help us defeat this is our destiny lugh had walked up silently behind them we must decide the future of our own kind before we turn to yours thackeray leaned on the ramparts to peer at the massed ranks i think its already been decided dont you youre still sure theyre going to attack today sophie asked lugh they have the weapons they need they have the forces there is no reason for them to wait any longer and if the court of souls ease falls our remaining allies will swiftly follow perhaps even the court of the final word sophie conjured up an image of dian cecht in his scarlet robes and his mysterious words to her in a dream the next time you see me you shall not see me why didnt dian cecht come here she asked surely its safer as always he has his own business to unfold great things take place in the court of the final word greater than you or i could ever imagine and it is said that dian cecht now undertakes the greatest work of all sophie was impressed by lughs nobility in the face of what many in the court secretly considered an impending disaster she turned back to the enemy and listened to the slow beat of drums that had risen up in their midst you have the resources to repel them we have a formidable armoury and we have her lugh nodded towards caitlin before walking away to inspect his troops thackeray approached caitlin hesitantly how are you he asked as though talking to a stranger i am the nightmare caitlin replied dreamily looking past him towards the starsprinkled sky she is the rider i am the horse and we bring with us the dark a jolt ran through her and she turned to sophie thackeray and harvey you dont have to worry about me im still the person you know but now i feel as if ive got electricity ripping through my veins i can see further than i ever could before in the tiniest detail i think i could run for ever without taking a break its like being some kind of superhuman there was a gleam in caitlins eyes that made sophie uneasy theres got to be some other way back to our own world aside from getting involved in this fight she said if there is i dont know it caitlin said there are only certain places where its easy to cross over and theres no such place in this court fighting our way out is the best chance we have thackeray gave voice to the fatalism they all felt fighting our way past that lot thats no chance at all caitlin was dismissive of his tone we have to do what we can she returned to the battlements in a manner that suggested they were all irrelevant i tell you shes going to go psycho harvey said shell turn on us next she wont thackeray said defiantly sophie wasnt so sure everything she had heard about the morrigan warned that the goddess was unpredictable her rhythms chaotic her agenda her own cant you do something thackeray said to her desperately get us out of this madhouse youve got all these wacky powers the shits going to hit the fan later and id rather not be around when it does he paused then added and i dont want caitlin here either i dont know what i can do this is a different landscape with different rules thackeray looked at her with such fierce hope in his eyes that she couldnt turn away ill find something she said moving away quickly before they saw her confident smile fade the winding streets were ablaze with lanterns and candles in the earlymorning darkness as sophie hurried over the cobbles asking every passerby if they had seen ceridwen eventually she was directed to a large white building resembling a mosque with minarets and slit windows inside lilting music played quietly in stark contrast to the mood at the walls the serenity inside was so potent that sophie calmed quickly a hallway led into a maze of rooms all of them filled with vegetation tall sharpleafed plants in huge round pots others in beds set into the floor itself clematis and ivy entwined around pillars hanging like cobwebs overhead a path wound amongst the plants with a celtic spiral pattern in mosaic swirling along its centre sophie followed it until she came to a vast hall filled with oaks that had pushed up through the stone flags to fill the roof space with their canopy everywhere paper lanterns hung from the branches so that it appeared as if the upper reaches were alive with fireflies with the music and the incense and the lights there was an atmosphere of subtle magics sophie felt at home somewhere nearby a mellifluous voice was singing ceridwen sophie called out the singing stopped above your head good sister sophie looked up to see ceridwen reclining on a platform in the branches with lanterns hung all around its edge so that she was bathed in light ceridwen motioned for sophie to climb a rope ladder to join her the platform was covered with sumptuous cushions on which ceridwen lay occasionally sucking on a bubbling hookah has the battle started sister of dragons ceridwen asked lazily not yet but theyll be at it soon shouldnt you be there there is nothing i can do my world is green and living not dead and bloodstained that place belongs to your new companion my dark sister she was plainly concerned about caitlins bond with the morrigan sophie sat on one of the cushions as the dreamy atmosphere closed around her youve helped me a great deal so far but i need your help again ceridwen nodded slowly her eyes huge and dark we have to find a way back to our world were needed there you know there are no doorways to the fixed lands in the court of souls ease sister i know but is there another way is there anything i can do as ceridwen silently read sophies face sophie knew there was something she waited patiently while ceridwen sucked on the hookah again finally the goddess said you have great power sister of dragons and even you do not know the extent of it you can manipulate the spiritenergy as well as your predecessor though you have yet to learn to control it use your craft let the blue fire burn through you and it may yet show you a way home how do i do that ritual sister unleash the serpentenergy let it rise up through you you know how and sophie did and she knew what a terrible thing she would have to do to achieve it there is a place between the far lands and the fixed lands ceridwen continued a watchtower from which all of existence can be viewed all can be reached it was a haven for some of my kind in times past a place where we could not be seen by hungry eyes let the blue fire light your path to the watchtower and then seek your way home but there will be dangers other things have taken refuge in the watchtower in these troubled times and they may resent your presence thank you sophie said she made her way to the rope ladder but as she put her foot on the first rung ceridwen said you must beware sister not all dangers will come from expected quarters as sophie climbed down into the shadows she knew exactly what ceridwens warning meant and she feared what was to come i think youve got a suicidal streak hunter led the way down a darkened corridor in the heart of queens college theyd made their way there after slipping out of the brasenoselincoln underground complex behind him mallory paused regularly to gather his strength after escaping a highsecurity cell most people would have been jumping the last train to freeville im not most people mallory was wearing a thick parka with the hood pulled up to obscure his identity hunter had lifted it from a cloakroom one of the guards would be going home cold its a sword they went out with chastity belts and pigs bladders covered with bells its not just any sword what its got a builtin ipod mallory steadied himself against the wall dont you ever shut up wit and conversation are forgotten arts in this modern world anyway dont be such an ungrateful bastard im getting you out of here your master plan had so many flaws it mustve taken you what four minutes to put it together left to your own devices youd have been back in your cell before the painkillers wore off you think crawling on your hands and knees in deep snow leaving a trail of blood through the centre of oxford is a bit of a giveaway hunter paused outside a nondescript door hed already conned his way past three sets of guards that would virtually guarantee a treason charge once his crimes had been revealed in the morning light but his next act would be the final straw moving to a security panel he tapped in the numerical sequence hed memorised the one time hed accompanied reid to the store when the spy had very rudely ordered him to wait outside this was a good way to get his own back for such gross disrespect thirteenthirteen he said the number of betrayal twice over if reid had a touch of art in his soul hed appreciate the irony the door slid open and they slipped inside rows of glass cases gleamed in the light what is this place mallory asked weakly the museum of the damned every magical artefact and weapon weve managed to steal loot or stumble across since the fall reckon we could find something else of use in here not worth the risk hunter said half these things would turn you into stone or make you sprout an asss head before you had a chance to work out what they were for there it is mallory came alive when he saw the sword in its new case three aisles down he hurried towards it with what hunter considered the eagerness of a junkie it really is special you dont know the half of it mallory smiled with a mixture of relief and desire myth says there are three swords of power three weapons that could shatter the world and this is one of them you didnt get it in a christmas cracker then it was a gift from the gods in otherworld hunter stiffened youve been there mallory nodded without taking his eyes off the sword whats it like hunter said hopefully ive read the briefing papers some stories say its like heaven others reckon its more like a land of dreams its whatever you make it mallory replied he crooked his elbow and shattered the glass with one blow once the sword was in his hand blue light limned its blade all right hunter said lets get out of here now that the mission was entering its final and most serious stage hunter became workmanlike and focused they hurried back up the aisle and then came to a sudden halt near the door stood an oldfashioned lantern a blue flame quivering behind its glass it hadnt been there when theyd entered hunters gaze flickered rapidly around the room i wonder who left that there his words were clearly meant as a warning for any intruder the mystery deepened after they had searched the room and discovered that they were definitely alone do you think its meant for us mallory said as they stood over the lantern ive had some experience of this supernatural shit and nothing ever happens without a reason hunter was entranced by the blue flame which was bent at an angle as if continually blown by a draught steeling himself he waved his fingers over the lanterns handle then snatched it up the flame continued to bend it was not due to a draught weird he said lets take it with us at worst a lantern on a dark night will come in handy mallory hid the sword and the lantern in the depths of his parka and then they made their way out into the silent city at one point mallory almost stumbled and fell and hunter gave him an arm to support him it had stopped snowing but the last fall was still thick on the ground it was beginning to surpass the abilities of the street workers to clear it how are we going to get out of this city mallory said anything that hasnt got tracks will be snowed in horses hunter said theres a government stable at nuffield college they use them for expeditions into the countryside around the city saves fuel mallory grumbled what a way to go frozen in the saddle we can pick up some winter gear and supplies from the quartermaster near the stables its not going to be a fun jaunt for the first time hunter couldnt hide his deep concern beneath a glib manner are you going to be all right just get me out of the city once weve found a place to make camp get some sleep food ill pull myself together mallory came to a halt the pain making him look much older than he was look thanks for getting me out i appreciate it but i dont think im ever going to be able to forgive you for sophie every time i look at you i just think of how she the words stifled in his throat i dont expect you to like me hunter said just to do whatever it is youre supposed to do mallory nodded once tersely he could live with that arrangement they reached the stables within the hour shivering intensely from the harsh wind that swept down new road the night watchman was a youth of about seventeen who appeared to know who hunter was and acted with due deference two horses were brought quickly saddled and ready to go hunter left mallory to rest and returned fifteen minutes later with two bags filled with supplies warm clothes tents cooking equipment and anything else they might need on their long journeys in the bitter night air hunter helped mallory on to his mount mallorys face was as white as the snow that was once again falling and hunter was afraid his comrade would be dead before the day was out if he didnt get rest pendragon spirit or not the going was hard for the horses until they reached the roads outside the builtup area beyond north hinksey where the wind had made the snow drift to the sides allowing a clearer path once they had put a few miles between them and the city hunter led the horses into the centre of some dense woodland where they would not be seen he pitched a tent collected as much dryish wood as he could find to build a roaring campfire and then cooked some food while mallory lay wrapped in his thermal sleeping bag yet as they ate their food hunter was surprised to see how quickly mallory was recovering a faint flush had returned to his cheeks and he had more energy to talk i think youve pretty effectively burned all your bridges mallory said as he cleaned the last of the soup from his bowl its a fair guess that i wont be going back to my day job no great loss this business has a habit of taking over your life when i found out i was a brother of dragons i was trying to set myself up for a life just looking after number one suddenly i was lumbered with obligation duty and all those things complaining mallory considered this for a moment no having a purpose is like going on holiday a break from worrying about what youre going to do with your life have you left anyone behind a wife girlfriend many many girlfriends so many women so little time im pretty rootless he thought about samantha and her kiss and how he had briefly felt a real connection with her the worlds falling apart getting involved would only complicate matters and with what were going into it wouldnt be very good for the woman would it maybe when its all over they exchanged a long glance silently recognising the truth and the lie so where are we going mallory said changing tack government intelligence says that one of the three survivors has set up camp in glastonbury got some kind of college for magicians going on or something the name weve got is shavi dont know if thats first or last thats not far from my old stomping ground all right if i give that a try sure hunter said but its not an easy ride no one weve sent down there has returned he killed them i thought he was supposed to be a champion of humanity i dont know any more than that we were on the brink of sending a full force in there to haul him out when this whole thing blew up hunter paused considering his words suddenly things look a whole lot different from this side of the fence that happens sounds like the government hasnt changed still fucking with peoples lives what have they done with the other two locked them up in dartmoor we havent been able to track them down from what we hear theyre travelling together one of them is called ruth gallagher mallory nodded shes the big witchqueen trained sophie mallory felt a twinge of desperate emotion battened it down the more you look the more you see these strands tying everything together it could get a little unsettling if you let it the other mallory asked some woman called laura dusantiago dont know anything about her so if you have no idea where they are how are you going to find them hunter leaned out of the tent mouth to throw another log on the fire it sizzled and spat as the frostrimed wood hit the heat i think im getting the hang of this whatever made us brothers of dragons brings us together to do a job so im just going to let it mallory held out his hands inviting the warmth of the fire to ease the bitterness from his bones youre just going to sit here until they turn up im going to ride and see where i find myself very zen or stupidly optimistic one of the two mallory leaned back into the tent and pulled out the lantern youd better take this then youre going to need something to light your way on those dark lonely nights hunter took the lantern and fastened it to his bag ill treat it as a goodluck charm until it turns into some monster in the middle of the night and slits my throat when we get back where do we meet up hunter thought for a moment then said theres a brothel on saint michaels street in town ask for mrs damask anyone will direct you youre sure its wise to come back to oxford the way i see it were all being drawn there we need to regroup there in case anyone else turns up start at first light if youre up to it mallory smiled as he unzipped his parka and tugged free the bandages wrapped around his midriff the wound beneath had almost healed hal had stoked the fire in his office every fifteen minutes but it had little effect on the biting cold that insinuated its way through the very walls hed bundled himself up in his overcoat and wore a pair of fingerless gloves while he worked occasionally taking a swig of some bitter alcoholic concoction that the main gate security guard had brewed up in one of the secret stills that now proliferated across the city the only relief from the bitter temperatures was losing himself in his project as he now grandly called it hed worked feverishly oblivious to all sense of time until the chime of the clock told him it was getting on for dawn his room was a claustrophobic space crammed with paintings and books and mysteries illuminated by the flickering light of several candles in search of clues hal had immersed himself in anything he could find on the poussin painting and its symbolism and on the shugborough hall monument instinctively he was somehow convinced that his investigations would lead to a devastating revelation that would change the course of the war everything pointed to the vital significance of the wish stone the way it had been hidden the way it had been found the coded message designed to deter the unworthy if he was right he had finally found his role hal couldnt decide if it was a byproduct of his obsessive investigation or even a sign of encroaching madness brought on by a world where anything was possible but he was starting to see hidden connections slowly developing into a sense of some arcane master plan the more he delved the more connections he saw so that at times he looked up from his books unable to tell what was real and what was a product of his overworked imagination so engrossed was he that he didnt hear the knock on his door he only jolted out of concentration when a figure loomed over him it was samantha i saw your light through the window what are you doing working at this hour she asked concerned important business for mister reid hal considered how much he should tell her for fear of putting her in danger then added i think it might lead to something that could change the course of the war really the admiration in her eyes excited him he wanted more of it can you talk about it she asked animatedly relenting hal explained about the stone recovered from cadbury hill and the mysterious message it contained why this painting or its reverse image at shugborough why was it thought important enough to preserve at cadbury how could it be linked to a picture painted hundreds of years later but what makes you think it has any relevance at all samantha settled into a sagging armchair near the fire and poured herself a glass of the moonshine two people two very important people in the crisis were seeing now were drawn to cadbury to find this those two people were supposed to be part of the last defence of humanity against whatever it is thats attacking us now and i think they were led to find this because the picture is a code that reveals something they could use in the fight perhaps some kind of weapon thats amazing mister reid must think a lot of you to give you a project as important as this he trusts me i get the feeling that well that doesnt matter anyway im starting to piece it together how far have you got samantha asked excitement and a moonshine buzz bringing colour to her cheeks is there anything i can do to help hal was thrilled by the prospect of the two of them working closely can you spare the time youre normally up to your neck in work ive been twiddling my thumbs ever since the war started what i do isnt a priority any more well if youre sure hal couldnt contain a smile any longer ok were a team let me tell you what ive found out so far he stood up to point to a print of the shepherds of arcadia with the shepherds and the stately woman gathered around the tomb with its intriguing inscription theres been a lot of debate about the meaning of this ever since poussin first painted it samantha stood and leaned towards the print to examine it more closely whats arcadia it comes from a long tradition of pastoral poetry going back to the greeks basically the poems brought to life an imaginary place a kingdom of utopia scholars spent a long time searching for the origin of the phrase et in arcadia ego but theres no classical source so poussin made it up hal nodded which makes me think that phrase is the key one translation suggests it means and in arcadia i exist with the scholars believing that i is death hence even in utopia theres death thats a little morbid samantha returned to her seat warming her hands by the fire but youll notice that the shepherds and the woman dont seem too concerned about this in fact if you look closely they seem to be pondering the meaning of the inscription yet strangely poussin painted another painting very similar and also on the death in arcadia theme a few years earlier in that version the shepherds and the woman are visibly shocked to discover the message theres also a skull on top of the tomb its much more sombre so he changed his mind suddenly death wasnt so scary hal smiled my conclusion exactly but why and this is where it gets stranger et in arcadia ego is an anagram of the latin phrase i tego arcana dei which means begone i conceal the secrets of god hal saw the light of inspiration rise up in samanthas face in the same way he had felt it when he first made the connection the secrets of god she whispered so the tomb could hide this weapon or whatever it is would it be that literal somewhere theres a tomb with a weapon in it i dont know trying to piece these things together is a nightmare because you cant work out whats fact and whats your imagination joining nonexistent dots for instance theres a popular myth linking poussins painting to the knights templar and mallory the man who found the wish stone was trained at salisbury to be a member of the new knights templar order that the church or whats left of it is establishing this all sounds like some bizarre conspiracy theory i know and it gets worse the image released by the stone is a nearreversal of the painting and on the estate at shugborough hall in staffordshire theres a stone carving in the gardens of the shepherds of arcadia with the same backtofront positioning of the figures i visited there when i was a girl samantha said it was lovely very peaceful shugboroughs history has lots of odd little sidelines which may or may not be relevant hal took a sip of the moonshine as he sought out one particular book he spoke as he flicked through the pages to get the names and dates he needed the grounds were laid out in seventeen fortyeight to fortynine by thomas wright a selftaught mathematician with an interest in the esoteric he used to tour britain drawing what he called druidic remains and in seventeen fifty he published a book called an original theory of the universe it was the first book to explain the milky way as our view through a galaxy but wright also had very strong views about the existence of an infinite number of universes or dimensions or whatever you want to call them all radiating out from a divine centre there was a revival of druidism at the time and this was one of the ideas that came out of that how does that fit in im not sure except coincidences are cropping up all over the place and im not sure any more that they are coincidences one of those defenders of humanity i spoke about has set up a college at glastonbury to teach druidic knowledge and wright was brought to shugborough by two men roger gale and the earl of pembroke who had both worked with the famous antiquarian william stukeley surveying stonehenge and avebury so were talking about old mysteries other dimensions utopia samantha came to stand next to hal leaning over him so closely that he could smell the scent of her skin it was almost overpowering struggling to concentrate he continued the owner of shugborough thomas anson was also interested in these old mysteries anson commissioned the shepherds monument in seventeen fortyeight at the same time as he had his dining room built and that room featured isis and serapis who are alexandrian mysterycult deities anson was a curious character he was a member of the royal society and supported the most advanced scientific thinkers including erasmus darwin and josiah wedgwood but he was also a member of the divan club one of the lesser hellfire clubs founded by sir francis dashwood who revelled in immorality and where does that leave us lots of facts and little else just the hint of something waiting to be found samantha mulled this over for a moment and then said i think we need to go to shugborough dont you you and me who else mister reid will want you to investigate it fully you can ask for me to come along to help you with your research there wont be a problem unless you dont want me to come no i do very much hal said hastily but its dangerous out there we dont know how far the enemy have advanced stop making excuses and start making plans samantha gave him a wink and a smile that was unknowingly sexy before she slipped out of the door suddenly hal was left with the feeling that everything was going right it was still half an hour until dawn as sophie raced from ceridwens temple back to the walls but long before she reached them she knew the attack was imminent huge braziers of oil burst into flame like miniature suns along the great expanse of the ramparts and a resounding cry rang up from the guards whose armour now gleamed golden in the firelight sophie was breathless by the time she reached the top of the winding stone steps where the warm wind buffeted her after its journey across the vast plain thackeray came over anxiously i thought you were going to miss the action he said edgily he kept glancing back towards the vertiginous drop to the ground far below whats happening theyre massing at the foot of the walls what do they hope to do sophie asked theyll never be able to use ladders to climb this high i thought theyd be relying on those weird machines to pound us into dust im not so sure thackeray took her to the wall sophie felt dizzy when she looked straight down but the discomfort was quickly subsumed by a creeping uneasiness when she saw the little men swarming like ants against the monolithic stone blocks at the base of the walls at that moment lugh made his way on to a raised stone platform that jutted out from the battlements over the city it was dominated by a flagpole made of silver from which lughs solar standard fluttered along the ramparts the gods fell silent as one they turned to face lugh a majestic figure tall and proud and strong these are dark times his voice rang out like a clarion over the court of souls ease brother against brother the golden ones riven who would ever have thought such a day would come since the days of our great wandering from the four shining cities of our eternal home we have been as one united by a single belief bound to the heart of existence but all has changed we here in the court of souls ease still maintain that single belief it is others who have strayed from the path of faith who have turned against everything that binds us all we hold close to our hearts is now at risk for if our brothers find victory in the coming battle they will be on another path no longer golden ones for we are what we believe therefore do not think that you fight against your brother do not waste your heart in anguish at this crime against existence rather believe that you fight for the essence of who we are you fight for our long traditions and belief you fight for what has gone and for what is yet to come lugh lifted his helmet and placed it firmly on his head a resounding roar rang across the rooftops of the court as the defending forces raised their weapons high defiant and proud lugh pushed his way into the heart of the throng and moved to a central position ready to fight shoulder to shoulder with his troops you can see why the celts were so in awe of these gods when they first ventured into our world sophie said to thackeray she looked round for caitlin and found her standing precariously on a gargoyle jutting out from the battlements oblivious to the gulf beneath her or the winds that pulled her this way and that the power of the morrigan shone out of her like a black light passionate resolute brutal the warriors in her vicinity gave her a wide berth casting quick glances in her direction then looking away in case she saw them sophie turned and grabbed thackeray who was also staring at caitlin anxiously times running out she said i need you to help me what can i do this isnt our fight we have to get back home where were needed look over here sophie was interrupted by harvey who was clinging to the ramparts as he peered over the side sophie and thackeray rushed to his side and looked down queasily from the heights into the sea of shadows at the bottom there was movement in the centre of the dark whats going on thackeray squinted trying to pierce the gloom look look harvey said stabbing his finger frantically at something only he could see but as sophie and thackeray stared their eyes gradually became accustomed to the gloom and then their hearts began to beat faster they dont need ladders sophie said they dont need anything jesus christ thackerays voice had fallen to a whisper theyre going to swarm over us like insects the little men were climbing up the walls along the whole length of the monolithic barrier their relentless progress was conducted with an obscene scurrying motion that made them resemble spiders arms and legs outstretched on either side of them heads close to the wall eyes never deviating from their target sophie couldnt tell whether their fingers and toes were finding minute cracks and crevices or if they were sticking to the stone through magical means or some innate ability that came with their devolved state hundreds of them were moving upwards rapidly becoming thousands there was something about the upward swarming of the black specks that made sophies stomach churn we should fight thackeray said distracted by the sight what are you mad harvey shouted his birmingham accent growing thicker with his anxiety what can we do against that thackeray looked from harvey to sophie the gods are helping us out were the reason theyre in this mess the least we can do is lend a hand to stop them being overrun i mean how hard can it be we just drop things on them to knock them off the wall look how many there are harvey protested everything inside the city will be outside and theyll still be climbing up in thackerays face sophie saw the decency and bravery that had been hidden from her before he was a normal person trying to do the right thing in a nightmarish situation the least she could do was help you two run off find whatever weapons you can she said im going to stay here and do my bit youre going to get all witchy harvey said suspiciously just go as they headed off sophie bowed her head and attempted to find the calm place inside her her craft worked best in peaceful quiet locations where she could use ritual to focus her mind but shed had remarkable success on the frantic chase from the court of the final word she was hoping it was just a matter of willpower she heard the clank of swords against stone as the defenders rested their weapons the murmur of their voices the wind keening over the rooftops lugh far along the battlements barking orders eyes shut concentrating hard all the distractions began to fade until she was left in the quiet dark of her head her ritual had been practised a hundred times or more she muttered her triggerword and the dark changed to a sunlit grove not far from her parents home where she had first felt the call of the craft and the world from which it spun amongst the oaks and ash was a pool in which a fish swam lazily its silvered scales glinting in the beams of sunlight breaking through the canopy sophie leaned over the pool and said i call on you brother salmon help your friend the salmon rolled its eyes towards her and replied what would you have me do sophie emerged from her trance with a start the words of her request ringing in her head already storm clouds were gathering from deep in the night a great wind rose up sophie felt as if nails were being driven into her skull when she looked around she saw caitlin staring at her from her perch on top of the gargoyle a smile of dark pleasure on her lips below the little men still scurried up the wall they were now close enough that she could see their mean beady eyes the one at the head of the swarm suddenly fell backwards with a shriek an arrow protruding from between his eyes caitlin had hit him perfectly in the dark with an accuracy surpassing most human ability so fast that her arms were a blur she released four more arrows all hitting their targets exactly sophie was sickened by the gleeful bloodlust she saw in caitlins face for the first time since sophie had known her she seemed truly alive the wind rushed across the plain like a living creature plucking several of the little men from the wall and flinging them far out into the night sophie could control its direction and force just but each burst of mental energy took its toll on her she focused a lightning bolt crashed down stones exploded from the wall and more of the enemy fell back smoking their eyes liquid their insides cooked sophie kept up the assault from the elements for as long as she could but eventually she fell back her head swimming so exhausted she could no longer stand she had personally destroyed more than a hundred of the swarming attackers but for every one she slew ten more took their place the leading edge of the swarm was close to the summit now their harsh grunts echoing all around you did great thackeray was suddenly next to her helping her back from the edge you need to rest now get away from here no she said in a small breathless voice once i get my strength back just lie here he said leaving her at the top of the stone steps where she could get a good view of the battle but after they start to break through the ranks do your best to get down and away he paused what did you want earlier later she said weakly thackeray ran back to the ramparts where harvey waited with a sickened expression they were both armed with enormous swords that made them look like boys in comparison weak barely able to prop herself up sophie drifted in and out of consciousness so that the unfolding battle had all the reality of a bad dream the little men swarmed over the ramparts small and brown and vicious tearing with their little knives striking with broken nails and sharp teeth the gods tall and stately responded just as savagely though their brutality was masked behind the measured sophistication of their balletic strokes and skilful attacks bodies were cleaved in half by the gods swords heads split in two but though the knives and teeth of the little men had but small effect on the heavily armoured gods it was clear they would eventually overwhelm the defence by sheer force of numbers sophie faded in and out but still they came clambering over the bodies of the fallen attacking relentlessly seemingly with no thought for their own safety but then there was a flurry of activity and the tide appeared to turn a terrifying demon swept along the battlements hacking and slashing in a blur of sword and knife carnage in human form it was caitlin and she was laughing and shrieking with the ecstasy of the moment no longer human in her daze sophie thought she saw caitlin rise up into the sky grow larger become the destroyer of everything her sword came down on the city and a sea of blood rose up and washed everything away and then there was only darkness for ever more chapter ten avalon dawn vox populi vox dei alcuin light filtered through stained glass flooding the whole hall with a demonic red framed at the edges by blue and green as sophie gradually came back to consciousness she had the odd feeling that she was surfacing from a dream into a dream colours too florid distant sounds given uncertain solidity by odd echoes she had never been in the room before but it had the ambience of a church the stainedglass windows ranged from floor to ceiling along the vast eastern walls presenting pictures of gods in battle and victory and it was clearly the first rays of dawn that were turning them to fire the floor was grey stone flags on which wooden benches stood oriented towards a lectern while the ceiling was cathedralhigh and vaulted sophie was propped up on the rear bench flanked by thackeray and harvey lugh was at the lectern and had clearly just given a speech of some kind for the gods who filled the remaining benches were taking their leave sophie had the feeling that these were the senior members of the court for ceridwen was there and math she didnt recognise any of the others but they wore their gravitas like a cloak we were starting to get worried about you harvey said with some affection sophie had been convinced for a while now that he was starting to develop a crush on her i blacked out sophie muttered after calling up the wind and the lightning much good that did oh it helped thackeray said but not as much as that did he nodded towards the figure striding towards them we drove them back caitlin said her eyes gleaming but theyll return and soon well never be able to fight them off thackeray said we surprised them this time they never expected us to have a secret weapon that was such a killing machine even you wont be able to kill all of them harvey said to caitlin but he wouldnt meet her eyes lugh marched up and addressed sophie his words are true i didnt hear your speech what did you tell everyone sophie said a deep sadness lay just below the surface of lughs composed expression the enemy is too numerous we cannot defeat them what are you saying she asked that youre going to surrender defiance flared in lughs eyes in all our long history the golden ones have never admitted defeat we are trapped here unable to strike back effectively we must escape regroup find another haven where we can plot our next attack how are you going to get out of here the only exit is through the gate straight into the enemys hands i have charged my brothers and sisters with finding a solution but what if they cant come up with anything then we stand and fight and greet existence with the sun in our faces and pride in our hearts the small group fell silent as lugh marched away the air of impending doom in the room was palpable sophie said quietly whatever it takes were getting out of here the road west from oxford was hard going mallory reasoned that the main thoroughfares would be easier to travel but heavy snow had still built up so deep in places that even the horse found it difficult to pick a path through some days he barely covered two miles he took the a skirting witney and then when he reached northleach turned south down the arrowstraight route of the old fosse way towards cirencester one advantage of such a route was plenty of abandoned buildings where he could seek shelter if the blizzards became too intense and many occupied ones where he could try to beg a few moments warmth by a fire or a bed for the night but many people were suspicious of him with the collapse of the rule of law across most of the country there were too many rogues at large others refused him any food fearing that the bizarre summerwinter would devastate the already fragile food supply most crops would already have died and what they had stored needed to be conserved after the tenth shotgun pushed into his face he decided to shun human contact altogether with each passing mile mallory had grown stronger the pain of his wounds becoming a distant memory but the bitter cold assailed him and at times he wondered if he would be able to continue every morning he woke with a deep ache gnawing at his bones that not even the campfire outside the tent could dispel and then there was the long day in the saddle riding into the harsh wind the frost building up on his chest and on the beard he had decided to grow to protect the skin from being flayed from his face in his thermal sleeping bag at night he dreamed of warmth but thought he would never feel it again increasingly the harshness of the outside world drove him deep inside his own head where memories dreams and emotions stewed and mingled so that sometimes he found himself unable to tell what was real and what was fantasy but always he returned to the single image of a gunshot in the dark that was imprinted on his deep subconscious the revelation that had come as he lay drugged and in pain had been too raw to contemplate immediately but now it had taken on a terrible gravity that dragged him back to it constantly perhaps it had been a suicide attempt from which he had recovered but if that was the case why did he have no memory of any hospitalisation or had that too been locked away from his conscious mind no he was sure it represented his death but the questions that came with that recognition threatened to drive him mad if only sophie had been there she would have helped him to find a solution she would have soothed him but then as he concentrated on the blast the fire then darkness a rush of other memories broke through like ice shattering on a pond another life setting up a club music criminal figures propelling him to a choice no one should have to make and then some unspeakable act which he still couldnt face that drove him to suicide it shocked him out of his drifting state so sharply that he almost fell from the horse and had to pull back on the reins to bring it under control the rush of memory brought deep depression along with the shock since sophies death the world had already become senseless but now that his own inner world was equally untethered he felt as if he was going mad gasping for breath he didnt see the figure that appeared suddenly in front of him until his mount shied away theres a monster it was a man of about eighty wrapped in several heavy jumpers and wearing a pair of ancient paintspattered trousers an oldfashioned hearing aid was visible in one ear and a pair of silverrimmed glasses held together with a plaster was jammed on the bridge of his nose anxiety made him throw his arms up and down as if he was exercising mallory brought the horse under control and barked what the hell are you doing you idiot theres a monster i heard you the first time what are you talking about and whats it got to do with me the old man managed to calm himself enough to get his words out over that way he flapped his arm towards the east its got my granddaughter and you youve got a sword you can fight it are you a knight from salisbury weve had a few of em round here they help out when theyre not biblebashing his words disappeared in another bout of panic mallory couldnt afford to break his journey but the old man was so desperate that he was on the verge of tears how far he asked with irritation two miles two miles thats about a days travelling in this weather no no the road isnt bad the trees overhang so its kept the snow off he protested please my granddaughter he wrung his hands and for the first time mallory could see that he was on the point of collapse he must have walked the distance searching for help could mallory ignore his plea possibly sacrifice a woman to one of the nightmares that had stalked the land since the fall come on he said wearily holding out a hand to help the man on to the back of his horse jesus youre lucky im such a soft touch as they made their way along the lane mallory was relieved to find that the old man had not been lying the snow lay thinly marred only by the old mans footprints whats your name mallory asked stanley hahn mallory could feel the old man shaking from the cold as he clung on youd better tell me what happened my son and daughterinlaw died in the fall stanley said in a fragile voice my granddaughter jenny got us set up in barnsley house just over the way but last night there were strange lights in the gardens and then a fire a big big fire we thought a plane had crashed jenny said she was going to investigate i told her not to but she never listens to me any more he sobbed silently for a moment when he managed to calm himself he continued when she didnt come back after half an hour i went to see where shed gone there was a terrible snowstorm blowing i could barely walk into it and then and then you found her the monster had her it was all wrapped around her and they were both on fire but jenny wasnt burning i dont understand it i dont all right calm down shes still with it i ran back to the house to find a shotgun but i was afraid of hitting jenny i went back this morning and she was still there still standing with it i didnt know what to do youll help me wont you youll help mallory sighed but it was answer enough for the old man who proceeded to sob quietly with relief after a journey of fifteen minutes or so the road brought them up to what looked like an enormous mansion three hundred years old at least built of cotswold stone with large windows and tall chimneys and set in formal gardens is that it bloody hell youve been living in a right old pile mallory said whats this place again barnsley house its famous it used to have gardens that people came from all over the world to see bit overgrown now then it was turned into this plush hotel but it was empty after the fall so we moved in thought it would be safer here the place is so big if anybody came looking for you itd take them a month to find you inside theyre in the pool garden will you go im afraid twilight was already drawing in and mallory considered leaving any confrontation to the morning but he knew that the old man wouldnt let him you get in the house ill see what i can do thank you thank you the old man sobbed with pitiful gratitude mallory lowered him to the ground then turned his mount in the direction stanley had indicated an abiding stillness lay heavily on the thick snow yet as he surveyed the lengthening shadows of the black and white world he felt an odd tingling deep inside him as though some invisible energy was radiating out from a source just ahead he rode on a little further and then dismounted when he drew his sword the blue light that always limned the blade was brighter than he had ever seen it cautiously he made his way across the overgrown but still ordered gardens he kept low but it was impossible to progress quietly on the frosted snow finally he glimpsed a frozen pool through an entrance in a winding hedge blue light shimmered on the ice and surrounding snow and there was a tang of burned iron in the air his heart beating insistently he followed the light to its source the sight that greeted him was stunning slowly the sword drifted to his side blue fire blazed without heat or sound and at its heart coiled around itself in a vast area of crushed trees shrubs and hedges was a fabulous beast more glorious than any mallory had ever seen in salisbury he had experienced them up close as they soared on the winds leathery wings beating metallic scales glinting red gold and green as the furious flames belched from their mouths but this one appeared to be made of the sapphire flames that raged around it at times mallory could see through the scales to the vascular system beneath and beyond into its organs it was completely blue and its eyes as they probed him were the deepest blue too standing motionless amongst the flames yet untouched by them was a slim attractive woman in her thirties her face the colour of alabaster and just as unmoving made even paler by the long black hair that framed it but it was her eyes that held mallory unblinking they were the mirror of the fabulous beasts as blue as the sky on a summer day the fabulous beasts tail coiled tighter around her legs as if it knew mallory was about to drag her free the tip of the tail tapped at her shin like a cats mallory was not afraid the fabulous beasts flaming breath could turn whole cities into an inferno they were unpredictable chaotic terrifying in appearance yet mallory was convinced that they were inherently a force for good tied in some way to the spiritenergy that coursed through the earth itself as the blue light on his blade gleamed brighter still mallory realised that his sword was calling out to the fabulous beast which in turn was calling out to the sword and through it to mallory himself i suppose this is what being a brother of dragons means he said it is the first the voice echoed so loudly all around that mallory took a step back it was deep masculine but with a hint of sibilance more disturbingly jennys lips had formed the words but the voice was certainly not hers jenny mallory didnt expect a response and shifted his attention to the fabulous beast this is the first the original the father or mother of them all but as he said the words mallory realised it was more than that the first has been waiting for you brother of dragons waiting even i didnt know i was going to be here the first knew the odd dislocation of voice and jennys moving mouth continued to unnerve mallory why is it after me you are bound into the great events that are unfolding these days of crisis are only the beginning of a great upheaval that will decide the path of humanity for all time to come here now is the axis around which everything turns foretold since the dawn of your race everything that has happened has been in preparation for this every moment of suffering that has shaped and guided your kind every joy every sorrow every victory every defeat there has been meaning in even the smallest thing even a leaf falling from a tree but your people have never had the perspective that would allow them to understand ok destiny fate i can understand that mallory said cautiously big things are happening and ive got a part in them i knew that already so again why me why here why now the truth and the fire mallory the truth and the fire the tone of the words made his blood run cold something skittered in the back of his head dark thoughts emerged at the tug of the fabulous beasts blazing stare five new brothers and sisters of dragons have been chosen for these crucial times the king and the queen are true to the patterns of old the remaining three were selected for chaos and confusion the devourer of all things known in these times as the void cannot easily read them or predict their actions and the devourer of all things sees all knows all mallory understood their unpredictability means they can blindside the void that is why they were created but one has already fallen though she fights to return to the field who are they mallory didnt want to ask the question but like a moth drawn to a flame he couldnt resist the broken woman the shadow mage and the dead man the rushing cold washed through mallory and he thought for a second that he might faint his heart was pounding panic fastened a strap across his chest no i dont want to hear any more he stepped back another pace you will only reach your potential through full selfknowledge mallory this is the reason you are here now the first is the key and you are the lock dont mallory said he was shaking the squirming at the back of his head had grown unbearable he clutched at his temples with his free hand it felt as if his skull was about to crack open the sword you carry is more than a sword it is a part of existence as are its two brothers but it has been disguised to hide it from the devourer of all things now is the time to return it to power mallory and by doing so unlock your mind against the palm of mallorys hand the sword throbbed in response to the beast come plunge your sword into the purifying flame and cleanse yourself in the process no mallory said i cant do it you fear the death you have experienced mallory and the events leading up to that death for your true self knows them well but understand this you have been reborn there is always hope it is not visible in the small things but when you soar high you can see it clearly mallory in you in your very being is this lesson emotion surged up in mallory he remembered his parents his childhood the feeling that he had let them down he recalled his first meeting with sophie in the pub in salisbury and later at the travellers camp where he had come to realise that he wanted her and needed her the feeling that she was the key to his redemption and then her death and the grief burrowing its way into his soul and the knowledge that by losing her he had lost his only chance of salvation a hot tear blazed down his frozen face he hesitated then thought what did it matter what did anything matter he strode forward and plunged the sword deep into the blue flames the fire rushed up the blade as if it was kindling and then up his arms and into him burning through his mind his soul until everything was blue he didnt know how long he remained in that state but the next time he came to consciousness he was staggering around in the snow with the sword still blazing blue in his hand he felt as if hed had a massive shot of adrenalin in his head it felt as if a stopper had been pulled from the bottom of an enormous vat thoughts and feelings surged through him three hundred movies playing at the same time all speeded up to a blur he knew instantly who he was and who he had been what terrible act he had committed and how he had atoned for it he saw himself pull the trigger the blaze of fire across his head and his death but then miraculously he was alive again driving a stolen car to salisbury shortly after the fall and he knew he wasnt of this world at all the point of his death had been an instant of transition somewhere there was another world a little like the one he was in with people who loved and hated and who were forced to do unspeakable things but he had the feeling that it was a greyer world without wonder where meaning was not so clear and where the joys of life had been diffused a world where the fall had never happened it was the reason why he was so unpredictable why the devourer of all things would not be able to see him clearly he didnt fit properly into the landscape of this world like an old bottle washed up on a beach whatever was watching skittered over the anomaly to preserve the purity of the holistic view there are worlds upon worlds upon worlds mallory all connected all joined to the source for the first time there was a faint smile on jennys lips mallory shivered he had the feeling that something beyond her beyond even the fabulous beast was speaking to him through them both your world no longer exists in the way that this world exists she continued existence has shifted a new structure has been raised around you mallory felt whole for the first time and more he realised what it meant to feel whole along with it came a deep sense of purpose im not going to fail he said the sword felt like a bomb on the brink of exploding and whatever energy it contained surged into him and back combining infusing you are the knight mallory jenny said you carry in your heart the standard of existence youve done your duty now mallory said to her and i thank you for that you can come back to your grandfather now her sapphire eyes blazed brightly and mallory already knew the response before the words appeared i cannot for i am now with the first i am its conduit in this world there must be many sacrifices to achieve the shining future youre going to stay here i will be there at the end for better or worse even if the hounds of avalon cry to the moon go now mallory brother of dragons the world waits for you mallory turned and left them but even when he had reached the shadow of the house in the gathering gloom he could still feel their presence warm at his back he found the old man cowering in the lounge next to a dead fire mallory did his best to explain what had happened but the old mans sobs were still hard to bear afterwards when stanley sat in a plush armchair staring blankly into the corner mallory remade the fire and cooked them both a small dinner he knew it would be hard for stanley to survive on his own especially if the bleak winter continued mallory encouraged him to find others in the area but the old man simply shook his head silently the next morning which was bright and clear but at least a degree colder mallory set off for cirencester with renewed vigour the cold no longer bothered him as much whatever else had happened when he plunged his sword into the blue fire it had given a boost to the pendragon spirit he felt he could do anything win any fight he stopped at the nearest inhabited house and convinced the residents to seek out stanley and offer what help they could but he could see the growing fear in their faces the winter that had corrupted the land was driving its ice deep into their hearts everyone was starting to believe that the end really was approaching the next three days passed without incident and on the fourth when glastonbury was within reach mallory noticed a change the day appeared slightly warmer the wind not so bitter the snow that had been falling faded away to reveal a clear blue sky at first he wondered if it might be his imagination but the closer he got to the town the more the temperature increased the hardpacked snow grew thinner turned to slush melted away completely the icicles on the houses and the fences disappeared in the warmth of the sun the leaves on the trees the shrubs and flowers and vegetation that had shrivelled in a cold they had never expected to endure gave way to verdant life the perfume of honeysuckle the colours of hedgerow flowers birds called and there were cattle and sheep in the fields residents greeted mallory with a cheery wave as he rode by and finally it became too hot to wear his cloak he stripped it off and turned his face to the sun surprised at how quickly he had forgotten the sensation of its warmth on his skin realising how much he had missed it by the time he reached the town it was summer again and all was right with the world youll never get in there the farmer eyed mallory wryly as he leaned on a gate gently swinging the hammer he had been using to fix the adjoining fence what have they got guards dogs flying pigs for all i know lad the farmer shielded his eyes from the sun we get one or two of you a week riding in from god knows where or on foot all thinking they can turn their lives around i spect the words all over the country now about what weve got down here and what have you got the farmer tapped his nose you dont mind having the college in town nooo they look after all us locals keep us in food crops have never been so good since they came down and the beasts have never given so much milk they know a thing or two and no mistake and they keep us safe so what theyve got guards some kind of militia they dont need guns he nodded at mallorys sword protruding from its scabbard or pigstickers like that theres more than one way to skin a cat mallory could see that he wasnt going to get anything useful out of the farmer so he nodded politely and urged his horse on it wasnt a surprise hed got the same response from everyone hed encountered as he neared the town boundary as mallory drew closer to his destination he was surprised to see that a massive flood had cut off the centre of the town and the tor from the surrounding countryside at first he presumed it had been caused by runoff from the melting snows on the periphery of the warm zone but as he skirted the deep water and marshland seeking a path through he realised it had turned glastonbury into a naturally protected island he was forced to approach from the south where there was a thin defensive bank that formed a land bridge to the edge of wearyall hill as he drew closer he saw that the entrance to the bridge was marked by an arch of thick entwining blackthorn and hanging from it was a severed human head it was a lurid greenblack from the early stages of decomposition but strangely untouched by birds and insects as mallory guided his horse to pass under the arch the heads eyelids snapped open and mallory jolted back in his saddle his sword drawn in an instant who goes the rotten lips parted to reveal black teeth the eyes rolled as if unused to seeing and eventually focused on mallory the deep horror embedded in them only enhanced the chilling image i want to visit the college the head made a low rattling exhalation only those who have been invited may enter turn back or face the consequences ill try my luck mallory guided his horse forward until the head emitted a highpitched scream that brought him to a sharp stop know then my story in life i was sent to capture the leaders of this college and in this act i killed one who had come here to learn now my punishment is to hang here for evermore as a warning to all others who trespass of those who have ignored me none have returned this way sorry pal i dont have a choice then cross the perilous bridge traveller and pray to whatever god you recognise the stink of the rotting head floated into mallorys nostrils as he passed beneath it the second his horse put one hoof on the slim land bridge the head began to scream again mallory kept moving but the head continued to wail like a siren warning of the intruders impending approach the water on either side was like glass giving the impression of another world existing just a stones throw away at times mallory was almost overcome by the illusion that he could dive in and swim to the green island he saw there the image was broken only by the occasional chimney protruding from the sunken houses beneath on the other side of the bridge he picked up the road again and rounded wearyall hill a cathedrallike mood of tranquillity lay over the town as he rode into the centre in a world of constant upheaval that in itself was unnerving something special hung in the air a subtle power filling his lungs calming him he felt at home the centre of town looked as if it had been unaffected by the fall though there was a definite absence of people and all the premises appeared deserted but as he rode forward he was confronted by a wall of trees across the street oak hawthorn rowan so dense that he would not be able to ride through their trunks broke through the tarmac soaring up tall and proud and looking decades old mallory dismounted and tethered his horse before inspecting the barrier more closely there was a tiny path leading through the trees along which he could just about squeeze but he would have difficulty defending himself if he was attacked which he guessed was the whole point no other entrance was visible so reluctantly he pushed between two trunks and began to edge sideways along the route he estimated that the stand of trees was only twenty yards across at best but it was impossible to see the other side and the path didnt take a direct route perfumed flowers of a kind he didnt recognise hung down from the branches and every now and then there were other strange blooms on either side like rare orchids gleaming black with the texture of skin or others like lilies with a cloying aroma after ten minutes mallory began to wonder why he wasnt coming out of the other side fifteen minutes on he had begun to accept that he was in some kind of maze though he couldnt begin to guess how it could continue for such a distance he decided to turn back to see if he had missed a branching path he walked for half an hour and when he found no other path and had not reached his starting point he realised that he was caught in some obscure trap for the next hour he pressed on in one direction he was convinced that he never passed the same point twice and by that stage he realised there had to be some magic at play perhaps the other intruders who had attempted to break into the college were still wandering along the path somewhere ahead of him or had died of starvation and fallen into the vegetation by the wayside it was futile to keep walking mallory leaned against the trunk of a tree to think logically but after a few moments of racking his brains he realised he was having trouble ordering his thoughts cotton wool packed his skull and honey trickled down his spine if he closed his eyes he could probably sleep for a long long time if he had continued along the path for a little while longer he would probably have been lost but there was still a small part of his mind sending warning signals one of them drove him to draw his sword the blue flames erupted around the blade and the air was suddenly singed with the aroma of burned iron the smell cut through the claustrophobic scent of the flowers and the rush of energy gave him a jolt in that instant mallory realised what was happening quickly he tied his handkerchief across his face unsure whether it would do the job with what little energy he had left he leaped up to slash at the hanging flowers and any others he could reach on either side of the path he moved quickly pressing the handkerchief to his nose and mouth with one hand and after a while of hacking and chopping the confusion in his head began to lift either the invisible pollen or the scents themselves were some kind of narcotic that had subtly tied his thoughts in knots not long after the path fell back into sharp relief and the dreaminess receded within minutes he caught a glimpse of buildings on the other side when the exit became visible he broke into a run he was only feet away from breaking out into the open when a vinelike plant with long thorns swung across the path with a life of its own mallory ducked but one of the thorns ripped open the flesh on his cheek it felt as if acid was burning its way into his system his legs grew sluggish refused to obey his mind until he was staggering around like a drunk within seconds he collapsed paralysis flooded through him he was aware of other vegetation moving around him grass and tendrils wrapping around his legs and arms enswathing him in green like a mummy darkness began to close around his vision and he knew that if the paralysis reached his heart he would die slowly he was being tugged into the undergrowth where he would never be found filled with excitement hal waited for nearly three hours before he could finally see reid the chief spy had been in conference from long before breakfast with a succession of ministers military advisors and nondescript people hal had never seen before when he was finally ushered into reids darkened office hal could see the toll the current crisis was taking on the man his face was drawn and tired and it looked as if he hadnt received any good news in a long time but he seemed to brighten a little when he saw hal and offered him a cup of real tea hal took it gratefully before pouring out all he had learned about the poussin painting and the mysterious monument at shugborough hall all i need is your blessing to go to shugborough hal concluded and the resources to do so i know its dangerous it is dangerous reid stressed the enemy is advancing very rapidly theyre already crossing yorkshire and lancashire it wont be long before they reach staffordshire the news was a harsh blow to hal hed always believed that the government would come up with something to stop the enemy in its tracks and had never given the possibility of failure a second thought we havent got a response no effective one weve tried reid dismissed the thought with an irritable wave of his hand im sorry hal said contritely i know you cant talk about it its not that i think the time has come for radical action others dont agree but that was always anticipated he took a long sip of his tea lost to his thoughts for a moment and then added i trust your judgment mister campbell if you feel this is important for the war effort then do it just make sure youre in and out as quickly as possible i can provide you with a helicopter theres no point taking any road vehicles out in this weather id like to take an assistant to help with any local research reid shrugged uninterested the phone rang and reid snatched it up his mood brightening as he listened when he replaced the receiver he said good news the pm has agreed to see you for ten minutes what when now hal grew anxious i havent prepared doesnt matter just speak from your heart with everything thats going down at the moment you probably wont get another opportunity and i believe this to be very important the pm needs to hear it ok hal said hesitantly now really now reid stood up and waited for hal to rise before hurrying him to balliol where the pms private offices were situated normally no one with hals lowlevel clearance ever got anywhere near them once they were outside the prime ministers door reid clapped hal on the back and whispered youll be fine he swung the door open but hal knew he wouldnt be able to speak for a few seconds for his heart was wedged firmly in his throat mallory woke on a rough wooden pallet his head thick and his limbs heavy the aroma of wood smoke filled the air when he finally accepted that he had survived his ordeal he managed to lever himself up on his elbows to look around he was in a roundhouse like ones he had seen as a child in history books about the celtic era a small fire crackled in the centre of the room the smoke winding its way up through the hole in the centre of the turf roof his bed was positioned so that he could see straight out through the open door across the lush somerset countryside the sun was rising framed perfectly between the door jambs golden and large and misty youre bloody lucky mallory strained around to see who had spoken a man leaned on a gnarled wooden staff watching mallory with a suspicious expression mallory guessed he was well into his sixties but he was so fit and lithe that it was difficult to tell his true age he could just as easily have been a hundred his skin was browned from days in the sun but his long grey hair was matted with dirt and grease and hung lank around his shoulders he wore a dirty cheesecloth shirt open at the front shapeless filthy trousers and a pair of wellworn sandals he looked like someone who had spent his life at the music festival they used to hold annually just outside the town if someone hadnt seen you getting wrapped in the defences youd have been gone for good the old man continued who are you mallory said he was already surreptitiously searching for his weapon his scabbard was empty the old man realised what he was doing and gave a brief hard smile where did you get the sword none of your business mallory swung his legs on to the floor his head spinning the old man brandished his staff see this ive split more heads open with it than youve had hot dinners you couldnt beat me even if you were fit and look at you now better answer my questions before youre out cold again im not answering any questions mallory said defiantly the old man moved his bony angular body like a ballet dancer swinging the staff in a blur the tip thudded against mallorys windpipe before he had even seen it coming all right mallory choked the sword thats one of the three great swords too powerful a thing for a weedy little weakarsed runt like you who did you steal if off i didnt steal it it was given to me the old man eased the pressure of the staff a little and eyed mallory curiously who gave it to you a woman called rhiannon mallory saw the flicker of recognition in the old mans face and added in the court of peaceful days youve been to tir na nog mallory nodded and the old man lowered the staff and paced away theyll let any bugger in these days he muttered opening a box in one corner the familiar blue light of the sword illuminated his face youd better take it then but dont think itll give you an advantage mallorys legs still felt weak but when he plucked the sword from the box the familiar energy surged into his limbs youre a brother of dragons the old man asked yes the names mallory the old man snorted sounds like a girls name to me he leaned on his staff once more and surveyed mallorys face im the bone inspector i run this here college ive travelled a long way to get here mallory said im looking for someone who used to be a brother of dragons someone who fought in the fall then youve found him mallory turned to see a tall slim young man with asian features standing in the doorway long black hair framed a handsome face with perfect bone structure and his natural beauty was accentuated by the black clothes he wore my name is shavi he said chapter eleven the other side of life my country is the world and my religion is to do good thomas paine mallory emerged from the roundhouse into the beauty of a glastonbury dawn the air was fresh and sharp a pearly mist drifting ethereally in the hollows shimmering in the golden sunlight the only sound was the birdsong rising up from the green landscape spreading out on all sides far below the roundhouse was set on the side of the tor just beneath the level of the terraces that formed a processional pathway to the top mallory observed that the college covered a vast area from the roundhouse down the hillside across the streets of formerly residential houses and into the grounds of the abbey it encompassed the chalice well nestling on the slopes at the foot of the tor the new college buildings were plain built in a celtic roundhouse style and were dotted throughout the area nature was being allowed to reclaim parts of the old town with new trees sprouting here and there ivy and climbing plants swarming over brick and concrete it was a place that looked at peace with itself breathe deeply shavi said softly let the tension ease from your body here you can be yourself here you can be everything you ever wanted to be his words brought an unexpected juddering sigh from mallory he had the sudden feeling that he wanted to stay there and turn his back on the harsh daily battles of life this is a mystical place shavi continued and now the true power in the land is being allowed to rise up we have returned it to its old use as a college for learning and study of the mysteries of existence here the important things are life and love faith and hope and dont you forget it the bone inspector said gruffly mallory could feel the magic in the very air as shavi and the bone inspector led him to a small campfire where they would watch the dawn turn into day down at the foot of the hill mallory could see people emerging to greet the morning youve taken a lot of people under your wing many feel the call to come in their blood in their dreams shavi looked beatific with his eyes closed as he felt the warmth of the sun on his face nearly two thousand years ago there was a great race of wise men who knew the secrets of the stars and the trees and the land they were almost eradicated by the romans during the invasion druids mallory said their true name was the culture but they never died out to avoid persecution they slipped into the background hiding in plain sight in the old communities dispensing their wisdom where they could ensuring that all the knowledge they had gained was passed down the generations shavi nodded to his grimfaced companion the bone inspector was the last of them in this world the bone inspector said obliquely but here we are building the culture up again training a new generation with the knowledge of millennia past and sending them out into a newly made world everything has been done over so that we can make a fresh start he smiled at mallory and this time we intend to get it right you chose a good place better than wolverhampton symbolism the bone inspector grunted the culture had their best college here but its also the place where the lands power is focused the isle of avalon shavi said in the dark ages glastonbury was as you see it now an island in the waters and marshland of the somerset levels avalon was the celtic heaven the otherworld land of always summer the mystical land of the dead where the fabled apple trees grew he made an expansive gesture to indicate the apple trees that were now growing all over the area glastonbury was considered to be the entrance to the otherworld a place that straddles the borders between this world and the next and is it mallory asked oh yes shavis smile was enigmatic this is the place where legend said arthurs body was sent after his final battle and all places linked with arthurian legend are tied to the otherworld focal points of the blue fire which is the epitome of the power of transformation but you would know all about that bits and pieces no one gave me a manual when i got the job mallory said thats for a good reason so that you grow into it the bone inspector said the only knowledge worth having is the stuff you learn yourself beaming shavi clapped mallory on the back in a surprising show of bonhomie it is so good to meet another brother of dragons how did you cope when you first found out because im worried were making a bit of a mess of it letting the side down shavi glanced at the bone inspector who burst into deep laughter clapping his thigh as if mallory had said the funniest thing in the world you should have seen the last lot in the early days he said as he caught his breath about as pathetic a bunch as you would find anywhere we came together just as the fall was starting to happen shavi said at that time no one really knew what was going on technology was failing magic was springing up all over fabulous beasts were flying over the land but no one would believe in them unless theyd nearly been burned to a crisp and then the gods came back the golden ones the celts called the tuatha de danann when they were first in this world they wanted control over everything except their natural enemies had different ideas the bone inspector said and the fomorii were the nastiest bastards youve ever clapped eyes on ugly as sin shapeshifting meaner even than me with that lot going at it hammer and tongs the brothers and sisters of dragons had to hit the ground running we all had our special abilities which we had to hone shavi continued i was the spiritual one the seer ruth gallagher mastered the craft to become quite formidable i know about her mallory said she became the big witchqueen trained up my girlfriend mallory was overcome with a deep sadness sophie would have loved it there in glastonbury with its peace and abiding spirituality he had thought his grief would diminish even if only a little with each passing day instead it was growing stronger and more difficult to contain there was laura dusantiago who gained great powers over natural things and ryan veitch who became a fearsome warrior shavis face darkened ryan died in the battle of london he was manipulated to betray us and the fifth he was the leader wasnt he jack churchill though we knew him as church shavi grew sad a good man a great man the blue fire burned in him the strongest he filled the symbolic role of king he died in the final battle too though we never found his body and ruth who loved him dearly was brokenhearted she put on a brave face and attempted to get on with her life but the last time i saw her she still looked as if shed had a part of her cut out youve made yourselves quite a reputation mallory said the words gone around about the famous five who saved the world we were just normal people trying to do the best we could try telling that to everyone out there these days youre on a par with the gods everyone keeps talking about how youre going to come back save the world again thats your job now the bone inspector said mallory ignored him his attention was fixed on shavi on the surface he appeared to be a calm simple man but beneath that facade lay complexity mallory was certain if shavi had once been a normal man mallory didnt believe that was the case any more he had grown into the role thrust upon him and even sitting there on the hillside enjoying the dawn he exuded a great strength and charisma that made him a natural leader theres even a movement out there thats elevated ryan veitch to some kind of antichrist mallory said the great betrayer whos going to come back and put the world to rights or wrongs everything gets twisted in the telling your story keeps doing the rounds with little bits added here and there youre all mythical now poor ryan is not coming back shavi said he was misunderstood troubled but not really bad he simply could not overcome his failings he was buried on a hillside in north london better not spread that around or theyll be digging up his body for the resurrection mallory could see that shavi was enjoying the peace he had found after so much sacrifice how could mallory ask him for more i still cant understand what happened the bone inspector shook his head perplexed we all thought jack churchill was destined for big things someone whod lead us on to the next level there were prophecies stories passed down from the earliest days of the culture i was sure they referred to him he had great power inside him certainly shavi said he wasnt allowed to reach his potential he could have changed the world mallory could see that the death of jack churchill still affected shavi deeply shavi broke the conversation by asking mallory to come for breakfast with them they wandered down the tor in the warming sun with shavi greeting everyone he encountered by name mallory saw respect in all the faces and in some something approaching reverence they ate porridge sweetened with honey in a large roundhouse at the foot of the tor it was a communal dining area and throughout the course of their meal men wandered in and out to grab a bite all kinds had made their way to the college from teenage boys to grizzled whitehaired men in their seventies and eighties some resembled old hippies with faded clothes and sandals while others had the cleancut elegance of barristers or the tattooed swarthiness of motor mechanics no women mallory said his memories of the disturbingly testosteroneheavy regime of the salisbury knights templar were still raw the sexes have different strengths shavi said women are better practitioners of the craft at manipulating its subtle energies its raw emotional power ruth gallagher endeavoured to spread the word to women across the country the cultures power has always been shaped by male energies but we would never turn a woman away if she felt the call and im sure ruth would not turn her back on a man its not a monastery the bone inspector said no bromide in the tea no rules about stamping on sex or stopping people drinking or doing whatever they want to do to get out of it besides he added with a gaptoothed grin theyll be out in the world soon enough when the teachings done and then they can get to know all the women they want after they had finished their meal they made their way into the grounds of the abbey where the main teaching was carried out many had already made an early start a group of young men sprawled on the grass before an elderly tutor charts of the night sky spread all around near the main teaching roundhouse a group session of tai chi was being conducted i adopted a very idiosyncratic curriculum shavi said with a smile as they stood to watch the graceful movements it seemed to me that we had an opportunity to enhance the long traditions of the culture with the best of eastern philosophy and belief systems thereby creating a profound new wisdom for this dawning new age about that new age dawning mallory began but shavi silenced him with a hand he did not wish to be rushed i know some of the reasons why you have come he said but lets not discuss them here where we might be overheard shavi led the way to a much smaller roundhouse in a secluded spot in a distant corner of the abbey grounds inside the only light came from a small fire that from the mound of ash and charcoal appeared to have been kept burning for a long time the bone inspector shut the door and barred it this is the only building with locks in the college shavi said it is also protected magically from external attack or from any party viewing from a distance there are many powers who do not want to see this college thrive we are always on our guard they sat around the fire the flickering flames casting their faces a dull red against the shifting shadows theres trouble the bone inspector said or you wouldnt be here trouble mallory said thats one way of describing it its called the void what is it no idea the best description ive got is that its the opposite of life and its here to wipe out everything on earth apparently were some kind of infestation with ideas above our place though i have to admit there are times when i agree with that estimation we are aware of this great darkness shavi said gravely and we have known of its approach i am ashamed to say i am responsible what do you mean mallory asked startled the atmosphere in the roundhouse appeared to be growing more oppressive during the fall one of the rules of existence was broken i was the reason and the cause i should take the blame shavi closed his eyes remembering i died during the struggle mallory felt a frisson at the connection you look pretty good for a dead man he said wryly i remember a place of mists and desolation of a graveyard that went on for ever shavi shivered but i was needed five brothers and sisters of dragons were necessary for the struggle barriers were overthrown and i was brought back to life but there was a price to pay there is always a price to pay before i departed the grey lands i was told these words i have never forgotten them in times to come you will discover that you cannot evade your punishment and it will be inflicted not only upon you but upon your world shavi swallowed his throat dry that voice that voice hidden in shadows so terrible beyond the edge of existence the void is stirring my actions the breaking of the rule of life and death brought us to its attention you have been noticed mallory repeated the words he had heard from one of the gods yes because of me and i have carried this burden with me since the fall shavi said desolately dreading the day when i would hear that the void had arrived selfishly hoping it would not be in my lifetime and now that day has come the bone inspector read mallorys face youre surprised we know whats happening youve got a little paradise going here cut off from the rest of the world you havent even got the bad weather doesnt mean were ignorant of everything thats happening elsewhere were not thick knowing things is part of what we do here the bone inspector said the wintry weather you talk about was what first alerted us shavi said it is the fimbulwinter as foretold in norse mythology the first sign of the end of the world ragnarok three successive winters without any intervening summers and during this time war will follow war and brother will kill brother sounds like situation normal mallory said everything that has happened in recent times has been leading towards this and all of it was foretold in the ancient stories shavi explained the fall the first change of the season leading towards the end autumn if you will and now the fimbulwinter the great winter the herald of the voids arrival the fimbulwinter has been released by the blue hag the cailleach bheur as the world winds down how come you havent got the snows here we have been using subtle magics to hold back the relentless flow of events so that the brothers and sisters of dragons can fight the power in the land is most potent here glastonbury is a node in the fiery network the earth energy can hold back the winter at least for a while so the way i understand it mallory said the brothers and sisters of dragons are the only ones who can hope to oppose the void but i cant even begin to see how that could be possible i had enough trouble with a handful of government thugs there are greater powers at work and you can tap into them the bone inspector said forcefully you might even say you represent them dont ever forget that but fives the magic number right mallory said and there arent five of us two are missing weve got no idea who they are theres a psychosoldier goes by the name of hunter whos off walking the land like kwai chang caine theres me and then theres my girlfriend sophie tallent mallory steeled himself but he still felt queasy saying the words and shes dead shavi and the bone inspector flinched as one so were not even halfway to making a fist of it things dont look good hunter and i decided that the best chance we had was to seek out some of the old brothers and sisters of dragons to make up the full complement it doesnt work like that the bone inspector snapped the pendragon spirit is strong in those who are currently chosen shavi said but much weaker in those who have completed the task for which they were selected i still feel it in me but these days it is like a single flame whereas during the fall it was like a raging fire mallory prodded at the ashes with a stick i cant say as im surprised we always expected a catch so thats it its over theres always hope the bone inspector said so fiercely that mallory thought the old man was going to lean across the fire and hit him thats what you lot are all about my friend is right shavi said you have travelled far to ask for my aid and i will answer the call for how could i not in this time of greatest need it will be an honour to stand shoulder to shoulder with a brother of dragons once more and even if i can be of little use i will strive to do my best as our kind always do mallory was impressed and a little chastened by the levels of decency he saw in the young man sitting opposite him ill come too the bone inspector said no you must stay here shavi was firm if it is possible that we can find some kind of victory it is unlikely that i will return that is not fatalism it is simply probable you will be needed here to continue our work for the new age that we have won and if i do go with you ill be next to bloody useless thats what youre saying isnt it the bone inspector said gruffly shavi laughed and it was an infectious sound that made mallory laugh too despite the darkness of their conversation as they made their way back across the abbey grounds mallory was glad he would have shavi fighting with him even if as he guessed they would have no chance of winning night had fallen by the time hal and samanthas helicopter whipped across the snowblanketed staffordshire countryside towards shugborough hall it felt as if the days were rapidly growing shorter until soon there would be nothing but constant night i still cant believe you got the opportunity to meet the pm samantha said huddled in the depths of her parka as she watched the white world speed by below hes been locked away since all this blew up hes under a lot of pressure i get the impression hes being pulled from pillar to post everyone in the cabinet every advisor seems to have an opinion on what to do everywhere you go you can hear them arguing amongst themselves over dinner in the bars in the corridors i wouldnt fancy being the pm right now but he listened to you didnt he samantha said warmly he listened i dont know if he took anything in though he was so distracted hal recalled the pms face the minute he had stepped into his room so grey and drawn that he was almost unrecognisable there was a report on his desk to which his eyes kept drifting and as they moved towards it hal could see a deep dread in them like a dark pit hal didnt know what the report said but he knew what the pm thought it meant no hope yet strangely that had only enthused hal all the more the pm may not really have paid heed to what hal had said but hal was convinced he was on the right path it was only logical to him that a conventional response would never work against such an unconventional threat the only way to oppose it was to utilise something as strange and illogical and potentially devastating as the threat itself quite clearly that meant something supernatural reid had the right idea with his treasure trove of mysterious artefacts but nothing in there was big enough it needed the brothers and sisters of dragons and whatever grand design they tapped into and after so long feeling weak and ineffectual hal felt as if he was finally living up to whatever was expected of him in his role as a brother of dragons he might not be wielding a sword like mallory or staring death in the face like hunter but he was using his own particular strengths his logical mind his attention to detail his forensic approach to problems it sounded almost laughable to consider those abilities on a par with martial skills but he was sure he would now be able to uncover the great secret that was hinted at by the wish stone the thing that would finally give them the upper hand then he would be a hero and what a great feeling that would be after being a faceless toiler all his life it made it easier to cope with the guilt he felt at running away from his obligation as a brother of dragons during the preceding days at not telling his best friend and at failing to offer support and solidarity when hunter was setting off to fight the unknown basically hed been a coward but not any more were nearly there the pilot turned towards them his voice muffled through the scarf he wore in the chilly cab you still want me to set you down on the village green outside the estate its a long walk hal nodded he knew it would be a hard hike to their destination through the snow but he didnt want to draw attention to what they were doing by bringing the chopper in too close to the hall he had a growing sense of paranoia that the enemy knew what he was doing and would attempt to stop him the pilot brought the chopper down on the common at milford the tiny village next to the shugborough estate now buried somewhere beneath the thick snow hal and samantha jumped out and hurried away as the chopper rose quickly into the sky that part of the staffordshire countryside had been designated a potential danger zone because of its proximity to the wild expanse of cannock chase which had become home to so many inexplicable creatures and events since the fall hal checked his watch they had an hour and a half before the pilot returned it was a clear night sharp as a wolfs tooth with the stars glittering overhead and the moon bright the crunch of their feet in the snow was the only sound when they reached the trees bordering the estate hal looked back to see their line of footprints scarring the pristine white cover the whole countryside was at peace still and sleepy as a christmas card there was an affecting beauty to it so much of humanitys mark had been obscured and what did remain the few houses a lone road sign nestled in the snow as if gradually becoming part of the natural world stone gates marked the entrance to a long lane with trees on either side forming a thick cover overhead even with the moonlight reflected from the snow it was unsettlingly dark anything could be watching their passage waiting for the right moment to strike and they wouldnt know until it was upon them samantha felt it too for they both stopped on the threshold hal felt her fumbling for his hand which she gave a quick squeeze still glad you came he couldnt help whispering of course i just didnt think wed be coming at night or that it would be so isolated you can wait at one of the houses in the village if you like no she said adamantly lets do it she stepped on to the lane before him their progress along the road was slow it wound around the edge of a steep bank so that soon the sight of the gate was lost yet it was still impossible to see how much further they had to go both of them jumped at the slightest noise in the sounddeadened world just branches creaking under the weight of the snow foxes and badgers foraging for food hal told himself but he wasnt so sure there was a strange oppressive atmosphere that grew stronger the further they progressed along the lane it felt very much as though they were moving away from the world they knew into one where some dark power waited for them samantha stayed so close to hal that their shoulders were touching most of the time hal regretted bringing her along not that she couldnt look after herself she would probably be more effective in a fight than he would but because he couldnt imagine her being in any danger and he would never forgive himself if anything happened to her the atmosphere was so tense that most of his energy was taken up searching the trees and listening for fugitive echoes other feet breaking the snow behind or in front sometimes he was sure he heard them other times he convinced himself it was just his imagination finally the lane broke through the trees and deposited them on an area of flat open countryside shugborough hall was visible in the distance against the skyline a large brooding presence with the threatening atmosphere of the lane behind them their mood lightened samantha even laughed in a release of tension then apologised in case hal thought she was going mad as they trudged across the white plain samantha said have you any idea whats happened to hunter hal had considered that question long and hard and guessed that hunter was embroiled in heroism somewhere fighting the good fight no idea he replied blithely you know hunter hes a law to himself thats the problem theyre talking about treason this time some are saying hes deserted do you believe that no of course not hed be the last man out what about all those rumours that he freed the prisoner and they took off together hal guessed this was probably true hunter wouldnt have told hal his plans so that he would be able to stand up to questioning but it was logical that hed seek the support of another brother of dragons why would he do that oh i have no idea samantha said with frustration i cant understand him at all they fell silent as the hall loomed up before them the mansion house looked empty the facade gleaming as white as the snow all around the tencolumned portico hinting at the mysteries of ancient greece two wings spread out on either side giving the building an impressive bulk it looked out across the sweeping fields grand yet stern and brooding do you know where weve got to go samantha whispered hal had researched the hall and its history in such detail that he could find his way around the rambling old pile blindfolded the quickest way to the shepherds monument was to head to the formal gardens on the far side but that would entail walking past the front of the mansion house with its windows like dead eyes and that spooked him for some reason he couldnt explain we go this way he indicated the outline of the nearest path that wound through shrubs past the side of the building its called the lady walk takes you through to the gardens at the back if we follow it around itll bring us to the shepherds monument they moved through another area of thick trees where the feeling of being watched returned in force but then the path led them back into the open along the banks of the river sow its waters slowmoving and black on the other bank the floodplain stretched out towards milford the snow unmarked nobody around hal said to reassure them both another feeling descended on them as they left the cover of the trees and moved along the river bank not oppressive or threatening this time but still potent it felt as though they had pushed through a veil into another room where the mood was alive with numerous possibilities can you feel it samantha said her voice hushed but intrigued it feels as if somethings about to happen the sensation was so strong that hal looked around to see if they had moved through some kind of physical barrier to their right they were presented with a vast area of formal lawns with stone steps leading the eye to the magnificent rear aspect of the mansion house in the foreground was an ornate pond with a fountain in the form of a cherub and a swan a ruined monument rose up on the riverbank on their left but as they passed it samantha grabbed hals arm tightly and grew rigid as she looked up at a statue of a druid mounted on the top it moved she said im sure it did hal watched the statue for a long moment something about the face unsettled him were just getting jumpy he said youre right im sorry but samantha couldnt help glancing back several times as they continued on their way the crunch of their footsteps echoed loudly over the still gardens as the path wound back towards the house once more passing into another heavily wooded area a strange building shaped like a chinese pagoda appeared out of the gloom to their left what is it with all these odd monuments and buildings samantha said ive been to one or two of these old houses but none of them had things like this that ones called the chinese house hal said in the mideighteenth century two brothers from the anson family who owned the hall restyled the house and gardens thomas anson had travelled pretty extensively maybe he brought back designs he particularly liked theres a doric temple in the ancient greek style further on he was a member of the society of dilettanti who were basically a bunch of connoisseurs of history and architecture who went all around the eastern med collecting knowledge and artefacts and generally showing off their good taste the word died in his throat what is it samantha asked i dont know he began hesitantly maybe that society was only interested in art and culture or perhaps they were searching for something something linked to the mystery of the shepherds monument more connections clicked into place in hals mind he began to glimpse a grand scheme reaching back through history a lot of the societies back then were interested in esoteric knowledge but hid it behind a facade of mundaneness secret knowledge shouldnt be for the masses that was the general belief painters musicians writers theyd often use codes sacred geometry all sorts of things to bury secrets in their works so that only the initiated would find them youve done a lot of research samantha said impressed hal stared at the chinese house symbolism he mused to himself before turning to samantha excitedly things that look normal and meaningless on the surface but which have hidden meaning underneath secret symbols in his rush of thoughts he was starting to gabble and he could see from samanthas face that he wasnt making sense the shepherds monument clearly means something beyond what it appears to be on the surface a garden ornament what if all the things in this garden are part of the wider secret all linked all meaning something when theyre placed in context suddenly excited he grabbed samanthas hand and pulled her along the path finally they came upon the shepherds monument just off the path to their right set in an avenue of shrubs with a wall of trees behind it hal felt a shock run up his spine when he saw it everything about its position in the landscape suggested that it was important the atmosphere is even more electric here samantha said quietly there has to be something in this did you ever doubt me hal walked slowly down the short avenue the crunching echo of his footsteps now sounded strange distorted when he finally stood before the monument none of the pictures he had seen in the books had prepared him for its scale he was dwarfed by its size the reversed image from poussins painting was only one small though central part of the whole monument it was framed by two giant stone columns topped by a megalithic block with another ornamental block on top on the large stone that straddled the columns two faces had been carved one smiling one sad like the greek masks for tragedy and comedy the size and shape of the framing monument reminded hal of nothing less than one of stonehenges trilithons underpinning the whole monument was the mysterious inscription ouosvavv with a d and an m carved partly beneath the line another clue left by the society of dilettanti perhaps its meaning now lost to time cautiously hal reached forward and scraped his fingers across the rough stone surface of the poussin relief picking out the legend et in arcadia ego carved on the tomb but as he removed his hand a large blue spark jumped out from his fingertips and crackled into the monument hal jumped back in shock what was that samantha gasped before hal could answer flickers of blue energy appeared on the relief sizzling around the outline of the tomb before moving down the monument though the ground was thick with snow hal could see the sapphire electricity sparking beneath the surface as it surged away from the monument in straight lines what are you looking at hal turned to samantha who was staring at him puzzled the electricity or whatever it is he pointed to the lines of force moving out across the gardens samantha followed the line of his finger but shook her head i cant see anything you cant hal was baffled the blue light now burned brightly through the snow the lines reaching out across the landscape far into the distance interconnecting a network of fire the brilliant blue energy was the same as that which formed the image locked into the wish stone hal could feel it resonating inside him filling him with a tremendous exhilaration he felt as if he could do anything that he was linked to everything was this part of what it meant to be a brother of dragons was that why samantha was blind to the power there was a sudden rush in his heart and the blue light exploded upwards from the ground soaring into the sky to form a cathedrallike structure high over the shepherds monument hal was stunned by the wonder of what was happening around him he turned back to the shepherds monument and was shocked to see that it was transforming the blue light had made the stone relief translucent and now the image had turned the right way around as hal watched the stonework began to fold out like two shutters its like a window samantha said entranced you can see that of course i can hals heart thumped even harder when he realised that what he was seeing through the gap where the relief had been was not the trees behind the monument but another landscape entirely hal made out rolling grassland and in the distance a thick forest before a row of breathtaking mountains in that place the sun was just rising casting the land in a magical light picking out the mist in the hollows illuminating the dawn clouds the ethereal quality was palpable and sparked in hal a deep yearning where is that the awe in samanthas voice told hal that she felt it too otherworld he said softly tir na nog the land of always summer across the magical landscape hal could just make out tracings of the blue energy that was spreading out across the countryside behind him it was in everything linking this world and the otherworld and the instant that thought entered his head more pieces of the mystery fell into place arcadia is the otherworld he said poussin is pointing us towards something in the otherworld the image here is reversed because tir na nog is the flipside of our world its telling us to view it from the other side a surge like a strong wind came through the window from otherworld it felt like a bubble expanding as it passed through hal and continued outwards and when he looked around he was shocked once again the gardens had been transformed the snow gone the quality of light that of dawn on a summers day thats why this place is so important hal said jubilantly for some reason this is one of the special spots where our world and the otherworld intersect thats what you could feel earlier the echo of it but feel it now i can samantha exclaimed its so different i feel as if im drunk thats just the start of the mystery though hal said theres more weve just got to keep pushing suddenly there was movement in the bushes nearby hal whirled just in time to catch a glimpse of a small man with the legs of a goat the figure was naked to the waist and small horns protruded from his forehead he winked at hal as he danced off clutching a set of pan pipes more activity was apparent all around the garden drawing hal and samantha away from the monument none of it was threatening a magical air hung over the whole landscape and hal found himself grinning for no apparent reason samantha caught his hand and they ran to investigate laughing as the jaunty music of the pan pipes floated across the balmy garden bats flitted in and out of the trees joined here and there by what hal at first took to be fireflies until he realised they were tiny people with gossamer wings glowing with an inner light this must be what its like over there hal said ecstatically then another thought struck him we could use this place to cross over they followed the path around in a state of wonder inside the chinese house coloured shadows moved across the walls it looked to hal like dragons winding sinuously across a landscape there was fire and light and a tremendous sense of wellbeing at the ruined monument by the river the statue of the druid was now gone replaced by the faun who perched on the highest point playing his pipes hal wondered if the druid was the faun locked in stone waiting to be released by the power from tir na nog nearby the fountain that had earlier been dead and dismal in the snow was now gushing but instead of water blue fire flowed from the swans mouth joining the network of interconnecting lines that spread out over the landscape this is amazing samantha said in awe this is what it could be like always can you feel it hal its like healing like im getting a shot of something thats making me fit enough to do anything i like that he replied this is what it could always be like they spent the next halfhour wandering the garden in a state of awe engulfed by sights and sounds and sensations that were so powerful it felt like a drug trip there was magic in everything the little creatures the nature sprites the tree spirits were everywhere as if every living thing and every object had a shadow life hidden away until a switch was thrown that allowed the true self to come out into the open the power was so evident so great that hal was convinced the war could be won if only humanity could tap into what had been released into the garden that was part of the secret of the shepherds monument he was sure and it was linked in some way to the part yet undiscovered it was a double mystery the reversal of the poussin painting on the relief was the clue two sides both inextricably bound together they had broken the symbolic code of one side the mystery of the reversed painting which was tied into the anagram of the legend i tego arcana dei begone i conceal the secrets of god now they knew what the secret of god was the blue fire hidden in force in the otherworld but the flipside of the mystery the true side still escaped him et in arcadia ego and in arcadia i exist if the ego wasnt death and he was sure it wasnt then who was it hals thoughts were disturbed by a sudden change in the ambience of the summery garden a note of tension intruded on the calm like jagged violins in a pastoral musical passage samantha felt it too for she looked around uncomfortably the music of the pan pipes faded and when hal glanced at the ruin he saw that the faun was gone and the little flying people were rapidly disappearing into the trees a stillness descended i think we should get out of here right now hal said but as they hurried along the path a shadowy figure emerged from the thick vegetation ahead of them it was huge its outline moving as if seen through a heat haze as it stepped forward hal was appalled to see that it was made up of the writhing bodies of animals badgers and foxes rabbits and mice all melded together to give the thing shape yet each creature still alive in some way jaws snapped eyes revolved crying out in horror samantha threw herself backwards on to the ground hal hauled her back to her feet and turned the other way but from the direction of the chinese house another figure was drawing closer this one constructed entirely out of birds what are they samantha said her horror a keen edge in her voice the clearest escape route was along the broad walk across the ornamental lawns leading to the mansion house hal propelled samantha in that direction as they ran past the fountain hal saw that the expression on the statue of the cherub clutching the swan had now transformed into one of abject terror leaping up the rows of steps they reached the garden doors through the glass the interior was in darkness and empty hal yanked at the handles and the doors swung open with surprising ease why do you want to go in there samantha said frantically looking around to see where their pursuers were both obscene creatures were rapidly drawing closer but their forms clearly precluded them from running or from any particular agility we can go straight through the hall and out of the front door quickest way back to the lane inside the house still revelled in its grandeur classical works of art hung on the walls antique furniture lined the corridors covered with vases and objets dart gathering dust all untouched by looters who would only have been interested in food and weapons what are those things samantha gasped her eyes inexorably drawn to the monstrous creatures the enemys lieutenants hunter called them the lord of flesh and the lord of birds in his report hal replied the enemy shouldnt have reached here yet samantha was right but hal didnt want to frighten her by replying none of the zombielike troops were crossing the adjoining land the lords were alone which suggested to hal that they were there for a purpose and the purpose was him was it because they somehow knew he was a brother of dragons and they were determined to eradicate the main line of defence was that possible if so he was in more danger than hed ever anticipated hal noticed something else that was just as disturbing the lines of blue fire burning along the ground warped wherever they came into contact with the approaching enemy like opposing polarities of a magnet in the distance the lines had already disappeared and the snowy night landscape had returned to normal as if the energy had been cancelled out somehow dont worry well be out of here in no time hal said but as they skidded across the polished floor to the front of the house hal realised the lie in his words two more lieutenants were approaching the lord of lizards green and scaly against the snowy background and the lord of bones a rictus grin adding a macabre touch to its hideous appearance oh samanthas voice was small and fragile but devastating to hal with its awareness of the grim reality they both faced dont worry he said desperately dont worry with samantha clutching his hand he raced down a dark corridor off the hall and turned into the library ancient books untouched in decades lined the walls beneath an ornate plasterwork ceiling the windows though were barred and hal quickly pulled samantha out of the room and back to the hall the lord of flesh was on the veranda at the garden doors and the lord of bones was ascending the steps at the front ok ok i know what im doing hal said as much to reassure himself as samantha all the windows on the ground floor would be barred but not necessarily the ones upstairs but he was gambling with their lives if he was wrong they would be trapped on the first floor until the four lords came for them he had no other choice he dragged samantha towards the main hall staircase and they took the steps two at a time im sorry i got you into this hal said when they reached the first floor i shouldnt have brought you i decided to come samantha said and dont give up yet despite her bravado though she couldnt disguise the tremor of fear in her voice they ran into a room off the upstairs hall and hal managed to wrench a window open a blast of freezing air rushed in followed by a loud crashing as the doors downstairs were rent apart they stepped out on to the roof of the columned porch beyond which was a long drop to the hard forecourt below hal headed to his left where there was a short jump to another flat area of roof on the wing but samantha held back i cant do it she said im no good with heights youre no good with getting torn apart by monsters either hal urged youve got to samantha hold my hand well do it together reluctantly samantha took his hand hal was surprised shed obeyed him her limbs were taut and hal was afraid shed freeze up at the jump and drag them both over the edge at the last moment he gave her a hard yank that propelled her into the air they sprawled together on the flat roof winded in a second hal was up his heart thundering so loudly that it almost drowned out the noise of terrible damage being done that was emanating from the mansion house from the flat roof they could climb on to a pitched roof at the end of the wing it was slick with snow and ice and after only a few feet hal found himself slithering with increasing speed towards the drop samantha screamed hal spread his hands out in a bid to create some traction and grabbed the edge of a broken tile that cut deeply into his fingers the pain as the blood bubbled out helped him to clear the fear from his mind cautiously he spreadeagled his body and edged along the roof stopping every time he felt himself begin to slip above him samantha followed suit it seemed to take an age to reach the end of the roof his muscles burning hal located a drainpipe and with some difficulty slithered down it when he reached the bottom he looked up samantha was hesitating hal i dont think i can she began you made the jump you can do this hal hissed i cant she looked around nervously as the noise from the house grew even more intense it sounded as if the place was being wrecked you have to hal thought for a moment then said what would hunter say if he saw you dithering up there he wouldnt let you live it down samantha teetered on the brink before determination crept into her face hesitantly she lowered herself on to the drainpipe and began to climb down hals relief was shortlived halfway down the drainpipe she began to lose her grip and a second later she was falling hal threw himself forward just in time the impact knocked him to the ground and stunned him for a second but then samantha was helping him to his feet and thanking him profusely between sobs the wideopen plain stretched away from the house to the trees and the lane leading out of the estate the thick snow would make it hard going but hal guessed they would probably be able to move faster than their pursuers let me go on ahead to check theres nothing waiting for us then get set to run hal whispered before samantha could reply he was running low across the thick snow he reached a fence at the side of a nowburied road and scanned in all directions but saw nothing large snowflakes began to drift down a new storm was on its way just as hal had decided that the way was clear samantha cried out scrambling back towards the house he found her kicking and screaming in the grip of the lord of birds who had just emerged from around the side of the mansion house thoughts burst through hals confusion and desperation why hadnt he checked that they were all inside the building and what was he going to do now the lord of birds effortlessly pulled samantha in closer she shrieked in pain as pecking beaks erupted from the confusion of the lords form to tear her flesh blood splattered on the virginal snow beneath where she struggled it was that final sight that cleared hals mind to a dull white noise acting purely on instinct he threw himself against the lords bulk in an attempt to unbalance it the sensation of the feathers and beaks roiling against him was sickening but he managed to grab hold of samanthas wrist and pull her hand free of the lords grip a second later samantha dropped to the snow and it was only when the lord of birds grabbed him with its feathery hands that hal realised that samantha was superfluous hal had been the real target hal craned his neck around as the lord of birds pulled him in samantha was sprawled in the snow dazed and trying to catch her breath run he yelled get back to the village dont wait for me samantha began to argue but hal yelled so furiously that she jumped to her feet and set off across the snow as fast as she could go pain burst all over hals body as the birds pecked at him with a terrifying savagery as the lord wrapped its arms around hal its aim became apparent hal would be pulled into the seething morass and consumed blood splashed into his eyes from the beak of a ferocious thrush that was tearing at his cheek his midriff was growing wet and warm now numb from repeated attacks he attempted to get some leverage so that he could prise himself free but the lord of birds was too strong and its form too shifting for hal to get a foothold there was nothing he could do as he forced his head back to protect his eyes a single thought came into his head like a clarion call with difficulty he wriggled one bloody hand through flapping wings and into his pocket the bloodeye met his fingers like an old friend all the hidden memories of its usefulness revealed once more the words came to him like a dream far and away and here almost lost beneath the wild bird calls and frantic flapping hal didnt know what happened next he found himself flying through the air knocked free from the grip of the lord of birds by a tremendous impact that stunned him as he lay in the freezing snow head spinning the smell of wet fur filled his nostrils the deafening roar of a tremendous beast echoed all around from the corner of his eye hal saw a frenzied shape attack the lord of birds feathers flew everywhere dismembered bird heads plopped into the snow beady eyes still rolling shocked alert hal drove himself backwards with his heels until he was far enough away to see properly what was occurring the lord of birds was being torn apart by an oversized man hal got glimpses through the wall of feathers furs a widebrimmed hat a string of dead conies swinging wildly and realised it was bearskin the sharptoothed drinker from the mysterious inn who had given hal the bloodeye hal got to his feet but he was transfixed by the inhuman fury of the attack the lord of birds was being driven back falling apart becoming less human in form with each passing moment but when bearskin glanced back in hals direction hal immediately saw why his rescuers face was partially transformed fur sprouted from the cheeks and forehead the nose and mouth protruding in the first stage of a snout the eyes big and black his hands now covered with fur and tipped with long jagged talons hal was horrified by the ferocity he saw there and he feared that once bearskin had disposed of the lord of birds the shapeshifter would turn on him leave bearskin roared at him the word barely distinguishable from the incoherent snarl of an animal hal could see from bearskins eyes that he also thought he might not be able to control himself hal scrambled to his feet and ran just as the other lords began to emerge from the front of the mansion house foaming at the mouth bearskin descended on the lord of birds in a renewed frenzy of tearing and rending by the time hal had reached the line of samanthas footprints there remained only a wide arc of twitching bodies and torn wings and a faint purple mist where the lord of birds had stood slowly breaking up in the snowy wind bearskin turned on the other lords but it was clear that he wouldnt stand a chance against the three of them instead he awkwardly manoeuvred the blunderbuss that hung at his side and fired a tremendous volley that rang off the halls white walls hal didnt wait to see if it had any impact on the fastapproaching lords though the thick snow made his leg muscles burn hal ran without stopping until he reached the halfway point between the house and the place where the lane entered the trees he allowed himself one brief glance back something that looked like a large brown bear was moving away on all fours at great speed already the memory of the bloodeye had faded from hals mind but the lords would haunt him for ever and the knowledge that they were hunting for him filled him with dread yet he had learned an important part of the mystery that he was sure was key to the survival of humanity and he was increasingly optimistic that the final pieces would soon fall into place ahead of him samantha was just making her way into the trees and there was his other great hope hed saved her life and if he could help save the day then perhaps she would finally see him as more than a good friend her love was worth fighting for more than anything else chapter twelve the heart in winter beware for the time may be short winston churchill needles of ice blasted into the parts of hunters face that he hadnt been able to cover as he led his horse blindly into the blizzard it had been blowing with fierce intensity for several hours and he desperately needed to find shelter but it was night and no lights glimmered anywhere he could no longer feel his feet or hands despite the heavy boots and thick gloves his mounts large body mass coped with the cold better than he did but there was a limit to how much it could endure hunter had only made it this far with the help of the horses strength on foot he wouldnt stand a chance his lifeless frozen body would be covered by snow within the hour never to be found again in his left hand he held the lantern up high but the illumination barely spread more than three feet ahead he was using it more in the hope that someone would see it and welcome him out of the storm than to light his way but he knew that was a dim prospect he was regretting his decision to let events lead him to his destination there so close to death it felt childish and nonsensical not the positive affirmation he had entertained when he had first embarked on his path his choice was going to end up killing him from north hinksey hed taken the a and then the a moving north before getting lost in the snow he had been hoping to reach banbury and some shelter where he could rest a while but there was little chance of that now just visible in the field next to the road was an old barn snow heaped against its walls and lay heavy on the roof but the door was accessible it looked poor shelter but it was all he had and after several minutes of clearing snow with frozen hands he could open the door wide enough to gain access for himself and his horse inside it was as barely adequate as he had imagined cold wind blew through broken planks around the door but there were numerous bales of hay that he could position to create a smaller shelter within the larger structure his horse perked up slightly at being out of the freezing night so hunter left it alone long enough to break up some old discarded furniture for a fire the barn was large and draughty enough for the smoke to escape and soon hunter was sitting next to the blaze pondering his bleak immediate future it wasnt long before the warmth and the weariness took their toll not long after he had slipped into an exhausted sleep he woke with a sudden start calling out his fathers name instantly he realised he wasnt alone a hulking figure sat on the other side of the fire its face obscured by the drifting smoke hunters hand quickly went to his gun but the figure didnt appear concerned it was difficult to assess the mans height in a sitting position but hunter guessed he must have been well over seven feet tall the smoke cleared a little to reveal long black hair and a black beard and eyes just as dark though burning intensely stay your hand brother of dragons the giant said in a deep resonant voice hunters fingers hovered over the weapon for a moment longer then retreated who are you the tooth fairy i am called the caretaker hunter recalled the encounter with this being that hal had related to him just before his life had taken a turn into the twilight zone the caretaker pointed ominously to the lantern its flame flared as his finger came close i am the lamplighter even when darkness falls i am there to ensure that a single flame still burns hunter lounged against a hay bale and rubbed the sleep from his eyes mallory thought i was crazy just wandering around waiting for something to happen well i bet hes the one frozen up to his neck in a ditch somewhere so youre one of the gods right one of the tuatha de danann the caretaker gave a faint enigmatic smile there are higher powers there is always something higher the goddess has returned reunited with her male reflection he watched hunters face intently i am an intermediary a guide yes i get it a caretaker you put the chairs away after the party hunter expected a negative response but the caretaker simply nodded i do and i put them out before the party begins it is my job to ensure that the master plan progresses smoothly a higher plan so vast and timeless that it is beyond your comprehension you can barely see even a part of it from your narrow perspective fragile creature yet you and your brothers and sisters have a large part to play you see theres one thing youre not getting im not a reliable person i like to drink i like to have sex preferably with as many women as possible i like to raise hell not so hot on doing the right thing moral compass needle all over the place hunter shifted as the caretaker stared right into him for a second he had the impression that he was a small boy again standing before his father the image was so potent that hunter could almost smell the starch of his fathers dress uniform you in a position to tell me exactly whats going on hunter asked the caretaker explained carefully about the void its nature and what it was planning making it plain to hunter that only the brothers and sisters of dragons could oppose it the lantern is called the wayfinder the caretaker continued hunter glanced at the blue flame as events began to fall into place he had been meant to find it of course it was important it is my lantern the caretaker continued and it is a part of existence not a lantern at all but that is how you see it that flame hunter began blue the caretaker nodded it is a link with the pendragon spirit the power in the wayfinder is a part of you brother of dragons the flame points the way follow it and it will lead you to the person you seek thats handy it would have been nice to know that before i started going around in circles in a blizzard freezing my arse off existence helps when you truly need it brother of dragons for the most part you must rely on your own strengths i get it free will hunter thought about this for a moment ok i like that so now ive got a direction how am i going to get where im going through this snow with a nag thats almost dead on its feet you dont have a magic snowplough tucked away somewhere do you the blizzard will break tomorrow you will have a brief period for travel before the next storm sets in there is food for you and your horse in a farm further along the road the occupants died when their fuel ran out hunter felt strangely calmed by the giants presence all you need to tell me now is that everything is going to work out fine the caretaker shook his head slowly whats the point in having a master plan if it doesnt all pan out nicely if everything occurred as it was meant to occur there would be no need for you would there brother of dragons there would be no need for fragile creatures or gods or anything this would just be a picture never changing there must be a chance for success or failure why the caretaker gave his enigmatic smile once again existence has put its faith in you brother of dragons he stood up drawing himself to his full height and his shadow fell across hunter your light burns brightly in the dark existence has chosen well he stepped away from the fire towards the door but then a cloud of smoke obscured him and when it cleared he had gone hunter stared into the fire for a while ruminating over what he had been told and then he shrugged lay down and went straight to sleep what do you think is happening back in our world thackeray sat in the vast bloodred hall of the court of souls ease listening to the sounds of conflict coming from the walls sophie stood nearby she was trying to prepare herself for what she was about to do but it was difficult to concentrate with the bizarre acoustics of the hall where even the quietest whisper reverberated loudly time runs differently here in our world a second could have passed or years maybe even decades thats why youre so keen to get back sophie sighed its hard to tell whether all this is futile perhaps the worst has already happened back home there might not even be a world to return to they fell silent allowing the clatter of swords and axes to take over the battle sounds were punctuated by dull vibrating eruptions as projectiles crashed against the walls launched from one of the many mysterious siege machines the enemy had in their employ it was only a matter of time before the court fell the small swarthy men scaled the walls like spiders in wave after wave the tuatha de danann led by lugh but invigorated by caitlins ferocity drove them back time and again but sheer force of numbers meant that the defenders would inevitably be overwhelmed sooner or later sophie had to make her move before it was too late but caitlin was the dangerous xfactor if she discovered what sophie was planning the outcome would likely be bloody how are you coping with caitlin sophie asked hesitantly thackeray rubbed at the tension in his neck he was a man out of his depth im not coping she looks like caitlin she talks like her but when i stare into her eyes i cant tell whether she wants to have sex or slit my throat i know its none of my business but i cant work out your relationship its complicated thackeray was going to leave it there but the emotional pressure was too much i met her just after her husband and son died i fell in love with her straight away the minute i saw her i know it sounds pathetic but its true shes got this amazing quality something special buried really deep it got me in an instant and i couldnt let go if i tried i think she loves me too or at least likes me a lot and i know this is pathetic too but id even settle for that he sighed but its still too soon after her tragedy all the grief and guilt are still swirling around i understand that maybe someday thats what i thought youd say sophie had grown more and more impressed with thackeray not because he was romantic and sensitive but because he had enough steel in him to admit it how about you thackeray said boyfriend back home yes hes a brother of dragons too at least youve got some common ground then he said ruefully sometimes you lot seem like you come from another planet youre missing him more than you know nothings going to stop me from getting back to him sophie flinched as the missing portion of her emotional memory made all her recollections of mallory dissipate like mist in the sun they were interrupted by the thunder of the enormous oaken doors being flung open caitlin marched in clutching two axes with harvey hurrying close behind almost bent double under the weight of a variety of weapons we need axes lots of axes caitlin announced shes going to be the death of me harvey dumped the weapons on the floor with a clatter here take your pick arrows arent effective when theyre coming up the walls caitlin said and we probably havent got enough anyway even with the fletchers working overtime but axes she wielded an axe in each hand we can just decapitate them as they come over the top the falling bodies will dislodge others two axes to each man doubles the kill tiring though sophie observed we do what we have to caitlin said coldly im going back to the ramparts coming well follow on sophie subtly motioned to thackeray to stay behind and hoped caitlin hadnt seen it caitlin ordered harvey to pick up a selection of the weapons and follow her he meekly obliged once they had departed thackeray said curiously what are you planning theres a way out of here a way back home thackeray was stunned silent for a second then said nonplussed why didnt you tell the others because its not as simple as it sounds ive been weighing it up ever since i found out about it i still dont think its necessarily the right way to go forward but we dont have a choice any more its dangerous yes morally emotionally probably physically if caitlin finds out sophie steeled herself she couldnt back out now theres a place called the watchtower a physical building in some kind of space between the worlds its possible to reach it from anywhere and access anywhere from it as long as you have the right key and you have the right key and the right keyhole she said with dark humour i can use my craft to open a way to the watchtower everything i learned back home works so much more effectively in tir na nog i can be powerful here thackeray really powerful given the right impetus youre scaring me now thackerays troubled dark eyes searched her face then id better get to the point imagine the craft as a bullet im the gun but you need some kind of focused energy to send the bullet shooting out of the barrel for small things you can often do it with the mind say with words that set free subconscious energy ritual works better but the best is sex the energy freed during sex is like rocket fuel to mix my metaphors you need to have sex with you thackerays expression was almost comical no no he protested holding up his hands subconsciously as a barrier i mean its not that youre not an attractive woman you are of course you are but its caitlin i know i love her i know harvey would do it in a flash sophie shook her head its not just about having sex thackeray it has to be with the right person the right battery bluntly harvey isnt the one youve got a lot of sexual energy ready to be released i dont know if i should be flattered or embarrassed he jumped to his feet and ranged around the room anxiously theres got to be another way there isnt thats what ive been considering long and hard dont you think i would have done this the minute i found out about it if it was that easy youve got to do this thackeray not just for us here but for all the people back home thackeray ran his hands through his hair in impotent silence ill tell you something thackeray ive never had to go to the lengths of invoking the survival of the human race to persuade a man to have sex with me before im sorry a flicker of fear crossed his face if caitlin loves me and if she finds out if the morrigan finds out then we have to make sure she doesnt find out lets get this done the sooner the better while shes out on the ramparts slaughtering thousands as if punctuating sophies words another projectile crashed against the walls shaking the court to its very foundations come closer sophie held out her arms thackeray twitched like a nervous schoolboy it had taken almost an hour to get the preparations just right they had moved to the privacy of the bedroom chamber in the large suite that had been set aside for sophie after her arrival in the court of souls ease the furniture had been moved to one side and a sacred space inscribed on the floor with red dye and candles shed had to guess at the cardinal points for her special sigils compasses didnt always make a great deal of sense in that place incense drifted teasingly through the air and shed forced thackeray to have two stiff shots of the dark potent spirit that many of the courts residents consumed at the end of their meals despite being a little tipsy he was still on edge and that made sophie even more anxious i dont know if i can go through with this he said this isnt helping the mood thackeray im sorry sophie turned and lit some dried herbs in a small brazier double double toil and trouble just get your clothes off thackeray she heard him mutter something wicked this way comes and then she turned and grabbed him and started to pull his clothes from him she stripped off herself quickly and then used her hands and her mouth to get him erect i dont know if i can keep it up he muttered dont worry ill help just close your eyes and think whatever you need to she lay down in the circle and opened her legs pulling him into her as he began to move backwards and forwards eyes clamped shut a surge of emotion hit her and she had to blink away the tears she had thought it would be easy pure mechanics but all she could think of was mallory and that she was betraying him and that she missed him so much she must have grown tense for he whispered are you ok im fine keep going her emotions were too raw and the only way she could continue was to focus in that gap where her meeting with mallory had once been she found it ironic how something so painful now had a use without that loss she might have had to give up they continued until they grew hot and sweaty and arousal took over from the regular flow of thoughts in her mind sophie shaped the energy and infused a word of power she managed to hold on to her orgasm so that they climaxed at the same time and then she said the word of power with force the flash she experienced may have been in the room or in her own head but when she looked around there was a doorway shimmering in one wall like oil on water and on the other side she could see a long corridor lit by flickering torches come on she whispered lets get the others thackeray withdrew and they both dressed quickly but then sophie noticed something strange the bedroom door was slightly ajar and she was sure she had closed it tightly after they had first entered how long will the portal stay open lugh stood in the centre of the bed chamber surveying the entry to the watchtower ceridwen stood behind him thackeray and harvey waited in one corner while caitlin remained a dark brooding presence nearby there was no sign that she had any suspicions about what had happened it wont stay open for ever sophie replied it should remain long enough for you to carry out some kind of evacuation lugh was troubled but will every member of this vast court be able to pass through before it closes i fear for the safety of any left behind there will be a slaughter ceridwen said bluntly we could do with your help back in the fixed lands sophie said but you have to do what you have to do we need to go lugh nodded curtly and stepped back ceridwen gave sophie a brief hug if we can we shall join you shortly sister of dragons sophie turned to caitlin ready lets do it caitlin gripped one axe tightly and adjusted the other strapped to her back sophie nodded to thackeray and harvey to follow and then led the way into the unknown the general steeled himself before he entered kirkhams private lab he thought that over the years he had learned to be immune to bad news but the latest report had shaken him to the core the estimates of the size of the enemy army were such that he had berated the messenger for typing too many digits but there had been no mistake the enemy had moved slowly south and west converting the population to their cause and converting was the ultimate euphemism for what they actually did hundreds of thousands had been slaughtered and remade in the image of the lamentbrood all of them now marching to the beat of war and birmingham was next he barged into the lab without knocking the model town lay gathering dust to one side while kirkham examined a purple gem illuminated by a powerful spotlight what have you got for me the general barked so sharply that kirkham almost swept the jewel on to the floor im working on nothing thats the answer isnt it the general had told himself he wouldnt lose his temper but the blood was thundering in his head months spent tinkering away down here the hope of the nation invested in you and youve got nothing to show for it the general turned to the model of the town and thrust it off the table it shattered noisily in a heap on the floor i need results the general raged i need you to get one of those one of those bloody magic wands working anything kirkham blinked at him from behind his glasses theres nothing thats reliable general he said calmly certainly nothing that would deal with the magnitude of this problem i thought the nuclear deterrent was weve tried nukes blast it the general sucked in a deep breath searching for his dignity we dropped one over tamworth never exploded the pilot said it looked as if it disappeared into some kind of black hole weve sent in troops on skirmishes quick in quick out aiming for minimal casualties they couldnt get out quickly enough more fuelair explosives anthrax from porton down nerve agents as the rage rushed out of him he sagged looking ten years older in an instant we have to face the fact that conventional weapons are not going to work from now on were down to wishing im sorry i dont have more helpful news general the things im dealing with are beyond scientific understanding certainly at current knowledge levels we lost our only hope when hunter went mad and smuggled that brother of dragons out the general said if i find him ill shoot him myself i should have done it a long time ago even if we had access to the brother of dragons i dont think we would have had time to make any breakthrough in finding a way across the dimensional barriers kirkham began to pick up pieces of the broken model and replace them on the table but the enemy is not the tuatha de danann this enemy may not even have come from the otherworld so what were now easy pickings for any higher power anywhere across the universe multiverse kirkham corrected pedantically you really are our last hope kirkham the general walked towards the door not knowing where he was going next or what he was going to do desperate times require desperate measures and these are the most desperate of times do whatever you can dont worry about protocol dont worry about chain of command just pull something out of the bag after the general had left kirkham waited until the sound of his footsteps had faded away and then picked up the phone its dennis kirkham he said quietly im with you true to the caretakers word the bad weather held off long enough for hunter to make good progress with his horse and himself fed at the next farm he followed the wayfinders blue flame northeast from banbury along the a to daventry where he helped starving residents fight against a local landowner who had taken ninety per cent of the food that had been stored hunter killed four heavily armed thugs and then threw the greedy landowner to the mob departing amidst cheers and the formation of a new legend he wasnt surprised to realise that he liked the adoration from daventry he cut crosscountry to market harborough where he stocked up on supplies and then continued across the leicestershire countryside it was hard going in the frozen landscape away from the shelter of trees the hungry wind flayed his skin and cut through even the thickest clothes it was even worse when he passed stamford and moved into the lincolnshire flatlands where there was little cover and the land resembled the antarctic wastes he found the a an old roman road which was marginally easier to travel than the country lanes and headed north despite the hardship he never entertained the slightest notion that he might fail it was all down to will the desire to win the hunger for survival and he had demonstrated throughout his life that he was more than blessed with those qualities finally on a blueskied sunny morning when the snow glared so brightly it hurt his eyes he arrived in lincoln the city was dwarfed by the imposing cathedral church of st mary perched atop a twohundredfoothigh limestone plateau overlooking the river witham its gothic architecture given a magical appearance by the snow hunter ventured past the city limits with a degree of apprehension since the fall much of the country had been gripped by lawlessness murder was commonplace in populated areas and hunter guessed things would be even worse in the grip of an ice age that threatened most of the population with starvation yet he was surprised to find a wellfed generally content population fruit trees sprouted from the pavements heavy with apples despite the weather the buildings in some areas had been demolished and given over to fields where potato plants carrot tops and broccoli forced their way through the snow their survival made no sense as he neared the cathedral he reined in his horse to talk to a trader manning a creaking stall laden with a variety of fruits and vegetables some of it exotic and not seen in britain since all contact with the outside world had ceased at the fall when asked about the abundance of produce the trader responded every visitor to lincoln has the same question all i can say is that were especially blessed he grinned weve got our very own green angel hunter couldnt decide whether the trader had been unbalanced by too long on a diet of swedes or if he was honestly hinting at some kind of divine intervention it was impossible to tell in a time when madness and miracles abounded in equal measure he urged his horse forward following the flame not far on hunter encountered a large group of people gathered in a square many of them wearing the black tshirts with the red v that signified followers of ryan veitch hunter had seen the mounting intelligence gathered on the group as their numbers increased but hed always dismissed it as just one of the many cults that had sprung up amongst people desperate for a god any god to drag them out of their suffering yet now that he had discovered his own link to the pendragon spirit the matter took on a new resonance what would it take to drive a brother of dragons to betray the very principle of life on a platform of pallets at the centre of the crowd a speaker preached with fire and brimstone that kept the likeminds of the crowd rapt he had a shaven head and the unflinching eyes of someone for whom brutality was a way of life the day is drawing closer when he shall be returned to us he roared in a codreligious tone we can all see the signs the world is ending only he can save us and only we can bring him back the mass ritual will be held shortly when well pray for him to walk once more upon the earth in this day and age prayer has power the gods listen if we concentrate if we believe we can change anything the dead can live again hunter shrugged maybe the preacher was right it was difficult to be sure about anything any more the lantern led hunter to the cobbled street rising steeply up to the cathedral on either side was a profusion of medieval houses that had once been antique shops and had now returned to their original use they were all ablaze with colour red pink and yellow roses swarmed around doors clematis was still in flower tulips and daffodils and pinks and geraniums sprouted from boxes on the pavement yet all around it was bitterly cold the steep cobbled street was treacherous with snow and ice so hunter dismounted and led his horse by the time the street reached the shadow of the cathedral dark heavy clouds had swept across the blue sky and snow was starting to fall again the lantern pointed towards the main door of the cathedral which was locked hunter tethered his mount and wandered the vast perimeter of the building searching for a way in but all the entrances were barred an unusual atmosphere emanated from the stone not reverence or transcendence like he had felt at many other cathedrals but a brooding sadness that began to affect him deeply the building was strange in other ways too like the houses that lined the old pilgrims route to the door the cathedral had more than its fair share of verdant growth ivy crawling over the windows russian vine spreading over stonework the leaves turning red as though it was autumn in lincoln all seasons were unfolding simultaneously he returned to the main door and rapped loudly as he listened to the echoes a disturbing sensation tickled his lower leg he was shocked to see ivy wrapped around his ankle and crawling slowly upwards before his eyes jumping backwards he wrenched the ivy out of the ground but it still continued to grow up towards his thigh he tore it away with frozen fingers and hurled the remnants against the wall quiet cynical laughter echoed around the cathedral precinct hunter looked around for the source but there was only stillness over the snow she wont let you inside a woman in a green cloak emerged from the side of one of the buildings adjoining the cathedral her hood pulled forward so that her face was hidden by shadows you want to be careful creeping up on me ive killed people for less hunter said oooh she replied with childish sarcasm big man big threat the woman threw back her hood to reveal messy whiteblonde hair above a face that had a faint greenish tint to the skin but which didnt hamper her flinty beauty the hardness made her appear aloof and a little arrogant but she had a wry smile that suggested she was entertained by hunters appearance the green angel hunter guessed love you too you did that trick with the ivy i cant reveal my secrets she teased him in a manner that some would find irritating youre not a local come for some free fruit and veg the stores down in town you did all that with the plants too im impressed green fingers green everything she came over now more intrigued than entertained youre not here for food who are you i cant reveal my secrets the woman circled him slowly looking him up and down lean mean packing some weapons if im not mistaken by the bulges under your cloak or are you just pleased to see me youre very sparky give it a bit of time and you might be able to develop it into a personality the woman suddenly noticed a flare of blue illumination inside hunters cloak as it blew aside in the wind she yanked at the hem to pull the cloak open revealing the wayfinder where it had been hanging out of sight in hunters hand her demeanour changed instantly where did you get that a giant gave it to me hunter said wryly but his mind was already turning at her recognition its called the wayfinder i know what its called she snapped in that moment the defences of her face were stripped away to reveal a flow of honest emotion memories of good times memories of sadness hardship and suffering it ended with a faint contented smile as though she had just recognised an old friend i think hunter said im looking for you she blinked away a furtive tear come far from the ends of the earth thats what it felt like to him now that his own defences had broken down he felt a deep affinity with the odd woman and he could see in her eyes that she felt it too she put her arms around him warmly and held him in silence for a moment when she broke away she said im not usually one for hugging so dont tell anyone about that all right sister of dragons he nodded slowly he could see it now and youre one of the new ones the pale copies i like to think you were the prototypes and were the definitive article he held out a hand hunter is that a name or some sexual roleplay thing the woman held his hand for a long second are you always like this i wouldnt be so lovable any other way laura dusantiago he looked up at the towering cathedral and this is where you hang out nice bet its a nightmare to clean now theres a thing wait till you see the inside if she ever lets us in she added tartly she being ruth gallagher uberwitch of the whole fucking multiverse and doesnt she just know it she shook her head with irritation and motioned for hunter to follow her this time the main door swung open easily looks like shes out of her sulk laura said but you still wont be able to see her yet shell be off brooding somewhere better come in and take the weight off for a while hunter followed laura into the cathedral and was even more surprised than she had indicated he would be the interior was a bizarre mix of tropical greenhouse and ice cave strange gargantuan ice formations almost obscured the lofty roof and curved across the nave which entered into a series of tunnels through the permafrost yet tropical trees thrust up from the frozen floor breaking through the stone to press against the ice and creepers and vines hung down from above it made the inside of the cathedral claustrophobic and disturbingly otherworldly so you can control nature make things grow even where they shouldnt hunter asked one of the pluses of being a plant what long story basically im an avatar of the green gifted or cursed by cernunnos you heard of him hes one of the tuatha de danann a nature god basically or the nature god anyway im his chosen one and hes given me lots of cool powers to use as i see fit course i get the chlorophyll skin but these days there arent many beauty parades laura led hunter through the maze of ice tunnels to a room where a brazier glowed with hot coals he warmed his hands over it eagerly theres bread and fruit over there she motioned to a cupboard in one corner before lounging on a hard wooden bench now youd better tell me why youre here hunter told her everything from the impending end of the world at the hands of the void to the attack on his troops by the lamentbrood and their lethal generals and the fragmented state of the current quincunx of brothers and sisters of dragons laura listened intently chipping in with sarcastic comments or wry asides but beneath the patina of levity hunter could tell that she understood what was at stake and recognised her responsibility we need your help he said finally to make up the numbers in the hope that it might make up for one of us being dead but we need your experience too to be honest none of us knows what the hell were doing with this pendragon spirit thing hunter was taken aback by lauras laughter this is the best youre coming to us for help and advice listen we were the biggest collection of fuckups you could ever imagine church jack churchill he was up to his neck in grief over the death of his girlfriend unhealthy you bet ryan veitch was a crook whod killed a man who turned out to be a relative of the uberwitch but ruth had got her own problems one of which was a poker up her arse shavi our seer now he was cool not what youd call wholly present if you get what i mean but a nice guy and me i was perfect but youve got to have one or the whole thing falls apart laura was a woman who liked to play games to distort for effect and for her own aims and hunter knew he couldnt trust everything she said their conversation was a dance defining boundaries deciding status he was impressed two questions first if you were all so useless how out of all the possible candidates in the human race did you get selected for the pendragon spirit maybe you get selected at random secondly the fall overnight the otherworld pumped out gods devils monsters every supernatural creature that ever existed in any fairy tale anywhere all the conventional responses failed but you five stopped us from being wiped out if you were so useless how did that happen we were just lucky she smiled tightly giving nothing away go on he pressed she shrugged pretending it was old news but the memory was carved in the tense muscles of her face whatever had happened to her during the fall had shaped her character eradicating the woman she had been before replacing her with someone forged in the cauldron of strife how long have you got as a faraway look appeared in her eyes some of the hardness dropped from her face we made lots of mistakes but somehow somehow everything turned out all right in the end she caught herself all right for the human race that is not so great for us youre talking about jack churchill and ryan veitch dying its more complicated than that things never happen in isolation you deal with the repercussions for ever anyway you can talk to ruth about that later you want to hear tales of swashbuckling adventure five people beating the odds to come up with the goods for humanity yeah i can do that it was all about the pendragon spirit all those myths about king arthur that church was always banging on about i dont really care about how its all linked together the bottom line is despite all the failures and the mistakes everything came together right when it needed to just like it was planned and youre right it was a big win at the battle of london she closed her eyes in recall the city burning things swarming all over it that would give anybody nightmares she drifted for a moment how did jack and ryan die he probed gently we were steered to a tower that had risen up on the banks of the thames there was something inside an expression of distaste sprang to her face a power evil yeah definitely evil if we hadnt stopped it that would have been it game over did it have anything to do with the void i dont know theres nothing to say it did but maybe all these things are linked together you know everything that wants to stop us getting a foothold on the ladder i used to think good and evil were ideas for kids too simple fairytale stuff but now on the big scale the universal scale i think good and evil are what its all about a constant war from the beginning of time to the end and were just little troops cannon fodder there to make sure things dont go bellyup for our side hunter moved closer to the brazier he felt as if he couldnt get enough warmth we confronted this thing at the top of the tower laura said wed got the right tools magic shit a sword a spear church was about to deliver the killing blow then ryan stepped in why did he do it he didnt mean to laura said wearily shed obviously spent long hours turning the tragedy over in her head ryan was just that little bit weaker than the rest of us he was manipulated by the gods the evil things all those socalled higher powers just manipulate us all the time and ryan paid the price there was a fight he died church managed to kill the thing that had been waiting for us but ryan had thrown everything offbalance some kind of hole opened up in the air like a hole into space the thing went into it with its last dying gasp and church got sucked in after it so we won and we lost story over youve been through the mill i dont want your sympathy and youre not going to get it you had a job to do and you did it theres always a price to pay in situations like that like this no point crying over it so after that you came here not at first laura rubbed her fingers together and a rose grew magically out of the floor its bud bursting blossoming into black petals she stared at it thoughtfully ruth wanted to pass on all her witchy skills so we travelled the country for a while with her doing her hogwarts bit to a load of wannabes but her heart wasnt in it when we reached this place she decided she wasnt going any farther and you stuck with her somebody had to she didnt have anybody else she snapped her fingers and the black rose shrivelled and died hunter cracked his knuckles then put his feet up on a small table hed found out all he needed to know for now must be boring here for you im not getting any if thats what you mean she gave him a challenging smile fancy some laura thought for a moment then shrugged why not the sex was the first physical contact either of them had enjoyed for a while and was passionate and unguarded hunter discovered that laura smelled of lime and roses but afterwards she told him that she could manipulate her scent at will thats probably my greatest power she added now that we live in a world without deodorant when they were both dressed again laura reluctantly agreed to take hunter to see ruth who laura said would be brooding in her batcave they moved through the fantastic ice tunnels and chambers a crystal world within the very heart of the cathedral their breath trailing behind them in clouds finally they came to a cavern so large that it dwarfed all the others it was a work of art with icicles hanging ten feet or more from the ceiling and reflecting surfaces designed to catch and distribute the light of many candles at the far side was a throne made entirely from ice and sitting in it was the saddest woman hunter had ever seen she was swathed in black fur her fragile features as pale as hoarfrost her hair was long dark brown and curly and black rings beneath her eyes emphasised the painful grief in her face those eyes too were dark filled with a surfeit of shattered emotion a black and white woman in a frozen world there she is the witchqueen of the world laura said quietly to hunter weve got a guest she added loudly get out the best china ruth had been lost to her thoughts and unaware they had entered her eyes flickered to hunter then moved away ill leave you to it laura whispered in his ear before departing hunter marched up to the throne are you expecting me to kneel and kiss your ring who are you ruth said coldly my names hunter im a brother of dragons and i still havent quite come to terms with that as an introduction you never will what do you want hunter was surprised by her brusque uninterested nature after lauras curiosity ive come a long way to see you and laura youre needed both of you ive done my bit ruths gaze was as cold as her demeanour actually i dont think you get to resign the way i see it its a job for life the pendragon spirit isnt as strong in me as it used to be still there though a little right ill ask again what do you want theres a crisis actually thats too mild a word for it he held out his right hand you have god here not representing any particular religion but some higher force that stands for life existence all right if you want to call it that he held out his left hand and here you have the opposite of existence and all that stands for the opposite of life an absence of being negativity not death worse not existing he floundered not sure he was making sense even to himself he extended his left hand thats whats here now and pretty soon none of us will be existing unless we do something you might say were only human what can we do against something like that and to be honest i dont have an answer for you but i do know that the brothers and sisters of dragons were created to oppose this were the champions of life of existence maybe theres something we dont know that we can do all working together maybe we cant do anything but we have to try the magic number is five she said icily dont you know that the old five is broken you need a new five hunter could see that he wasnt persuading her and renewed his argument i know that one of the new five is dead two havent been found yet that makes three vacancies the two of us left could either hold up our hands and say weve failed and that word just doesnt do it justice since this failure means the end of all human existence who could cope with that so we could say weve failed or we could seek out substitutes who might not be able to do anything or who might make all the difference in the world my partner has gone to get shavi im here for you and laura so will you come back not for me but for everybody for existence there was a long period of silence when the only sound was the howling wind beyond the cathedral walls then ruth leaned forward and turned the full force of those dark devastated eyes on hunter let me tell you something i loved jack churchill more than i love myself he was everything to me and when he died it felt as if everything inside me shattered into a million pieces nothing trust me nothing comes even close to the pain i feel inside and ive been through a lot of suffering in my short unhappy life church had everything going for him he was filled with the blue fire all the prophecies spoke about how important he was to the future he was going to lead us into some golden age and still he died you want to know what it means to be a brother of dragons thats what it means hope strife failure not even the best can win you just hold the line i can live with that she silenced him with a raised hand they tell you grief fades with time what i feel for church wont fade its beyond grief the price i personally paid for our success during the fall was too high far too high so dont come asking me to do it all again i dont care any more about anything im just going to sit here while the world freezes around me and wait for it all to fade away to nothing the desolation in her words was almost too painful to hear hunter could see that what she had been through had fractured her but he couldnt afford to back down please whats at stake i know whats at stake she said and i dont care youre wasting your breath if you dont come thats it our last hope gone youre the one consigning us all to the end she held up one hand palm outwards and a freezing wind hit hunter he could feel ice forming across his face and body with an effort he tried to resist it but whatever she was doing she simply turned it up a notch until he realised that she would quite happily see him freeze to death in the end there was nothing he could do but leave outside the cavern laura was waiting dont think badly of her how can i not hunter snapped shes killed everyone she might not be able to make a difference anyway laura touched his face soothing the anger and disbelief out of him she loved church and she couldnt cope with losing him emotions rule us hunter theres nothing we can do about it thats the way we were made and we were made that way for a reason well if thats true i cant see it he sucked in a deep breath still coming to terms with the fact that hed failed id better get back im coming with you that surprised him what little he knew of her had suggested that she would be the selfish indifferent one whats the point youll just be coming back to die weve got to try havent we she grinned defiantly thats the job come on i need to find a horse she turned and headed off back through the tunnels as if there was still hope chapter thirteen the hour is getting late vae puto deus fio oh dear i must be turning into a god vespasian in the reverent depths of the bodleian library hal pored over a mountain of dusty volumes but his mind was elsewhere while reading the same page over and over again he was back in the helicopter on the return journey from shugborough hall adrenalin racing through his system his heart pounding fit to burst and the snowy countryside sweeping past beneath in a magical procession and samantha was pressed tight against him her head on his shoulder her arm entwined around his and she was whispering the words he would never forget you saved my life hal i dont know what id ever do without you and then there had been the kiss on his cheek admittedly but it had not been chaste he was sure certainly not overtly sexual either but filled with a deep affection the scene played over and over in his mind the seeds were so small he didnt dare give them too much credence but a tiny part of him refused to let go there was hope she wasnt completely devoted to hunter when the crunch came shed prefer hals decency over hunters louche amorality he was so lost to his everentwining mind games that he almost missed the item for which he had been searching just as he was about to turn the page of the twohundredyearold book he had been sifting through his subconscious flagged up a tiny reproduction of the shepherds of arcadia hal read the accompanying information once then again this time taking it in and finally a third time with avid concentration samantha he called out ive found something samantha ran over from another table where she had been hidden from his view behind a wall of books she hung over his left shoulder and peered at the text hal could feel the warmth of her skin smell her perfume but he forced himself to concentrate listen to this he said and began to read from the book the phrase et in arcadia ego cannot be traced to any classical source when asked of its origins nicolas poussin maintained a puzzling silence yet on several occasions he told of a strange meeting it occurred in sixteen thirtyseven shortly before poussin began work on his famous painting les bergers darcadie when according to the artist a young man with blue skin mysteriously appeared in his studio and entreated him to paint his first work on the subject the angelic messengers details were specific and included the curious phrase but poussin was induced to take the secret of his painting to his grave poussin always grew pale when questioned about this nighttime visitor but whatever was said to him in the privacy of his studio on that occasion encouraged him to begin work on his painting the next morning in a feverish state according to his closest friends hal stared at the page for a moment then looked into samanthas face so close to his own i dont know about angelic messenger or blue skin but that certainly sounds like a visitor from the otherworld but why would someone from the otherworld visit nicolas poussin in rome and force him to paint the shepherds of arcadia because hal said they wanted to preserve a clue that could be discovered hundreds of years later maybe they knew poussin was going to be a great artist and that all his works would be well known down the years but why all those centuries back hal thought about that for a moment perhaps the strange visitor didnt set off all that time ago what do you mean all the legends say that time is odd in tir na nog it doesnt move in straight lines maybe theres no such thing as time there at all youre making my head hurt maybe the gods can access any point in time they want from the otherworld and maybe they picked poussin because he paused reordered his thoughts ok how about this what if thomas anson had a similar meeting with say a blueskinned man who encouraged him to commission the shepherds of arcadia in reverse for the shepherds monument at shugborough we dont know that hal shrugged and pressed on and what if these gods were influencing our world all the time but they passed into legend as angels he said excitedly or demons didnt william blake supposedly see some hideous figure before he painted ghost of a flea i have no idea samantha said with some amusement yes yes youre right im off on a tangent but dont you see were getting somewhere poussin painted the shepherds of arcadia because of divine intervention its important enough that the tuatha de danann or some other higher power wanted it preserved its got something to do with tir na nog a tomb a death a secret in death if it was painted over here it was a clue we were meant to find his train of thoughts was rushing wildly on we as in you and me we humans we he paused maybe it was left for the brothers and sisters of dragons his heart started to pound was it some supernatural connection meant for him alone couldnt they have left the message in a more obvious way samantha asked if it was meant for the brothers and sisters of dragons why would it be in a poussin painting and a monument at shugborough not whatever it is the dragon brothers do on their day off because another shiver perhaps they knew that one of the brothers of dragons would come across this but they havent have they we have i mean i know one of them found the original stone but he didnt crack the clues hal disappeared in a mist of intense concentration before he said they buried it deeply because its such an important perhaps powerful thing thats been hidden that they couldnt risk anyone else finding it so it is something that could help us in the war yes said hal dazed i really think it is the war room was dominated by a large electronic map of the uk vast swathes of the north country were coloured red ending at a line bisecting the country from west to east and centring on birmingham along one wall three female operatives were in constant radio contact with numerous field agents supplying intelligence back from as close to the front line as they could get the general who had not slept for nearly fortyeight hours regularly checked the updates but spent most of the time inspecting maps and making calculations youre in a bad mood the general looked up to find reid standing next to him how do you slip in and out like that its bloody unnerving reid smiled without humour i have to say things arent looking good and you ask why im in a bad mood the question was really just a way into finding out how the meeting went with the pm surreptitiously reid began to shuffle through the maps on the table until the general dragged them away from him and pulled reid away to one side where they couldnt be overheard i think hes bloody losing it the general growled quietly oh look at the map weve got five days before the enemy reaches us maybe less theyve stopped annihilating the general population and are marching straight for us here their army now stands at somewhere around two million they dont eat sleep rest the only way to stop them is to blow them into tiny little pieces and even then theyre not dead whats left twitches and crawls under its own steam ive seen the footage its sickening ah so the pm didnt go for your nuclear option no he didnt a series of nukes secretly buried in their path to be detonated when the army is over them might take out what even a million of them and irradiate half of england i wonder why the pm wasnt interested the general glared reid would not have been so disrespectful a few weeks earlier his bleeper went off and when he checked the message he flung the device across the room in a fury temper temper reid cooed how can you be such a cold fish everythings falling apart here because nobody has the backbone to make the tough decisions barring kirkham coming up with something the hidden nukes are the only chance we have yes there would be some collateral damage and i wouldnt fancy taking a holiday in the midlands for a while but we have no other option reid turned towards the map tracing an imaginary blast zone in the air in his line of vision what did the pm say he vacillated yes it may be our only option but this maybe that let me think about it blah blah bloody blah somebodys put another plan to him are you sure he dropped a few clues is it you the general asked bluntly not me i bet its that bitch manning i have no idea what it could possibly be we have no other weapons well reid interjected with a sly smile things are always darkest before the dawn general remember that you can be a slimy little shit reid but if youve got something going on that you can pull out of the hat ill kiss you steady on old chap reid tapped his nose were working on something well work quicker weve hardly got any time left the general cracked his knuckles theres something no ones grasping this power were all supposed to be so afraid of isnt anywhere to be seen reid nodded old news why isnt the void here yet missed the train where is it going to turn up at what point its army is winning the fight its generals are marching on the field but still no sign of the real enemy youve not sighted anything weve got agents all over the damn place looking for the first sign of arrival nothing so far maybe it wont turn up until long after were all gone we need to find it the minute it gets here stop it instantly in its tracks you think thats possible it was the generals turn to smile slyly if its as powerful as its supposed to be why does it need an army to prepare the way perhaps because its not so powerful after all so if we take out the army it might not appear or maybe we can take it out the moment it arrives get your intelligence working on that reid reid considered the generals words thoughtfully good point why isnt it here yes thank you general i think ill do that the general looked around furtively then whispered i dont know if the pm is the right person to be leading our defence we need strong decisions not weakkneed umming and ahhing what are you suggesting nothing just yet but if we needed to replace him would you be prepared to tell him to step down reid shook his head theres nobody else in the cabinet id like to see in the top job unless youre putting yourself forward as a candidate if i did it would just be as an interim measure to see this crisis through we need to get a grip reid five days tops and its all over im going to need to issue the order on the nukes within twentyfour hours dont do anything hasty general you might regret it none of us is going to live to regret anything reid if we dont stop this dont forget that the generals cold stare condemned reid in an instant and then he walked away with the air of a man who had reached his limit in the depths of the ashmolean museum where the most powerful government computers were housed kirkham watched the screen as the modelling wound towards its conclusion manning tapped her red nails on the desk top with irritation i find it very hard to concentrate while youre doing that kirkham said with controlled exasperation and i find it very hard to wait while you continually come up with nothing you know its not that simple kirkham protested this would have been nighon impossible even before the fall when we had endless resources and unlimited time no more excuses she snapped before the fall you wouldnt have had a whole range of supernatural artefacts energy sources and a whole new way of thinking to draw on so stop whining what youre asking for is an understanding of the underpinning of reality but even to begin to explain the concepts in laymans language is he began but manning cut him dead again i dont want the mechanics kirkham she prowled around the desk like a big cat claws barely sheathed we know now that there are different levels of reality different dimensions this is not theory any more we know that there is a certain fluidity to these other dimensions dimensions isnt really the right word shut up we know that socalled magic or the new science as you like to call it can affect reality too so is what i am suggesting possible were talking about nonlimited consciousness causing an effect at the quantum level if reality is phaselocked like the light in a laser then consciousness can is what i am suggesting possible yes it is possible without another word manning turned on her heels to snatch up her furs and then she was gone kirkham breathed deeply for a second he thought he had seen something else standing where manning was something in her and around her gone in the blink of an eye he rubbed his tired eyes and returned to the flickering light of the computer screen sophie experienced a sensation of floating in water and a second later she was standing on the flagged floor of the watchtower corridor the chilly air smelled of damp stone and her footsteps echoed loudly off the roughhewn walls that was weird harvey steadied himself beneath a hissing torch caitlin appeared at sophies side clutching her axes her gaze flitting back and forth as she searched for danger are you anticipating trouble sophie still found it unnerving to hear caitlins voice emanating from a body that resembled caitlin but was clearly not her the muscles of her face were tauter her brow regularly knitted her eyes piercing and unblinking subtle changes that altered not just her demeanour but who she was no idea the watchtower was always a waystation between tir na nog and our world but that doesnt mean its deserted then we had better proceed with caution how do we get back home from here harvey asked you can get to all times and places through the doors that line the corridors sophie said somewhere theres a door leading back to where we want to go we could be looking for ever harvey whined look at this thackeray was standing at a window the others fell silent as they gathered round the view filled them with a deep dread there was emptiness emptier even than deep space a spiritual emptiness but here and there fires occasionally burst and faded like stars with their lifetimes diminished to fractions of a second where are we thackeray said quietly lets worry about where were going sophie said firmly leading the way down the corridor it twisted and turned in a manner that made no architectural sense each section they came upon as they rounded a bend looked exactly the same as all the others through which they had already passed doors oaken and studded with black iron broke the monotony of the walls at regular intervals the majority were locked but the first one sophie discovered to be unlocked released a blast of freezing air into the corridor they looked out over a frozen hilltop where a gnarled figure stood a crone dressed in rags clutching a wooden staff her hair wild in the wind icy blue light washed off her every now and then she would lift up her staff and shake it as if angry at the gods and another fall of snow would come from the slategrey sky another door opened on to a scene of caitlin covered from head to toe with clay beside an open hole in the ground it was night and raining and she had her head back as if she was howling her face transformed into some animalistic expression they only had a moment to glimpse the scene before caitlin grasped the door and pulled it shut so fast that she almost knocked sophie to the floor other doors showed scenes from their past lives and one or two appeared to reveal future events though they were bland and uninsightful harvey and thackeray talking in a small room sophie standing next to an asian man in a snowy street but then they came upon something that disturbed them immensely when thackeray threw open the next door it revealed nothing at all no scene just a black void that appeared to go on for ever the second and third doors revealed the same vista ok thackeray said if we can only open doors that show aspects of our lives past or future what does it mean when the doors show nothing at all you know what harvey said as they all silently mulled over the question who cares theres nothing we can do about it lets just get home they trudged on disconsolately with sophie keeping a close eye on caitlin every now and then sophie had heard her quietly answering questions no one had asked and as they walked she was growing even moodier and more introverted ignoring any advances from the others after the monotony of the long corridors they were surprised when they found a flight of stairs breaking off to one side harvey eagerly led the way skipping up the steps two at a time he soon disappeared from view then called back excitedly for them to join him the others found him lounging on a heap of sumptuous cushions in a large chamber with intricately illustrated tapestries lining three of the walls and floortoceiling windows with leaded diamond panes on the other whats the point in windows if youve got nothing to look out on thackeray asked tired and irritated he collapsed on to the cushions next to harvey sophie ignored them and looked around with interest she was struck by several unusual items in the room but the most prominent was a threelegged piece of furniture with a dome on top constructed from gold and silver and covered with finely detailed workings thackeray saw her approach the piece and warned i wouldnt go touching anything in this place sophie ignored him increasingly she was learning to trust her instincts and now she could feel a subtle vibration at the base of her skull like the buzz of power lines only more pleasant it emanated from the object caitlin moved to explore an archway leading to more stairs while sophie investigated the item from the corner of her eye sophie saw caitlin cast one dark cold stare her way before she disappeared into the shadows the dome was warm to the touch sophie couldnt help but trace her fingers over the fine filigree as she did so the dome began to throb she stepped back as it opened with a mechanical whir i told you not to touch it thackeray said jumping to his feet harvey rolled off the cushions and hovered near the door to the stairs leave it alone he said but sophie was entranced the dome revealed an electricblue ball of energy hovering in the air orbiting slowly i dont think its dangerous sophie said she reached out and touched the surface of the globe it shimmered as it sang to her with a soothing tone as the notes died away the ball changed colour slightly becoming greener until it revealed a face distorted as though seen through a crystal ball as sophie peered closer she realised the face was that of a green man like the ones she had seen in medieval churches with features constructed from interlocking vegetation the eyes deep and intelligent blinked sophie jumped back in shock who calls the voice resonated clearly around the room sounding like the wind rushing through the forest at night i i sophie burbled im sorry i didnt mean to disturb you a sister of dragons the green mans eyes narrowed as though he was peering back at her through a crystal ball he appeared to see her confusion you have called to me you know me little one i couldnt forget you sophie replied his names rattled through her head cernunnos lord of the green master of the wild hunt and more all inscribed in the heart of man you are in the watchtower the god said then you have activated the emptoreptic known also as the eye of distant dreams it was left in the watchtower so that in the darkest days the golden ones and all associated with them could be contacted wherever they might be sophie assimilated the information quickly and instantly said we need your help the void is coming i am aware of the devourer of all things sister of dragons i do what i can to help all fragile creatures will you fight beside us is that your wish yes yes and any others of your kind too anyone any help we need all the help we can get then the wild hunt will ride for you and your kind and the call will go out to my own brothers and sisters this day we make a pact thank you sophie said thank you so much the green man faded from view the blue globe descended and with another mechanical whirr the dome closed i dont believe it you called in the cavalry thackeray was standing beside her i think i have sophie replied this green man thackeray continued i know all the myths and legends and everything but hes a big deal right the biggest sophie said of all the gods weve encountered hes one of the most powerful wheres caitlin we need to tell her harvey nodded to the stairs behind him shes up there you want me to get her well all go sophie was barely able to contain her excitement perhaps with the green man on their side they might actually stand a chance she pushed her way past harvey and bounded up the steps they spiralled upwards in such a way that sophie realised they must be approaching the top of the watchtower sophie called caitlins name as she ran but there was no response had they been stupid to let caitlin wander off on her own finally the last flight of stairs appeared at the top the sucking blackness of the gulf was framed in a doorway a figure was silhouetted against it briefly as one of the explosions flared silently in the infinite distance sophie called caitlins name again there was still no answer was it caitlin or someone who had struck her down sophie turned back to thackeray and harvey wait here she said quietly whats wrong thackeray asked i dont know probably nothing but if there is its better if only one of us is up there cautiously sophie progressed up the final few steps a balcony ran around the perimeter of the towers summit it was barely two feet wide and the stone balustrade was worryingly low below the full extent of the watchtower was revealed an everest of stone vast and monolithic with carved gargoyles and faces statues and designs black sloping roofs of wings smaller turrets and towers the ground floor lost far below in the dark shadows all of it floating in the gulf vertigo gripped her and she pressed her back against the stone dragging her gaze away from the dizzying view sophie looked both ways along the deserted balcony deciding against calling caitlins name again she edged around the wall the atmosphere of that strange place dampened sound so that it felt as though her ears were filled with cotton wool the effect threw her natural instinctive abilities awry and so she was taken by surprise when the blow came from behind her crashing against the base of her skull sophie rolled away from the wall to the edge of the balcony stars flashing before her eyes when her vision finally cleared she was bent backwards over the balustrade with caitlin looming over her one hand gripping sophies throat the other holding an axe high caitlins face was transformed by dark fury more morrigan than caitlin her strength and determination inhuman what what are you doing sophie choked i saw caitlin snarled in an echoing voice that no longer sounded like caitlins you and him together behind my back you cant be trusted youre the enemy no sophie squirmed but couldnt break caitlins iron grip youve got it wrong sophie saw the frenzy in caitlins face her arm muscles growing tense the axe suddenly coming down hard towards her head no room to escape the killing blow sophie clamped her eyes shut but instead of the impact of the axe on her skull she felt caitlins hand wrenched free of her throat choking she threw herself forward to see thackeray and harvey wrestling caitlin away get back sophie yelled to them shes lost it a black cloud was growing around caitlin gaining solidity like bubbles forming on crude oil the bubbles took shape grew wings became crows that suddenly burst free from her orbit scores of them swirling all around caitlin assailing thackeray and harvey with beak and talon and beating wing thackeray and harvey thrashed them away but were driven back towards the door to the stairs sophie drew her spear from the harness suspending it across her back she held it twohanded balanced on the balls of her feet knowing she was no match for caitlin in terms of physical strength the crows surrounded caitlin like a thunderstorm she was preparing to attack i had to do it to open the door to this place caitlin sophie yelled i wasnt betraying you it wasnt personal caitlins movement was so swift and ferocious that sophie barely saw her she had an impression of a black wind rushing at her the whirling axe blade a gleam of silver within it sophie parried the blow through a mixture of blind luck and instinct but the shocking vibrations from the incredible force of the attack almost knocked her unconscious her spear went flying from her hands and sophie dazed spun offbalance slamming against the balustrade she went over unable to stop herself there was a brief feeling of falling before she reacted she grabbed on to a carving protruding from the side of the tower the shock almost wrenching her arm from its socket she flung her other arm around it before she slipped off but she wasnt strong enough to cling on for long her feet kicked over the abyss her muscles already aching from the strain of hanging her stomach sick from the shock of fall and impact caitlin loomed over the balustrade surrounded by the thunderous murder of crows yet there was a subtle change in her face a shadow of humanity i i cant stop her caitlins voice had returned to a human timbre but it was weak barely audible its as if ive got two people in my head and neither of us can think straight this it isnt meant to be its driving us both mad fight it sophie gasped she managed to swing her feet around to catch a foothold on another carving if i still had the pendragon spirit i could balance her out but caitlins voice faded away sophie saw caitlins face darken and knew that her moment of respite was over climbing back up wasnt an option fighting the vertigo that spun her head she focused as hard as she could on the stone of the tower wall to block out the drop and then searched out more foot and handholds the mass of carvings gave her plenty of options but already she was shaking from the strain of keeping her muscles tense she swung to one side with her right foot tested her weight on the new foothold and then followed with her right hand she vacated the carving just as caitlins axe raised a shower of dust as it crashed against where she had been clinging sophie moved as quickly as she could while maintaining her safety to get out of the reach of caitlins weapon but in doing so she allowed herself a glance down it was like standing on a ledge at the summit of the empire state building her head spun so wildly that she almost fell away from the wall she screwed her eyes shut and rammed her body hard against the stone while she reclaimed her equilibrium when she looked around again thackeray and harvey were hanging out of a window below and to her right urging her silently towards them with the last of her strength she made it as close to the window as she could but for the final two feet there were no more carvings to support her jump thackeray hissed well pull you in i cant sophie said i dont know if ive got it in me its either that or fall sophie knew he was right with her eyes shut she jumped convinced she was plummeting to her doom and then she felt herself being manhandled roughly through the window all three of them fell on to the stairs and rolled down cracking heads and shins on cold hard stone before they could stop their descent from above came the sound of flapping wings approaching fast sophie was the first to her feet and dragged the others after her they careered down the stairs on the verge of falling out of control skidding into the room with the emptoreptic and then on down the next flight of stairs the sound of the birds never relented and as they emerged back into the corridor they knew that if they slowed they would be dead caitlins gone that things taken over a desperate sadness filled thackerays voice theres still hope sophie said but we need to save ourselves before we can think about helping caitlin which way harvey yelled in a panic sophie randomly picked a direction and they set off as fast as they could whenever they felt they could spare a second they randomly tried one of the doors en route but on each occasion they lost valuable time that they knew they would not be able to make up the morrigan would never give up and soon they would tire and then she would catch them this is ridiculous thackeray wheezed we could run around here for ever and not find the door its statistically impossible sophie wrenched open a door i think its this one she said thackeray didnt have time to query her before she had propelled both him and harvey through she dived in after them slamming the door behind them they skidded down a snowy slope and came to a stop beside a fence next to a road sign obscured by ice and frozen snow its winter harvey said must be thackeray said they were all racked with shivers in the biting temperatures we need to get to shelter before we freeze to death sophie said with chattering teeth how do you know this is the right place thackeray asked all the other scenes had an odd artificial quality as if the backgrounds were films projected on to the walls of the room sophie said this one looked real it doesnt make sense its too much of a coincidence he looked at sophie suspiciously as if she was about to turn into a monster like caitlin two things she said one i felt it in my gut and i think it was the pendragon spirit telling me that this was the right door two there are no coincidences i think we were meant to find the way out like we were meant to do lots of other things thats kind of creepy harvey said lets move sophie said caitlin will be through soon you really think so thackeray said sadness flashed across his face but sophie was impressed to see him constrain it shes a killing machine with the powers of a god no compassion no empathy shes not going to stop until im dead sophie said bitterly and you know what the worst thing is i helped to make her this way and i gave up an utterly valuable unique thing to do it and now im going to die as well thats irony for you thackeray went to comfort her but before he could harvey hailed them i dont think weve got far to go before we find somewhere to hole up he said motioning to the road sign he had just cleaned off it said oxford in his arctic survival clothes supplied by the quartermaster hal was almost unrecognisable as he trudged head bowed through the blizzard perhaps that was why manning didnt notice him as she crossed the high street on her way to the cabinet offices it was a random moment that at any other time would have passed hal by but he was lost in thoughts of the otherworld and its strange inhabitants and suddenly he was struck by a revelation hed always been suspicious of mannings intentions even before he had heard her talking to a seemingly invisible companion that night before the invasion had started hed dismissed the troubling event sure hed misheard perhaps misinterpreted had too much else on his mind but now he knew there was something abnormal about her even though she wore a fur coat and hat they were scant protection against the cold but when she passed hal it was clear that the bitter temperatures werent affecting her at all with the hairs on the back of his neck prickling hal made the decision to follow her it was out of character for someone who paid little attention to instinct he preferred things hard and fast but he felt such an imperative that he knew he would regret it if he didnt hal allowed manning to reach the far end of the high street before he turned and followed her and that was when he noticed the second strange thing he had been staring at her tracks in the fresh snow when he realised that there was not one set of footprints but two intermingling so closely that if he had not been paying close attention he would have missed it with growing apprehension hal kept behind manning until she disappeared into oriel college he anticipated that she would first be heading to her own complex of offices which lay on the first floor of the building hal quickly hurried in through another entrance and made his way up a parallel flight of stairs so that he could approach from the opposite direction and if discovered it would not appear that he had followed her the building was quiet and he heard manning moving around her office there was a single set of footsteps at first and then eerily there were two sets hal edged cautiously along the corridor until he could peer in through the window in the door the blind on the window was halfclosed impairing his view but he could see manning from the waist down she was talking to someone just out of sight things are falling into place reid doesnt suspect a thing this is a strange alliance the voice was strong and resonant hal craned to see who was speaking that doesnt matter if it works to our mutual benefit now timing is essential are you prepared i am are you there will be great hardship for your kind im ready dont worry about me hal bumped against the door and rattled the blind in his attempt to see the mysterious visitor immediately he sprinted quietly along the corridor and turned the corner on to the stairs just as the office door opened he was sure manning hadnt seen him or if she had glimpsed him wouldnt be able to identify him but he was angry with himself for alerting her before any action could be taken he slipped out of the building into the heart of the blizzard relieved that it would cover his tracks at queens hal found reid lounging in a chair drinking a brandy in front of a blazing fire he appeared at ease despite the impending crisis ms manning hal said breathlessly i think shes a traitor i think shes going to sell us all down the river sit down have a drink reid stood and thrust hal into the chair by the fire then stuffed a crystal glass of brandy into his hand now tell me what you know hal blurted out what he had seen reid listened intently then muttered this changes everything are you going to arrest her of course but if theres a conspiracy i want to know who else is involved before i tip my hand she stressed that you didnt suspect anything im sorry if ive made her suspicious now dont worry about it reid stared into the depths of the fire while he thought things through finally he said the void is coming soon ive got new intelligence the only chance we have to stop it is to get the brothers and sisters of dragons together he turned to hal i believe hunter to be one of them hal said nothing the research carried out by kirkhams team suggests that the brothers and sisters of dragons become active if thats the right word in proximity to the crisis theyre meant to deal with or they are quickly drawn to that area wed already profiled a great many people in oxford thats why weve been carrying out a detailed census in recent weeks hunter was one of a very few who fit the profile how did you know oxford was going to be the centre of the crisis the government is here it became obvious that this is where the last stand will be made reid downed the rest of his brandy i was ninety per cent sure about hunter when he disappeared with mallory i knew i was right reid eyed hal anything you want to say hal shook his head youre his very best friend im not stupid you know he must have told you hal remained silent but reid wasnt offended he shrugged and said i believe hunter is getting his little band together we need them here now if we are to stand a chance can you get word to him i dont think hunter or any of the brothers and sisters of dragons will work with the government they dont trust you us reid nodded understandable i suppose in which case i face a conundrum i dont know where they are mister reid and thats the truth then all im asking of you hal begging you is that when hunter does finally contact you as he undoubtedly will i want you to pass on to him the message that the last stand against the void will be made here and that he really needs to be with us were in the final stage of this game hal and what may be the twilight days of the human race none of us must falter chapter fourteen the secrets of god mankind when left to themselves are unfit for their own government george washington the screeching blast of the siren tore hal from troubled dreams of betrayal and hatred he scrambled out of his bed into the freezing cold room and ran to the window through the thick frost that lined the glass inside and out he could just discern frantic activity soldiers carrying rifles raced along the street a few seconds later a truck packed with more soldiers followed a snowplough down the centre of the road hals first thought was that either manning had launched some kind of coup or that reid had arranged for her arrest and some kind of disturbance had broken out still halfasleep he stripped off the several layers of clothing hed taken to wearing in bed splashed some water on his face and quickly dressed he was barely out of his room when samantha came running up the corridor in a state of distress whats wrong he said catching her in his arms she sobbed against his shoulder for a moment before she calmed enough to tell him its the prime minister hes been assassinated what happened tell me hal gently pushed samantha away from him so that he could look in her face i dont know she wiped her tears away with the back of one hand no ones releasing any details all weve heard is that it happened about half an hour ago theyre shutting down all buildings and instituting an immediate curfew while they search for the killer hals jaw gaped in shock is that what manning had been planning if so reid must be devastated at not having acted immediately but then no one could have foreseen it who would possibly kill their leader on the eve of a battle that would determine the survival of the human race he decided not to tell samantha anything about manning and his conversation with reid in case it put her in danger if were being confined to our quarters i wanted to be here with you she said hal took her back inside and quickly made up the fire once it was roaring he brewed up and they sat warming themselves while they drank their herbal infusion i dont know whats going to happen to us samantha said desolately i always had hope that things were going to turn out all right they always do dont they or did even at the fall when it seemed as if it was the end we pulled through that but now im not so sure things will work out hal said with as much optimism as he could muster there are a lot of good people working on our behalf samantha didnt look convinced so hal changed the subject ive been doing a bit more research on the mystery we found at shugborough and i think ive made a breakthrough he fetched a pile of books and papers from his desk and spread them out around her i dont know how you can think about that at a time like this samantha muttered because it might be our only hope hal said simply reluctantly she picked up a book of illustrations of one of the grail romances whats this king arthur the stone with the poussin image inside was found at cadbury hill one of the supposed locations of camelot there are lots of arthurian links floating around this whole business im starting to think that maybe the legend of king arthur is a code too like the poussin painting and the shepherds monument that the stories themselves and elements of them are meant to be symbolic and that somehow they tie in to what were looking for sounds a bit tenuous samantha said unconvinced not really arthurs sword excalibur was supposed to have come from the otherworld and thats where he went when he died and the poussin painting is of a tomb and the mystery surrounding it points to tir na nog arthurs tomb like i said its a code we shouldnt take it at face value but the king arthur legend goes back centuries before poussin even how long has all this been weaving together ah hal said with a smile thats the mystery before he could say any more they were disturbed by the sound of numerous booted feet running along the corridor without doors were flung open orders barked hals door crashed wide and a grimfaced soldier stood there brandishing a rifle as if he was prepared to shoot hal and samantha on the spot theres a curfew he said no ones to leave their quarters we heard the news hal said whos in charge the soldiers cold eyes observed hal with nearcontempt for a moment before he replied the general and then he was gone and hals many other questions were left unanswered what about the rest of the cabinet where was reid and what did the general plan to do now the journey from glastonbury had been hard over roads and fields that resembled the arctic wastes in the face of a wind that raked at their flesh day and night mallory wished he could have turned his back on his responsibilities and stayed behind in the magical atmosphere of the sunlit tor when the summer gave way to winter as he passed the limit of the cultures influence he felt a palpable pang of despair and looked back repeatedly until the blizzard blocked the glowing uplands from view the biting cold and the dark days felt more than just a physical hardship they were signs of a world bereft of hope winding down to die as the last candle guttered with his mood still tainted by the loss of sophie it would have been easy to give in to despair but shavi was there on the horse at his side with quiet words of encouragement mallory already felt that he could trust the young asian man with his life shavi was the most spiritual person mallory had ever met the peace he radiated was almost contagious filtering in through mallorys pores neutralising his blackest thoughts shining a light into the dark areas of his soul mallory knew that over time the brothers and sisters of dragons increasingly exhibited peculiar abilities and this he decided was shavis the magic of the soul given strength and weight that description had an uneasily religious tang for someone like mallory who had little time for god or gods but even he instinctively felt the truth of it with the wind howling in their ears shavi told mallory of how he had fled a repressive family in west london for a life of searching he had hungrily devoured the teachings of every major religion and most of the minor ones eventually turning to more esoteric knowledge as he quested for his own personal grail but then he had experienced colourful dreams that drew him into contact with the other brothers and sisters of dragons much like the insistent pull that had dragged mallory to salisbury where he had first encountered sophie its difficult to get your head around the fact that youre special mallory said as he futilely attempted to warm himself beside a raging campfire i do not consider myself special shavi replied i believe we have been given the tools to do a job on behalf of humanity it is our duty to carry out our task to the best of our abilities in truth we are not special we are servants we act with humility not arrogance we accept sacrifice and suffering that is our lot mallory jabbed a branch into the depths of the fire watching the sparks fly up to meet the falling snow and is that it we have to accept misery theres no cake when we get to the end of the road shavi smiled wryly happy endings mallory you do not seem the type yeah maybe youre right im an old cynic but i do have barely repressed romantic leanings mallory pondered shavis words for a moment then said not so long ago i was told that i come from another world that doesnt exist any more somehow reality changed my world disappeared and this world is what we have in its place do you think thats possible i think we live in a universe where anything is possible the only reality that truly matters is the one inside here he gently tapped the position of his third eye in the middle of his forehead something is troubling you would you like to talk about it mallory was surprised he always guarded his true thoughts and feelings carefully but shavi had seen inside him effortlessly perhaps he shouldnt have been so taken aback the initial elation when the gaps in his memory were filled had faded and the knowledge had developed a gravity that was gradually sucking all of his other thoughts into it mallory told shavi about the fabulous beast and jenny the woman who had been possessed by it or had become its avatar or some other relationship he couldnt quite understand shavi was both surprised and excited by mallorys account i feel this is very important he said a bond established between human and fabulous beast it could be a very good omen the girl told me that i died in the last world blew my brains out i am sorry shavi was not being glib he looked truly upset by mallorys bald statement but i died do you understand and now im here alive this place doesnt look like heaven it looks a lot like hell but i dont think its that either you visited the land of the dead on one of your transcendental superjaunts so tell me what does it mean to die do you just carry on in some other place like me or is all this some illusion playing out in my dying mind perhaps this world is the bardo thodel of the tibetan mystics the place between death and birth they missed that bit out when i was doing my studies at salisbury the bardo is central to the tibetan concept of the afterlife shavi said the word means intermediate state the tibetan mystics believe that all of existence is nothing but a series of transitional states which they called bardos in the bardo thodel there are three distinct stages between death and rebirth the chikai bardo includes the process of dying and the breakup of the elements that make up the physical body the chonyid bardo is next with visions of gods heaven hell judgment and so on that sounds familiar mallory found shavis information disturbing in the light of his experience finally there is the sidpa bardo shavi continued during this the consciousness chooses a new body into which to be born do you believe that i believe there are many many paths and that we must all be detectives searching along them for any clues that might help us theres got to be some reason for all this misery mallory said if its all just the result of some random chemical reactions at the dawn of time it would be so crushing the search for meaning is the greatest quest of all shavis smile suggested that he knew much more than he was saying when i was in salisbury training to be a knight i had to study a lot of christian philosophy mallory continued to prod the fire watching the sparks leap heavenwards theres a philosopher called hicks youve probably read him he says that this world is basically a school for souls all the struggles and hardships we go through all the evils we face are designed to challenge us and shape us until we develop our souls and become more like god shavi said nothing there are a million explanations as to why were here putting up with all this shit mallory was entranced by the fire almost talking to himself where do we look for answers science or religion are there any answers or should we just stop wasting our time thinking about it and get on with it the answers are inside us shavi said softly we all know the truth instinctively many have forgotten how to listen to that part of themselves we need to relearn if we dont know whats expected of us mallory flailed around for the right words how are we supposed to know whether what were doing is right shavi could see the distress that lay behind mallorys questions and moved quickly to calm him in soft tones he said consider then hindu beliefs to hindus the universe is a vast place filled with immeasurable numbers of thinking beings gods and demons continually being born dying and reborn the timescale is vast three hundred billion years for the entire wheel of existence to turn how can humans so insignificant in this big picture so powerless make decisions about how to live the hindus find their answer in the sanskrit word dharma it is defined as each persons unique path in life and the knowledge of how to find it dharma is always there to be discovered and it is the answer when faced with something too immense to comprehend but how do you find dharma shavi smiled that is the simplest path of all to find dharma you must be yourself as fully as possible all the information you need lies within you recognise that each human consciousness is unique that each is an experiment in seeking the eternal truth just be myself im lucky to get across the room if i do that this time shavi laughed heartily mallory your selfdeprecation belies your true essence i can see it allow yourself to see it mallory nodded but the question he really wanted answered died on his lips he wasnt concerned about himself his desperate need to know the meaning of life and death and whether death itself was an ending was driven by sophie was there hope for her somewhere beyond the world would he ever meet her again they travelled for as long as they could but the cold forced them to take regular breaks in any shelter they could find at barnsley house mallory searched for the fabulous beast and jenny at shavis insistence but they were gone yet there was still a faint echo of their presence in the air like the intense atmosphere in a cathedral somehow they made it across the freezing wastes without dying from the cold or starvation they had come across many people frozen in their homes their last fuel now ashes in the fireplace their cupboards bare after the fall and the plague humanity was barely clinging on the new ice age was a crisis too far as they neared oxford they became distracted from the humanitarian crisis not far from the outskirts mallory reined in his horse on a ridge to survey a curious sight a row of figures moving across a field in the wan lateafternoon light at first he thought they were residents of the nearby village but their regimented actions made little sense they are not human shavi said quietly as if he could read mallorys thoughts his head was back his eyes closed so that he appeared to be either listening intently or smelling the air i feel despair it rises off them like smoke from a bonfire they are all empty shells given animation their humanity twisted perverted shavis words confirmed what mallory thought he could see weapons protruding from the bodies of the figures themselves as if they had been implanted by some horrific surgical technique the enemy mallory said recalling his encounter with them at cadbury hill he scanned the area advance troops they are encircling oxford shavi said mallory didnt think to ask how he could possibly know this that is where the last stand will take place and the enemy wants to make sure that no one will leave alive to drum up any further opposition then the sensible option would be to stay outside town mount some kind of guerrilla action behind enemy lines it would if you think we could survive out here and maintain cover while their troops mass mallory considered what hunter had told him about the vast and increasing numbers of the lamentbrood in scotland whats the alternative suicide if we go into oxford well never get out theyll have us trapped then how will we find the void and destroy it the brothers and sisters of dragons should be united for the last stand that is the will of existence what if hunter hasnt been able to get through enemy lines he paused then answered the question himself thats a risk well have to take hell be heading towards the meeting place so thats where i ought to be in the distance purple mist drifted against the gleaming white background mallory knew it was more of the enemy circling closer drawing their lines together lets wait until night falls then slip through between their patrols in the depths of a copse now stripped of summer leaves by the biting cold they watched the distant movement of dark figures against the snow occasionally swathed in that eerie purple mist like soldiers on a first world war battlefield their numbers were increasing slowly the space between patrols growing smaller night wasnt coming fast enough the horses stamped restlessly on the edge of the stand of stark trees snorts of hot breath billowing twilight eventually came in fast and hard mallory and shavi shook relentlessly with the cold yearning for a fire or some movement to warm their blood the dangers of exposure were readily apparent and whenever mallory saw shavis eyes begin to flutter shut mallory shook him awake with hands that could barely feel what they were touching eventually though the cold proved the greater enemy and even mallory began to succumb his eyelids grew heavy and he fought to keep them open pinching himself hard on the face punching tree trunks while watching for the last glimmer of light to fade the enemy moved across a field ghostly against the growing gloom mallorys eyes dimmed momentarily and when he forced them open again the enemy were even nearer mallory could hear the crunch of their feet in the frosted snow he pulled shavi down then eased them a few paces backwards so that they could more easily merge into the background vegetation complete darkness was only a few minutes away through branches and twigs he watched the patrols slow movement along the edge of the copse and watched and he woke with a start as activity exploded around him cursing with the realisation that the vampire cold had sucked away his consciousness it was dark but the snow added an eerie luminescence to everything streams of purple mist floated amongst the trees shavis cry for help echoed from somewhere nearby mallory forced himself alert then propelled his stiff cold body forward in a lurching drunken motion through the silver trees his limbs too numb to feel any sensation with a shock he realised that the enemy were everywhere their ghostly figures loomed all around sometimes standing motionless so that they appeared to be part of the copse itself at other times stalking at a slow measured pace the oppressive atmosphere of despair made mallory even more sluggish there was whispering too so subtle it felt like the wind in the branches urging him to give up give in die another cry for help the direction now clear mallory propelled himself forward once more two members of the lamentbrood had shavi pinned deep ruts marred the snow where he had been dragged blood ran down his face from a head wound that must have stunned him and now one of the lamentbrood was poised to complete the job with a spear protruding from its forearm mallory drew llyrwyn and the copse was suddenly flooded with sizzling blue light so strong that it shocked him motionless for a split second sapphire flames blazed around the edge of the blade and the familiar smell of burned iron flooded the air though the lamentbrood appeared to be little more than machines the two holding shavi shied away from the burning sword the spear hung mere inches from being plunged into shavis face mallory bounded in swinging llyrwyn in an arc it sliced through neck muscles and bone with a sizzle and the head flew into a snow drift where it stared at mallory with wide eyes the other attacker a more brutish and alien creature than his decapitated comrade swung an arm with a fan of knives protruding from the wrist his blood now hot and pulsing with adrenalin and the strange energy of the sword mallory ducked the attack drove llyrwyn hard into the creatures belly and then used all his strength to rip upwards as it flopped backwards hanging in two halves mallory grabbed shavis arm and yanked him to his feet leave me here shavi said if you try to get me out they will have you and that will be the end of all hope for humanity you are the important one now not me mallory looked around the lamentbrood were moving towards them from all directions through the ghostly trees shavi was right if he ran he could escape through the gaps to reach the horses if he had to manhandle shavi he wouldnt have a chance he let shavi sink gently back to the ground and headed for a clear path but hed only gone a few paces before he realised that he couldnt leave shavi behind whatever the cost he ran back and before shavi could speak barked dont say anything just keep behind me shavi pressed against an ancient oak continually wiping the blood from his eyes mallory gripped his sword tightly set his legs apart and braced himself it was too late to change his mind the lamentbrood had closed their ranks and were drawing nearer in the dark mallory couldnt work out how many were approaching but there were certainly more than he could destroy but if this was to be his last stand he would go out fighting for half an hour mallory battled fiercely the air filled with the clash of steel and the hacking of flesh as brilliant blue light soared and fizzed and flashed as though they were at the centre of an electrical storm the bodies of the lamentbrood piled up all around forcing mallory to clamber on top of them fighting for his footing so that he could strike again and again and still the lamentbrood came for mallory it was his finest hour blood seeped from a thousand cuts his cloak was in ribbons his shirt sliced open so that the cold bit into his bare chest every muscle was on fire every ligament hurt and exhaustion always seemed but a hairs breadth away but still he fought scything and hacking parrying stabbing chopping with a skill that exceeded anything he thought he had within him determination clouded his mind and weariness wrapped it in cotton wool until he had little idea how long he had been there or even what he was doing there were only the constant shapes looming out of the night the purple mist the attack the body in front of him falling and then the next enemy approaching and then he found himself lashing the sword back and forth but no longer feeling the juddering impact of steel on bone yet still he continued to fight blinded by the fury of battle until he felt a hand on his shoulder and a calming voice just behind his right ear mallory it is over it felt as if a spell had been broken his eyes cleared to reveal a mountain of bodies parts scattered all around snow was falling softly on the still motionless copse the exhaustion finally caught up with him and he staggered backwards into shavis arms you proved yourself a brother of dragons tonight shavi whispered but you must not rest yet shavis face was covered with dried blood but he was smiling we must be away mallory escape before more come mallory nodded and somehow found some last vestige of strength in his limbs he forced his way through the trees to where the horses waited shavi helped mallory into the saddle and pulled himself on to his own mount they scanned the snowcovered countryside saw that there were no further lamentbrood in the immediate vicinity and then rode as fast as they could over the treacherous ground at first mallory barely had the strength to cling on but when the lights of oxford finally sparkled on the horizon he raised himself up in his saddle and looked to shavi we did all right didnt we not such a pair of losers after all maybe there is still hope shavi smiled there is always hope the seer said when they entered the citys outskirts mallory and shavi dismounted they had hoped to sneak in quietly but there was activity ahead a makeshift barricade was being thrown up across the road from building to building old vehicles metal sheeting household furniture piled high sparks from welding equipment arced in several places and the screech of metal goods being dragged around reverberated loudly punctuated by barked orders mallory was just about to urge shavi that they should find another route into the city when they were caught in a powerful beam of light someone shouted threateningly who goes there friend mallory replied loudly two of us a small group of heavily armed soldiers advanced from behind the barricade mallorys hand went to the hilt of his sword beneath the remains of his cloak the captain of the guard led the way his features obscured by the hood of his thermal uniform he shone the light in mallorys face then illuminated his tattered clothes you must be freezing the captain said what happened to your clothes he indicated the cuts youve been attacked these strange creatures set on us shavi said feigning ignorance of the situation an army of them we were lucky to get away with our lives how far away the captain said insistently about five miles jesus christ the captain spun around on his heels and hollered at the men working on the defences get a move on the enemy is almost here he turned back to shavi and mallory keeping the torch on their faces he was still suspicious youre lucky weve had orders not to let anyone inside once the barricades are up he nodded to one of his men sergeant priest here will take you to the gate office where youll be collected for debriefing leave your horses at the gate can we find somewhere to rest and get a bite to eat mallory asked in a while were under martial law no one is allowed to wander the streets without an escort and i need all my men here the captain turned brusquely away and hurried on ahead of them while priest led mallory and shavi through a small gap in the defences the minute they were through a large panel of rusted iron was hefted into the gap and men rushed forward with facemasks and canisters to weld it into place mallory and shavi exchanged a secret glance but the place was swarming with soldiers and there was no way they would be able to make a run for it the horses were led off to stabling and some muchneeded food and warmth while mallory and shavi were guided to a brightly lit makeshift office priest left them inside with a guard on the door and returned to his duties the warmth of the room was a fantastic relief to the two frozen men but they barely had time to consider their options before there was an outcry at the barricade part of the defences had collapsed pinning two soldiers beneath it the guard at the door rushed to help instantly mallory jumped to his feet and swung open the door he glanced around to make sure no one was watching but all the soldiers were involved in either rescuing the two men or patching up the barricade motioning for shavi to follow mallory glided into the shadows along the row of houses keeping low within a minute they were out of sight of the barricade and running as fast as they could manage in the heavy snow as they approached the city centre they came to a sharp halt the outline of the aged buildings against the night sky was indistinct and there appeared to be another city shimmering over the top of it like a mirage filled with a faint blue light you see that mallory asked i do ive seen something like it before in salisbury mallory said for a time there was a warping effect that made the cathedral stretch through into tir na nog shavi finished for him with a hint of awe mallory shrugged whatever you want to call it why is it happening here but shavi was silent as they progressed cautiously into the heart of the still silent city entrancing events began to unfold around them a tiny figure flying high over the street leaving a trail of gold sparkles behind it a wolf with the body of a man rooting in bins down an alley at the side of a restaurant ghostly figures fading in and out of focus not quite human all garishly dressed and then in the distance coming down somewhere in the city what at first looked like a comet with a blue tail but then became the fabulous beast mallory had seen at barnsley house mallory began to point it out just as they were assailed by a rushing wind and the odour of burned iron blue lightning crashed all around and thunder rolled ominously close before a hole opened up in the air mallory and shavi jumped back into the shadows of a building as a stream of figures poured out they sprawled breathlessly on the frozen ground or turned to face the portal instantly adopting a warlike stance when the doorway finally clashed shut there must have been about eighty of them quickly forming a defensive posture backtoback in the centre of the street they all wore ornate bizarre armour marked with a sun crest the tuatha de danann shavi said in amazement you know them mallory asked they call themselves the golden ones and believe themselves to be gods enemies or friends that has never been an easy question to answer shavi shielded his eyes from the glare of the street lights reflecting off the snow and peered at the group is it yes i think it is he marched forward from the shelter of the buildings holding out his arms in a gesture of peace lugh he called out the leader of the group marched forward proud and tall the suspicion slowly falling from his face to be replaced by something that almost came close to awe great hero he bowed his head slightly the filid of our court still sing songs of your exploits shavi took the compliment gracefully then motioned to mallory who was still surveying the group with caution and a brother of dragons lugh said with a bow surely then we have come to the right place why are you here shavi asked the tension that had turned lughs face to stone fell away to reveal deep emotion shavi was shocked by the grief he saw there lugh fought to control his voice then said the court of souls ease has been overrun by those who were once my brothers and sisters but no longer now they are my enemies for all time they wiped from existence all those they encountered the night turned golden with fluttering moths he gestured towards the rest of his group with a hand that trembled uncontrollably these are all that remain the entire court was wiped out shavi said horrified lugh struggled to contain his despair if we had remained behind we would have been extinguished too we retreated to the watchtower and then to here to the fixed lands we love so much that battle is lost but the war will be rejoined once we have made contact with the court of the final word mallory didnt like the note he heard in lughs voice it was hard uncompromising and promised a brutal revenge for the time being we have come here to help you with your struggle for if this battle is lost our war cannot be fought besides he added we owe a great debt to your fellow sister of dragons and her associate sister no more sister of dragons mallory said where is she he looked at shavi eagerly then weve got another one he paused sister no more what are you talking about you do not know them lugh asked puzzled one of the sisters has lost the fire that blazes inside the morrigan now rides her the other sister a brave woman filled with power came this way before us through the watchtower in the names of your kind she is called sophie lugh didnt have the chance to continue for mallory turned to shavi passionate emotions running unchecked across his face it cant be mallory said he was afraid that lugh would reveal it to be a mistake or some cruel joke the brother of dragons believed this sister to be dead shavi said to lugh lugh shook his head she lives though she was grievously wounded when she came to the far lands she was repaired in the court of the final word then ceridwen emerged from the group to join lugh then i brought her to the court of souls ease sophie is brave and true a fine addition to the ranks of the brothers and sisters of dragons mallory was afraid he would cry with the heady mix of joy and relief where is she he asked his voice breaking the sister of dragons will be here ceridwen replied for the watchtower always ensures that its occupants arrive where they are needed most mallory grabbed shavi in a bear hug and lifted him off the ground shavi laughed i am so pleased for you mallory he said and for us all mallory dropped shavi and looked around as if sophie would miraculously appear before him come on we have to find her shavi placed a hand on mallorys shoulder calm assured there will be time for a reunion time for all the words you thought you would never have the chance to say but that time is not now he motioned to the tuatha de danann depleted in number but still strong these are our allies in the coming fight we will need them at our side but if they stay here they will be taken away or worse attacked where they stand we need shelter mallory we must draw our forces together mallorys heart was thundering so hard that he could barely hear shavis words but he knew the truth of them despite everything he felt he accepted his duty tell your people to follow us he said to lugh well find a safe place for them until the time comes for the battle then he turned to shavi his face brighter and more hopeful than shavi had ever seen it we can do this i really think we can and with that he was away along the street leading the strange troupe with renewed energy in his room huddled before the fire but still not warm hal sat surrounded by piles of books that would have seemed to the casual observer to have been arranged in such a way as to form a defence against the outside world samantha had been forced to return to her own quarters earlier left on his own the assassination of the prime minister had haunted him for much of the day his feelings exacerbated by his memories of his recent visit with the leader the murder would cause despair at a time when they needed hope chaos when they were desperate for an ordered defence during the previous few hours his mind had found some solace in the mystery that had tested him for so many days burying himself in it was an attempt to regain some measure of control when he felt so powerless but more importantly he was still convinced that it was the key to survival at first the puzzle had appeared intractable but the more he allowed himself to sink into its depths the more he began to discover subtle connecting strands hal was aware of the pitfalls that mysteries have a seductive power to lull those trying to solve them into making great leaps that however logical they seem take them in the wrong direction even so he was sure he was close to a breakthrough his thoughts were interrupted by footsteps pounding along the corridor without then a desperate hammering on his door hal opened it to find samantha in a distraught state why have you risked breaking the curfew hal said concerned as she forced her way past him whatever it is they wont be lenient if they catch you out there i wouldnt be surprised hal shut up the sharpness in her tone silenced him instantly whats wrong samantha listened intently through the open door hal could hear shouts running feet drawing closer theyre coming for you hal me theyre saying that you killed the prime minister but i was nowhere near him when it happened theyre saying that he was killed by some secret weapon something you planted on him when you met with him its not true hal took a deep breath ill explain it all when they get here theres been some mistake samantha grabbed hal by the shoulders and shook him roughly stop acting like a sensible clerk theyre after a scapegoat so that they can get everyone behind the new leader and theyre determined to pin it on you she swallowed theyre going to have you executed as a traitor make an example of you but the thoughts wouldnt come quickly enough stop talking she grabbed him and thrust him out into the corridor run find somewhere to lie low until until all this blows over oddly the most overwhelming thought in hals head at that moment was the warmth he felt at the deep concern he could see in samanthas face what about you if they catch you here they wont now go as she ran past him she paused and gave him a kiss on the cheek lingering just long enough to search his face before she was away and down the stairs the sound of the guards was rapidly drawing closer hal ran quickly along the corridor and down the far steps more snow was falling and he would be leaving footprints but he had a head start as he sprinted through the bitter cold and into the night his alarm became intense if they caught him everything he had learned would be lost but could he survive with everyone in the city looking for him suddenly lost and desperate he ran as fast as he could to the only place he knew where he might be able to hide the barricades were up on every street into the city beyond them purple mist was dimly visible away in the night the lamentbrood had arrived their forces encircled the city thousands deep an army that would never give up there was no escape for anyone in oxford the end had begun chapter fifteen the light burns brightest the great mass of the people will more easily fall victim to a big lie than a small one adolf hitler in a bower of ivy and roses hunter and laura lay in a postcoital glow that belied the freezing temperatures outside their refuge was well insulated the ivy covering a layer of interlacing living hazelnut encased in elder then russian creeper and finally densely packed hawthorn at least two feet thick the warmth of their bodies kept the interior temperature nicely balmy even the sound of the howling blizzard failed to penetrate hunter plucked one of the blooms and examined it roses didnt quite picture you as the romantic type laura stretched like a cat actually it masks your body odour when was the last time you had a bath if you think im going to frolic around in water in subzero temperatures youve got another thing coming even if i could crack the ice no im quite happy reeking thank you very much for your information i am romantic it just has to be the right person and youre not it what we have here is sex pure and simple of the moment and not to be considered the instant our bodies separate im in heaven hunter put his hands behind his head and surreptitiously sniffed his armpits i dont get how she became a hero laura knew exactly who he meant ruth had been on both their minds since they had left lincoln laura had not been parted from her since the fall and for a while had thought she never would be they had never really been the closest of friends but they were kindred spirits bound by the pendragon spirit hope and sacrifice and struggle though she would never tell hunter laura was feeling a loneliness she hadnt experienced for a long while you dont know anything about her so keep your trap shut she said i know that shes supposed to be a champion of life or humanity or whatever you want to call it and when it came to the crunch she turned her back on her obligation laura hovered over him eyes blazing you have no right to judge her dont ever do that again the chilling hardness of her expression made hunter reconsider his approach all right i dont know her but you must accept that her decision could mean the end for all of us and maybe its all over because you lot fucked up weve done our bit we fought and sacrificed your five were supposed to pick up where we left off now youve come crying back to us ok back off i wasnt trying to pick a fight laura wasnt about to let him off the hook ruth loved church more than anything shed earned her right to be with him but this life isnt fair is it we went through all we went through at the fall and theres still no happy ending for her they deserved to be together just so that the rest of us could see what true love is really all about hunter grabbed her shoulders and gently pushed her back he was a little disturbed at the way hawthorn shoots had started to burst out of the ground all around him as her anger increased im not saying she hasnt had a raw deal worse than that whatever but sometimes you have to rise above your own suffering duty responsibility call it what you will everybodys relying on us youre perfect for this job arent you she sneered rolling away they lay separated by a gulf for ten minutes until hunter tenderly reached out to stroke her bare back im sorry forget it were going to do our best no blame thats the job too isnt it suppose hunter kissed her shoulder so if youre all plant how do you still get pleasure from this wouldnt you be happier photosynthesising or something i get pleasure from my clitoris and yes like all my other organs i have one i can if i like eat and drink but ive given up on the periods dont you miss being human overrated and i told you ill never be on the rag again you tell me one woman who wouldnt rather be a nature spirit than have to go through that every month hunter watched her as she dressed her personality wasnt the easiest thing to like but he admired her and there werent many people about whom he could say that he rolled over and propped up his head so that he could get a last look at her body so was this plant thing written in the stars when you became a sister of dragons you ask a lot of questions cant you just go to sleep after sex like a normal bloke stop avoiding she sighed being a brother or sister of dragons is about freeing the potential inside you didnt you get the manual you run around leading your daytoday life and then somewhere a switch gets thrown and youre activated over time as you do your duty you learn youre changed by hardship and all the nightmarish things you face and gradually all those hidden qualities you never dared believe you had are teased out into the open so you always had a bit of vegetation deep down inside with some work you could almost be funny i was an environmental campaigner a member of a radical green group treehuggers the rightwing wankers called us so it was there and maybe cernunnos saw that when he turned me into this it was my potential to be a champion of the green living world and ruth became the uberwitch right from pain in the arse to the most powerful woman on the planet shavi became a magician or a seer or whatever he used to call himself he could contact spirits see the other side like that she snapped her fingers veitch poor pathetic useless veitch he went from a jumpedup petty crook to some kind of conan the barbarian warrior and church despite herself her voice took on a hint of deep respect he became the kind of leader youd always want in a fight and like the kings in the old stories he sacrificed himself so that everyone could live again end of fairy story hunter lay back musing wonder what ill become laura eyed him dismissively probably some kind of insect hybrid if theres any justice youre just playing distant because youre secretly brokenhearted that we can never be together he sat up scrubbed his hair and cracked his knuckles right ive eaten as many vegetables and fruits as i can probably cope with ive had sex i think im ready for the rest of the journey they hadnt seen a single soul on their travels south from lincoln much of their route took them across the flat eastern lowlands now a desolate frozen wasteland flurries of snow blew across it in little tornados and the wind cut through their thick clothes there was no sign of any birds or wildlife during the day the sun blazed so brightly off the drifting snow that they had to keep their heads bowed to avoid blindness at night it felt as if theyd been stranded on the surface of the moon they never spoke about what dangers lay ahead or whether they had any hope of survival they lived for the moment seeking what little pleasures they could knowing full well they might be their last ten miles from oxford just as mallory was leading a strange group of gods through the deserted streets of the city hunter and laura finally allowed their darkest thoughts to catch up with them they looked out over a force that left them breathless with its size the lamentbrood numbered millions several miles deep the enemy force now encircled oxford completely the purple mist streaming out from them in the darkness the waves of despair that washed off them made hunter sick to the pit of his stomach looks like we shouldnt have made that last pitstop big boy laura said now whos the fuckup bloody hell i never expected them to reach here so quickly before i set off they were taking their time wiping every population centre clean they must have put on a spurt as if they knew that the brothers and sisters of dragons were gathering so they got straight to the source of the only opposition but how would they know about us laura pushed her hood away from her face her shock of blonde hair glowed spectrally in the dark things like that they can smell us see us on some kind of level we dont understand the pendragon spirit is like a beacon in the night to them hunter surveyed the extent of the lamentbrood his mind racing looking on the bright side at least it means were a threat laura added why dont you divert your brain away from your mouth and come up with a way to get through them and into oxford hunter said humourlessly ask and you shall receive little one hunter looked at her suspiciously unsure whether her sarcastic sense of humour was at play again she grinned revelling in her position of strength but gave nothing away just give me a while to prepare take all the time you want im going to scout around see what other options weve got hunter spurred his horse back down the road and rode for half an hour hoping there would be some gap in the enemy lines knowing in his heart that it was not to be it was impossible for a human army to defeat this demonic force any rational observer would have said that the situation was hopeless but hunter didnt feel that way at all since he had learned of his destiny as a brother of dragons he had come to believe in the pendragon spirit and all that it represented with a faith he had not previously thought existed inside him his life had made him cynical about human values he had killed and seen killing relentlessly he had witnessed murders committed on a whim or because someone was in a bad mood or because of political ideology if that was the norm then human existence was pointless and the quicker the infestation was eradicated the better so that nature could get on with its benign job yet the pendragon spirit had shown him that there was some essential structure underpinning all life an intelligent plan though he was loath to consider it in such a way because of all the baggage that concept carried with it but he knew from his training that it was impossible to make judgments based on the small details a death here a defeat there only by viewing the vast strategic plan could any decision be made about the value of what was happening and for most soldiers on the ground that grand plan was never visible they simply had to trust he hoped existence wouldnt let him down that somehow a handful of flawed men and women burning with an inner fire could take a stand against the hordes of hell and win that the source of their victory would be presented to them that he that all of them were up to the job with no weak links anywhere the alternative was unthinkable when he returned to laura she was sitting crosslegged in the snow her head bowed what little he could see of her skin was as white as the icy blanket that lay all around at first he thought she was sick or worse had been killed by the enemy but when she heard the crunch of his boots she raised her head and forced a smile her face was filled with a debilitating exhaustion as if her life had been sapped from her are you ok he asked dropping to his knees to put an arm around her shoulders its not easy being the saviour of the moment one thing you learn in this business theres always a price to pay for everything hunter could feel heat radiating off her and when he pulled her closer a tingling sensation ran from her body into his as though she was generating electricity it was then that he noted the new green shoots breaking through the snow all around youd better stand back she said im ready now what are you planning wait and see as she bowed her head again hunter moved away from her to calm the horses which had grown jumpy he stroked their noses and whispered in their ears while he watched laura a tremble ran through her then she bucked as though in the throes of a convulsion a second later she pitched forward slamming the palms of both hands down hard through the snow to the ground beneath there was a discharge of blue light that slowly faded to green the horses whinnying grew more insistent a rumble like thunder rolled across the land the ground beneath hunters feet began to shake gently at first but then with more and more force he held on to the horses reins tightly and watched waves roll out from lauras epicentre the tremors built until the ground was rent open in a line running from laura towards the lamentbrood from the churning soil sprouted shoots rapidly growing into saplings then soaring up into trees rushing to meet the sky leaves erupting from the branches thirty years of natures growth condensed into a few seconds laura bucked and writhed in a frenzy that could have been pain or ecstasy sparks blue becoming green fizzed around her fingers where they dug into the earth hunter was rooted in shock he had been astounded by her abilities ever since they had met in lincoln but he had never guessed she was so powerful as the frozen soil tore apart the noise was deafening and the land rippled like water in all directions at the upheaval the flourishing trees formed a densely walled avenue ten feet wide the branches meeting high overhead to form a natural arch the leaf cover was so thick that no sky could be seen through it the row of trees rushed out across the countryside through the ranks of the lamentbrood though the detail was lost in the dark hunter imagined the trees tearing through the massive force throwing those twisted onceliving bodies to either side as the avenue ploughed on towards oxford the sheer scale of what laura had accomplished took his breath away and left him a little uneasy at what she could have done to him if hed pushed her temper a step too far after ten minutes the sparks stopped arcing from her fingertips and she pitched forward into the snow hunter ran forward and lifted her up in his arms her eyelids fluttered she was completely drained match that soldierboy she said hoarsely hunter knew what had to be done as laura slipped into unconsciousness he sat her on her horse and did his best to lash her to the saddle so that she wouldnt slip off setting her mount off ahead of his he urged the horses into the dark avenue and then forced them to gallop as fast as they could manage he didnt know whether the trees would soon start to wither and die or disappear as magically as they had grown the last thing they needed was suddenly to find themselves stranded in the middle of the lamentbrood army but existence hadnt let him down yet oxford beckoned and the last stand was only hours away the damask brothel on st michaels street was packed to the brim in the groundfloor office space in the sprawling firstfloor lounge and the many bedrooms on the two floors above the tuatha de danann moved like golden ghosts aloof introspective silent as the night while the girls gaped in awe or ran giggling to discuss the new arrivals in the confines of their changing rooms or the torture dungeon mrs damask wrung her hands repeatedly dashing to the velvetcurtained windows to peek out into the deserted street i would never have agreed to this if jeffrey had told me what he was planning she wittered in her scottish accent mallory smirked so hunter has a first name he was sitting back in a plush armchair boots up on an antique table a crystal goblet of brandy in his hand washed fed and dressed in clean clothes he felt renewed if the authorities investigate theyll close me down for certain the authorities have more important things on their minds shavi reassured her soothingly he leaned on the mantelpiece next to the roaring fire occasionally tipping back his head and closing his eyes as he smelled the perfume that wafted through the room ill expect to be well paid for this well paid she repeated glaring at mallory as she flounced out humanitys on the brink of extinction and only the privileged few know mallory noted what would it benefit the rest to know shavi said there is nothing they could do better they enjoy some normality in their final hours if final hours they be the ornate clock ticking away on the wall showed that it was just after one am mallory swigged back his brandy im going out to look for sophie this is a big city i would think she has probably already sought shelter somewhere i know but i need to see her again before everything blows up mallory acted blase but shavi could see the emotion coursing through him i understand shavi said but take care in those dark streets the door swung open and lugh and ceridwen marched in their mood intense brother of dragons please come with us lugh said to mallory time is short whats up mallory looked from one god to the other it was ceridwen who answered there are many of our kind already here in the fixed lands they can help us in the coming battle indeed their presence may be vital for they count amongst their number some of the most powerful of the golden ones we must contact them but we need your help how can we help shavi asked there is a ritual lugh said known only to our kind it calls to the ties that bind us however far apart we may be now that there are so few of us left he paused letting the words sink into his own mind now that there are so few of us those ties may be stronger and our own brothers and sisters may be summoned to fight for the cause why do you need me mallory asked with one eye on the clock the fire that burns inside you will give strength to our call ceridwen said the pendragon spirit is the key shavi said to mallory the brothers and sisters of dragons are like batteries sometimes that power heals them on other occasions others may tap into it if you so allow all right mallory said not attempting to mask his irritation get on with it they collected the items they needed from mrs damask and then lugh and ceridwen led the way up a back staircase to a vast dark attic room that had been knocked through into the houses on either side mallory shivered pulling his cloak around him ceridwen marked a circle on the dusty wooden floor with a piece of dressmakers chalk and then lit candles at the four cardinal points mallory was intrigued by how closely the gods ritual resembled sophies work with the craft is all this necessary he said to shavi theyre gods cant they just snap their fingers or something magic shavi said with a strange smile is the cheat code of reality we are in a vast program of repeating patterns a superstructure of encoded rules reality has been constructed and once you know the code that underlies that construction you can change it and thereby change reality reality is not fixed mallory even here in what the gods call the fixed lands it is less changeable than their home but it is still possible to unpick the construction sound and symbol are the keys words of power arcane marks in our literalist rationalist society we see those sounds and symbols only as what they are on the surface but their true power to break through the inherent programming of reality is hidden behind them mallory shook his head dismissively if reality can be altered whats the point that is the point exactly that the world out there is not important that it is what is inside us that truly matters what we do who we are the chinese call it chi spirit it cannot be altered it is the bedrock of everything ceridwen summoned mallory and shavi into the circle they all sat crosslegged facing the centre where another candle flickered lughs face was determined and mallory had the strange impression that the god had altered his appearance had somehow grown more heroic something about his features his bearing ceridwen her dark hair falling about her beautiful face forced a smile to put shavi and mallory at ease but a deep sadness was etched into every aspect of her being at the devastation of her people if only the extinction shears had not been lost lugh said they would have cut through the warp and the weft and the devourer of all things would have been destroyed he bowed his head in contemplation and then lugh and ceridwen began to speak quietly the words passing back and forth interweaving overlaying the rhythms and cadences gradually forming a complex chantsong mallory couldnt understand any of what they said but the words had a strange effect on him nonetheless in that instant he understood exactly what shavi had been saying still chanting quietly ceridwen and lugh put their heads back their eyes rolling under the upper lids so that only the whites were visible within seconds mallory was disturbed to see a clasp at ceridwens shoulder begin to move of its own accord echoed by the shifting of an ornate dagger on lughs belt the two items ran like water becoming silvery then white and finally forming into eggs which then sprouted legs and scurried to the candle at the centre of the circle mallory was fascinated but repulsed shavi saw his reaction and whispered they are known as caraprix all the gods have one they are living creatures but infinitely mutable pets much much more than that they appear to have some kind of symbiotic relationship with the gods in the flickering glow of the candle the caraprix altered shape once more stretching and entwining forming themselves into one object a globe that slowly raised off the boards and began to spin ceridwens brow furrowed her voice becoming more intense and though mallory still didnt recognise the language this time he understood i call to you my brothers and sisters here in the fixed lands this is a time of crisis you are needed to stand with us against a power that would wipe us all from existence come now in mallorys mind images began to appear so richly textured that it was as if he was watching them on a movie screen his emotions linked to what he was seeing before he was swallowed up by the evocative experience he saw from shavis face that his friend was experiencing it too and then he was lost to the rush of visions and sensations as though carried along in the flow of a swollen river he felt deep abiding peace as he saw cernunnos his body a hybrid of flora and fauna stags horns protruding from his head mallorys emotions shifted to unease then fear as the naturegod strode out from a grove of oak trees altering his form as he moved growing bony ridges on his head and greenish scales becoming the erlking of myth somewhere a horn sounded eerily the wild hunt has already been summoned by an ally he said we of all our brethren are close enough to do battle a black dog appeared from the undergrowth accompanied by the sounds of horses and finally other hounds smaller red and white in colour mallory remembered the old stories of the hunt tearing across lonely moors hunting lost souls and he hoped he would be nowhere near when the riders descended on the lamentbrood there were other gods he didnt recognise one that appeared to be made wholly of water breaking through the ice of a deep dark pool another one soaring through the clouds with a face like a human hawk but there werent many of them and they all announced that they were too far away to be of help he was shocked out of his vision by a sudden sharp query from lugh he is here in the fixed lands mallory had an image of a man in long red robes his face halfcovered by what appeared to be a surgeons mask with it came a spike of unease perhaps fear he resists ceridwen said then gone any further discussion was disrupted by a sharp intake of breath from lugh and ceridwen together at a vision of a thousand crows flying chaotically she is here too ceridwen said this time the note of dread was much stronger so the gods were not equal mallory thought some were even feared by their own he had no idea what the birds meant but then shavi was tugging at his sleeve anxiously his eyes rolled upwards watching his inner visions it is the morrigan he hissed and see see she hunts mallory slipped back into his own trancestate and saw more clearly the birds were now transposed over a woman somehow occupying the same space the woman was carrying an axe and had another strapped on her back she was rushing through a snowy street oxford he guessed pursuing three figures a woman and two men the morrigan so dreaded by the others was drawing closer to her prey moving in for the kill mallorys attention was drawn to the hunted instinctively concerned for their safety he realised why a second later the woman was sophie thackeray and harvey were yelling something but sophie couldnt tell what it was all she knew was that her lungs were filled with acid and her legs were on fire her mind pummelled by exhaustion wandered back and forth her vision snatching single images like a slow parade of still photographs a piece of ornate stonework a silhouetted tree twisted like a praying mantis a wide expanse of crisp snow bisected by a row of footprints the part of her that still clutched on to consciousness didnt know how much longer she could keep going when they had first emerged through the portal from the watchtower she had thought that they would have some respite but it wasnt long before caitlin had burst through in their wake sophie recalled the chill she had felt when she had first heard those familiar footsteps crashing like hammer blows into the crisp snow somewhere behind them and so they had run through bleak woods across frozen fields making their way towards oxford but the morrigan never slowed never deviated and sophie knew she never would it was all simply a matter of time and the depth of the reserves sophie had inside her it seemed so unfair she wasnt the warrior she wasnt supposed to engage in brutal handtohand combat just to survive her skill was the craft manipulating from afar perception wisdom she hadnt even done anything wrong all she had tried to do was help selflessly and she had been punished again and again she skidded down a snowy bank and found herself on a hard surface as she tried to run her feet went from under her and she came down hard stunning herself for a few seconds when she came round her cheek was burning where it was pressed against ice sophie pushed herself up slipping and sliding through her daze she realised she was on a frozen river that was why thackeray and harvey had been calling out to her it was the cherwell she couldnt go back so she pressed forward across the ice hoping to get to the other side where she could lose herself in the city centre find a place to barricade herself in not that it would do any good in the centre of the frozen watercourse she slipped again and when she looked back a dark figure was coming down the bank it slowed when it saw sophie defenceless but still advanced now with measured intense paces an axe at its side it might have been an illusion in the gleam of the streetlights off the snow but in that instant there was no sign of caitlin at all sophie saw a woman of terrible beauty long black hair streaming in the wind white white skin and lips as red as blood her eyes burned they said i will hack and slash and drench myself in your blood and even then i will not be done with your body sophie had a shift of perception and it was caitlin again but this caitlin still bore traits of the morrigan was still as terrible and elemental and filled with an insatiable lust for blood the axe beat out a steady rhythm against her leg on the other bank thackeray and harvey jumped up and down urging sophie to get up and run desperately harvey had begun to make snowballs to hurl at caitlin the only weapons he had left to drive her away sophie dug in her heels forcing herself backwards away from caitlin with the last vestiges of her strength she slid across the ice for a few feet then came to a halt caitlin remember who you are sophie said feebly why youre doing this caitlin marched forward head bowed eyes glowering youre a good person caitlin dont let yourself be corrupted this isnt you this but sophie didnt have the energy to continue it was too late the end she lay back on the ice and looked at the vast sweep of stars in the dark vault of the sky so beautiful warmth enveloped her at the knowledge that she could finally rest caitlin loomed over her blocking out the stars she raised her axe high in a last act of defiance sophie closed her eyes in the dark of her head as she waited for the blow somehow she sensed movement a sudden jarring clang of metal on metal made her snap her eyes open caitlin was sprawling across the ice a figure in black was moving with balletic grace and strength swinging a sword that left a trail of blue flames searing through the icy air it looked like some hero from myth larger than life filled with epic determination and uncanny bravery it took a second or two before his real identity registered mallory caitlin rolled and sprang to her feet attacking in a fluid movement so rapid she was almost a blur the axe would have ripped open mallorys chest if he hadnt bounded backwards keeping his balance on the balls of his feet and plunging the sword past caitlins defences a shower of golden sparks burst where the sword skidded off the axeblade it continued through slicing into the top of caitlins shoulder she didnt cry out didnt register any pain on her face at all even though a spurt of blood shot out from the wound and splattered on the ice cold and determined caitlin attacked mallory again they battled back and forth that way for several minutes two jungle cats sparring with grace and savagery neither gaining an upper hand sophie realised how much mallory had advanced since their first meeting from a novice with a sword to someone who could keep a goddess like the morrigan at bay while the morriganpowered caitlin could attack with neverending ferocity it was mallorys human cunning that gave him his edge where caitlin expected a thrust from mallorys sword instead he jammed the blade between her knees and used it as a pivot as he threw his full weight at her she slammed down on the ice wide open for mallorys killing blow in that instant sophie saw clearly the caitlin she had first met in the court of souls ease sad broken hopeful decent mallory dont hurt her she called out pushing herself to her feet mallory stopped midblow halfturned but what surprised sophie the most was the startled expression on caitlins face it was almost human the crack that came from beneath sophie was like a gunshot radial lines shot out across the ice from her feet she didnt have time to think a split second later she was falling into the bitterly cold water mallory saw the ice break and sophie plunge through the hole he couldnt react half his attention was on caitlin knowing that she would kill him from behind if he went to sophies aid in the end he couldnt help himself he ran as close to the edge of the fractured fragile ice as he dared but sophie was already gone falling to his knees he tore at the hoarfrost until the ice was as clear as glass framed in the white window he saw the horrific image of sophies pale face her eyes wide drifting slowly by her cheeks inflated with her last breath her hands scrabbling on the underside of the ice unable to break through drowning freezing the blow to the side of his head made him see stars and he knew as he fell that caitlin had recovered and attacked but there was no blood as he jumped to his feet caitlin had the axe over her head and then brought it down with such force that she was obscured by the eruption of ice before mallory could move she was on her knees she raised one fist and smashed it through the remnants of the ice furiously somehow she latched on to sophies drifting hair yanking her upwards then hauled her through the hole she had made blood streamed down her wrist spraying over sophies face mallory grabbed hold of sophie and helped to haul her out she was shaking violently but still conscious quickly mallory pulled her away from the dangerous ice to the bank where thackeray jumped in to help his face white with desperation mallory threw his cloak at thackeray to wrap sophie in and then turned back to caitlin she was herself again hot tears burning down her cheeks she bared her throat kill me now she ordered i cant control her thackeray stepped in and grabbed mallorys sword hand dont hurt her he pleaded with so much desperate love in his voice that caitlins eyes grew wide with realisation mallory threw thackeray off and swung his sword towards caitlin her eyes now closed the long white line of her throat ready for the killing blow thackeray knew he would remember that image until his dying day caitlin looked like a saint preparing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good thackeray yanked his gaze away just as mallorys sword made contact hot tears welled up in his eyes but when they had cleared he saw caitlin lying on the frozen river and no blood staining the ice a raw lump marked her temple where mallory had struck her with the pommel pick her up mallory barked lets get her back before she wakes next to the blazing fire of mrs damasks lounge mallory hunched over sophie rubbing her frozen hands gently she looked like a little girl bundled in his thick cloak somewhere on the journey back she had lost consciousness and he feared the worst but as he watched intently for the slightest muscle tremor on her face her eyes flickered open dark and searching and then a small smile crept to her lips you saved me she said in a weak voice my big hero mallory fought back the lump in his throat i thought you were dead i thought i thought id never see you again you cant get rid of me that easily she was racked with a coughing fit and when it passed a shadow briefly crossed her face before her smile returned whats wrong he asked concerned when i was in tir na nog i gave up something very valuable to help caitlin i thought id regret it till my dying day and it wasnt important after all she gently touched his cheek as she searched his face this here is like meeting you for the first time all over again how many couples get the chance to experience that same first moment again with all its power mallory had no idea what she was talking about but it wasnt important she was alive they were together a single tear filled the corner of her eye and rolled down her cheek mallory wiped it away he couldnt believe how happy she looked it wasnt a punishment at all she said softly it was a blessing chapter sixteen the lords of despair when the people contend for their liberty they seldom get anything by their victory but new masters george savile marquis of halifax hal sat in an alley just off the high street and watched one of the numerous patrols crawl slowly by as the spotlight in the back of the truck washed across the walls he flattened himself into a doorway as he had done several times already sometimes it was a truck occasionally a jeep or even a lone rider on horseback every time he had finally screwed up the courage to move on another patrol passed locking him in place for more long minutes his fingers and toes were already numb and the lack of feeling was creeping slowly along his limbs more snow was falling the gale howling over the rooftops raising whirlwinds of white along the street hypothermia was a constant threat freezing to death a distinct possibility but the risk of getting caught was too great in the current climate of anger fear and suspicion it was more than likely that some overzealous guard would save everyone the trouble of a trial a bullet in the back of the head a foot on the windpipe or simply locking him up without food or water in an unheated room in the looming crisis who would even care he would simply be one less thing to worry about beneath the cold was a sickness of spirit born of incomprehension how had he become the chief and from the way samantha had described it sole suspect he hadnt done anything that might have hinted at his involvement that left only one other possibility that he was being set up it was obvious that the government had been a hotbed of plotting and counterplotting in recent weeks but he would never have suspected that any conspirator would go to such lengths clearly it had all been running slow and deep and dark like the waters beneath the frozen river a rush of selfloathing swept through him why was he always so naive so selfobsessed so consumed by his own petty emotions and intellectual games that he never saw the big picture shouts rose above the wind a large disturbance nearby afraid that he had been discovered hal ran to the other end of the alley only to be confronted by an iron gate topped with razor wire his heart thundering he huddled down staring at the gleaming snow at the end of the alley in anticipation of a silhouette the shadow of a gun a barked order his attention was caught by a trail of golden light high overhead seen briefly and then lost in the swirling snow slowly a figure descended from the dark and the snowstorm it was petronus the boy who was not a boy still wearing his floppy nightcap mask and his rompersuit outfit his hands were clasped nonchalantly behind his back and his feet crossed as he floated down brother of dragons why do you wait here in the cold and the dark petronus asked curiously im hiding from the soldiers can you help me hal said petronus held out his hands how can i refuse such a request after you saved the life of my companion what do you require a diversion can you swoop around the patrols so theyre distracted enough for me to slip by petronus nodded slowly and under his mask hal had the impression that he was smiling but you must run fast brother of dragons petronus cautioned battle is about to be joined the city is surrounded and soon it will be overrun the news came as a shock but hal could only deal with one obstacle at a time petronus bowed theatrically then swooped to the end of the alley where he paused for a second before darting out as soon as hal heard the sound of gunfire he sprinted out of the alley and across the street as fast as the snow would allow keeping to the backstreets and alleys as much as he could he arrived at mrs damasks just as the sound of whinnying horses echoed across the approach route hal dropped back to wait for the riders to pass only to feel an almost overwhelming surge of relief when he saw that the first rider was hunter behind him a woman with pale skin slumped weakly in her saddle hunter reined in his horse as hal stepped out of the shadows then jumped down in surprise to greet his friend raucously i thought you wouldnt be coming back hal said hal this is me were talking about hunter held out his hands in a disbelieving gesture i am unstoppable unbearable more like what are you doing out in the cold at this time of night hals grin faded the pms been assassinated and they think i did it everyones looking for me laura slid from her saddle and walked up to them wearily can we cut the malebonding i need to get inside to rest i didnt do it hal protested course you didnt hunter said lets face it youre the most unlikely suspect for a political assassin i can imagine hunter clapped a reassuring arm around hals shoulders and nodded towards the unfamiliar woman shes a bossy witch but shes right lets get inside times running out and weve got a lot to do as they walked to the door hal asked whos your friend some kind of plant havent quite decided the phylum subphylum or class yet but probably a distant relative of poison ivy hal gaped in incomprehension while laura eyed hunter superciliously hunter smiled back at her then as they passed through the door laura let it slam in hunters face the atmosphere in mrs damasks warm fragrant lounge was subdued mallory shavi and sophie talked intensely by the fire while lugh and ceridwen pored over a map of the city at the table near the window sophie had already made a remarkable recovery when the new arrivals entered shavi strode quickly across the room and swept laura into his arms with enthusiastic happiness it has been a long time laura he said feels like years she put her head in close to his so that only he could hear ive missed you ive missed all of us together we made a good team didnt we we did this new lot dont know what theyve got give them time they need to draw closer to each other find their shared strengths overcome their weaknesses together time is one thing they havent got shavi ignored her last statement and looked to the door hopefully where is ruth laura shook her head gravely while laura and shavi spoke quietly hunter and hal gathered by the fire with mallory and sophie you look very fit for someone whos supposed to be dead hunter said to sophie with a hint of flirtation youre wasting your time turning it on with me hunter mallorys already warned me about you she replied in a not unfriendly manner hunter feigned a hurt expression well then down to business its a bit late in the day to start talking hal said whos this misery goat sophie shucked off the cloak mallory had wrapped her in her skin so pale and deathly less than an hour ago now bloomed with vitality dont go saying anything against my chum hunter clapped an arm around hals shoulders and crushed hal to him this is hal campbell damned intellectual the brains to my brawn the brains to my beauty hal fought his way free sophies eyes narrowed as if she was peering through skin and bone into hals very heart theres something about you theres nothing about me hal snapped stop picking on him hunter edged hal away from sophies probing stare hal wandered into a corner where he observed the proceedings sullenly this is better than i thought hunter continued with sabrina here back in the land of the living we should be up to speed he glanced at shavi and laura still locked in deep quiet conversation if you count our two substitutes quickly they began to exchange information hunter explained ruths absence sophie could barely hide her disappointment i wouldnt be here today if not for the trail ruth walked before me she said before telling everyone how caitlin had lost her pendragon spirit and become possessed by the morrigan caitlin was locked up downstairs under the guard of thackeray and harvey in case the morrigan reasserted herself we stand a chance then mallory said but id be happier if we had the true number instead of trying to pad it out with laura and shavi still even if we had the proper number five of us against a couple of million hal came forward and said passionately youre missing the point hunter stepped in before hals brusque attitude could offend anyone in the tense atmosphere that lay across the gathering spit it out theres no point just lining up alongside the troops to fight the lamentbrood you can help sure but thats not what youre here for go on hunter said youve been brought together to fight the void not its agents thats what the brothers and sisters were designed for how would you know mallory said sharply hunter held up a silencing hand hals got a brain the size of a planet i trust him think about it hes right we need to focus on finding the real enemy not waste our time fighting his pawns but we dont know where the void is mallory said we cant just sit back and wait until were overrun no you cant hal said but sure as anything the void is going to be here the lamentbrood his generals will bring it into the city with them hal felt uncomfortable when he noticed that everyone was now hanging on his words i always thought it would be bigger than some physical presence sophie said something that could be all around us maybe it is i dont know hal backtracked but this is the place where the last battle will be fought the void is going to be here and you need to be ready to face off against it thats where whatever skills the pendragon spirit has given you will come into play see hunter said i told you hes not just an ugly face then i say we do what we can on the front line mallory said to make sure that the city doesnt get swamped while we try to find out where the void is or what it is sophie said for all we know it could be a little glass bottle of nothing or a tenfoot teddy bear i can help shavi said i can contact the spirits for more information but it takes a great deal out of me so i should not attempt it until i really need to enough jawing laura said all you lot do is talk talk talk it wasnt like that in our day she gave shavi a wink lets hit that front line as they trooped out hal called hunter back hal had been fighting with what he had to say ever since they had entered the brothel but when he saw the bravery the others were exhibiting by putting their lives on the line for a greater cause the guilt consumed him he had to speak out that was smart talking there hunter said im proud of you you wont be in a minute hal began he steeled himself then blurted im a brother of dragons ive known it for a long time but i hid it away i lied to you because i was afraid hunter searched hals face hal couldnt read what was going on in his head but knew that if hunter condemned him it would tear him apart you know now that you say it i can see it hunter mused it certainly wasnt the reaction hal had expected arent you angry with me everybody does what they have to you dont need to be fighting at the front to play your part thats not why you were chosen im betting youre doing your own thing secretly away from the limelight which is just so very hal hal was deeply moved by hunters complete belief in him for the first time he realised the true depth of their friendship and how much it meant to him hunter clasped hals arm in a powerful gesture of support you decide where you need to be and what you have to do if you dont want to come to the front line thats fine dont let me off the hook hal said make me come im a coward no youre not hunter glanced towards the open door he had to go i bet you havent been hiding out in a bunker since you found out what you are youve been doing something to help havent you well see youre playing your part hal youll be where you need to be i trust you how can you say that ive betrayed you and what it means to be a brother of dragons im not up to it stop talking such bollocks now i need to go before someone nicks my horse but ill see you again soon all right hal nodded reluctantly come back for samantha i think shes in love with you hunter gave him a curious look then one more smile and he was gone to death or glory hal wanted to hate himself but hunters words were still flying around in his head perhaps he hadnt been fooling himself that his investigation into the mystery of the wish stone was vital was that really his role as a brother of dragons if so he had to find the solution quickly hunter reined in his mount next to mallory who was just climbing into the saddle of lauras horse sophie shavi and laura waited next to one of the patrol jeeps that had been fitted with a snow plough laura claimed that she had found it in the next street therell be hotspots at three main barricades hunter began on saint giles saint aldates beyond thames street and the high street beyond magdalen therell be another couple of barricades to the west and on the smaller roads to the northeast but those routes wont present easy attack routes so im betting that the main forces will come in from the north south and east we cant be everywhere mallory said what are you suggesting ill take the high street you head south down saint aldates hunter turned to laura think you can grow something strong enough to form a barrier across saint giles its a big road no problem her smile unnerved sophie who hadnt taken to laura at all looking forward to it sophie you need to stay in the jeep with shavi hunter went on move back and forth between the main battle areas and do what you can with your thing storms rats ferocious rabbits if youve got any hats you can pull them out of sophie felt excited at the prospect of using her craft to the extent of her abilities it would be a massive release after all the stress and suffering of the preceding weeks shavi were counting on you to find our primary target hunter continued do whatever you have to do if sophie stays by your side she can protect you if you get into a weakened state shavi smiled enigmatically what hunter said you remind me of my good friend church silenced by the comment hunter urged the others to leave they didnt say goodbye didnt consider the future for a second surviving the present situation was the only thing that mattered alone in the room hal watched the crackling flames as he sank deep into thoughts of king arthur a raging blue fire and the secret language of symbols the solution was so close that he could almost touch it and this time he was going to succeed carefully he laid out the evidence in his mind it was complex but he was sure he had all the information he required the only thing he needed was the key that would unlock the code the underlying pattern of the mystery was the legend of king arthur from everything hal had learned it was clear that the story had been devised at some point in ancient times as a symbolic means of passing information down the years that was a standard way of operating for cultures without the written word in the distant past memory skills had been developed far beyond what modern man was used to greek storytellers could recite by heart every word of homers iliad the celtic bards had vast detailed story banks recorded in their heads passed down from father to son those stories were a secret language locked in their accounts of gods and heroes and men were rules for living life as well as tracts of knowledge about the stars and animals and plants most importantly the stories preserved for all eternity the vast mysteries held by the wise men and women in the only way their culture knew it was an elegant solution lists of facts and figures rules and regulations could be corrupted by memory or easily forgotten but stories went on for ever with the vital information stitched into the fabric of a tale it would always be there to be discovered by anyone who understood the secret language of symbolism the true story the important story was not the one on the surface it was the one hidden beneath and thats what hal knew he had to do cut through the surface story to find the real message the arthurian legends spoke of places where the power of the king was concentrated of camelot and avalon and the lake where excalibur was found many of these places the stories said were pathways to another world but hal knew that the power of the king in the legends was not meant to be the temporal power of an earthly ruler it was real power the blue fire the energy that coursed through the earth and every living thing upon it that was the first and greatest of the hidden messages ley lines spirit paths the dragon lines of the chinese king arthur who was a force for good against evil and the defender of the land against the darkness was a code for this power any place linked to arthur was a spot where the earth power was strongest and these power nodes could be used to cross over to the otherworld the place he had witnessed with awe when he had gazed through the reversed monument at shugborough as hal turned these things over in his mind he found himself becoming increasingly excited for instinctively he knew that he was nearing some point of revelation when a log crackled and spat another connection leaped forward he suddenly realised that like the shugborough monument the symbols coded into the stories had two faces dual strands of information operating one on top of the other in fact the more he considered it the more he knew this to be true duality was everywhere two worlds side by side reflecting each other yet different both influencing the other good and evil humans and gods life and antilife so if there were double meanings in the legends what did that suggest certainly on one level that king arthur was a symbol of the blue fire but on another also that there was a king a king who embodied the earth power a defender waiting to be called back in britains darkest hour that was what the legends said and surely this was the darkest hour of all when life was about to be subsumed by antilife his heart beat faster et in arcadia ego and in arcadia the otherworld i wait but i was not death it was the king and the tomb in poussins painting was where he lay waiting to be awoken and the flipside of that was the anagram of the inscription on the tomb i tego arcana dei begone i conceal the secrets of god the king was infused with the power of god the blue fire the power of life that could throw back the void that was why the secrets had been waiting until this moment to be revealed to be discovered by hal so that he could bring the defender back hal felt a frisson as the pattern surfaced it suggested the influence of a hidden intelligence and a vast unimaginable master plan with connections stretching across millennia almost there now one final question who was the king the plan had clearly been put in motion at some point in the ancient history of cadbury hill when the wish stone had been buried but not just anyone could have found it another connection not just anyone only a brother or sister of dragons that was the key the pendragon spirit was integral to this grand scheme and then he had it jack churchill he said out loud the symbolic king of the last group of five ryan veitch was definitely dead and buried after the devastation of the battle of london but jack churchill was only presumed dead there hadnt been a body that much was clear from the intelligence briefing samantha had recovered from the files what if during the final cataclysmic struggle jack churchill had somehow been thrown into tir na nog perhaps amnesiac perhaps in a coma hals mind raced what if he was such a powerful avatar of the pendragon spirit that he could defeat the voids antilife a secret weapon waiting to be found and brought back and used the ultimate weapon that would tip the balance in the war hal couldnt be sure that he was right not completely but the symbolism and the facts fitted together nicely and instinctively he was convinced he had to tell hunter immediately perhaps there was still time for the brothers and sisters of dragons to cross the barrier between the worlds somehow and bring jack churchill back from his exile the stories said that time operated differently in the otherworld hunter and the others could be there and back in the blink of an eye hal felt a rush of excitement mingled with relief he had played his part and hed done so without leaving his armchair with a whoop he jumped up ready to rush out to the high street to find hunter only he was no longer alone two armed soldiers stood just inside the door and between them was reid time to go hal he said with a cold smile as he made his way along the high street towards the barricade hunter heard his name called anxiously he turned to see samantha running through the snow looking desperate jumping down he ran to her and they embraced passionately how did you find me he said softly when they pulled apart there was a giant all surrounded by blue light samantha appeared dazed after her meeting with the caretaker he told me where you were said i had to take his lantern back to him hunter fetched the wayfinder from the horse where it had been hanging from the saddle tell him thanks for the loan hunter said handing it over touching the lantern had an effect on samantha her pupils grew less dilated her mind cleared hals in trouble she said suddenly i know hes hunter took her by the shoulders to calm her hes safe dont worry she leaned forward to kiss him strongly and hunter felt a surge of love so deep and powerful that it shook him to the core as he pulled away he could see that samantha felt it too dont get killed hunter she caught herself then added you and i you know hal loves you hunter interrupted it was a truth that he had only come to realise in the last hour but once he had recognised it it was obvious samantha was taken aback by his response i know he likes me you should go to him youll make a good couple if all this pans out right samantha took a step back struggling to find solid ground i thought we could a betting man would say i probably wont come out of this alive and even if i do there are lots of places to go people to see women his voice trailed off he couldnt keep it up any longer but he could see from the hardening of samanthas face that he had done enough go to hal hes at mrs damasks he said he needs you she backed away still unsure what to make of his words but her pride would not allow her to say any more dont worry i will when hunter was a short way down the road he allowed himself one quick glance back at the tiny departing figure the blue light from the wayfinder washing out across the snow the sight was heartbreaking then he turned towards the sounds of battle rising up from all sides and spurred his horse onwards his mind locked on conflict and victory the snow was falling heavily when mallory arrived at the southern barricade it added an incongruously ethereal atmosphere to the street scene dampening sounds blanketing the flaws of human living but as he neared the hastily erected metal wall the sounds of battle rose up there were no cries of pain or anger from the lamentbrood beyond they remained eerily silent washing against the barricade like a summer swell in a harbour but the soldiers lined up along the walls made up for it with a cacophony of defiance it was all an act mallory could see that their faces were etched white with fear beyond the barricade the hellish invading army stretched as far as the eye could see they fired saos hand pistols rifles from the walls and from all vantage points on the nearby buildings brass cartridges rained through the air glittering in the arc lamps and the sound was like a caribbean rainstorm further back from the barricade the big guns waited for any enemy breakthrough of the front line mallory reined in his horse and waited it was only a matter of time before the defences were swept aside by the massive unfeeling force pressing against them yet it happened even more quickly than he had anticipated within fifteen minutes there was a sound like the howl of a dying animal as the metal plates began to buckle under the weight of bodies crushed against them one of the soldiers firing from the top of the wall lowered his weapon his mouth gaping jesus christ whats that on the other side of the barricade the purple mist was rising as the lamentbrood clambered on top of each other to allow those behind to gain purchase they reminded mallory of ants but riding the crest of the twisted bodies was a gleaming yellowwhite figure that mallory recognised from hunters description as the lord of bones it had grown in size now almost twice the height of a man its bulk increasing a little with every skeleton sucked into its voracious mass there was a hunger to it in the avid gleam of its eyes and the way it reached out with clackingbone hands desperate to snatch anything that fell within its reach most of the soldiers leaped from the wall as it fell apart but one remained in position a second too long firing his pistol futilely into the seething mass the lord of bones eyes swivelled towards the soldier fixed on its target and then moved towards it with alarming speed crushing hands shattered the soldiers wrist and yanked him forwards the lord of bones stood erect on the roiling lamentbrood beneath it and pressed the yelling squirming soldier against its chest mallory was sickened as he watched the victims skeleton sucked out of his body leaving a flopping sack of skin and organs that was tossed to one side to splatter into the snow and then the lord of bones threw its head back opened its mouth and released a sound that was not a sound it made mallorys stomach turn and his brain fizz it was the creatures roar of victory mallory lost sight of the lord of bones in the confusion as the barricade burst apart and the lamentbrood flooded through into the city for a brief moment he was rooted as the lamentbrood caught hold of fleeing soldiers broke necks ran swords through stomachs gouged out eyes and then mere seconds later repossessed the dead twisting their bodies forcing weapons to meld with bone and flesh the reanimated corpses joining the ranks of those who had slain them to turn on their former comrades the big guns released a hail of massive fire power mallory fought to control his horse glad that something had torn his gaze away from the hellish vision smoke swept across the street when it cleared scores of the lamentbrood had been ripped to pieces but hundreds more surged in to take their place the gun positions were overrun in seconds the remaining soldiers fleeing powerless mallory drew llyrwyn and suddenly the street was flooded with brilliant blue light even the falling snow appeared to be sapphire flakes mallory had never seen such a powerful display the flames raged so forcefully along the blade that it vibrated in his hand rang up his arm and into his heart digging in his spurs he propelled his horse into the fray lamentbrood fell beneath the trampling hooves skulls split torsos crushed the air itself singed as mallory swung his sword the lamentbrood fell before him like grass before a scythe none could touch him and soon the ground was covered with corpses and his horse was trampling them into the snow in mallorys mind all sound disappeared the hacking of bone the ringing of steel the thunder of hooves until a deep silence swaddled him he couldnt smell taste touch and a blue sheen lay across his mind in that instant he was the sword and the sword was him each possessing and being possessed by the other finally the lamentbrood fell back at some silent summons their ranks parted and the lord of bones marched through it towered over mallory even on horseback its bones splattered with red human blood it surveyed mallory for a moment a cold intelligence that insinuated through the blue into mallorys mind unbearably alien betraying no recognisable emotion and then when it was satisfied that it understood what lay before it it drove forward with a speed belied by its size mallory forced his horse to dance out of the creatures path but it only just evaded the charge the lord of bones talons ripped through mallorys trousers and into the flesh beneath and as the fingers scythed across his flesh mallory felt a tugging in his bones as if they were on the verge of being sucked out of his body mallory guided the horse to circle and then drive in llyrwyn blazed through the air to smash against the bonecreatures shoulder blade the impact almost threw mallory out of the saddle bone erupted outwards and parts of the creatures form began to fall away but it clearly felt no pain and immediately launched another attack that mallory only just avoided they continued that way for nearly half an hour with no sign of the creature weakening every now and then the lord would draw blood with its razorsharp fingers and mallorys clothes were now wet and sticky in many places mallory had a vision of losing the battle of the thing pulling his skeleton clean out of his skin he wondered with a sickening fascination what his final thoughts would be the horses breath and his own mingled in a hot white cloud in the freezing air but while mallory tirelessly sustained his attack his horse was growing sluggish finally as mallory brought his searing sword down in a hissing strike that shattered a portion of the lord of bones skull his mount failed to retreat quickly enough the lord of bones seized its moment like a striking snake it grabbed mallory and ripped him from the saddle pressing him close to its hard body it smelled incongruously of milk mallory fought to free himself but a powerful sucking sensation had already manifested deep inside him it felt as though hooks had been attached to his bones and were pulling them out through his muscle and skin the agonising pain drove him to the edge of unconsciousness but he continued to fight to the last the hurricane wind came from nowhere mallory and the lord of bones were thrown through the air against a building on the far side of the road the lord of bones took the brunt of the impact but mallory was knocked unconsciousness by the shock when he came round he was lying in the snow his entire body on fire with pain from the sucking power of the lord of bones but it was fading the creature was staggering around its right arm shattered into pieces and a section of its torso falling away the wind had died down a little but the snow still blasted against mallorys skin like hot pins dazed he staggered to his feet searching for his sword it lay halfburied in a drift nearby but the lord of bones had seen him again and was rapidly stalking his way before it could reach him there was a deafening clap of thunder lightning crashed down in a direct hit on the lord of bones in the flash of blinding light mallory was hurled backwards but this time he fought to stay conscious the air reeked of burned iron what remained of the lord of bones still stalked around smoke rising from the shattered bones drunkenly mallory retrieved his sword the moment the weapon was in his hands and the blue flames were roaring his mind became sharp and focused he attacked the lord of bones with venom not stopping his hacking and slashing until only a few bone shards remained and a faint purple mist was drifting in the nowsubsiding gale mallory looked around eagerly he knew who he had to thank for his survival sophie stood in the drivers seat of the jeep arms raised in supplication to the sky gradually she sagged as the power faded she managed a wave and a smile before shavi urged her to drive to another location the lamentbrood appeared disoriented by the lord of bones destruction but mallory could see that they were slowly reforming their ranks to prepare for their next advance all the surviving soldiers had fled to another fallback position there was nothing else he could do reclaiming his weary horse he turned back into the city following the tracks of sophies jeep the row of mighty oaks soared more than thirty feet above lauras head and the barrier was at least the same distance thick almost all her reserves had gone into constructing it but she knew it would not keep the lamentbrood out for long already she could hear the hacking of their weapons against the trunks they would not tire would not defer to serious injury they would just keep going until they crushed everything in their path laura walked away in search of shelter to recover only to be halted in her tracks by gunfire coming from the buildings on either side of the wall of trees knowing instantly that it signalled a change in tactics she angrily stormed into the nearest building and climbed the stairs to the second floor where two soldiers were pumping rounds wildly into the swarming lamentbrood on the other side of the defence they were so preoccupied with their task that laura could creep close enough to see past them the lamentbrood were clambering up the side of the building to get access to the windows so that they could bypass the trees some were smashing their weapons into the brickwork to gain foot and handholds others were simply clambering up on top of compacted bodies but at the head of the climbing ranks was the lord of lizards the glow from the street lights glistened on its skin its entire body writhing with the packed combination of snakes toads and newts its appearance revolted her but what made her feel worse was the hunger that gleamed in its reptilian eyes the soldiers slugs ripped through it with little effect and the two men were growing increasingly scared as the beast drew nearer to them soon it would be in a position to pull itself through the window laura leaned against a wall and closed her eyes in her mind she could see one final blue spark of power burning in the depths of her would it be it enough she coaxed the spark higher and focused just beyond the window the lord of lizards paused as an odd sensation moved through its body deep in the stomachs of the many creatures that made up its form biological matter was starting to move change grow laura concentrated she had all but exhausted her abilities one last drop remained one minute amount left to be squeezed out the pressure inside the lord of lizards grew laura gave it her last burst of energy a holly bush a rowan tree a hawthorn and several other small shrubs and plants grew within the lord at once ripping through weak flesh in an instant the amalgamation of lizards exploded in a puff of purple smoke and a sudden shower of red roses laura thought that was a nice touch too weak to be any more use she lurched back down the stairs to the street her actions had bought them a little time to find the void that was all but as she headed back towards the city centre humming an old basement jaxx song she reflected that shed at least got a little pleasure from her last wanton act of violence sophie brought the jeep to a sharp stop the wheels skidding in the snow anything she asked shavi shook his head the strain on his face starting to show it used to take an intensive ritual to contact the spirits but recently i have been able to do it easily often they felt as if they were always around so that i could talk to them at any moment but now a shiver ran through him they are not answering my call come on shavi we have to find the void its all down to us you mean it is all down to me i know i will not fail you he looked around then said get me inside one of the buildings away from this cold i can concentrate set up a ritual there was a faint note of desperation in his voice that to sophie sounded out of character they clambered out of the jeep and struggled through the snowstorm towards the nearest buildings hunter was aware of mallorys arrival but he couldnt take his eyes off the lord of flesh the scores of snapping animal mouths threatened to tear at his flesh whenever he came close hed already discarded his gun as useless after that hed wrenched a spear from one of the lamentbroods limbs in the hope that it would allow him an arms length attack but it had simply passed through the churning furry bodies without inflicting any serious harm now he was left with a rusted sword the jagged forearm of one of the lamentbrood still hanging from the hilt ive taken one of these things down already mallory yelled as he guided his horse in a circle around hunter and the lord of flesh arent you the bigshot hunter replied through gritted teeth he attempted another flailing lunge that resulted in a ferocious snapping of jaws you need a hand mallory swung llyrwyn and sheared through several of the lamentbrood who were drawing too close for comfort the brilliant light from the sword made the others shy away what do you think hunter snapped mallory directed his horse to the opposite side of the lord the creature ranged back and forth attempting to strike at one then the other i prefer my weapons a bit more on the modern side hunter said mallory grunted a poor workman always blames his tools theres only one tool around here hunter relished landing a blow that took the head off a badger and its not me as the lord of flesh responded furiously to hunters attack mallory seized his moment driving in to hack at the creatures head from behind a mass of furry bodies rained across the area before the lord could recover from mallorys blow hunter had leaped from his horse and was slashing at its legs bloody chunks fell all around and within seconds the lord had crashed down into the snow together mallory and hunter jumped in to finish the thing off they didnt stop chopping until there was no recognisable shape left amongst any of the animals that had made up the lords form mallory held hunter back as purple mist drifted up all right he said hes done for they ran to their horses and mounted them quickly well regroup further down the street hunter yelled above the wind i wonder if these things burn got a plan i wouldnt quite call it that yet hunter reined in his horse and looked around can you hear that at first mallory couldnt but then a low drone began to float in from the darkness beyond the city growing louder gradually becoming even louder still the wind suddenly and mysteriously dropped look hunter said the lamentbrood had stopped moving it was an eerie sight to see them all standing stockstill like statues they were waiting for something whats that noise mallory said rubbing his ears the rising sound felt as if it was drilling deep into his brain hunter knew hed heard it before and the memory brought a strong queasy response i think he said that the king is about to enter the building chapter seventeen twilight of the gods i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal abraham lincoln blood stained the front of hals shirt and crusted his top lip where he had been punched repeatedly in the face by members of the arresting party his jaw ached and one eye was so swollen that he could barely see out of it the guards had made it quite plain that there would be no trial judge or jury it had already been decided that he was guilty of the assassination plot hed lost consciousness at some point during the beating but now as he looked around he saw that he was in one of the cells in the highsecurity area in the brasenoselincoln complex through the walls he could hear the dim cries of the supernatural creatures that had been imprisoned down there they all sounded distressed frightened dull panic battled with guilt everyone was relying on him and hed allowed himself to be taken he should have guessed that reid and the others would know where hed be hiding out hunter wouldnt have made that mistake nor would any of the others why was he so useless he fought down his contempt for his own abilities and forced his mind to focus on a way of getting out the alternative was unthinkable as hal racked his brains for some kind of strategy the door swung open and reid slipped in mister reid i didnt do anything hals protestations died on his lips when he saw reids slight smile of course you didnt reid leaned against the door and folded his arms he was completely assured displaying just a hint of the arrogance that he had kept in check in recent weeks hal could see reids complicity writ large in his features you set me up youre responsible for this whole plot yes and no im just a loyal servant doing what im told going where im ordered then who do you report to the general reid laughed the general is a simple man soldiers do not normally make good politicians hes even more of a lickspittle than me though im sure he would never characterise himself in that way just following orders thats the general the dignity and honour of being a public servant reid watched the thought processes rush across hals face and shook his head laughing youre too simple a person mister campbell uncomplicated i think is the polite phrase not cynical very very innocent reid made it sound like an insult the conspiracy extends much more widely than you could possibly guess everyone in the government is involved certainly everyone in the upper echelons the cabinet the cabinet the senior advisors spies policemen business leaders aristocrats all the people who made up the great and the good before the fall and who now keep the country running hal was dumbfounded all of them why what could you possibly gain by killing the pm now when everything is falling apart and we need a strong leader exactly the pm was being particularly obstructive to the route that everyone else felt was best to preserve traditional values and our way of life and time was running out so you killed him no you killed him theres no evidence of that hal protested ah but there is a great deal of evidence in fact reid pulled out a digital photo of a strange starshaped object hal recognised it instantly reid had handed it to him when he had taken hal into the secure storeroom to give him the wish stone mystery to investigate odd thing this reid continued we still havent discerned if theres a biological element to it but one of our scientists discovered early on to his great misfortune that when activated it pumps everexpanding tendrils into the body and tears it apart from within and this innocuouslooking object was by the side of the pms body when it was found with your fingerprints all over it so you didnt want the stone investigated at all it was just a ploy to fit me up hal put his head in his hands sickened by the machinations what was the point in framing me if there were so many people involved in the conspiracy why didnt you just bump the pm off and have done with it reid grew uncomfortable he was still hiding something the majority of our soldiers and employees the people generally needed a culprit to focus their minds and keep them fully behind the project but why me was i simply in the wrong place at the wrong time reid didnt answer and what was happening with manning all the weird things i saw ah ms manning a very puzzling woman she appeared to be on board at first but recently he shrugged shook his head theres an order out for her arrest you think youve got everything covered but its all a waste of time the void is still going to wipe everything out reid nodded indeed you want that hal jumped to his feet in disbelief reid raised one warning finger he remained calm but there was a deep threat implicit in that simple motion you cant escape hal you cant run every single person in authority out in the city has your description orders have now gone out for you to be shot on sight youre safer here why dont you just kill me now hal flopped on to the bed and covered his face again nothing made any sense oh i will your execution is imminent we cant have you blurting all this out and ruining things but first you have one more little part to play it took a second for reids words to register and by then the spy was slipping out of the door with a cruelly triumphant smile directed at hal the door closed with a click the locks slipped back into place you can set me free im not going to hurt anyone caitlins pleading voice cut to thackerays heart he could barely look at her tied to an old wooden chair her wrists bound behind her back and roped to her ankles the knots pulled so tightly that they had brought droplets of blood to the surface of her pale chafed skin her face looked so innocent the caitlin he had met all those weeks ago in the devastation of birmingham when hed cared for her and first realised he had fallen in love but with the morrigan still inside her they couldnt take any chances hed seen what the goddess could do one flick of a wrist could snap his neck and shed move on without giving it a second thought you know i cant do that he said but theres been some kind of change i can feel it the morrigan isnt controlling me any more her eyes were wide and hopeful a faint smile played on her lips thackeray looked away hating himself that he couldnt trust her any more part of him wished he hadnt been dragged into this senseless world of gods and magic but then he would never have met caitlin and his life would have been immeasurably diminished yet when he glanced back at her he felt that there was something subtly different about her though he couldnt quite put his finger on what it was caitlin put her head back her eyes flickering it feels as if shes waiting she muttered to herself the door was thrown open abruptly and harvey launched himself into the room hed been keeping watch from the first floor for any developments weve got to get out of here theyre evacuating the street he rubbed a hand over a thin wrist for warmth moving everybody to some buildings down in the centre like thats going to do any bloody good he added dismally thackeray glanced at caitlin her head framed against the window where the snow fell heavily harvey was one step ahead what are we going to do with her we cant leave her here its too dangerous to take her with us harveys birmingham accent grew thicker in times of stress bloody hell thackeray youve got us into a right old mess why couldnt you have fallen for a normal girl torn thackeray wandered past caitlin to look out of the window there was frantic activity in the street people running others tumbling out of doorways laden with possessions unconsciously he reached out a hand to touch caitlins hair the snapping of ropes caught him by surprise his wrist was snatched gently as caitlin rose up and turned towards him across the room harvey flung himself back against the wall whimpering dont hurt him he pleaded but after the initial shock thackeray wasnt scared the cold terrifying fury of the morrigan was no longer visible in caitlins face thackeray pulled her to him and held her tightly her heart thundering against his chest when she pulled back tears gleamed in her eyes its come back a transcendental smile leaped to her lips i felt it enter me blue so very blue its back thackeray im one of them again corpus christi was filled with long shadows as shavi and sophie made their way along empty corridors where the only sound was their footsteps finally they found an unlocked office and slipped inside sophie battened down her anxiety and said do you think you can make contact here i will try shavi cleared a desk to one side to make a space on the floor for him to sit something is amiss there is what i could only characterise as background interference which is impeding my attempts to reach the spirits on the other side interference is it being caused by the void perhaps sophie stood quietly in one corner while shavi sat crosslegged in the centre of the room slowly he lowered his chin on to his chest his long hair falling across his face his breathing grew slower more measured until he began to make a faint soooo sound on each exhalation it was a ritual chant of some kind sophie knew designed to attract the attention of the spirits with which shavi communed after five long tense minutes sophie began to believe that it wasnt going to work but then shavis head snapped back as if he had been punched on the chin his eyes were open but all that was visible were the whites his breathing had become laboured and from the twitching of his facial muscles it was clear that he was in some distress sophie wasnt sure if it was part of the ritual but was afraid that if she disturbed him shavi might come to harm her paralysis was broken when blood gouted from shavis nose mouth and ears and in scarlet teardrops from the corners of his eyes she ran to his side and put her arms around him gently urging him to break the trance he came round with a convulsion that threw him halfway across the room as if he had been hit when his eyes finally flickered back to normal she began to ask what had happened his response was so violent it shocked her it is here he yelled still in the final grip of the trance it has been here for a long time sophie gradually managed to calm him sitting up with his head in his hands he said with a shudder my consciousness touched it i felt he swallowed nothing a bleak emptiness of the soul it was horrible are you ok i will recover another shudder it is as i feared it is protecting itself hiding its location thats interesting sophie mused why would something so powerful feel the need to hide shavi forced a weak smile because the brothers and sisters of dragons can stop it it is remaining hidden until it is too late for us to do anything we have to tell the others sophie helped shavi to his feet but if you cant find it how are we going to pin it down the door swung open before shavi could respond the silhouette framed in the doorway at first gave the impression of two people standing one just behind the other but as the figure moved into the room sophie and shavi saw that it was just one woman her hard pale face framed by black hair her body swathed in expensive furs my name is catherine manning i know who you are i know what youre doing and im on your side she said in sharp clipped tones you need to come with me anticipating a weapon sophie pulled shavi back towards the far wall even when she saw that manning didnt appear to be armed she still maintained her guard what do you want were in the last hour of the human race mannings eyes shone glassily everythings coming to an end the enemy have broken through our defences and youre sitting here getting nowhere leave us alone sophie said we know what were doing really manning couldnt restrain the snide tone that came too easily to her voice do you realise what little time you have you know nothing do you sophie made to respond angrily but shavi held her back with an arm across her chest and you know something she nodded i know the only information you need i know where the void is sophie turned to shavi we cant trust her we ought to find the others we have no choice shavi said i have failed he turned to manning where is the void i have to take you there shavi sophie cautioned but she knew he was right if there was even the slightest chance that manning knew the location of the void they had to seize it all right take us there quickly sophie said but ill be watching you stop whining and get a move on we may already be too late manning stood back to let shavi and sophie pass through the door neither of them saw the faint outline of another figure behind her shimmering as if fighting to gain weight and form the drone reverberated off buildings setting mallory and hunters teeth on edge it sounded as if a wasps nest as a big as a house had been disturbed the whole of the high street was filled from wall to wall with lamentbrood they lapped around on either side their measured relentless pace driving them on eyes dead weapons scraping against brickwork an echo of the buzzing hummed in mallory and hunters heads but that was the collective voice of the lamentbrood whispering cajoling spreading its message of despair mallory and hunter fought back but it felt as though a tidal wave of depression was about to break over their spirits and consume them mallory clutched his sword tightly as he urged his horse back a few paces even the blue flames that danced along the blade were dampened he glanced at hunter who looked back at him before they both fixed their eyes on the darkness looming over the heads of the marching monstrous army they moved their horses a few more yards away from the enemy and when they turned back it was there towering a good ten feet off the ground was the king of insects its body a swarming mass of wasps bees flies dragonflies every tiny scurrying creature that had been sucked into its orbit the gravity of the being far exceeded its physical dimensions hunter remembered when his mind had briefly touched it on the killing fields of scotland but now it was more powerful stronger more intelligent and more savage than any of the lords the force of its monstrous will radiating off it like the heat from a furnace the lamentbrood parted in small eddies as it moved amongst them but when its ranging eyes fell on mallory and hunter both of them were stunned by the voracious glee they sensed it wanted them it desired to rip them apart and crush both their bodies and their souls and they knew this as completely as if it had spoken to them im going to need a bigger sword mallory said with flat humour were going to need something hunter replied lets find the others they turned their horses and sped away the weight of the king of insects stare hard on their backs it was speaking to them i can bide my time you cannot run you cannot hide your end is near they found laura where the high street met cornmarket street she was recovering from her exertions i killed the lord of lizards she said with untoward glee but the lamentbrood broke through theyre on their way here theyre coming from three directions hunter glanced around quickly laura and mallory both knew that he was looking for a place to make a final stand have you seen sophie and shavi if we can find the void before the rest of the lamentbrood get here we might actually be able to achieve something sophie helped me out earlier mallory said then she drove off in the jeep with shavi not seen either of them since they dropped me off laura said where the hell are they hunter cracked his knuckles irritably before adding to himself and wheres hal rapid gunfire interrupted them as a small group of soldiers hurried past from the south the leader saw hunter and yelled fall back theyre coming the men disappeared along cornmarket street the steady tramp of thousands of feet could be heard approaching up st aldates were going to get boxed in if we follow them mallory said i dont think we have a choice hunter replied shame and its such a beautiful night laura said she raised her face so that the big white flakes could settle gently on it laura climbed on to hunters horse and they caught up with the soldiers as they veered right into market street further along cornmarket street a wall of lamentbrood moved towards them mallory hunter and laura galloped into market street where government workers were congregating in jesus college and the other buildings surrounding it in a futile bid for safety ahead hunter caught a glimpse of gold amongst the falling snow as he neared he saw that it was the tuatha de danann their battle armour gleaming as they waited bristling with arms lugh hailed them this is where we make our stand lugh said as hunter jumped down to greet him the street is narrow enough for us to hold back the main flow of the enemy he motioned behind him to the divinity school and if we fall you brothers and sisters of dragons may retreat in there it is defensible you may be able to hold it for a while there was little hope in lughs voice but oddly little despair either he acted as if impending doom was just another twist in lifes plan hunter surveyed the divinity school it was easily the most beautiful medieval building in oxford he couldnt have imagined anywhere better for a last stand for hundreds of years the walls had rung with the lectures and disputations of the theology faculty with talk of higher purpose of meaning it would be a fitting context for their defeat mallory gripped llyrwyn when he saw caitlin marching towards them from the shadows of the ancient building lugh held up his hand hold your sword brother of dragons she is one of you once more a sister of dragons im sorry caitlin said when she stood before them i made a mess of things but im all right now i can help how did that happen mallory asked suspiciously he couldnt forget the unbridled ferocity he had seen inside her on the frozen river i think saving sophie was the key caitlin replied hesitantly i dont know it might have been some kind of test she shrugged smiled whatever i passed the pendragon spirit came back into me she closed her eyes beatifically revelling in the surging energy she could feel inside her im a sister of dragons again and ive still got the morrigan inside me but i can control her now nearly a full complement of the true five mallory said nearly hunters jaw was set he wondered if hal was really going to let them all down when they needed him the most the teethjarring drone of the king of insects rose up once more the noise echoing even more loudly off the closely packed buildings lugh gave an order in a language that hunter couldnt understand and the gods fanned out across the street we should be standing with you mallory yelled to lugh you will get your chance to fight brother of dragons the sun god said you form the second rank any of the lamentbrood who break through must be dispatched by you hunter mallory caitlin and laura exchanged silent glances they all knew that it was too late to consider tactics too late to give in to despair at their diminishing chances of survival they were in the twilight hours and the light was fading fast all that was left to them was to immerse themselves in the moment to fight the battle before them and to hope that others would save the day the lamentbrood came first a purpletinged wave breaking against the golden shore hunter speculated that the king of insects had sent them ahead to test the defences the monstrous being hovered back watching intensely wasps swarming around its head the lamentbrood slashed and hacked with the weapons embedded in their limbs not caring whether they lived or died the first wave fell like corn at harvest time but their ranks were replenished in seconds they would not be repelled they would not be beaten even so the tuatha de danann fought with breathtaking skill and fury hunter a dedicated student of the art of war had never heard of anything like it in the annals of human history the fluid movements of the gods swords became a golden blur flashing back and forth lightning strikes that sent heads and limbs flying and made a growing mountain of the desiccated soulless bodies of the lamentbrood in that moment hunter saw clearly why the celts had considered them gods the tuatha de danann were glorious their human form made them appear commonplace and understandable but they were far far beyond human refined power like electricity briefly taking a shape humans could recognise lugh was in the forefront of the battle one foot braced against the bodies of the lamentbrood as he cut down all who came at him seemingly with no need for rest to hunter he looked like the sun itself for a powerful light shone off him the more invigorated he became and seeing the dedication with which the tuatha de danann threw themselves into the defence of fragile creatures hunter wondered if there was a chance they could win despite the odds like the others he was gripped by the battle and the clashing of steel but his attention was disturbed by a presence beside him it was ceridwen floating like a ghost from the divinity school you are seeing the twilight of a race she said tears glistened in her eyes and as if in answer to her words the first of the tuatha de danann fell a flurrying cloud of golden moths soared up to meet the falling snow from the place where his body had been sundered by a lamentbrood axe in that instant hunter knew that he had been fooling himself however great the tuatha de danann were they were just a handful against a multitude and like the rocks on a beach they would slowly be eroded by the pounding waves laura darted forward and retrieved the sword dropped by the departed god she offered it to hunter a goingaway present she said with a wry smile use it wisely hunter gripped it tightly enjoying the way it appeared to sing in his hands get set he shouted theres just too damn many of them mallory said bitterly another of the gods fell in a burst of golden wings caitlin removed one of the axes fastened to her back a chill ran through hunter as he saw the odd cast of her face the morrigan was preparing for battle since the first glimmer of light in the universe my people have been bound into the heart of existence ceridwen continued in a low mournful tone that oddly rose above the sound of battle we thought we would always be here always standing proud with a view across the many lands but now our age is coming to an end you dont have to die here hunter said ceridwen shook her head we have chosen to make a stand with the fragile creatures our kindred now we will not let you down whatever is to become of us the golden ones will fight to the last she bowed her head slightly then returned to the divinity school as if the battle had already ended at the far end of the street beyond the looming bulk of the king of insects hunter could just make out a disturbance rapid movement the flash of steel the wild hunt mallory said in awe otherworldly horses filled with power and ferocity cut a swathe through the lamentbrood their riders brought down scores of the enemy with long pikes affixed with sickleshaped blades every now and then strange red and white dogs ran up sheer walls before descending on the lamentbrood with snapping jaws though the hunt fought ferociously in and out of the surging currents of the lamentbrood there were not enough of them to make any significant impact hunter felt his mouth grow dry his palms sweaty familiar signs that told him instinctively that battle was not far away four more of the tuatha de danann fell on one edge of their defensive line leaving a gap through which the lamentbrood surged caitlin bounded forward in an instant with a bloodcurdling yell and a flash of an axe and the first of the lamentbrood dropped to its knees its head cleaved in two at the level of the top of its ears caitlin followed through with a backhand slash that took down another and then she was fighting wildly using not just the axe but tearing at throats with nails and teeth if her strokes were constricted eyes were torn out ribs dug open and snapped jaws ripped off and then mallory was at her side the blazing blue flames of llyrwyn adding a majestic counterpoint to the morrigans horror of blood and death together they plugged the gap yet there was only the briefest lull for more gods fell at the other end of the line and hunter threw himself into the fray to fight alongside laura who was using both a short sword and her own abilities to send nature rampant in the vicinity bursting bodies with suddenly sprouting trees or tying others up in constricting ivy in the thick of it there was no room for distraction every iota of concentration and energy was given over to staying alive each opponent was only inches away from hunters face their eyes glassy their flesh peeling back to reveal the bone beneath and as each one fell another took their place wounds multiplied across hunters body then an axe came crashing down towards him hunter barely avoided it but the blow continued to fall and sheared lauras sword hand off at the wrist dont worry she cried dont worry she staggered back clutching at the stump her face drawn but there was no blood hunter had no chance to check whether she had crawled back to safety for the lamentbrood were instantly forcing their way through the gap in the line driving the other defenders back retreat regroup lugh yelled hunter ran into the shadow of the divinity school and only then did he see with dismay that a mere seven of the tuatha de danann remained lugh stood amongst them heroically organising his dwindling band for their final stand and though his face remained stoic and committed hunter knew what desperate thoughts must be raging through his head at the impending destruction of his race lugh saw hunter staring and said we stand and fall as brothers our two peoples joined for all time equals what do you say brother of dragons i say were proud to have you at our side lugh hunters attention was caught by laura sitting against a wall keep your eyes on the battle she snapped i can look after myself though he couldnt be sure it appeared to hunter that where her stump had been something was growing mallory was suddenly at his side this is madness weve barely made a dent in the lamentbrood and that big bastard is still waiting there untouched if hes directing them we should try to take him out i agree hunter said but how do you propose we get through that lot the next wave of lamentbrood reached them a second later the defenders fought furiously but their numbers were too few they were driven back and back until they were pressed against the ancient brick walls hunter knew the signs they were minutes from being overrun another of the tuatha de danann fell and then another as hunter yelled we cant hold the position get inside the building and barricade the doors but they were already too hemmed in to escape to the divinity schools entrance while striking out with his sword lugh turned to hunter and said get set brother of dragons the golden ones will buy you time hunter knew what he meant and felt a wave of sadness wash over him but there was no time to consider it or even to acknowledge lughs final act of sacrifice while hunter fought for his life against two of the lamentbrood lugh drove forward with his remaining men apparently towards the king of insects the lamentbrood instantly turned all their attention on the gods lugh led his men into the heart of the surging mass there was no possible escape blows were raining in from every side with caitlin fighting a frenzied rearguard action hunter led mallory and laura through the open door of the divinity school once inside hunter turned to look back golden moths were glowing amongst the snowflakes but lugh fought on alone not relenting in his determination to repel the attackers until there was a bright flash like the sun coming up on a glorious day when the light cleared he was gone chapter eighteen the king of insects the next greatest misfortune to losing a battle is to gain such a victory as this arthur wellesley duke of wellington hal refused to give in to despair while the cries of the supernatural beings that filled the cells around him grew more frenzied with each passing hour he had reached a zenlike state where he had just about managed to prevent the guilt and the powerlessness from eating away at him all his hope was placed in hunter and the others they would discover where he was and then overcome all odds to free him that was the kind of thing the brothers and sisters of dragons did the door swung open and two armed guards stood there its time traitor one of them said with an underlying note of contempt were to take you to your place of execution the hammering at the doors sounded like the end of the world deafening echoes reverberated so loudly throughout the divinity school that mallory had to yell to be heard above the din whats the point of this he shouted all were gaining is a few more minutes sooner or later theyre going to break in and this place will be a slaughter house hunter remained unaccountably calm though the others couldnt see the signs in his face lughs sacrifice had affected him deeply a higher being giving up its existence for a lesser life form it brought sharply into relief the responsibilities that he had already accepted were not giving up he said calmly the divinity school was a long hall with a flagged stone floor and rows of tall windows on opposing walls that flooded the place with sunlight during the day overhead a carved vaulted ceiling added to the atmosphere of majesty which coexisted uncomfortably with the chaotic sound of the lamentbrood attempting to smash down the doors with their weapons and fists a group of around forty people cowered in one corner of the room thackeray and harvey were doing their best to calm them and were looked upon with a touch of awe as if they were emissaries between the heroic almost godlike defenders and the ordinary people hunter observed them and felt a touch of humility at the task that had been presented to him for the first time in his life he was in a fight that felt completely just where death was not simply a matter of political expediency theres a second storey housing the library he said lets get up there and bring ceridwen as they crossed the floor thackeray grabbed caitlin youre not going out there surely he asked she nodded ive got a big responsibility invested in me thackeray i cant turn away from it a huge weight of emotion lay behind his quiet sigh i followed you from this world to tir na nog put my life on the line bloody hell put harveys life on the line which hell never let me forget youre a very special person caitlin ive never met his words faltered look im a soft old romantic and i dont want you holding that against me i just wanted to say that i love you ive never loved anybody the way i love you he let out another sigh there no going back now caitlin leaned forward and kissed him gently on the lips i know she smiled turned to leave then paused when she looked back her eyes were bright and free of the morrigans coldness i love you too thackeray and given time when my husbands death isnt so raw im sure that love would grow i know it would thats a relief he said with fauxlightness then youd better make sure we get the time together that we need his eyes never left her as she joined the others and then disappeared in search of the stairs even then he concentrated on the ghostimage she had left in his mind until harvey urged him to return to help the frightened group of survivors from the firstfloor window mallory and hunter looked out on a street where purple mist almost obscured the packed bodies of the lamentbrood pressing against the divinity school the sheer weight of their bodies would soon break down the doors further along the king of insects rose up above the seething mass whatever power lay within it disrupted mallory and hunters thoughts with mindimages of a world swarming with nothing but cockroaches were mad arent we mallory said quietly not mad hunter replied we simply dont have a choice this is what we do hunter glanced at mallory reading his secret thoughts easily shell be all right im glad youre so confident shes as tough as us and probably significantly smarter shell be hiding out somewhere mallory nodded but didnt meet hunters eye caitlin led ceridwen up to the window the goddess was broken barely able to cope with the devastation that had been inflicted on her people we need your help hunter said bluntly there arent many of your kind left out there but we need the ones that are specifically we need the wild hunt can you contact them dazed ceridwen nodded slowly hunter explained to her exactly what he required then sent her off to perform whatever ritual she needed to carry out to reach the hunt before she left she paused and turned back watch the dogs carefully she said the hunts dogs those weird red and white things mallory said your kind used to call them the hounds of annwn but they are also known as the hounds of avalon though they appear as hunting dogs to you that is not what they are like many things from the far lands your limited perception gives them a form you can understand mallory opened his mouth to ask a question about the dogs true nature but hunter interrupted him why should we watch them carefully he asked simply they know when everything is coming to an end when all of this she made a broad gesture is falling apart when the time comes they will band together and their multiplicity of howls will become one a sound of sadness that will rip into your hearts it is the cry of dying ceridwen left and the others returned to the window i dont like it that were weakened mallory said the five who fought at the fall clearly have some of the pendragon spirit left in them but its not enough we need the five who are supposed to be here standing shoulder to shoulder theres still time caitlin replied we need to be united to defeat the void and we still have no idea where it is i wonder who the fifth is mallory mused when i was on the road i met a woman who was in tune with the original fabulous beast she told me that existence or whatever you want to call it had been a bit cannier this time in bringing the latest five together how so hunter asked intrigued three of us are different this time mallory peered into the distance through the falling snow waiting for the wild hunt to appear it was an attempt to mask us from the void so that we would have a chance to get together before it wiped us out me he looked at hunter im dead died in another world then was resurrected here i cant begin to get my head around that its too big but the void still picked up on me pretty quickly then theres one called the broken woman he glanced at caitlin she nodded i went over the edge for a while she smiled tightly some might say i never came back she tapped her head different personalities in here but the void sniffed me out quickly as well the other one was described to me as the shadow mage mallory continued i dont know what that means but if he or she is still below our radar maybe that bodes well who could it be caitlin said they must have been drawn here thackeray harvey she shook her head knowing it was neither of them they had no more time to ponder the conundrum for the wild hunt suddenly burst into view tearing their way through the lamentbrood like a hurricane of knives in a matter of seconds they had cut their way past the king of insects and reached the divinity school no more talking hunter said time to do the business the chaos the wild hunt had caused in the ranks of the lamentbrood prompted the king of insects into violent activity the towering creature lurched forward surrounded by a cloud of wasps and flies that surged out in all directions hunter was the first to drop from the window into the melee followed swiftly by mallory and caitlin the instant they hit the ground they struck out for the king of insects ruthlessly chopping down any lamentbrood that fell in their way mallorys sword was a blaze of blue fire lighting the way for the others caitlin hacked savagely with her twin axes while hunter darted and thrust with power and grace in the thick of the transformed warriors the air of despair was palpable but hunter mallory and caitlin kept the sour emotions at bay by sheer force of will within minutes it became apparent that they would not succeed even with the wild hunt carving a path for them towards the king of insects the lamentbrood were so numerous that hunter realized that the three of them would not be able to get back to a position of safety even if they did kill it they would fall and die there in the middle of the walkingdead army it was not something they had time to consider their world was confined to inches around their bodies and their lives were counted in seconds as they survived one attack and prepared for the next by the time they reached the king of insects the creature was in a frenzy its massive droning arms thundered crushing the heads and spines of its own troops as it drove towards the brothers and sister of dragons caitlin was just emerging from the dismembered bodies of two of the lamentbrood when one of the kings fists smashed against the side of her head flinging her yards away in his peripheral vision hunter was convinced that she had been killed by the force of the blow but a second later she was on her feet shaking the echoes from her head as she launched herself at the king of insects in a berserker rage the morrigan had come to the fore raining axeblows hacking viciously into the king of insects form hunter lost sight of her as he fought his way around a knot of lamentbrood when he surfaced it was into the path of one of the king of insects gigantic hands it closed rapidly around his head hauling him off his feet and high into the air the memories of the torment he had suffered in scotland came flooding back dry insect bodies squirmed against his face and flies forced their way up his nostrils and into his mouth the pressure of them increasing inexorably their buzzing so loud that he thought his head would explode and just when he thought his skull would shatter he was falling he came down in front of mallory whose fiery sword had hacked through the king of insects wrist hunter choked and spat out a mouthful of dead flies thanks he croaked but mallory was already throwing himself into another furious attack the three of them fought for long minutes circling the king of insects rapidly they attacked whenever its defences dropped while at the same time fighting the lamentbrood which not even the wild hunt could keep at bay with exhaustion creeping up on him hunter knew that the end was near steeling himself for a final burst of effort he caught sight of a white flash like sheet lightning that appeared to emanate from a street away he fought on wondering if it was some optical illusion caused by the patterns left on his retina by mallorys flaming sword or a sign of even more bizarre weather on the way another flash burst brightly at the end of the street this time unmistakably lightning caitlin launched herself on to the king of insects back ignoring the stings and bites as she clung on with one hand chopping relentlessly with her remaining axe hunter saw her pause midstrike drawn by whatever was taking place further down the street another bolt of lightning seared down from the heavens mere yards away hunter was blinded by the flash for a split second and when his eyes cleared there was a heap of charred lamentbrood corpses all around it was a miracle it had missed him then events happened in rapid succession as he fought hunter became aware of lamentbrood bodies churned up into the air as if struck by a powerful machine they crashed against walls rained down into the mass all around taking more down with them something was coming tearing through the army like a whirlwind the king of insects bludgeoning attack kept hunter fully occupied swarms of insects engulfed him repeatedly before returning to the central form and those powerful fists swung down like sledgehammers but his mind raced with one question friend or foe friend or foe he was exhausted they couldnt fight on three fronts caitlins frenzied axeattacks on the king of insects started to have results in several sections though small its basic form appeared to be ruptured insects sprayed out into the freezing air like steam escaping from a pipe mallorys sword blazed as it took off part of the king of insects ribcage and in that sapphire illumination hunter saw mallorys puzzled expression as he glanced once again at what was approaching the rain of dismembered lamentbrood grew more intense and hunter had to dive out of the way of several falling bodies his final leap somehow brought him into a position that gave him a good view down the street and in that instant he froze oblivious to the peril all around him at first not quite believing what he was seeing walking slowly along the street was a single figure a woman her face as pale as the snow and terrible in the power and fury it contained her dark hair flew all around her head as if caught in a great wind but her body was untouched by the buffeting lightning crashed all around her and the hurricaneforce gales whisked up any member of the lamentbrood in the vicinity to dash them violently this way and that she was glorious and untouchable it was ruth gallagher hunter recalled the last time he had seen her in her private ice cavern in lincoln devastated frozen and wondered what had driven her to cross the barren wastes her power stunned him it was greater than anything he had ever thought could possibly exist in a human the king of insects leaned forward and blasted hunter with a stream of bees that roared from its mouth like bullets he dived out of the way but the few that hit him brought up red welts on his neck as he danced backwards and forwards looking for a way past the king of insects defences he heard his name called in an insistent frightened voice he turned to see samantha sprinting towards him from the cover of one of the buildings go back he yelled but she wasnt about to be deterred he abandoned his attack on the king of insects and ran towards her another of the lamentbrood broke past the wild hunt into samanthas path hunter reached it just in time taking off its head with one blow then hacking through its chest for good measure but as he turned back to samantha to protect her he just caught a fleeting glimpse of another of the lamentbrood coming up behind her he started to call a warning but it was too late a spearhead burst out of her chest and her face took on a startled notquitecomprehending expression fury and desperate grief fighting for control hunter charged forward and dispatched the attacker with brutal ease he hacked off the spear shaft and samantha slumped on to her back in the churnedup grey snow she coughed and a bubble of blood trickled down her chin hunters heart hammered so loudly in his chest that it drowned out all sound of the battle ignoring his own safety he cradled her head he had seen enough deaths to know that she had little time left but this was the first one that had affected him so profoundly youve got to get to hal she said her eyes were wide and staring still not understanding what had happened to her the shock had eliminated all her pain dont talk he said though he was really saying it to himself dont talk dont think dont see what youre seeing no she croaked you dont understand hals been arrested another cough another bubble of blood reids got him trying to frame him hunter theyre going to execute him when dont know probably soon is he being held under brasenose but she was already gone hunter scooped her up in his arms and ran to the edge of the street where he placed her gently in a doorway he allowed himself one last look at her but no emotion then he bounded back into the fray as if nothing had happened we have to wrap this up quickly he yelled to mallory the king of insects was sagging now mallory took out another chunk of torso releasing a further cloud of flies and wasps they buzzed briefly before dying in the cold why mallory gasped you just want to spoil the fun weve got to stop them from killing hal if they do its all over mallory eyed him curiously is he the fifth hunter said nothing but his silence was answer enough just beyond the king of insects ruth directed the lightning and wind like a goddess come down to earth her face registered no emotion but her eyes would have broken anyones heart finally the king of insects expired in a gush of flying creatures and a burst of purple mist even then caitlin didnt stop she crushed carapaces underfoot and chopped at what remained of the things form until there was nothing left but an ugly smear in the snow finally the frighteningly intense cast of her face lifted to reveal the gentle hopeful caitlin who had been waiting within there were no more standing lamentbrood in the street though others were beginning to arrive at the far end the wild hunt charged down to meet them head on while mallory gathered his strength hunter ran over to ruth the winds dropped and the lightning faded away why was all he said theres no escape from responsibility she said bitterly and this time hunter knew exactly what she meant church would have been proud of you he said if he was still alive i would have thought that worthwhile knowing there was nothing else to say hunter returned to the others not realising the desperate pain that ruth had suffered in the silence of her sanctuary after he and laura had left her alone in lincoln not comprehending her grief at the memories of the man she had loved and lost and what that man would think of her for ignoring such a call as she had left lincoln on horseback a part of her had even hoped that she would die so that she could be with her love again no one would ever understand the depth of her despair that she still lived on to suffer more icily she set off to seek out more lamentbrood she wouldnt rest until they were all driven back to the darkness or torn asunder and even then there would be no peace if only she could see church again she thought if only she could feel his strength and his wisdom and his sensitivity but wishing achieved nothing in the complex deep beneath the echoing empty corridors of brasenose and lincoln the general sat in a bleak room struggling with a halfremembered notion of a similar occasion when he had been surrounded by other hard men the memory was elusive and could well have been a dream but it only added to his sense of desperation on the table before him was an ivoryhandled pistol that had once belonged to his father the knowledge that he had been called on in britains darkest hour and found lacking was almost impossible to bear hed wrestled with his terrible failure for too long the honourable thing would be to pay the ultimate price for losing the country to the invading force yet hed even failed there he wished he was in his comfortable office in magdalen with its atmosphere of tradition and history the wall of war art that spoke of his responsibilities it would have been easier to make the decision there he thought of his family and wondered where they were still alive hed failed them too in so many ways all he wanted to do was to make amends but the only option left to him would change nothing no one would even know he had pulled the trigger absently he flicked through the very latest intelligence report that reids department had prepared for him it was about the gang of thugs who wore black tshirts marked with a red v theyd terrorised the country for months growing in number with each passing week all of them had now gathered in hampstead to carry out some kind of crazed ritual in the belief that they could bring ryan veitch back from the dead the population was dying in their millions and a bunch of nutters had decided to turn some rotting brother of dragons into a messiah the whole world had gone insane the general thought what was the point in any of them carrying on reid breezed in he glanced at the gun and then at the general but if he had any understanding of the situation he didnt show it he probably didnt care the general reflected the men need a pep talk reid said whats the point its not over yet the general fixed a cold gaze on the spy have you got something planned come on reid marched out ignoring the question the general sat for a second in thought then pocketed his pistol and followed there would be time for honour later in the divinity school the survivors chatted with incipient hope that victory had been achieved thackeray who knew the worst was yet to come did nothing to dash their optimism after all they had been through these people deserved at least that instead he quietly found caitlin who was squatting in one corner catching her breath when she saw him coming she stood up and they hugged each other and then they kissed passionately which was a shock to both of them theyre already talking about you in the same breath as the five who fought at the fall theyre going to put your name up in lights thackeray said only if we win you will i have every faith in you his words filled her with a powerful sense of the responsibility that had been bestowed on her they were interrupted by hunter who urged her to come with him and mallory to the highsecurity wing under brasenose laura approached her hand now fully healed im coming too she said hunter bluntly refused you have to find sophie we need her tell her she has to come to brasenose immediately she cant waste a second all five of us have got to get together to prepare for the void he turned to go then added and when youve done that go and help ruth she needs you laura nodded once in agreement and departed without another word when are you going to fill us in on who the fifth brother or sister is caitlin asked as she ran alongside hunter and mallory through the frozen night when im sure that information isnt going to prejudice our survival hunter replied on the journey through the cold night from corpus christi sophie had never let her attention waver from manning sophie didnt trust her at all despite what shavi had said about them having no other choice the womans contemptuous nature made sophies hackles rise but there was some other troubling quality about manning that sophie couldnt quite define the corridors they were now walking along were dark and quiet sophie didnt know oxford well enough to be able to work out where they were and manning had refused to offer any guidance shavi wasnt any help either since they had left corpus christi he had been slipping in and out of a trance state as if the ritual he had conducted earlier refused to let him go manning suddenly stopped short as though sensing something beyond sophies range of perception therell be things coming down here soon she hissed she chose a door at random then ushered sophie and shavi in shavi slumped into a corner barely conscious sophie turned on manning her patience gone you said you were taking us to the void i lied the baldness of mannings response brought sophie up sharp but within a second she was preparing to summon up the power that the craft put at her disposal dont try any of your witchy stuff on me really it wont do any good manning cautioned let me rephrase i lied about taking you to the void but that wouldnt help you anyway youd be destroyed in a second but i have brought you here for a reason youd better explain yourself quickly im not going to be pushed around any more all right nows as good a time as any you need to be here why because here is where everythings going to end and if youre not here it would ruin my plans a trap then sophies eyes narrowed she steeled herself ready to attack really theres no hope of winning this battle manning said but just to show you what a good sport i am let me tell you how it all is going to end ill tell you the truth about everything im sorry to say youre not going to like it even worse youre not going to be able to tell a soul the guards led hal through the maze of corridors then up a flight of stairs and out into a small courtyard that smelled of rotting refuse walls rose up on either side making it oppressively dark kneel one guard barked he motioned with a handgun to the centre of the courtyard the realisation that this was the place where he was going to die hit hal hard a shudder ran through him closely followed by the absurd acknowledgement that the location was so mundane hed end his life unmourned and forgotten in a place where rubbish was disposed of as he knelt in the thick snow the blood thundering in his head every sensation was heightened the stink of old cabbages the bitter cold making his skin ache the distant undefined noises of the city snow crystals glimmering like jewels in the thin light that filtered into the courtyard the bitter taste of bile in his mouth the hard muzzle of a gun pressed against the back of his head for a second hal thought he was going to be sick and in that instant remembrance surged through him like a shock of electricity his hand shot into his pocket and his fingers closed around the bloodeye for the final time words sprang to his lips unbidden far and away and here just a rustle in the stillness of the courtyard but they were heard a universe away a shadow like a giant spider fell across the snow one of the guards choked on an exclamation of horror in his throat the gun fell into the snow and hot sticky liquid splattered over the back of hals head the other guard was shouting into his radio the prisoner is escaping repeat the prisoner is there was a tearing sound a gurgling and then silence still shaking hal raised his head to see the bodies of the guards lying nearby broken and bloody come brother of dragons the voice sounded like fingernails on glass hal looked around to see shadow john from the hunters moon lurking in the twilight area between the shadows and the snow his sevenfoottall painfully thin figure given extra height by his stovepipe hat yet there was something different about him in the pub he had appeared jovial and elegant but in the cold hard night of the real world there was a menacing air about him he was hunched slightly one gimlet eye darting hungrily back and forth those stretchedtoffee fingers now sharp as razors and stained with blood hal stood up fighting to steady himself i dont know what to do he ventured do you must run brother of dragons run shadow john waved a skeletal arm wildly and hide your enemies here will kill you if they find you run and we shall protect you there was a frightening insistence in shadow johns voice verging on madness hal didnt wait a second longer he turned and bolted back the way he had been brought in the first corridor he came across mother mary the cackling old crone who had seemed almost senile the last time hed seen her she sat crosslegged in a pool of gore white cap stained scarlet while her black cat played with the remains of a guard as hal ran past her she eyed him coldly like a lion ready to pounce hal didnt look back two minutes later he came across another familiar figure the attractive but unbalanced woman with the long blonde hair that moved like snakes had another guard pinned against a wall it was impossible to tell if she was attacking him or seducing him his trousers were open his erect penis gripped tightly in her hand but his eyes had rolled upwards to show the whites and a string of drool was falling from one corner of his mouth she looked at hal seductively run brother of dragons she whispered sibilantly hal ran scared now that what he had unleashed might prove worse than the threat he had sought to eliminate the man who resembled a devil with horns and cloven hooves stalked past completely oblivious to hal there was murder in his eyes and a smell of brimstone about him further on bearskin hunched over a bundle of bloody rags feeding finally hal came to a dark deserted room and flung himself inside he slammed the door shut and slipped down to the floor listening to the constant padding of feet without and the sounds of rending and the running and the screams until he covered his ears and bowed his head and wished he was a boy again chapter nineteen the cold at the end of the world those who cannot perform great things themselves may yet have a satisfaction in doing justice to those who can horace walpole oxford felt like christmas eve as hunter mallory and caitlin ran through the deserted streets preternaturally quiet with the snow lying heavy on the rooftops and roads there was something uncannily magical about the city occasionally they glimpsed shimmering buildings ghostly in blue hovering just behind the familiar ancient landmarks just a trick of the light they told themselves somewhere ruth gallagher was harrying the remnants of the lamentbrood to destruction it was in all their minds once she had been like them someone struggling to do the right thing against impossible odds and now she had risen to the status of legend a human become god and so it was for all the five who had fought at the fall gods and demigods angels and even in veitch a devil to haunt the nightmares of the people great greater greatest yet this time it was down to the three of them and sophie wherever she was and the mysterious fifth to defeat something of such magnitude that it was defined as the opposite of life it didnt seem right it certainly wasnt fair only hunter had reached any kind of accommodation with the dilemma for him it was simply a matter of acceptance samanthas death had removed any link he had with the rest of the world he had no need of softness or any care for his own survival now it was simply death or glory and so they arrived at brasenose at first glance it appeared deserted though lights glared from the windows no sounds of life greeted them as they ventured into the echoing corridors maybe they all evacuated when the lamentbrood came mallory hissed hunter shook his head when the government first moved here they restructured this place for high security it wouldnt make sense for them to leave theyd be safer here than anywhere else caitlin stopped moving and sniffed the air there are people here down below you can smell them mallory said incredulously you know what sometimes you are an extremely creepy woman her smile was a challenge you dont know the half of it then we should proceed with extreme caution hunter said either theyre gathered for the execution or theyre barricaded in waiting to blow the heads off anyone who turns up he crept stealthily to the end of the corridor and sneaked a glimpse around the corner youve done this kind of thing before havent you mallory said wearily once or twice luckily for you me id just charge in with sword swinging like i said luckily for you one of us knows what theyre doing hunter led the way down a short flight of stairs to the lower level at the bottom step caitlin caught his arm someones nearby she mouthed she paused raised her head slightly its over here sophie beckoned them urgently at the end of the corridor she was staggering under shavis weight who was pale and a little delirious the others ran up to relieve her mallory grabbed her by the shoulders unable to restrain his joy are you all right fine she forced a smile but mallory could see that she was lying whats wrong nothing you dont fool me spit it out she pulled him towards her and kissed him with a surprising passion that spoke of desperation and loss when she broke off she said quietly dont ask me any more i cant tell you not now later she nodded but there was a deep sadness shadowing her smile that mallory didnt notice he was distracted by hunter gently slapping shavis cheeks to bring him round hes been in a trance sophie said there were some things he needed to find out but then he started raving as if as if what he saw was too terrible to believe and then he ended up like this have you found anyone down here hunter asked her as he continued to try to bring shavi back to consciousness there was a lot of commotion along that way she motioned in the direction of the highsecurity wing we found some guards dead butchered thats when we decided to come back to look for you if theres anyone left alive they must have locked themselves in somewhere secure caitlin nodded thats what we thought too then maybe they havent had time to carry out the execution hunter said with some relief hunters insistent efforts finally brought shavi round his eyes gradually focusing he tried to support his own weight staggered then succeeded in propping himself against the wall the things i saw he said shuddering at the memory the horror in his voice chilled them all whats up shavi mallory clapped the arm of the man he had come to consider a good friend shavi managed a wan smile i saw the cailleach bheur filling the universe with ice and snow the white walker has failed the fimbulwinter he gasped took a deep breath the prophecy of the fimbulwinter at the end of the world the coming of the void both are linked the endwinter comes because the final days are near and the final days are near because the void has come but the void needs the extreme cold to exist it cant abide heat it comes from beyond the edge of the universe where there is no light or warmth it has been here gestating in the cold waiting until the moment is right here hunter grabbed shavis arm where shavi shook his head i saw so many things i saw the followers of veitch prepare a ritual of such magnitude that it sent ripples through the world black tshirts red v faces like rainy city nights his eyes were glazing over again as the images paraded across his mind they were drawing on the dark energy the void brought in its wake trying to bring him back calling to his wandering spirit corrupting it with the blackness sucking all hope and chance of redemption from it veitch is coming back mallory asked are you saying hes becoming part of the void i dont know i dont know shavi was slipping away again hunter shook him roughly come on focus we need to know whats going on and i saw i saw shavi looked at sophie and fell silent at the expression in her eyes there is no more i can tell you the void is here it is ready to do what its nature has prepared it to do the rest is not important hunter turned to the others his face grim we need to find the fifth quickly then get out of here and locate the void before it gets us first bloody hell cant you say the name yet mallory said no sophie gripped his wrist so tightly that her nails raised blood it was clear to mallory that she knew more than she was saying he accepted her plea with a silent nod leave me here shavi insisted this is no longer my business it is the time of the new five now only you can save everything in case you havent noticed mallory said unable to hide the bitterness in his voice theres only four of us shavi slumped into a crosslegged position his back against the wall and lapsed into unconsciousness once more that was the way they left him a faint transcendental smile on his face like a saint about to be led to his death the four of them made their way towards the highsecurity wing all the cells were silent their oncenoisy occupants either dead or stilled in the gloom they came across the corpses of many guards in various states of butchery but whatever had slaughtered them appeared long gone is it me or is it colder in here mallory said caitlin exhaled heavily a white cloud bloomed from her lips its colder she said hunter drew his sword mallory followed suit the flames of llyrwyn painting the walls and ceiling a brilliant blue caitlin balanced an axe carefully in each hand the light of the morrigan began to come on in her eyes sophie followed behind head slightly bowed her hands at her sides they turned into another corridor and were shocked to see the walls glistening with a rime of frost it was as if theyd stepped into a butchers meat locker the lights here were eerily dimmer and further on the corridor progressed into darkness looks like this is it hunter said redundantly the words had barely left his lips when a security door crashed shut behind them they started in shock but it was too late their exit had been cut off as they turned back another security door this time barred like a jail cell slid into place ahead of them hunter took point as doors further along the corridor opened slowly reid was one of the first to emerge but behind him hunter could just make out the shadowy figures of government officials the cabinet senior advisors who had once been the captains of industry the aristocrats the financial sectors biggest players open the doors hunter said were here to protect you reid stood before them carefully surveying mallory caitlin and sophie before moving his attention to hunter still only four of you reid time is running out hunter attempted to moderate his voice against the urgency that was straining every fibre of his being the thing thats behind the invasion is already here we need to find it destroy it before it wipes everything out i know exactly where it is hunter was struck dumb by the quiet confidence in reids voice reid motioned further down the corridor on the edge of the crepuscular zone hunter saw the frozen door that he had noticed when freeing mallory its been here for a long time mister hunter realisation crept up on hunter but not comprehension or acceptance mallory a man who mistrusted all authority grasped the situation instantly youre working for it his eyes blazed as brightly as his sword in a way its controlling you caitlin ventured its a very seductive power reid silenced her with a simple shake of his head people who deal with power on a daily basis are pragmatic that is the most vital quality for any political leader what about honour mallory interrupted his voice cold and hard integrity ethics unnecessary reid replied oh lovely lovely qualities of course no one would disagree with that but completely useless for the job of leadership the traits you mentioned are useful for winning one great battle but then you have to retire politics is about winning battles every day little ones mundane ones you need to be pragmatic to retain power so that you can continue to do that politics mallory sneered behind him caitlin was checking the security door for a way out oh politics is the most important thing of all because its about the way we live our lives every decision is a political decision most of us who work to keep things running cant afford the luxury of fighting for a cause like you however worthy that cause might be we need to make sure that we stay in power so that we continue to live our lives the right way which implies that your way is the right way hunter was trying to buy the others time to find a way to break free it was a clumsy attempt but reid didnt appear to mind it is the right way its been proven by time its been accepted by the majority of the people and consequently it is by definition normal any opposing view is therefore aberrant and something to be resisted the most chilling aspect about reid was his calm expression of his views there was no hatred there no contempt or anger not even any superiority he was like someone patiently explaining a scientific fact to the uneducated in a display of impotent anger mallory crashed his sword against the bars the flames surged at the impact but the blade left no mark youre thinking you can use the void to maintain power he raged youre insane its antilife you cant control it it wants to wipe out us the world the universe not in the way you suggest reid summoned two guards and motioned for them to train their guns on caitlin who was clearly considering throwing one of her axes through the bars she reluctantly lowered her weapon the antilife it represents is not an absence of life its more abstract than that i suppose i could wallow in the depths of philosophy but to put it simply you have to consider what life actually means as a concept this is all profoundly pretentious is it not he gave a small laugh youve communicated with it hunter said incredulously i wouldnt say we exactly sat down over beer and sandwiches but yes after it sent its advance guard to prepare the way we found it a place to wait and then we entered into negotiations he shook his head if you knew what we went through you would find that almost laughable negotiations the void as you call it is not a thing its not a life form it doesnt exist in any physical way you or i could comprehend but even so it connected with us and we with it and he held out his hands and gave a small shrug that made mallory even angrier so you gave in to it caitlin said you have to understand we couldnt win that was never on the agenda its too powerful its like trying he searched for the words to describe the magnitude of what he was attempting to say like trying to punch the universe no point even beginning to fight so pragmatism you see we found out that what it wanted wasnt actually very far from what we wanted certainly it was something we could live with and thats when we decided on the most beneficial course of action if you cant win everything you should at least try to win something hunter looked past reid to the shadowy figures hovering in the background you betrayed the whole of humanity just to save yourselves youre missing the point reid said our aims are the aims of society whats best for us is best for you its the same we did the right thing hunter could see that reid completely believed what he was saying and that all those waiting behind him believed it too flickers of dread rose in his heart theyd lost the fight the minute they started the seeds of that defeat were buried in the heart of what they were fighting to save the enemy the true enemy was all around them but they didnt look like the enemy and didnt believe they were the enemy how could anyone fight that we went to the pm with our plan reid continued but he refused to reach an accommodation he had to be removed he saw the looks on hunter and mallorys faces and added with annoyance if hed been allowed to do what he wanted the human race would have been extinct how could that be right he loosened his tie took a deep breath you were the only real threat to everything you brothers and sisters of dragons theres no logic in what youre saying hunter stated if we defeat the void you wont have to reach any accommodation we weighed up that option and for a while it was certainly a possibility but in the end we decided that the risks were too great the chances of outright victory seemed extremely thin and anything less would likely result in complete eradication so so you decided to get us out of the way hunter tried to ignore mallory who was pacing the confines of their prison like a tiger occasionally rattling the bars or attempting to prise open the security gates with his sword there was no attempt at violence reid looked horrified at hunters implication completely ignoring the irony that he was complicit in the assassination of the countrys leader your young friend mister campbell hal wasnt that his first name i feel quite sorry for the way we had to use him hes a rather naive chap not cut out for any of this business hunters temper flared what have you done with him reid chewed his lip for a second and it appeared that he wasnt going to answer then he changed his mind once we realised you were a brother of dragons our route to controlling you was easy your long friendship with young hal was obvious we were able to use him to direct you to where we needed you to be here hunter said so you could trap us exactly we framed him for the assassination in a very clumsy way knowing that he would realise i had organised the plot when we allowed him to escape from custody we knew hed go directly to your hiding place and that once he met up with you he would identify me or someone in the government as the chief suspect then when we let his young female friend accidentally discover information about his impending execution we knew youd realise that i would do anything to hide my complicity kill him even sooner to silence him and so you would rush here to save him even though all sense would tell you to stay away from my base of power and concentrate on the more pressing task of locating the void youre very easy to manipulate mister hunter not as easy as you think hunter was relieved to discover that reid still hadnt found out that hal was the fifth the real reason all of them had rushed to brasenose is hal dead the execution was set to take place half an hour ago have you seen the body two men with guns one young frightened bookish man do i really need to hunter turned to the others and said quietly theres still hope dont give up reid must have guessed what hunter was saying for he added im sorry but you really mustnt think you stand a chance i dont know what it is about the pendragon spirit that makes you a threat to such a vast unknowable force as the void but here you are close enough for it to work its ways on you yet unfortunately for you not close enough to harm it that was always the plan hunter noted that was always the plan reid confirmed kirkham emerged from the grey background with a cough to gain reids attention the chief scientist said its time reid nodded to him pulling a torch from his pocket and shining it ahead of him kirkham proceeded towards the growing gloom emanating from the door behind which the void existed as he drew closer he began to shake from the extreme cold frost began to form down his front what are you expecting to get out of this mallory shouted what do you think the voids going to give you a new world reid said the voids world a world ruled by the opposite of life mallory was incredulous how could anyone exist in that you think this one is any better reid said the countrys falling apart people still have their lives their freedom mallory replied urging reid to change his mind theres magic everywhere caitlin continued wonder endless possibilities all the things people hoped for before the fall reid cut her dead with a cold stare its unpredictable uncontrollable we cant govern none of the things we had before the fall can thrive here you cant work hard to better yourself you cant have rules and regulations you cant have a strong society producing for the common good no ones going to get rich here or fat or live out their lives in luxury this isnt the world we spent thousands of years of human civilisation trying to form whats the voids world going to be like mallory shouted constant night blood war death hopelessness reid merely gave a faint smile then a shrug do it he said to kirkham theres still hope hunter said to the others from the back of the faceless crowd of politicians and civil servants the general made his way forward he had a gun time to stop this he said reid turned just as the general raised the pistol and fired the bullet hit reid directly between the eyes his body slammed against the bars and then slumped down in an awkward jumble of limbs come on hunter said under his breath im in charge now the general said to the others stop this nonsense immediately free these people hunter caitlin and mallory watched silently urging the crowd to obey the general no one moved the general brandished his gun at the crowd i said kill him the voice may have come from the deputy prime minister or one of the cabinet members but it didnt really matter which the guards responded instantly turning their weapons on the general and cutting him down look at them mallory said sickened like animals fighting amongst themselves the generals blood flowed into reids mingled with it formed an ocean that separated the brothers and sisters of dragons from the small crowd huddled together against the gloom mallory glanced at hunter thats it isnt it all over shaking violently kirkham continued towards the frozen door that was now leaking darkness rapidly hunter repeated his mantra now a wish a prayer theres still hope kirkhams palsied hand grasped the handle hunter guessed that the ice must be burning his flesh but the scientist didnt flinch he almost appeared to be in a trance from somewhere that could have been far far away or in the next corridor an awful sound rose up that made all of them feel sick to their stomachs it resonated deep into their bones stabbing into their brains they wanted to scratch at their ears make themselves deaf the howls of dogs joining together to form one note one ringing chime of despair the blood drained from caitlins face the hounds of avalon she whispered for all the time they had been imprisoned sophie had stood silently observing mallory stepped back to take her in his arms and when he saw her face he realised the truth you knew why didnt you say something i couldnt take the risk that the void might discover the fifth there were tears in her eyes but no despair she smiled mallory pulled her to him and they held each other tightly caitlin closed her eyes and bowed her head resting it gently against the bars hunter couldnt believe it hed put his trust in existence and hed been wrong theyd failed in the worst way possible there was no hope kirkham opened the door the obscene howling grew deafening subsuming every other sound between one tick of a clock and the next the moment appeared to drag on for ever as all eyes focused on the gaping door kirkham stared into its depths frozen and then darkness began to seep out slowly at first then faster rapidly becoming a torrent everything it touched became fluid began to alter twist out of shape the very molecules of the fabric becoming something else with it came an awful wave of despair a million times more potent than anything sent out by the lamentbrood and everyone it touched fell to their knees devastated at what was to come hunter gripped the bars tears burning the corners of his eyes still unable to accept that humanity had betrayed itself that the basest elements had won out over all that was noble in mankind reality began to warp and as it rushed towards him he had a glimmer of what it was becoming it looked very much like the worst of all possible worlds it looked very much like hell jagged static jumped across sophie tallents mind it startled her so badly that she almost knocked her polystyrene cup of coffee across the keyboard she guessed she had been daydreaming it must have been a particularly deep one for it took her a moment to orient herself and though she couldnt recall the details it must have been satisfying for she felt a great wistfulness at having left it behind she was sitting at her desk at steelguard securities the screen in front of her flickering with the constant updating of currency information from all over the world beyond her was the window offering views from high over canary wharf across londons financial district sitting smug and bloated beneath the thick blanket of pollution from car exhausts and the jets flying into heathrow or london city airport every few seconds something hit her across the back of the head and this time she did spill her coffee it was kane his chubby face looking like a side of ham above his salmon pinstriped shirt and he was clutching the file with which he had clipped her youre useless tallent how do you expect to get any bonuses watch the screen he tapped it with a fat forefinger never take your eyes off it if anything interesting happens get on the phone he snorted with disgust youre a waste of space you know they only keep you on here because youre decorative mister rowe likes to look at your tits in that nice white blouse so if you want to hang on to your job take your jacket off he stalked off to abuse some other unfortunate labouring for ten to twelve hours a day in front of one of the rows and rows of screens on the steelguard floor in the corner the tv came alive as someone turned up the sound for the morning news more deaths after the rebels shelled a market in najaf in iraq a western businessman had been taken hostage somewhere else in the middle east his captors had released a video of him staring beaten and humiliated at the camera a knife at his throat the prime minister and the president of the united states shook hands another successful summit another announcement of millions poured into a new joint weapons project inflation holding steady a cheer ran around the room the poverty gap had widened again another cheer sophies attention was caught by a cleaner making his way slowly across the floor unnoticed by anyone else he had a handsome face though he occasionally let his long hair fall across it as if embarrassed he looked beaten and dejected like a badly fitting shoe mallory briefly met sophies gaze somewhere in the dark recesses of his subconscious something stirred a hint of recognition so vague that it was almost a shiver across his synapses there then gone crazy he thought no details surfaced because there werent any his kind and hers would never meet it just wasnt done better keep his mind on the work if he wanted to hold on to his job there were the toilets on this floor to clean then the two floors above then back to this floor an endless cycle never to be broken the dying part of mallory knew that he would see sophie every day as he crossed that room their eyes would meet in vague uncomfortable recognition but it would never be reconciled they would never meet they would never speak five burgers sizzled in pools of grease laura dusantiago watched them oddly captivated by something she didnt quite comprehend how many had she cooked that day in the fastfood joint stinking of stale fat down a dingy side street not far from northamptons main drag how many tomorrow and the endless days after why was she so unaccountably queasy it was a job she should be thankful on the other side of the counter a queue of deadeyed people shuffled and waited most of them overweight heading for a heart attack sooner rather than later clad in ugly cheap leisurewear and knockoff trainers from the market laura flipped the burgers five she thought why was she so ill at ease get a grip this is it this is your life caitlin sat in a traffic jam listening to a radio i dj trying to get listeners excited about some kind of event that weekend the cars snaked on for eight miles ahead of her and another four behind they hadnt moved for the last five minutes she knew because shed watched the clock tick around on the dashboard she should have been at the beauticians in gateshead fifteen minutes ago in the boot the boxes of samples sat pretty pinks and russets hair products that had been scientifically tested that could make you into someone else really truly and of course if she was late for the gateshead appointment how was she supposed to get down to middlesbrough on time she thought about this for a second then shrugged who cared who cared about anything really the thought made a lot of sense to her but she still couldnt explain the grating feeling of unease in the pit of her stomach she turned up the radio so that she didnt have to think shavi sat at his desk in the accountancy office of gibson and layton and wondered why hed absently doodled the number five on his pad he didnt have time to spend daydreaming mr gibson had just brought in the file for some property developer a personal friend and shavi had a few hours to locate every possible loophole and find every creative way to lie cheat and deceive so that the incometax liability was as close to zero as possible as shavi opened the box file he wondered why he felt such an abiding sense of despair ruth gallagher broke off from her shift in the old peoples home to sneak outside for a little cry the owners salted away most of the vast amounts of cash paid by the loving relatives and left the poor occupants to survive or not on a subsistence diet drugged up with valium staring vacantly at daytime tv another one had died that morning and it had been ruths job to clean the bedroom she was always cleaning bedrooms they came and went with remarkable regularity a production line shipping them to the afterlife no point getting to know them they were too drugged for any conversation the relatives didnt really care it made the visits so much easier ruth dried her eyes no point being miserable it was a life wasnt it and hunter sat in the briefing overcome with a strange feeling of deja vu the map on the wall showed the former yugoslavia little flags signifying the rebel forces threatening to break the fragile peace ok he said wearily who do you want me to kill this time while entertaining an odd thought of a world where he was a force for life not death in a quiet dusty room in brasenose hal huddled against a door wondering why he was such a failure he grew tense as footsteps echoed in the corridor outside then rigid when they stopped at the door open up a familiar womans voice hal flinched he could pretend that the room was empty but what good would it do shed come in anyway hed been caught might as well own up after all there was nowhere left to run when he opened the door catherine manning stood there swathed in her expensive furs ms manning hal stuttered were you looking for me he caught himself when he saw mannings glassy eyes and the disturbing waxy sheen across her face she looked oddly like a marionette her mouth opened and closed opened and closed and when a sound finally did come out it was no longer her voice the strain has been too much for this form it cannot hold hal took a step backwards at the eeriness of a mans voice emanating from mannings full feminine lips suddenly manning collapsed and as she fell to the floor she wasnt like a flesh and blood woman at all her body appeared to be made of paper or perhaps just skin folding up on itself what was left of her lay on the floor flat and wrinkled and twisted like a discarded set of clothes and where she had been someone else now stood at first the face appeared to swim before hals eyes and he had fleeting images of people he thought he knew and probably disliked before the visage settled down to that of a sternfaced man dressed in flowing scarlet robes who are you hal gasped in the time of the tribes i was known as dian cecht of the court of the final word wise man healer now the last of the tuatha de danann the bitterness in his voice made hal wince ms manning she thought she could use me for her ends i was using her for mine i rode her body and her mind through these fixed lands avoiding the notice of the devourer of all things preparing for this moment i dont understand hal knew that he sounded like an idiot but he didnt know what else to say your kind have long been an interest of mine dian cecht said in a manner that on the surface appeared quite unassuming but hal found distinctly menacing i know how you work inside and out down to the smallest particle though many of my kind had a strange affection for fragile creatures i was not one of them i saw in you something else a chance for the golden ones to survive in a place that had grown tired of them i dont understand what youre saying hal said weakly in you lies the last hope of my people and the last hope of your own are you ready for the task that lies before you hal stared blankly at dian cecht for a moment then nodded then come dian cecht led hal out into the corridor you are a strange people dian cecht continued i told a sister of dragons what was planned i needed her to be there at the end so that the devourer of all things would not suspect and she kept the secret well even though it meant her suffering dian cecht clearly could not understand sophies sacrifice several feet away a shimmering wall of blue ran from wall to wall whats that hal asked though it took all my abilities i have closed this small space off from existence it lies beyond the world on the other side of the wall yet is still a part of it but only for a short while and here the devourer of all things has no power to see dian cecht strode ahead so that hal had to skip to keep up the god led hal to the research rooms where kirkham had carried out most of his experiments into finding a way to cross over to tir na nog they came to the plexiglas window that looked on to the lab where glenning had turned to a pile of dust after returning from his trip to the other side and hal was surprised to see it awash with a brilliant blue light the stately bluestone that had been brutally ripped from stonehenge was glowing with the sapphire radiance it never stopped working hal said in amazement after glennings death no one had felt the need to return to the labs down here it was considered a failed experiment and everyone had more important things on their minds the sheer power coming off the megalith gave hal pause thats why he said to himself then to dian cecht oxford was flitting in and out of the otherworld because of this stone the power must have been infusing the whole city the door opened of its own accord and dian cecht stepped into the blue world hal followed he is here dian cecht said he is in your hands now standing nearby was the giant who had appeared to hal in the grove behind magdalen what seemed like so long ago the caretaker held the wayfinder lantern aloft and when he smiled warmly hal felt all the tension leave his muscles i knew you would be here now brother of dragons the caretaker said warmly this lantern will light your way as it has done for many of your kind before you as hals eyes adjusted to the megaliths flooding light he realised that there was something else in the room coiled around the walls was an enormous fabulous beast that appeared to be made of the blue energy yet which had solidity and weight its sapphire eyes were fixed firmly on him and to hal they appeared not like those of a beast at all but wise and calm and wonderful hal had no idea how it could have entered that enclosed space and standing in the sinuous loops of its tail was a woman her own eyes as blue as the fabulous beasts skin pale hair black this is your time brother of dragons it was the woman who had spoken but the voice was deep male and slightly sibilant all eyes were on him hal looked from one to the other and realised that he was being asked something of great importance do you understand your responsibilities brother of dragons the caretaker asked yes i havent lived up to them hal admitted im sorry he caught himself and then added honestly i think im too much of a coward for this job everyone has a different strength the woman said you have used yours effectively energy arced across the room the power emanating from the bluestone was growing more intense hal stood entranced by the light show for a moment before adding youre talking about the code in the painting he sighed i know who the king is now but its too late it is never too late the caretaker said firmly the signs were left for you and you alone to prepare you for this moment me hal said puzzled you have a choice the woman added you may turn away now and give all of existence up to the devourer of all things or you must find the king and bring him back here but the sacrifice you make will be great indeed youre saying i have to die hal said not far from the megalith the blue fire had begun to take on some kind of shape the caretaker stepped forward and for a second hal felt as if he was in the presence of his father nothing dies nothing new is created nothing is destroyed it is simply transformed and hes not dead the king the caretaker smiled once more reassuringly nothing dies he is lost the woman said as if she could read hals mind in distant times in a faraway place his memory fading he will not find his way home without your guidance how can i do that the blue fire had now formed itself into a rectangle like a burning doorway in the air the caretaker stood next to it holding the wayfinder as if to light the way through the lanterns flame surged and flickered and tugged towards the door you must give up your mortal form the woman answered become one with the pendragon spirit in that way the caretaker continued you may pass through this door to the source of all things you will become a part of existence you will reach through all time all space and for the briefest of moments you will have subtle influence a mere tug but it may be enough to direct the king towards this place youre saying its like becoming part of god hals mind spun everything rests with you brother of dragons dian cecht was grimfaced only the king can defeat the devourer of all things only he can save my people and guide your own race back to the upward path and only you can call him in a moment of utter clarity hal understood exactly what his sacrifice would mean he would be converted into energy a wavelength a thought a message to the past and the future and then he would be gone absorbed into the background energy of the universe it was the ultimate sacrifice yet for the briefest time he would be a conscious part of the underlying intelligence of existence and he would be able to search the twists and turns of reality for the man who would be the ultimate representation of the pendragon spirit the champion of life the only one who could defeat the embodiment of antilife and hal would be a part of that champion and a part of all the brothers and sisters of dragons who had ever existed across the millennia after all his failures and his weaknesses here was his chance to redeem himself the onceinalifetime opportunity to find the true strength inside him briefly he had a vision of himself flashing back across time appearing to poussin to plant the message that he would eventually find in his real life manifesting to the dilettante society and all the others he would guide so that at this point in time he would have already assimilated the information he needed to make his choice in truth he had made the decision long ago the doorway was crystal clear now manifested and held in place by the combined power of the caretaker and the fabulous beast will you accept this quest brother of dragons the caretaker asked hal smiled and stepped towards the light we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly martin luther king jr
