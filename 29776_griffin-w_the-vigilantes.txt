w e b griffin the vigilantes will curtis a frail fiftyfouryearold was sitting slumped against the drivers door of his rusty chevrolet malibu when the thoughts suddenly hit again causing him to wince and grunt he quickly pulled his right hand from the gap glock model semiautomatic pistol beside him on the seat stabbed at the dash to turn off the radio then smacked at the brim of his greasesmeared redandblue fedex cap knocking it from his head with the fingers of both hands he began rubbing his sweaty temples goddamn these flashbacks he thought the fingertips pressed harder and deeper in a futile attempt to make the mental images vanish damn them all to hell only six months earlier curtis had been what hed thought of as bulky standing at fiveeleven and weighing twoten but now he had withered to a sickly onesixty his jeans tshirt and denim jacket were illfitting hanging on him so loosely they looked as if they belonged to someone far bigger his closecropped silver hair was damn near disappearing and his formerly warm gray eyes were becoming more and more hollowed and distant in his slight if somewhat hard face curtis felt he was fast becoming a miserable shell of the man hed been he had gone from fearing nothing and no one to being scared shitless to now just not giving a good goddamn anymore he wasnt sure what was most responsible for thatthe constant stress from the mental anguish that caused the flashbacks or the aftereffects of the intense chemotherapy treatments to slow the aggressive cancer theyd first found in his prostate probably both easily one or the otherespecially that fucking chemo that makes me shit my shorts like some sorry bedridden invalidbut probably both the flashback scenes torturing will curtis were of the brutal sexual assault of his only child wendy after leaving a pub late on the night of saint patricks day almost eighteen months ago his beautiful bubbly twentyfouryearold daughter had been attacked in her apartment she was just two years out of college just beginning to enjoy a full life triggered by the slightest of thingsfor example hearing a song she liked which had just happened as he sat listening to the radio in the malibu or driving past genos and smelling her favorite cheesesteaksthe flashbacks would suddenly hammer him they were grotesquely lit and viciously vivid showing the attack in her bedroom again and again from damn near every possible angle and they haunted him all the more because he hadnt actually witnessed the attackrather his imagination ran with possibilities of what had happened to her and what had happened to her was what the legal system termed involuntary deviant sexual intercourse involuntary he thought putting his hand back on the pistol fuckinga it was involuntary which of course meant rape thered been absolutely no question of that the exam given by the doctors at hahnemann university hospitalnot a dozen blocks from where he now sat parked waitinghad determined unequivocally that that had happened and not only vaginally which was without doubt bad enough to have happened to his baby girl but also what was termed in the legalese as sexual intercourse per os and per anus the pervert drugged her so she passed out then abused her bodyeven gave her the goddamned clap the revelation of all that had driven the normally levelheaded curtis to a point of desperation hed never believed possible andboomhis mind hammered with the garish image of the bastard on top of wendy in her bed dammit will curtis said as he sat up in the dark and slammed the pistol against the dashboard his left hand rubbed his temples more vigorously he shook his head what kind of miserable fucking animal does that who takes advantage of an innocent girl like that he glanced out the window and looked across callowhill street at the office with the frosted plateglass window more or less centered on the windowwhich had a crack that ran jagged across its upperright cornerwere faded black vinyl peelandstick letters that spelled out law office of daniel o gartner esq and ill never understand why that bastard defends perverts just for a lousy dollar but that assistant district attorney had said only a matter of time before gartner gets busted himself and goes down just like one of his clients so yeah some kind of payout or payoff thats for sure because theres no shortage of scumbag lawyers like him he squeezed the glocks grip that da was close to right gartner may never have got busted but he is about to go down before their world went to hell will curtis and his wife linda were more or less comfortably middle class will had driven packagedelivery trucks all his career first for the us postal service the last eleven years for fedex and linda was a teller at first national bank their idea of an exciting weekend night usually meant taking a byob of cheap california red wine to the allyoucaneat pasta and salad at luigis little italy around the corner from their row house of twenty years on mount pleasant avenue in phillys west mount airy section they had known little about what went on in the nightclubs of philadelphia and damn sure absolutely nothing about any illegal activities that was until the toxicology tests taken on wendy curtis at hahnemann had come back and will and his wife had gotten an immediate and indepth education into what the doctors called club drugsrohypnol known on the street as roofies or mind erasers ketamin khole special k and ghb wendys blood had tested positive for far more than a trace of ghb which was shorthand for gamma hydroxybutyric and called the daterape drug and easy lay among other street names it was a powerful pharmaceutical widely prescribed as a sleep aid and a local anesthetic the doctors told will and linda that when consumed with alcohol ghb became even more powerful it came in the form of a quickdissolving pill liquid or powder and was odorless and colorless sometimes with a slightly salty taste commonly it was slipped into the drink of a young woman at some barthough the illicit drug was no stranger among males in the homosexual communityor even at her apartment if she made the mistake of letting a date come up for a drink just one only and just one was all it took within fifteen minutes of entering the bloodstream ghb could leave the victim completely powerless for up to four hours during which time they had no conscious knowledge of what was happening to them in most cases for better or worse it also left them afterward with no memory of what had been done to them almost the doctors explained as if theyd had a very vague very tragic dream which will had tried to console himself and his wife explained why wendy would not talk about the attack she couldnt remember or maybeprobablydidnt want to but that doctors exam sure as hell found the physical damage and thats what really put her momma over the edge screaming hysterically at the news of her baby girl hurt so badly not even the damned priest could talk to her calm her down and then this scumbag lawyer turned it all the worse getting the case tossed on a technicality with the rapekit evidencea goddamn broken chain of custody in the property room the pervert was guilty as hell then he just walked sonofabitch tonight made the third time in a week that will curtis had been parked in the block of callowhill street each time hed been in a different car and in a different spot but all with a clear view of law office of daniel o gartner esq callowhill was two blocks north of the vine street expressway to the south of vine spread the great wealth of modern skyscrapers and wellpreserved historic buildings that was the bustling center city here however on this block of callowhill the majority of addresses were deserted signs in the dirty vacant windows of the decaying strips of storefrontsmostly threestory offices sharing a common brick facadeannounced to the occasional passersby that they were for sale or lease of the few that were occupied not one was particularly noteworthy five addresses to the right of gartners law office almost up to north nineteenth street stood a soul food restaurant and barcurtis thought of it as that soulless restaurant complete with vagrants loitering nearbyand a couple addresses to his left were two other lowrent law offices one of which had lettering on its window stating that the firm offered immigrationlaw services and finally across the street next to a large grassy lot surrounded by chainlink fencing was a struggling establishment named tattoo u that curtis had thought with a morbid chuckle was probably where gartners clients went to acquire im a loser gangbanger body art after gartner their loser of a lawyer had told them their turnin date to report to jail other than that there was damn near nothing here and that served his purpose tonight just fine it had been a little more than three hours since will curtis had pulled the chevy sedan into the parallel parking space across the street from gartners office in that time hed come to feel comfortable that the patterns he had noted on his previous two nights of surveillance were similar to what was playing out tonight first most workers in the nearby offices had headed for homeor probably a corner bar hed thoughtthe great rush of them at the stroke of five oclock there were even a few whod worn halloween outfits if black tights and cat whiskers and a headband with pointy furry ears counted as a costume then for the next hour out came the stragglers they disappeared one by one down the cracked sidewalk until easily by six callowhill streetnot counting an occasional patron for the restaurant or the tattoo parlorwas more or less deserted right about seventhirty a woman left gartners office returning fifteen or so minutes later with some sort of fast food each night it was the same chunky woman about age thirty and black and overweight but with a pleasant face the first time she had carried two flat cardboard boxes with pies from the pizza joint on the corner of callowhill and north twentyfirst street tonight shed gone a block up to hamilton street and come back with a couple of greasy white sacks that had asianlooking lettering takie outie tasty chinese the thought of smelling let alone tasting greasy egg rolls made wills stomach grumble not because he was hungryhe had almost no appetite these daysbut because the chemotherapy treatments had made his gut easily upset even before they found the cancer his prostate had caused him to have to take leaks far more often than he liked particularly because finding a pisser was not always easy especially while driving a fedex truck on its delivery route schedule he couldnt keep stopping continuouslyhis boss would wonder why he was constantly lateso in center city hed swung by goldbergs armynavy on chestnut street and bought a couple of surplus gallon canteens the plastic containers werent the most sanitary solution but they worked he could do his business while seated then later simply crack open the door and dump out the canteen onto the street and that had damn sure come in handy the nights he watched the law office now for the third time tonight will curtis picked up the canteen unscrewed its top unzipped the fly of his blue jeans and relieved himself into the halffull container then he screwed the top back on tightly and dropped the canteen to the floorboard and heaved a huge sigh of relief ten minutes later curtis saw the battered heavy metal door of gartners office swing open the doorway opening filled with a harsh white glow of fluorescent light he checked his wellworn goldtoned seiko wristwatch eight oclock on the nose then as hed seen happen the other times here out walked the overweight black woman tonight she wore a gray kneelength woolen overcoat which only made her obesity more pronounced and slung a black patentleather purse over her shoulder right on time he guessed that she was gartners parttime help one who came in maybe after attending college classes or another job and worked for him till eight gartners fulltime assistant a bony white woman of maybe forty was one of the ones who left the office at five oclock on the dot that meant to the best of curtiss knowledge that gartner was now alone which was how curtis wanted it he held no animosity whatever toward any of the office help everyone had to work for a living he reasoned and no one should be held accountable for what their bosses did which was why he did not mind waiting so long in the car and pissing in canteens while he knew that the spreading cancer wasnt going to give him all the time in the worldsure as hell not much more time left on the top side of the turfhe felt that he did have enough time to settle some scores with the ones who deserved it curtis glanced down at the glock the matteblack gun reminded him of the semiautomatic colt model acp with which hed first learned to shoot that had been during his short stinttwo years ten months and twentytwo days during the s discharged honorably during a postwar reduction in forcein the pennsylvania national guard and that caused him to shake his head in disgust i joined up to fight for freedombut damn sure not so our legal system would allow these worthless shits to do what they want to innocent girls no one is going to miss him and theres not a damn thing thats going to happen to me for taking him outthat is if i get caught then he chuckled like that saying goes you cant kill a man born to hang or in my case hang dead at the end of a chemo iv drip he slipped the glock into the right pocket of his denim jacket and opened the drivers door as he shuffled his feet to get out he accidentally kicked the full canteen across the floorboard he looked down at it and made a face oh what the hell may as well dump it out now then he smirked and i know exactly how he looked over at the cracked frosted plateglass window with law office of daniel o gartner esq he saw a couple of overhead white lights go off behind it then there began a pulsing of differentcolored lights hed seen that happen on the other nights hed sat watching the office and decided that gartner liked to watch a little television maybe a movie after the help had left he picked up the canteen and swung open the door two will curtis staying in the shadows walked up the sidewalk on the far side of the street as he approached a parallelparked filthy old ford panel vanone that apparently hadnt been moved in a month of sundays judging by the parking tickets and fastfood restaurant flyers stacked thick under its windshield wipershe stepped off the curb to cross the street he turned his head left and checked for any traffic and just as he saw that there wasnt anything coming there came from the opposite direction the sound of a roaring motorcycle engine he stopped in his tracks keeping behind the filthy ford van and carefully peered out to look to the right and there he saw it one of those highend racingstyle motorcycles designed to look at once sleek and aggressive he saw plenty of them while driving his truck routesand he hated them the idiots on those crotch rockets are always street racing or running in packs like marauding dogs reckless as hell causing wrecks in their wake even worse every now and then splattering themselves on the bumper of some car making that innocent driver carry that damn memory the rest of his life the motorcycle had just turned the corner at nineteenth but then suddenly made a fast uturn which explained the roaring sound hed heard and then curtis saw why the riderjesus hes small for that big bikehad changed direction near the end of the block a group of four girls wearing their parochialschool outfits of dark woolen skirts and white cotton blouses were approaching the corner of nineteenth and callowhill they looked to be about age fifteen or sixteen as the motorcycle closed on the group the girls were lit by the bikes bright headlightand they froze there in the beam staring at the fastapproaching machine scared like damned deer one of the girls wore a zippered hoodie athletic jacket in blue and white and when she turned away from the beam it lit her back there curtis saw the representation of mickey mouse stitched on the jacket the cartoon characters head partially obscured by the hood curtis had figuredand the jacket confirmedthat the group was from john w hallahan catholic girls high school a private institution run by the archdiocese of philadelphia hallahan was just around the corner between callowhill and vine blue and white were its school colors the disney icon its school mascot the motorcyclist slowed then passed the girls and did another quick uturn he may be small but the prick can ride thats the little man syndromeinsecure guys getting a hot bike or car to help them look tougher or maybe its little dick syndrome as the headlight swept around it again washed the girls in its beam then the motorcycle engine roared loudly and the beam moved upward as the bike popped a wheelie the front tire rising about three feet off the asphalt the rider half standing on the foot pegs drove the bike on its back tire as he roared past the group of girls fucking showing off curtis thought like he owns the street and wants to own one of them as the motorcycle came closer to where will curtis peered out from behind the filthy ford van the rider backed off the gas and the front tire returned to the pavement the headlight beam flashed curtis in the eyes momentarily blinding him he instinctively dropped back behind the van and went into a crouch he heard the motorcycle approaching quickly followed by the sound of skidding tires the motorcycles engine revved twice then went silent the only sound will curtis now heard was in the distance up the street the school girls were giggling and talkingboth nervously and excitedlyas they slowly walked on up nineteenth andboomthe sights and sounds of the high schoolers triggered a memory this time though the flashback wasnt an unpleasant one wendy had attended hallahan and will remembered the last day of her senior year she had come home with her blueandwhite athletic jacket dripping wet because as was traditional at the girls school she and the rest of the senior class had jumped into the logan circle fountain which was just blocks south of the school in front of the four seasons hotel and then the catholic school memoryboomfilled his mind with scenes of attending saint vincents catholic church with wendy and linda in addition to worshipping there near their west mount airy home will had volunteered his time mostly it had been in the capacity of scoutmaster with a boy scout troop that the church sponsored never mind that hed had no sons in the program he liked what the scouts didhed been one as a kid working his way up to just two merit badges shy of the top rank of eagle scoutand bending rules a bit he liked taking his daughter on camping trips and other outings with the boys hed treated her like the others he taught them how to handle knives and how to shoot pistols andcaliber rifles though to his disappointment she never kept any interest in guns in scouts hed also of course taught wendy how to tie her knots and thatboomdid cause an unpleasant flashback damn it an ugly one a vivid one because he knew that the morning after saint paddys after that evil daterape drug had worn off wendy had awakened to find herself naked and spreadeagledbound with nylon stockings knotted around all four of the bedposts as will curtiss eyes readjusted to the darkness and he could make out his surroundings again the flashback faded he looked across the street and saw that the motorcycle rider had nosed the machine to a stop in front of the cracked frosted plateglass window with law office of daniel o gartner esq the window still pulsed with colored lights from the television the bike was indeed an aggressivelooking racing machine it had bright neon green plastic body panels and a neon green fuel tank a sleek sweptback windscreen and bold decalcomania that damn near screamed in black lettering kawasaki ninja the rider dramatically swung his right leg over the seat as he dismounted he then began loosening the chin strap of his matching neon green helmet a fullface model with its silvermirrored visor pushed up then suddenly the battered metal door of the office opened the motorcyclist turned to look toward it will curtis thought all that engine roaring and rubber burning got someones attention and then he saw a familiar face in the doorway curtis had amused himself the first time hed seen the criminal defense lawyers name listed on court papers as counselor defensegartner daniel o hed begun by calling him danny o then hed switched that around well hello o danny boy you sleazy sonofabitch curtis thought of gartner with a beak of a nose and squinty dark eyes as a palefaced prick he was mediumsize and in his early to mid fifties he tried to appear much younger by dying the gray of his thinning hair though the dye job full of blotches was badly done he wore tight faded black jeans a gray tshirt stenciled with black arty lettering that read peace love justice and tan suede shoes that were open at the heel as his squinty eyes darted back and forth curtis recalled his first impression of gartner that he not only looked like a weasel but projected a greasy sleaziness gartner then said something to the motorcyclist as he was rocking his helmet side to side to slide it from his head when hed finally gotten it off and turned to lock it to the rear of the bike curtis saw yet another familiar face a smug one well i will be goddamned all the waiting really has paid off im going to get a twofer jaycee you miserable shit you wont be smug long not for what you did to wendy john jc nguyen was a cocky twentyfiveyearoldhalf caucasian half asian smallboned fivetwo and maybe oneten soaking wetwho didnt walk but strutted his thick black hair was combed straight back and hung to his collar he wore baggy blue jeans that barely clung to his hips a longsleeved white tshirt and over the tshirt a philadelphia eagles football jersey the green jersey had a big white number on the back and in white block lettering across the shoulder blades the name vick small surprise that the punk worships an overpaid jock who likes making dogs fight to the death but what the hell kind of justice is it that michael vick sat almost two years in the slam for that crime while this miserable shit abused my baby and never spent a single fucking night behind bars by the time he reentered the court system for the assault on wendy curtis jc had had a long list of priorsmore than a dozen arrests over as many years mostly for either possession of or possession with intent to distribute pot and speed and other controlled substances his first bust had been when hed just turned fourteen and it earned him the street name jc for john cannabis a nod to the homegrown marijuana he first sold to his south philly high schoolmates curtis had learned primarily from the prosecutors in the repeat offenders unit of the district attorneys office that in all but nguyens very first cases he had been represented by gartner curtis also had been told that that did not necessarily mean gartner was a good lawyer in fact one assistant district attorney assigned to prosecute nguyens case said that the opposite was true the one thing commonly said of daniel o gartner esquire the prosecutor told curtis quietly but bitterly is that hes the worst fucking lawyer in all the commonwealth of pennsylvania hed then added if there existed a book titled the dictionary of dirtbags and in it was a definition of a lawyer who not only graduated at the bottom of his class but was as dirty as his clients gartners ugly mug would be beside it hed exhaled audibly and added hes always working the system he explained that gartner almost never really won a case for a client practically all them were negotiated with some sort of plea bargain to get the charges reduced working the system so that the sentence left the scum with a very short term in the slam thus it wasnt unusual for gartner to watch a lessthanecstatic client in handcuffs and a faded orange jumpsuit being hauled out of court to go back behind bars sometimesthanks to the already overloaded justice system its dockets packed its prisons fullhe managed to get only a slaponthewrist sentence of probation and on very rare occasions gartner got a case tossed out on a technicality curtis had learned that the hard way in wendys case with nguyen gartner got the guilty bastard off scotfree all it had taken was for him to find a breach in how the evidence had been handled the animal didnt even get probation nothing in the das office after giving the bad news to will and linda curtis then deeply apologizing for the administrative mistake the prosecutor sighed and said its the reality of what we deal with every day the system is broken but like a broken watch that gets the time right twice a day we eventually do get em meanwhile guys like gartner take advantage of the weaknesses to get their clients to walk will curtis saw gartner motion for jc to come inside jc nodded in reply then pulled a small nylon bag from under the weblike netting on the rear end of the motorcycles black seat strutting like a rooster he carried the bag to the open metal door went through it and closed the door behind him will curtis checked for traffic again and started across the street three loft number hops haus tower n lee street philadelphia saturday october pm maybe im wrong about you being a cop dr amanda law playfully whispered to homicide sergeant matthew m payne philadelphia police department badge number because im beginning to think that you do your best work undercover he saw that her face was flushed and glowing as she smiled and pulled her shoulderlength blond hair into a ponytail then threw back the soft cotton cover in question she leaned over and kissed him wetly and loudly on his heaving chest then she stepped out of bed and after taking a moment to catch her breath said be right back romeo twentysevenyearold matt paynewho was six feet tall oneseventyfive with a chiseled face dark intelligent eyes and thick dark hair he kept trimmed shortmarveled at the magnificent milkwhite orbs that formed the toned derriere of amanda law as she padded stark naked across the hardwood flooring then disappeared into the bathroom there then came from behind the door a soft thumping and whine followed by the sound of two clicks one of a light switch and another of the door latch softly shutting the whine had been from luna the twoyearold pup amanda had rescued from the animal shelter five months earlier and the thumping had been the dogs wagging tail hitting the plastic floor liner of the wire kennel crate that served as the dogs den in the massive tiled bathroom lunamatt joked that it was short for lunatic due to the dogs occasional hyperness and regular talkativenesswas either a labradoodle or a genuine purebred portuguese water dog the two breeds could be spitting images and had similar traits a friendly disposition and a serious protective loud bark it was amandas opinion that luna at forty pounds with a dense tightly curled nonshedding black coat was more poodle than lab payne smiled as he thought what the hell is it possible to lose count he glanced at the bedside table there beside two beer bottles and a glass of white wine was his cell phone he looked at the clock on its screen its only eleven and we got back here at maybe nine payne his heart pounding put his head back on the pillow so that means she that is we damn three times in two hours as his chest continued to rise and fall with heavy breaths he decided that if he was about to go into full cardiac arrest right damn here and right damn now the luxury apartment of a medical doctor wasnt necessarily a bad place for that to happen particularly considering that over the course of the last two hours said medical doctor had been party to the cause of his current condition im not about to die but when i do i damn sure want to go wrapped in the arms of that wonderful blond goddess thank god shes gotten back so much of her old self and thank god again she seems only to have suffered a little of the anxiety that her shrink predictedand none of the posttrauma stress hed said would come he certainly underestimated her strong character and her ability to move forward and keep working and she loves her work amanda law md facs fccm was chief physician at temple university hospitals burn center matt was then jarred by the painful memory of amandas abduction from in front of the hospital a month beforeand how close shed come to being killed by a psychopath and that made him think about what shed just said about him being a cop and that in turn made him think about her condominium and why he was really glad she had a place that he knew was safer than any place in the screwedup city after what she went through having the fortress doesnt hurt if only for her peace of mind hell mine too nearly nine months earlier amanda law had bought loft number a luxury onebedroom oneandahalfbath condominium on the top floor of the yearold hops haus tower in the northern liberties section of philly the penthouse property had met her long list of requirements starting with a good price a really reasonable one considering all the amenities shed said but she confided in matt what had really sold her on the place were the incredible panoramic views even from his pillow payne could stare out at the lights twinkling on nearby interstate and the delaware river and past the far riverbank the lights of camden new jersey and spreading out even farther east of the garden state itself shed said she also liked the retro industrial design of the highrise which reflected the feel of the hops haus brewery the renovated fourstory hundredyearold building adjacent to the foot of the tower the wall surfaces were alternately exposed red brick and stained concrete and the flooring was a rustic dark hardwood planking the high ceilings had exposed fire sprinkler pipes and the metal ductwork for the airconditioning hung from straps out in the open the floortoceiling windows were of the same design as those of the original bavarian brewhouse downstairs but what payne liked best about the residential towerand why he privately called it the fortresswas that while it was meant to appear old the place had the absolute latest in stateoftheart security that included of course being wired with highend closedcircuit tv cameras with overlapping fields of view so that no corner went unrecorded as well as a multifactor authentication system for anyone who wished to access the property and all of it was monitored by roundtheclock private security personnel the security chief was andy hardwick a midforties bald and barrelchested sergeant from central detectives whod conveniently retired from the philadelphia police department right before the development was completed hed known paynes biological father and uncle had known matt since hed been in diapers and was more than happy to show him all the buildings bells and whistles and badguy booby traps hardwick had promised payne thered be a close but discreet protective eye kept on the primary resident of loft number as well as heightened surveillance mostly via cctv cameras but also by occasional security personnel performing routine safetydevice inspections of the twentyfirst floor this place is probably tighter than a graterford rhu payne thought and then he had a mental image of the hellish supersecure restricted housing unitseffectively individual prisons for the worst offenders serving time in solitary confinementat the pennsylvania state correctional institution thirty miles west of philly all of the hops haus towers commonarea and exterior doors were on computercontrolled locks every resident was issued an electronic fob smaller than a cough drop and designed to fit conveniently on a key ring each of which had a unique electronic signature that could be turned onand perhaps more important turned offat one of the security computers most residents also had electronic scans of their thumbprints saved to the security computers for entry residents could unlock the commonarea and exterior doorsincluding those on each floor of the parking garage that led to the elevatorsonly through a twostep authentication process first they used the electronic fob and second they submitted to a biometric thumbprint reader or manually entered a unique code on a keypad the doors guarding each elevator bank within the building were fitted with the same certification devices finally as a last electronic barrier there was a fob receiver panel inside each elevator on the wall of buttons you had to swipe the fob in order for any of the buttons to become live and light up when pushed each fob was coded to be floorspecific which meant two things it was noted if the resident associated with the thumbprint or keypad code at the elevator bank door got off at a floor other than the one linked to the fob and the anomaly was flagged and archived and available in the event anything unfortunate happened and only residents of the penthouse floor had fobs that allowed access to that level the fobs of every other resident could go only as high as the twentieth floor which was another reason payne thought that amandas topfloor unit was highly secure then he had an unkind thought of course no matter how high the professional standards including andy hardwicks the weak link in the most secure of facilities whether its a luxury residence or a supermax prison is the human factorthe gatekeepers whoever the hell is manning the desks and machinery one crooked guard on the take and the whole fucking system may as well be a bucket of rusty bolts and blown locks especially with securityand certain conciergepersonnel having access to that master key to every unit the one that that effeminate manager had said was necessary you know just in case of emergency like your washing machines water line ruptures while youre gone or your bathtub overflows and starts flooding your neighbors yeah right and for what he didnt say or theres the stench of rotted flesh coming from behind your locked door still for what it is and where it is this place is as good as it gets his pulse starting to calm payne sat up and heaved one last deep breath he reached back over to the bedside table and picked up one of the beers a halfempty bottle of hops haus india pale ale after he and amanda had eaten dinner in the pub on the first floor of the building hed bought a case of the ipathe pub had its own microbreweryand that case of twentyfour bottles was now down to twenty he looked out the tall windows again as he took a swig of beer while he could appreciate the view being a cop he couldnt help but look past the twinkling lights and think of all the criminals hiding out there in the shadows masked by darkness his eyes followed the delaware river up to the betsy ross bridge then beyond that though too far to see clearly he knew that a few miles beyond the bridge on state road in the holmesburg section of northeast philadelphia some of those lights were from the philadelphia prison system its curranfromhold correctional facility the largest in the system alone processed some thirty thousand inmates all adult males each year every year the intake center operated around the clock but not damn near enough what was that figure on fugitives from the courts almost fifty thousand whove jumped bail and run now theyre in the wind out there somewhere theyre damn sure not in church confessing their sins and praying for absolution hell no theyre roaming the streets committing more robberies rapes murders whatever at will they know the court system is so clogged that they can just ignore it thumb their nose at it jesus what a mess four it was no secret to the one and a half million residents of the sixthmostpopulated city in america that the city of brotherly love was among the deadliest in america philadelphiakilladelphia payne heard it called at least once every damn dayaveraged a murder dailydown from incredibly a twoaday average only a decade agowhich of course kept the police departments homicide unit plenty busy what politicians wished was more of a secret if only because of bureaucratic bungling and intergovernmental fingerpointing was the fact that there were tens of thousands of fugitives loose on the streets nearly fifty thousand miscreantsfrom pimps to pedophiles to robbers to rapists to junkies to every other lawless sonofabitchwho had skipped out on their bail and were on the run from facing their day in court as a general rule of thumb the main purpose of a courts bail system was more or less a noble one to let certain of those charged with crimes to remain productive family members and citizens in their community until their court date which could be months away this pretrial release reinforced the presumption that those charged with crimes were innocent until proven guilty it also conveniently helped ease the burden on the overcrowded jails and that in turn eased the financial burden on a cashstrapped city to provide three square meals a day armed guards for supervision and sundry other services the vast majority of americas biggest cities used the bail bond system a privatesector enterprise administered by forprofit companies in contrast the city of philadelphia and the city of chicago illinois which had a similar number of fugitives from justice used a system of deposit bail which was governmentfunded and governmentrun in philly it was overseen by judges from the municipal court and from the court of common pleas using a worksheet titled pretrial release guidelines an arraignment magistrate determined the severity of the crime and the risk factor of the person charged with the crime to set the bail the guidelines would in theory set a bail high enough to ensure that the person charged with the crime would appear in court so as not to lose the security fee once the bail fee had been set both the bail bond and the deposit bond worked essentially the same way generally depending on various factors the person charged with the crime had to pay only ten percent of the whole security fee to get out of jail the main differences between the two models arose if the offender missed or skipped out on his court date under the bail bond model the court went after the bail bondsman for the deadbeats forfeited feethe company then had a financial incentive to find the deadbeat and deliver him to the court there was no similar financial incentive however with a deposit bond the government already owned the deadbeats iou it was funny money more or less worthless unless they hunted down the deadbeat and collected the remaining feeif they could find him and if he had the funds to pay and so not surprisingly those whod blown their deposit bail numbered around fifty thousandno one knew the exact number because due to more bureaucratic blundering a master listing was never kept these fugitives collectively owed hundreds of millions of dollars for their unpaid ious worse in the meantime they remained at large on the streets acting with impunityeffectively telling the city of philadelphia and its judicial system to go fuck itself all kinds of craziness going on down there payne thought while im up here enjoying the company of this incredible goddess and god knows i do love her but do i love being out there chasing some murderer more he sighed the answerright here right nowis not no but hell no and amandas not complaining that they pulled me back off the street and stuck me at a desk in homicide theres absolutely no question that deep down all things being equal shed rather i do something other than be a cop anything that didnt risk me getting shot in the line of duty like her father or killed like my father and uncle and that obit damn sure spelled it out five while amanda law had been in her first week of recovery under the shrinks orders simply to rest at home and to reconsider taking the antianxiety meds that hed prescribed and that shed steadfastly refusedi dont need to be popping prozacs and i damn sure dont need them turning my mind to putty so i just sit there and drool all over myself her type a personality had her brain working overtime dealing mentally with the abduction and the attempt at extortion had been bad enough but then came the knowledge that the bastards whod kidnapped her had made a regular habit of committing sexual assaults and worse their leader had just killed one teenage honduran girlan illegal immigrant whom hed forced into prostitution naturally logically all that had caused her to consider her own mortalityhow close had he been to killing again he certainly threatened meand then that of matt and in the process of working through whatif scenarioswhat happens if we continue seeing each other what happens if we get married and move into that vinecovered cottage with the white picket fence that matt loves to mention and then what happens if he stays on with the departmentshed come up with as her father the cop had taught her to do a worstcase scenario amanda explained all thisand moreto matt in great detail and then handed him the absolute worst case as it had manifested itself to her as an obituary amanda had written the obit as if she were mickey ohara the pulitzer prizewinning reporter who was well respected by both police rank and file and brass over the years matt and the wiry irishman ten years his senior had even become fairly close friends amanda had gotten a great deal of the details for the obit from searches on the internet mostly from the bulletins online archive of articles many of which had been articles written by ohara the rest of the details had been provided by matts sister amy payne had never liked that her brother was a cop and had been more than happy to fill in any gaps for her old college dorm suitemate payne thought that amanda had done a helluva job putting together the obit he hadnt been able to shake it from his mind which was no surprise considering the subject the wyatt earp of the main line killed in the line of duty homicide sergeant matthew m payne faithfully served family and phillyand paid the ultimate price by michael j ohara staff writer the philadelphia bulletin photographs courtesy of the family and michael j ohara philadelphiathe city of brotherly love grieves today at the loss of one of its finest citizens and police officers sergeant matthew mark payne a nineyear veteran of the philadelphia police department and well known as the wyatt earp of the main line was gunned down last week in a kensington alleyway as he dragged out a fellow officer whod been wounded in an ambush paynes heroic act amid a barrage of bullets sealed right up until his last breath his longheld reputation as a brave loyal and honorable officer and gentleman friends and family say that part of what made payne such an outstanding civil servant one that personified the departments motto of honor integrity sacrifice was that he didnt have to do it he chose to do so a family that servedand sacrificed when almost a decade ago payne graduated summa cum laude from the university of pennsylvania he could have followed practically any professional path other than law enforcement hed enjoyed a privileged background brought up in upscale wallingford in all the comfort that a main line life afforded after attending prep school at episcopal academy then completing his studies at u of p he was expected to pursue a law degree and perhaps join his adoptive fathers law practice the prestigious firm of mawson payne stockton mcadoo amp lester instead matt payne chose something else he decided that he should defend his country he signed recruitment papers with the united states marine corps only to discover that a minor condition with his vision barred him from joining the corps determined to serve in some other capacity payne joined the philadelphia police department again he didnt have to if anything matt payne had a pass but again he chose to a pass because his biological father sergeant john f x moffitt known as jack was killed in the line of duty tooshot dead while responding to a silent burglar alarm at a gasoline station and jack moffitts brother captain richard c dutch moffitt commanding officer of the departments elite highway patrol had been killed as well while trying to stop a robbery at the waikiki diner on roosevelt avenue paynes decision to join the police department came only months after his uncle dutch was killed many believed he joined in order to avenge the deaths of his father and uncle and to prove that the condition that kept him out of the corps would not keep him from being a good cop frankly all that scared the hell out of us said dennis v denny coughlin who recently retired as first deputy commissioner of police but who was a chief inspector at the time payne joined the department coughlin had been best friends with jack moffitt at his death and took upon himself the sad duty of delivering the tragic news to matts motherthen pregnant with mattthat shed been widowed i can confess now that when matty came to the department a visibly upset coughlin added i tried to protect him i sure as hell didnt want to have to knock on his mothers door with the news that now jacks son had been killed on the job too unfortunately that duty fell last week to first deputy commissioner of police peter wohl new cop hero cop after graduating from the police academy there was no question that matt payne was becoming both a good cop and a respected one but no matter how hard we tried throughout his career said peter wohl to whom payne was first assigned as an administrative assistant when wohl ran special operations matt wound up in the thick of things bullets flying that said all his shootings were found to be righteous ones before payne had even put in six months on the job he had already drawn his pistol it had happened when he was off duty and had come across a van that fit the description of the one used by the criminal the newspapers had labeled the northwest serial rapist when the driver tried to run him down payne shot him in the head a young woman trussed up and naked in the back of the vehicle was saved from becoming the rapists next victim and headlines hailed matt payne as a hero the next incident happened during an operation that this writer covered matt payne had been assigned to provide protection for me in an alleyway that was supposed to be a safe distance from where tactical teams were staging to arrest a gang who had committed murder while robbing goldblatts department store we thought that in having matt sit on mick wohl explained we could keep mick out of our way and at the same time keep matt far from any gunplay they were wrong as this writer reported then one of the men the cops were trying to arrest came into the alleyway and began shooting matt payne his forehead grazed by a bullet returned fire and killed the shooter the following day on the front page of the bulletin the photograph i took of a bloodied matt payne holding his pistol and standing over the dead shooter appeared with this writers firsthand account of paynes heroic actions the photographs headline read officer m m payne the wyatt earp of the main line a shiningbut briefcareer promotion followed but so too did more gunfire payne became romantically involved with a young woman named susan reynolds and then discovered that a sorority sister of hers had become caught up with a terrorist named bryan chenowith who was the target of a nationwide manhunt by the federal bureau of investigation in an attempt to trap chenowith payne asked reynolds to lure her friend to a diner in hopes that the fugitive would follow and the fbis special agent in charge in philadelphia could nab him however the fugitive brought with him acaliber carbine rifle and shot up the parking lot susan reynolds took a bullet to the head and died in paynes arms later matt payne quietly admitted to a very few that the experience haunted him beyond anything hed ever known payne dealt with it as best he could mostly by losing himself in his work and that he did well when he was promoted to sergeant and transferred to the homicide unit matt payne was given badge number which previously had been worn by sergeant john jack f x moffitt his father other dramatic incidents occurredtoo many to be included herebut one of the most recent was among the most memorable when the wyatt earp of the main line again found himself involved in a foot chaseand a shootoutwith a murderer payne happened to be at temple university hospital when jesus jimenez a nineteenyearold gang member snuck into the hospitals thirdfloor burn unit and executed a patient when jimenez fled the floor payne pursued him out onto the streets ultimately wounding jimenez in the thigh before he got away jimenez it turned out belonged to a group led by juan paulo delgado a texican age twentyone and the assassination in the hospital was only a part of delgados reign of terrorone that stretched from the streets of philadelphia to the dirt trails of the texasmexico border when delgado abducted dr amanda law for ransom payne detective anthony harris and sergeant jim byrth of the legendary texas rangers lawenforcement agency were already hunting him thery were accompanied by a confidential informant acting on a tip from the informant the group tracked delgado to a dilapidated row house on hancock street in kensington the policemen confronted the occupantsjimenez delgado and their associate omar quintanillain an exchange that eventually left delgado and quintanilla dead payne and his associates rescued dr law who was found in the kitchen her head covered by a pillowcase her ankles and wrists bound by duct tape to a chair and the arrests of the members of delgados gang quickly followed and so now we come to today one final time we declare matt payne a hero this courageous dedicated son of philadelphia gave the city his all in last weeks gun battle and selfless act in which he put down a pair of vicious criminals and saved a fellow officer may he rest in peace we know that matt will always be a hero to the decent and lawabiding citizens of philadelphia said his deeply grieving wife dr amanda law payne as she held their toddler daughter on her hip and as their twin sons clung to her legs following a memorial service that overflowed with attendees but first and foremost he was our familys hero while we must move forward our children and i shall never ever forget that matthew mark payne is survived by his loving wife of five years mrs amanda law payne his sons brewster cortland payne iii and john francis xavier moffitt payne age four his daughter mandy law payne age two his sister dr amelia payne his parents mr and mrs b c payne ii and numerous other relatives and friends the family requests that in lieu of flowers memorials be made in matthew mark paynes name to the widow amp orphan fund at the fraternal order of police lodge spring garden street philadelphia pa matt remembered slowly folding the sheets of paper then handing it back to her she smiled weakly as tears welled then trickled down her rosy cheeks softly she said life is short baby maybe too short ii one callowhill street philadelphia saturday october pm will curtis almost across the street chuckled at the tune that suddenly played in his head then he heard himself start singing it softly o danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling from glen to glen and down the mountain side the summers gone and all the losers falling as he came closer to the law office he realized that he hadnt given a hell of a lot of thought as to how he was going to get inside he figured if he knocked on the door long enough and loud enough he would get a response hell then again all i really have to do is make a lot of noise kicking over the motorcycle ill bet that bastard jaycee comes flying outside when he reached the door and had put the canteen on the sidewalk beside it he decided just for the hell of it to try the doorknob with his right hand holding his glock he carefully grabbed the knob with his left hand and slowly started to turn it it was unlocked why am i not surprised jaycees a dumbass the heavy metal door swung outward with a squeak of its hinges and then curtis realized why it had been unlocked it was a common door for the multiple individual offices within the building he now stood in an empty corridor a short and very narrow one with the inner door to gartners office immediately to his left a flight of wellworn wooden stairs leading to the offices on the upper floors a little farther down on the right and at the end of the corridor an exit door to the alleyway curtis decided to press his luck and turn the dirty tin knob on gartners interior door to see if just maybe jc might have left it unlocked too as he reached for the knob he heard someone directly on the other side of the door then saw the knob turn he barely had time to flatten himself against the wall by the door hinges before the door flew open toward him blocking his view then came the sound of feet moving quickly then the exterior door squeaking open and closed curtis didnt see who had gone outside but now he leaned over to peer through the gap between the door edge and the frame into gartners office it was mostly dark except for the glow of the televisionout of curtiss field of view but he could hear its sound which seemed to be a lot of heavy breathing with rock music blaring in the backgroundand a single short lamp on what he guessed to be gartners desk there were two other desks smaller ones their tops not nearly as messy though one had the crumpled greasy chinese takeout bags on it against a far wall stood a pair of old sixfootlong folding tables they sagged at the center under the weight of loose fat file folders and white cardboard storage boxes under the tables and all along the walls were books and more stacks of file folders and piles of legalsize papers and there was trash or what could have been more legal papers littering the worn dirty industrial carpeting curtis could see gartner behind the deska big wooden one piled ridiculously high with papersstanding bent over at the waist with his face close to the desktop he held something to his face and slowly pivoted his head from left to right while inhaling deeply then he suddenly stood erect and rubbing his nose looked wideeyed at the open office door then spun on his heels and looked at the cracked plateglass window after a second apparently satisfied gartner then bent back over the desk again will curtis carefully stepped to the left so he could peer around the far edge of the open door he saw that the heavy metal door to the street was closed he started to move toward it to lock its deadbolts but then he thought that might reveal him to gartner if only for a second or two which would ruin the element of surprise fuck it get it over with will curtis quickly moved around the open door and gun up and ready entered danny gartners office as he scanned the interiorgartner was alonehe pulled the door closed behind him this time he did throw the lock on the door before curtis could say anything gartner his face still close to the desk casually said you find it when gartner looked up for a response his eyes became huge again he dropped what he had in his hand and staggered two steps backward almost tripping over his own feet what the hell danny gartner asked his voice almost a squeak who shut the fuck up will curtis said calmly but forcefully aiming at him with the glock who gartner repeated i said shut the fuck up curtis glanced at the desktop he saw the black nylon bag jc had brought it was open and held a plastic sandwich bag not quite a quarter full of what looked like groundup chalk beside that on the desktop were two linesactually a line and a half leftof the powder and a stub of a thin plastic straw coke maybe meth goddamn drugs he glanced around the room he now had a clear view of the tv and the pulsing lights were of a very raw pornographic scene it was hardcorenothing but writhing naked women and closeup shots of the sex toys probing their genitalia filled the flat screen sick sonsofbitches he thought as he walked over to the tv theres no end to their depravity he hit the onoff switch and the room got darker curtis looked back at gartner then motioned quickly with the pistol step out here in front of the desk gartner didnt move curtis saw his eyes glance out the plateglass window whered jc go curtis asked it was clear by gartners expression that he was surprised the intruder knew jcs name then that expression changed to one of found opportunity gartner his tone more controlled said youre after jc i can damn it just answer the question he motioned more aggressively with the pistol and get your ass over here slowly staring at the glock gartner began moving as told when he was in the middle of the floor curtis motioned again with the gun and said now on your knees as gartner complied curtis looked around the room quickly over on one of the sagging folding tables was a roll of threeinchwide clear packing tape he walked over and picked it up then went back to gartner hands behind your back curtis said and when gartner had complied curtis wrapped his wrists tightly together with the tape he pulled a folding knife from his pocket and cut the tape roll free then he pushed gartner hard between the shoulder blades so that he fell forward and smacked his face on the dirty carpeting shit gartner said whatd you do that for curtis didnt reply he put his right knee in the small of gartners back and on top of the taped wriststhen quickly wrapped gartners ankles with the tape the locked doorknob rattled followed by a knock dan jcs muffled voice called whats up will curtis put the muzzle of the pistol against gartners left temple dont say a word he looked at gartners eyes then decided he didnt trust him to do as ordered he ran the tape through gartners open mouth and wrapped it twice around his head as curtis stood and went to the door jc began banging on it dan you okay in there jc called at the door curtis held his pistol at the point where he expected to find jcs head then he reached for the knob and unlocked it at the sound of the click the knob spun and the door was yanked open jc stood there an envelope in his right hand andsurprising curtisthe green plastic canteen in his left he froze as he saw he was looking at the muzzle of a bigbore pistol and judging how his facial expression changed he recognized the angry man who was aiming the weapon between his eyes ahhh jc said dropping the envelope and canteen and holding up his hands palms out curtis then noticed some kind of movement in jcs midsection when he glanced down he saw that the crotch of jcs blue jeans was darkening and the stain was quickly spreading moving mostly down the inside of the right leg of his pants curtis snorted not so smug now huh not so tough and cocky either you chickenshit you just pissed yourself cmon curtis said motioning with the pistol for jc to come in strut in over there beside your lawyer buddy and get on your knees after jc reluctantly moved inside the office curtis quickly stepped out and grabbed the envelope and the canteen then pulled the door shut and relocked it the envelope was hefty and packed with a thick wad of paper will curtis put one end of the envelope in his teeth and tore it open he blew into the hole then looked insidethen whistled he walked over to the desk and started shaking the envelope to dump out its contents a stack of wellworn billstwenties fifties and hundreds easily totaling at least a couple grandlanded by the ziptop bag of white powder he shook the envelope once more and out fell a cellophane packet of pills he looked at jc who had gotten on his knees curtis then went to him and said hands behind your back as curtis wrapped jcs wrists he asked whats that bag of powder meth jc shook his head uhuh he said nervously coke take all you want curtis ignored that and those pills in the packet he saw jc and gartner exchange nervous glances he pushed jc to the floor and put a knee in his back what the fuck are they curtis said tell me or ill just shoot you now roofies jc said quietly closing his eyes curtis said nothing as he considered that while taping together jcs ankles then with an amused tone to his voice he said roofies really curtis then leaned over gartner and using the pocketknife cut the tape that was wrapped around his head and pulled the gag from his mouth i think we all need a drink curtis said i know youve got to have something here danny boy gartner made a forced smile sure bourbon vodka gin what do you want where is it gartner nodded toward a bookshelf across the room will curtis grabbed the first bottle he saw on the bookself it was vodka stolichnaya specifically stoli razberi beside it was a bottle of jack black and one of bombay sapphire and next to those were six somewhat clean highball glasses as he walked back to the desk curtis didnt know what pissed him off more about the vodka that its goddamned russian or that its candyass flavored well maybe the raspberry will make the pills easier to swallow gartner and jc watched curtiss every move as he splashed about an inch of stoli into each of two glasses then he took from the cellophane packet four of the rohypnol pills and dropped two in each of the glasses of vodka there was a little fizz as the pills began to dissolve in the alcohol he took the bottle of stoli razberi back to the bookshelf picked up another glass then the bottle of jack daniels as he poured he turned to glance at gartner and jc if youre getting the clear stuff curtis said then im getting the dark stuff wouldnt want to get them confused no he carried the glass of jack black to the desk and set it down then he picked up one of the glasses of vodka he took it over to where gartner lay on the carpet grabbing gartner by the arm curtis got him back up on his knees then he held the glass to his lips gartner shook his head curtis grabbed him by his thinning grayblack hair and yanked back gartners jaw dropped open and curtis poured in the vodka then moved his hand under the jaw and closed gartners mouth it took a moment but gartner finally swallowed most of it he repeated the process with jc though he had to hit jc on the head with his pistol after he spit out the first glass of vodka curtis had then mixed two more roofies with another three inches of stoli razberi then grabbed a stunned jc by his bloodsoaked thick black hair and poured the drink down his throat then will curtis went back to the desk sat in the chair and began sipping from the jack daniels while watching the alcoholfueled roofies take effect and for reasons he did not understand particularly considering the circumstances he suffered not one single flashback maybe this is what they mean by finding peace through justice okay lets go you assholes curtis didnt expect a reply under the influence of the stolirohypnol mixture gartner and jc were more or less out cold even when he kicked them in the ass with his boot toe they barely responded for the first ten minutes after hed forced them to swallow the powerful sedative hed watched them slowly get sleepier and sleepier gartner faded faster and curtis thought that might be because of the cocaine hed also consumed by the time fifteen minutes had passed theyd basically become incoherent slurring their words after the twentyminute mark with them curled up babylike on the carpet curtis had felt confident that they posed no problem whatsoever and had gone out to move the car behind the building now a half hour later he struggled to get themvery groggy but agreeable despite their wrists still being boundone at a time down the corridor and out the back door of the office building hed parked the malibu in the dark alley and left its truck open he dumped jc and gartner inside the trunk then took the clear adhesive tape and wrapped their heads so that the tape sealed the nose and mouth of both men as he watched their bodies begin to convulse at the blockage of their airways curtis wondered why dont i feel bad about this thenbooma vision came of wendy it was the one of her spreadeagled bound to the bed with her nylon stockings shit thats the hell why he looked at jc because of what you did to my baby and to whoever else you miserable bastard then his eyes went to the other bucking body and you danny boy kept him out of jail so that he could kept him and who the hell knows how many other miserable shits on the streets curtis suddenly furious shook his head angrily as he took one last look at the pair then he quickly pulled from his pocket two plastic garbage bags hed grabbed in gartners office and covered their heads with them he took the glock from his jacket and put its muzzle at the base of jcs skull angled toward the top of his head and squeezed the trigger thecaliber round fired with a loud bang jc made a primal groan his legs kicked out straight and the garbage bag on his head billowed briefly the top of it moving violently as bullet fragments flew out accompanied by bits of brain and blood and lodged in the trunk floorboard the pistol automatically ejected the empty brass casing which flew up hitting the trunk lid then landed beside jcs body near where a dark stream of blood flowed from the bag staining the white shirt and pooling on the football jersey now you wont be going after those high school girlsor any others then he moved the pistol muzzle to the same place at the base of gartners skull and squeezed off another round this time the ejected spent casing landed on the concrete of the alleyway the brass made a tinkling sound in the darkness as it tumbled to a stop against a curb rot in hell you scum will curtis thought then slammed down the lid two loft number hops haus tower n lee street philadelphia saturday october pm as matt payne looked out of amanda laws penthouse window thinking about how much damn truth amanda had written in his wouldbe obituary he took a sip from the beer bottle and swallowed hard so then why do i feel the pull to be out there running down those animals because of what else amanda said long before writing the obit that it takes cops like me and her dad to keep the city as safe as possible from the bad guys loose on the streets which shed told me more than a little ironically right before those shits snatched her off the street at the memory of finding her bound in the gutted kitchen of that abandoned row house payne suddenly felt his throat constrict that place wasnt a house it was a slum and a fucking prison slum at that but there it is ill take the door of any place like that a hundred times over that may or may not make me a good cop but bagging bad guys is the right thing to do proof of that being that amanda is alive and further proof being that bastard jimenez is on the fast track to serving a life sentence in graterford following his arrest at the row house jesus jimenez had confessed to killing twentysevenyearold j warren skipper olde over what juan paulo delgado claimed was a bad drug debt in exchange for avoiding the death penalty jimenez also ratted out everyone in their small band of thugs in a signed confession payne drained the beer bottle which helped ease the constriction then he grinned as he thought too bad the bastards about to become somebodys bitch jimenez will hope he gets thrown alone in an rhu the door to the bathroom swung open and amanda law still starkers stood momentarily backlit in the doorway my god shes stunning matt thought you take my breath away he said in more ways than one it would appear she flashed a sly smile that romeo is my evil plan she clicked off the bathroom light and said sweetly to the dog good girl luna lie down then she smoothly and swiftly moved across the dimly lit bedroom completely comfortable in her birthday suit it reminded matt of the second time hed met her just last month in liberties bar when she seemed to float effortlessly across the wellworn wooden floor clothed of course but even then hed been mentally undressing her as she crawled back into bed matt smelled the delicate floral scent of her perfume it became stronger as she moved in closer to put a hand on his chest and kiss him on the forehead he smoothly turned his head so that his lips were on hers she moaned softy and appreciatively and thenhearing a brief familiar vibrating soundmade an unhappy groan paynes eyes turned in the direction of the sound to the bedside table where hed left his cell phone it was set to silentvibrate its color screen was now casting a pulsing bluishgreen glow amanda playfully bit his lower lip and held it as she mumbled dont you dare get matt still in her grips carefully reached for the phone then held it more or less behind amandas head so he could clearly see its screen she bit harder payne grunted as he read the text message onscreen blocked number yo matty hope im interrupting something really good at this hour got another popndrop an hour ago two actually couldnt have happened to nicer guys you know one the black buddha said to give you a headsup click on fox news th matt sighed then turned his eyes to meet amandas and raised his hands up palms out i surrender he muttered as best he could she let loose his lip and slipped back between the sheets her tone sounding disappointed amanda said i sure hope thats not what im afraid it is especially at this hour please tell me its not work he held the phone out for her to read its screen as she did matt thought someone i know what the hell does that mean th was tony harrisage thirtyeight slight of build and starting to baldwho was widely regarded as a really good guy and a really good homicide detective he had worked closely with matt and sergeant jim byrth of the texas rangers last month when theyd tracked down juan paulo delgado and the black buddha was their boss lieutenant jason washington head of the homicide unit he was a great big bear of a mansixfootthree and two hundred twentyfive pounds with very dark skin washington wellspoken superbly tailored and highly respected did not consider the nickname unflattering im damn sure black matthew he said in his deep sonorous voice and buddha the enlightened one surely is a wise man i have no problem wearing that badge with pride so amanda said softly i guess since youve been working the popanddrops were done for the evening someone in the city was shooting fugitives these particular ones were wanted on outstanding arrest warrants for crimes against women and children he had not told amanda that their crimes were sexual in nature after popping a sex offender at pointblank range the shooter then transported the body to the nearest police district headquarters dropping it off in the parking lot with a copy of the perps wanted informationa computer printout downloaded from one of various internet websites listing fugitivesstapled to some part of his clothing thus popanddrop not that anyones complaining that the scum of society is being swept from the streets for good payne had thought but as jason washington said murders murder matthew and who knows what the shooter might escalate to next matt payne hadnt figured out how in hell the shooter had been able to get so close to any of the district hq buildings without being caught in the act of dumping a body so far it had happened five times in about as many weeks and the department had been able to keep the incidents quietwhich meant away from the news mediawhile the brass finally found someone who was available to take the cases and try to piece together who the hell the doer or doers might be a lucky sergeant payne stuck at his desk assignment had been chosen matt turned kissed amanda on the forehead and said hold on baby matt reached back over to the side table and fished around in its drawer until he came up with a remote control he thumbed the on button and the sixtyinch flatscreen television mounted on the wall made a humming sound and its screen began to glow he punched in from memory the channel of the local fox station and it was clear a live news report was being broadcast in the bottom lefthand corner was confirmation a small box alternately blinked the fox logotype and the phrase news now news you can use a white bar also ran diagonally over the left top corner of the image and it flashed red text reporting live at pm from old city as the red and blue emergency lights from the police vehicles flashed the news camera panned down the narrow treelined street on the red brick sidewalk were curious bystanderspayne noticed more than a few in halloween costumesheld back by a length of yellow crimescene tape paynes eyes went to the ticker of text scrolling across the bottom of the tv screen breaking news two men found bound and shot dead one is a yearold wanted on an outstanding bench warrant arrest warrant was for failure to appear in municipal court on two counts of intent to deliver a controlled substance the other dead man is a criminal defense lawyer about age both bodies dumped at lex talionis offices police withholding names pending notification of families of the deceased breaking news then the camera cut away from the shot of the sidewalk and the tv screen suddenly filled with an awkwardly tight shot it showed the jowly face of an almost bald man wearing a dark rumpled suit coat and a wrinkled white shirt with no necktie the emergency lights bathed him in pulses of red and blue oh hell matt said thats a bit more of good ole fiveeff than id care to see then in a jerky motion the camera lens pulled back amanda looked at the tv screen she recognized the man who now was shown headtotoe in front of a nice but old brick building he was in his midforties short and stout with a small defined gut he had a round face and wore perched at the end of his bulbous nose tiny round reading eyeglasses he stood addressing a small crowd of news media types reporters held microphones to the portly mans face almost touching his big nose as well as camera lenses both still and video fiveeff she repeated i thought frank fuller was foureff payne turned to her and smiled he said fucking frances franklin fuller the fifth that makes five three matt paynes family had known francis fullers as long as matt could remember they had many connections both social and professional and while payne did not actively dislike the man he had on more than one occasion called him fiveeff to his faceand that almost always had happened when fuller was being a pompous ass payne otherwise addressed fuller as francis knowing full well and purposely ignoring that fuller preferred the more masculine frank fuller boldly and shamelessly touted the fact that he traced his family lineageand what he called its puritanical waysback to benjamin franklin fuller fancied himself a devout franklinite mimicking his ancestor from his looks to his philosophical beliefs fuller regularly sprinkled his conversations with quotes from poor richards almanac and other ben franklin sources and like the multitalented franklin francis fuller was involved in all kinds of enterprises private and public payne somewhat begrudgingly admired fuller for having built on the wealth hed been born into because he himself had enjoyed being raised as he called it comfortablythough certainly not nearly on the level of the superwealthy fullersand hed seen many others piss away vast sums of money that they had done nothing to earn and he believed thus did not deserve fullers primary companyrichard saunders holdings which hed taken from the name franklin had used to write poor richards almanachad many entities there was keycom the fortune nationwide telecommunications corporation that hed built city by city by buying up local community cable television providers and keycargo importexports which was one of the largest leasers of warehouse space at the port of philadelphia which was easily visible from another of fullers holdingsthe hops haus towerwhich fell under his keyproperties with so much financial wealth came a great deal of influence and francis fuller had political connections from washington dc to harrisburg to phillys city hall and police department he was more or less happy to share with all both his wealth and his opinions though sometimes far more of the latter than the former and in terms of the latter fuller was a devout believer in the bibles an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and so francis fuller funded and personally promoted a nonprofit organization he called lex talionis from the latin phrase for the law of talion which more or less translated as an eye for an eyewhich of course was the meting out of punishments that matched the crimes the logotype of lex talionis had the o as a stylized eyeball the offices for lex talionis took up half of the first floor of a fivestory brick building on the treelined corner of north third and arch streets fuller said he felt the location on arch in the historic section of old city with the delaware river just blocks to the east and the liberty bell on display just blocks to the west was more appropriate than any shiny marbleandglass highrise office building francis franklin fuller vs belief in the fundamental philosophy of lex talionis was strong and unwavering and there was a good reason for it tragedy had struck him personally five years earlier his wife and their eightyearold daughter had been driving home in the early evening of a rainy saturday when she had accidentally exited just shy of the vine street expressway shed been aiming for my dearest could get lost in a closet fuller later lamented and that gps street map in the dash of her benz may as well have been a video game for all she knew how to operate it after getting off the expressway at spring garden street then driving east and crossing over the schuylkill expressway shed somehow maybe because the rain was disorienting made a wrong turn onto pennsylvania avenue shortly thereafter shed found herself in the north philadelphia west area driving down the darkened streets of struggling and failing neighborhoods what had happened next was a matter of great speculation it could have been because of the luxury convertible automobile she was driving or it could simply have been an unfortunate case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time according to two eyewitness statements as the mercedes waited for a traffic light to turn green two vehicles flew up to the intersection and squealed to a stop alongside the second car actually went up over the curb striking a garbage can and newspaper dispenser box knocking them over angry words were exchanged between the occupants of the two carsand suddenly a torrent of gunfire filled the air then the first vehicle ran the red light followed by the second both racing off into the night the fullers mercedesbenz did not move for a couple of minutes even as the traffic light cycled to green and back to red then the car began to roll into the intersection running the red traffic light and getting struck by an old pickup truck the truck did not kill them although it struck the mercedesbenz hard enough to trigger its air bags the medical examiners office determined that both mother and daughter had died when struck by multiple hits of singleaught buckshot from a shotgunor shotguns the windows of the mercedes and certainly the soft fabric of the convertible top were no match for the fusillade of lead balls the shooters were never caught despite the extreme pressure francis franklin fuller v placed on everyone from the police department to the offices of the mayor and the governor frustrated fuller shortly thereafter announced his new nonprofit organization that night i lost my wife my childmy family sadly it was a tragedy that could happen to anyone and those responsible for such harm must be brought to justice and held accountable to help the police and the justice system do exactly that today i have established lex talionis in honor of my wife and daughter and all other victims in the city of philadelphia he explained that he had funded the organization with an initial endowment of five million dollars from that he said lex talionis will reward ten thousand dollars cash to any individual who provides information that leads to the arrest conviction andor removal from free society of a criminal guilty of murder or attempted murder rape or other sexually deviant crime or illicit drug distribution in the city of philadelphia lex talionis will work with the philadelphia police department and our courts to protect the identities of those providing the information keeping them anonymous every week usually on fridays he ran an announcement restating that message in philadelphias newspapers and on its television stations you dont like fuller amanda law asked matt payne sometimes i do and sometimes not so much matt said turning up the volume here lets see what hes saying fullers voice filled the bedroom as my ancestor benjamin franklin wrote in the year of our lord where carcasses are eagles will gather and where good laws are much people flock thither and so tonight i am personally signing the paperwork for my organizationhe gestured grandly toward the castbronze signage listing all his companies that was embedded in the wall behind him to the line that read lex talionis llcto transfer two tenthousanddollar rewards into two separate escrow accounts at pnc bank these will be payable immediately upon the determination of who is properly responsible for the apprehension of these evildoers there was a smattering of loud applause in the background and the cameras panned to show the people who were clapping outside of the police crimescene tape matt said looks like francis has the support of batman andwhats that other character there thats the supervillainthe joker amanda looked at the screen and made a hmm sound i think that particular joker costume is supposed to be one of our distinguished city councilmen you can tell by his trademark black bow tie that looks like a tiny cheap clipon and by all those exaggerated dollarbill bribestheyre stuffing his pockets to the point of overflowing the handcuffs on his left wrist are a nice touch oh and theres a dollar symbol on his coat kind of like the riddler had those question marks payne recalled that the loud cries of corruption in city hall were back in the newsif theyd ever really left either way to bowtied city councilman h rapp badde jr a thirtytwoyearold native philadelphian who was alternately charismatic and arrogant it was simply politics as usual which also meant shenanigans as usual including the hiring of a twentyfiveyearold highly regarded colleague as his executive assistant and the use of funds from his election campaign for them to attend a conference on urban renewal in of all places bermuda as luck would have it someone happened to recognize the publicityhappy councilman during the trip and when a photograph appeared in the news media of the councilman and his tremendously attractive assistant on the beachwearing as one tv news wag said nothing that could be considered business attire unless they were employed in a strip club at seaworldcitizens of philadelphia were furious perhaps the least happy being baddes wife of seven years of course the councilman drawing on both his charisma and arrogance repeatedly stated that it was all being misinterpreted that the trip had cost the city not one red centhis excess campaign contributions covered it then he spun the subject to what he and his able assistant had learned on advancing urban renewal and how h rapp badde jr was going to change phillys fortunes the behavior stemmed from the same sort of abovereproach attitudefrom the hankypanky to the denyandspinthat hed learned from his father horatio r badde sr whod once held the office junior now so desperately desired that of mayor to matt and countless others in philadelphia the good news in all this was that there was a genuine firstclass person serving as hizzonor the honorable jerome h jerry carlucci was nononsense to the point that his detractorsand quite a few admirersclaimed he governed with an iron fist unapologetic carlucci fought the culture of corruption in city hall just as he had fought crime in the city before being elected to public office carlucci had risen through the ranks of the philadelphia police department and he bragged that hed held every rank but that of policewoman payne said or maybe more appropriately that dollar sign is also supposed to represent a scarlet letter for badde these days its easier finding a virgin in a whorehouse than an honest politician he grunted to himself an honest pol in or out of a whorehouse with or without a scarlet letter fuller could be heard speaking again and the camera cut back to him so to all you out there who commit crimes or you who are considering doing so i share with you further wisdom of benjamin franklin fear to do ill and you need fear nought else there was more applause fuller paused waved briefly to acknowledge it then looked back into the camera his face turned stern and he wagged the stubby fat index finger of his right hand as he went on dramatically evildoers know that you are being watched know that eventually you will be caughtwith all his right hands stubby fat fingers he gestured behind himself where the bodies had been dumped never taking his eyes off the cameraand know that you will be brought to justice by gods grace and by gods words as it says in exodus then you shall give life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth foot for foot lex talionis thank you there was more applause this time accompanied by whistles and cheers matt sighed evildoers jesus ive heard enough of that he said thumbing the mute button on the remote after a moment amanda said well i cant say i am opposed to what hes trying to accomplish matt looked at her with an eyebrow raised but baby people just cant take the law into their own hands and thats what hes basically encouraging she shrugged sorry i cant of course she cant damn sure not after what shes gone through he nodded thoughtfully and kissed her on the forehead the news camera now followed francis fuller as he walked inside the office building then it panned the cheering crowd and in the process captured some of the news media payne said hey theres mickey ohara hes working the story a younglooking philadelphia police department patrolman was going back under the yellow police tape next to ohara who matt noted was standing apart from the pack of reporters quickly scribbling on their pads ohara had a camera of some type hanging from his right shoulder by a thin black strap he held in both hands what looked like a cell phone and he was tapping it with both of his thumbs then payne felt his phone vibrate again and a new text message appeared in a box on its screen mickey ohara an old source just mentioned popndrops tell me what you know damn it and ill tell you what i do meet me at liberties old source my assit was that wetbehindtheears uniform the kids probably starstruck with mickey and thought hed show off how important he already is by sharing whats supposed to be kept quiet hell mickey will keep his mouth shut if i ask and if hes on the scene he probably has something good that i can use but amanda is going to be pissed if i leave now to go work he heard her sigh and when matt looked to her he saw that shed read the screen he began to apologize im no she interrupted its okay really it is i cant agree that bad guys should be off the streets and then expect you not to do your job he kissed her forehead again im sorry he said finishing the apology then payne texted liberties in back to ohara paynes phone vibrated once then again the first message was from ohara whod simply texted ok the second was from tony harris blocked number you just see f i bet jason is fit to be tied got time for a beer th my amanda said arent you the popular one at this hour should i be jealous payne thought what the hell may as well kill two birds with one stone and texted back liberties in she rolled over and began to slowly rub his belly matt looked at her and began speaking of killings you should go amanda finished his sentence no what i was going to say is i dont see the rush as she made another slow circle with her palm she asked what do you mean well as far as i can tell theres no reason to jump up and race anywhere mick can cool his heels with tony at liberties for ten minutes and even if i do get a call about those popanddropshe reached for his cell phone and pressed a button to turn it offwhich will now go directly into voice mail its my professional opinion that those guys who got popped will probably still be dead ten minutes from now amandas hand stopped matt looked deeply in her eyes just ten minutes she said her tone suggestive as he smiled and nodded she pursed her lips after a moment he felt her warm hand slide down his belly i know a ben franklin saying too she said yeah im afraid to ask something to do with moderation or saving for a rainy day orworseabstinence her warm palm moved smoothly and excitingly slowly until it was just below his belly button then a bit farther down he grunted appreciatively in anticipationuntil her fingers suddenly gripped him by the short hairs ouch he cried out a bit dramatically when she pulled them what was that for ben said love and be lovd four ridgewood street philadelphia saturday october pm mrs joelle bazelon long had lived with the dark fear deep in her big bones that such a terrible day would come the darkskinned sixtytwoyearold widowshe was of jamaican descent fivefooteight tall and after a decade of battling diabetes clinically obesehad prayed literally every night down on arthritic knees her bible before her on the bedspread that somehow she could figure out a way to run from it some way to pack up everything in time and move to a better place for her and sasha her justturnedeighteenyearold granddaughter but that hadnt happened and now standing at the kitchen sink on what so far had been a fairly pleasant halloween looking out the window as she finished drying and putting up the dinner dishes joelle bazelon suddenly realized that time had run out earlier in the evening shed heard the doorbell ring again and again the excited choruses of young children shouting trick or treat and seen sasha her beautiful slender fivefootseven teen rushing enthusiastically to the door with the large plastic bowl of candies then bending at the waist and complimenting each child on his or her costume as she put treats in their bags the sequence of sounds had repeated until about nine oclock when the kidseven the older ones a few in their middle teens who knew they really were too old to be trickortreatinghad stopped ringing the doorbell sasha had then told her grandmother that she was going down the street to hang out with keesha jones her friend since they were ten joelle was never completely comfortable with sasha being out at night especially late but she reminded herself that the child was now eighteen too old to be kept home and keesha lived just at the end of the block about the only thing that joelle could do was tell her to be safe and as an added precautionso that when sasha came home it would be easier and quicker to come inside the houseleave the heavy wroughtiron outer door unlocked and now from the sound of it sasha was coming home very quickly too quickly joelle heard the wooden front door fling open making a stunning thud as its heavy brass doorknob smacked an interior wall then she heard a clearly terrified sasha cry out grammy joelle got the chills and when she heard a familiar male voice call out trick or treatthe tone deeply threateningher knees buckled xavier smith she thought clinging to the lip of the sink to keep from falling to the linoleum floor ridgewood street was in the kingsessing area of southwest philadelphia joelle bazelon had lived there going on forty years graduating from south philly high then lasalle university with her teachers certificate and ultimately being assigned to anna h shaw middle school from which shed now retired as principal the school at warrington avenue was only a threeblock walk from her row house on ridgewood shed moved to the row house with her husband ray whom shed met at lasalle and later theyd reared their only daughter rachel there about the same time that joelle retired from teaching rachel then age eighteen had become pregnant with sasha the father a year older had stuck around for about half the length of time it had taken him to cause the actual moment of conception the bazelon housea modest thirteen hundred square feet totalbecame quite full that had lasted for only just shy of a year however ray and rachel had been driving up from delaware on interstate when their cars front left tire blew out causing the vehicle to roll over and strike a bridge support they were killed on impact among many things joelle was tough she had to be and as she had already reared one daughter and over the years taught countless other children she had no problem with the idea of bringing up sasha on her own yet over the years despite sasha proving to be both as sweet and as smart as her mother had been rearing a granddaughter hadnt been easy as any single parent knew the constant oneonone time with a child exhausted energy and emotion there had also been a money problemrays income went away shortly after his burial and joelles pension did not go as far as shed have liked then came her health issues including the diabetes and because of her excessive weight a heart condition which not only further sapped her strength but also drained the savings account to pay for doctors bills and medications and what put a painfully fine point on their problems was that southwest philadelphia simply was no longer the same place that joelle and ray had first moved to twenty years before to raise a family at first glance kingsessing appeared to be the same somewhat comfortable middleclass neighborhood most of the residents tried to keep the row homes tidy the small yards trimmed and free of trash but if one looked closely the signs of quiet despair were present practically all the residences had something not one of them had been built with burglar bars the heavy racks of black wrought iron had been added house by house over the last ten or twelve years some of the chainlink fences were even topped with razor wire there was a creeping blight on almost every block when houses burned downnot always by accidentthe owners took whatever money the insurance company paid out and got the hell out of town the city was stuck with the task of finishing off the destruction of the property which more times than not left a dirt lot littered with rubble a lot that oddly still had the fivetier set of concrete steps coming up from the sidewalk but leading to nowhere when that happened to the house next door to joelle bazelons she saw the writing on the wall she planted a for sale sign in the small tenfootsquare patch of grass that was her front yard joelle bazelon found that she was not the only one who saw that the neighborhood was going to hell in a handbasket three other row houses were on the market within just two blocks of her address they all offered essentially the same property give or take a bath or bedroom shed listed the property through a realtor setting the asking price at ninetynine thousand dollars and she never got a single offer when she asked the realtor why not joelle was told that the price on one of the other row houses for sale nearby was being reduced by five thousand dollars every two weeks worse it still wasnt getting any reasonable offers joelle bazelon had suddenly felt terribly trapped she now knew that shed seen the start of all this decline years before back when shed been principal of the middle school shed seen kids who were on the path to no goodand parents who didnt care and in the time since then shed seen plenty of punks from shaw from the neighborhood who had gone on to cause trouble in high school or worse in one of the disciplinary schools that served as their last stop in the school district of philadelphia the worst of the worst had gone straight to the temptations of the street and there drawn the realworld version of a monopoly game card go straight to jail do not pass go punks such as xavier xpress smith who got his nickname selling crystal methamphetamine and delivering it fast except they didnt always stay in jail iii one loft number hops haus tower n lee street philadelphia saturday october pm the irony was not lost on matt payne here at almost the stroke of midnight on all hallows eve he was headed for liberties bar to spend time talking about some goddamn bad guys who were stupid enough to get themselves murdered what a shitty way to spend a holiday even more to the point especially when my other option was staying in that wonderful bed with the goddess who all things considered would really rather have me there than here he felt his phone vibrate twice and when he looked at the screen there were two text messages the first from amandabe safe out there babyand the second from mickey oharawhere the hell are you he had a mental image of amanda walking luna on the leash out to the grassy area that the hops haus tower called the pet run matt had started calling it piss park which was the nicer of the two nicknames that had come to mind he was convinced that the towers fourlegged residents outnumbered the twolegged onesthe vast majority of the latter it appeared by both sight and smell choosing to ignore the pet runs garbage can roll of disposable plastic bags and sign reading please pick up after your pet as he texted see you soon sweetie back to amanda he was reminded again of the obituary shes always going to be concerned its sweet and its somewhat worrisomebecause what happens if she doesnt get over that then again what the hell happens if shes right he texted a reply to ohara mins out order me a macallan if nothing else right now payne did find himself enjoying the energy of those celebrating halloween the infectious laughter and vibrant music coming out of the bars along second street could be heard damn near all the way back to amandas place most everyone hed seen up and down the sidewalks pub crawling was having one helluva halloween in the elevator and the lobby of the hops haus tower payne had come across quite a few twenty and thirtysomethings in halloween costumes some of which were quite interestingif not totally wild such as the one worn by the cute wellbuilt blonde in her early thirties who was having difficulty opening one of the big glass doors at the lobbys main entrance she was dressed as little bo peep but her scant frilly whiteandbabyblue outfit the ruffled skirt cut high and the pushup top cut low was anything but grated the costume gave the character a whole new meaning especially when she kept bending over to pick up her sheepherders staff and the outfit revealed far more than an eyeful of lovely flesh bo peep indeed payne thought with a grin then as he walked down second street toward liberties payne had also gotten a chuckle when he saw two guys more or less staggering out of a bar wearing tshirts that while not technically halloween costumes were appropriately darkhumored one tshirt had a representation of the liberty bell with the words come to philadelphia for the crack the other showed a white chalk outline of a human and the words a friend will help you move but a good friend will help you move the body either of which payne thought would be appropriate to wear into liberties for tonights discussion on popanddrops with tony harris and mickey ohara it certainly would not be the first time such topics had been broached in liberties the bar was the unofficial preferred watering hole of the homicide division as well as cops from other divisions whod discovered the comfortable old neighborhood bar that served stiff drinks and great food andsome would argueoccasionally more than a little gruff attitude the place has real character payne then idly wondered how much longer such older establishments would survive because there was no doubt that this section of the city thanks to the new hops haus complex and its fancy new neighbor the schmidts brewery development was seeing its real estate prices pushed up and that in turn was forcing out the longtime residents who couldnt afford to live there anymore everybody from older retirees to young bohemian artists the more expensive properties that attracted young professionals were replacing the lowrent row houses and abandoned industrial areas and the newcomers generated new jobs for others and money spent meant money taxed which translated to more revenue to fill the citys coffers such is the rejuvenation of philadelphia and lord knows so much of it needs renovation too many parts are a living hell that gave some hope to a lot of peopleincluding mattwho feared that philly with all its crime corruption and broken infrastructure was circling the goddamned drain payne knew that supporting the gentrification was one of the reasons amanda law bought a place in hops haus tower rather than one in center city where payne had his small apartment she liked the idea of renewal and rebuilding the location wasnt any closer to her workthe difference would have been only minutesbut she believed that it was a vibrant place where for too long there had been little more than misery and the fact that philadelphiathe city matt loved but knew so many others loved to hatehad been allowed to reach such depressing depths was something that frustrated him how in hell does the city thats the birthplace of the most important law of our landthe united states constitutionbecome one of our nations most lawless and one of our nations most fucked up how does that get fixed how do we get back that honor and pride he shook his head could the answer be found here two major speculators one who built hops the other who developed schmidts had both denied for nearly a decade that they were at all interested in a lost cause like northern liberties but once one of the speculators had quietly pieced together enough property to begin a development the renovation had begun on the schmidts brewery building then like a phoenix rising above the ashes of phillys northern liberties additional twostory buildings went up filled with expensive apartments stores restaurants and of course office space then when that development had proved a success the owner of the hops brewery site began his renovation project and soon the twentyonefloor hops haus tower also had risen well above schmidts people want to save this city want to preserve its history and theres damn sure plenty of it all over philly but throwing all kinds of money at a problem is no guarantee of successjust look at center city phillys shining star of all places it has parts that still look like ghetto maybe this place is past the point of saving two ridgewood street philadelphia saturday october pm at the kitchen sink joelle bazelon struggled to regain the strength in her knees then moved as quickly as her legs and weight allowed she came out of the kitchen and headed toward the sounds of scuffling at the front of the house when she entered the living room she came almost facetoface with xavier xpress smith his left hand gripped sashas right arm he had a snubnosed chromeplatedcaliber revolver in his right hand this was not joelles first encounter with smith hed grown up one block over on pentridge street a twentyfouryearold black male with a short temper he had a hard mean face and wore baggy denim pants that hung so low that half of his brown boxer shorts were visible a tshirt a zipperfront hoodie and a new york mets ballcap the brim worn sideways over his right ear in which a diamond stud twinkled sasha cried i didnt see him hiding in the dark by the porch grammy shut up bitch smith shouted at her as shed done with so many students over so many years joelle carefully studied the punk though he had a pistol and was waving it he wasnt directly aiming it at anyone she saw that his eyes were bloodshot his movements jerky and hyperactive hes on something she thought you will not speak to my granddaughter in that manner joelle said in her crisp english accent as calmly and authoritatively as she could she felt as if her rapidly beating heart was about to burst through her chest smith tried to stare her down i told you this would happen he then shouted i warned you dont talk with nobody you old bitch you been fucking with me all my life what joelle bazelon had done the previous week was more or less the same thing shed done ten years earlier when shed seen xavier smith then fourteen years old beating up younger boys as they walked to shaw middle school after the first shakedown shed telephoned his house to speak with his parents but xaviers motheralso joelle then learned a single parenthad told her that she should mind her own business that she could take care of her own boy then when joelle had seen xavier shake down another boy the very next week taking his money and wristwatch shed called the cops shed told the cops that she was saddened to see such bad behavior but it could not be tolerated and shed still felt the same way four days ago when shed again called the cops the city of philadelphia was divided into twentysix patrol districts twentyfive numbered ones plus center city the corporal who answered the phone at the police departments twelfth district down on woodland avenue at sixtyfifth dispatched a pair of patrol officers to respond to the house of the complainant one mrs joelle bazelon at ridgewood street joelle had been waiting in the wooden rocking chair on the front porch when the chevrolet impala squad car pulled up to her curb she repeated to the uniformed patrol officers what shed witnessed that when shed been in the alleyway putting out trash that afternoon shed seen xavier sneaking out the back of the neighbors house two doors down hed been carrying the new flatscreen television that she knew the neighbor had just bought when xavier had realized shed seen him hed shouted at her mind your own business bitch or there be trouble the cops asked a few questions wrote down her statement had her read and sign it and then told her that theyd be in touch if they needed anything else and that was the last shed heard about the episode that was until tonight when xavier smith angry and hopped up on some drug burst into her house i seen that police car here he said next i knowed i was picked up then he made an odd smile showing his bad teeth but i got me a good lawyer he looked at sasha and leered at her backside your girl got herself one fine booty sasha glared at him he noticed the bulge in the back pocket of her tight jeans give me that cell phone he said and when she didnt move he worked it out of her pocket and put it in his front pocket xavier please let go of my granddaughter joelle said as evenly and sternly as she could then please leave if you dont he suddenly laughed out loud interrupting her leave old woman you telling me to leave you crazy i aint leaving till i show you what happens when you call the police on me that cost me money had to pay my lawyer and bail i dont like losing money joelle started to move toward the couch and to the white telephone with the long cord there im going to call you not calling nobody he said he waved with the pistol in the direction of the couch sit there you old bitch xavier he suddenly shook his head violently as if trying to clear it then shouted dont you be trying to talk me down he let go of sashas arm then waved the pistol muzzle at the elderly woman as he walked over to her he then pushed her so hard that she fell onto the couch as she lay there struggling to sit up he grabbed the telephone from the side table he took up the slack in its cord and yanked hard snapping it free of the wall plug he then went back to joelle and pushed her back down on the cushions after tucking the snubnosed revolver in the hoodies belly pocket he grabbed joelles wrists and started wrapping them with the cord she resisted pulling apart her wrists after a moment and undoing his work he grabbed the pistol from the pocket and raised it above his head as if he was about to hit her dont make me do it he said almost in a growl then put the pistol back in his pocket and rewrapped her wrists then tied her ankles the white vinylcoated cord pressed deeply into her loose black flesh he looked down at her and said now im gonna show you what its like when you got something to lose too he walked back over to sasha who was visibly shaking he aimed the pistol at her chest get to your knees whore joelle who suddenly started to hyperventilate cried out xavier please dont hurt her shes all i have left sasha started sobbing do it smith said pointing to the ground sasha suddenly shook her head in defiance smith hauled back his left hand then swung forward slapping her with an open palm with such force that it knocked her off her feet as she started to get up trembling he grabbed her by the hair yanking her around till she was on her knees facing his crotch go on whore you know what to do with it no please she said starting to sob deeply no joelle could be heard taking faster breaths shorter ones smith looked down at sasha do it she shook her head again closing her eyes at the anticipation of being slapped again he didnt hit her but instead touched the muzzle of the revolver to her head and slowly thumbed back the hammer as he did so the cylinder rotated the metallic clickclick sounds made her open her eyes wide when hed finished sasha began to sob softly xavier xpress smith still with his left fist gripping her hair and his right hand holding the pistol to her head then terrified the beautiful teenager one last time bangbang bitch he said as he smiled and squeezed the trigger sasha screamed at the sound of the hammer falling forward but there was no bang there was just silenceand a great gasping from the couch then nothing smith laughed as he and sasha looked over to the couch the old woman had either fainted or was pretending to sleep next time old woman there be a bullet in there he called to her his left hand let loose of sashas hair he patted her head that was good girl real good i just might make you my steady bitch sasha got to her feet and bolted over to the couch grammy she cried as she reached her there was no response sasha shook her but still nothing she put her cheek to her grandmothers nose and mouth looking for an exhaled breath then desperately touched the inside of her wrists and all along her neck at the jawbone hoping to find a pulse however weak shes dead sasha wailed oh grammy xavier xpress smith ran over to the couch and felt the wrist and neck of the old woman sasha balled her fists and started hitting xavier smith on the back and arms dont touch grammy you bastard he stood up and nervously aimed the pistol at sasha listen bitch dont you say a word i was here you hear me she stared at him a mixture of deep sadness and hatred in her eyes he moved quickly toward the front door and said dont you forget i can come here anytime i want or find you anywhere anytime then xavier xpress smith lived up to his nickname and fled into the dark of night three n second street philadelphia saturday october pm tonys and mickeys cars harriss cityissued battered unmarked gray ford crown victoria police interceptor and oharas new black bmw m sedan were parked in front of liberties bar inside matt payne saw that the place was not as packed as hed expected along the left wall were wooden tables with booths a couple were filled but most looked like theyd recently been vacated they were still covered with empty and unfinished drinking glasses same was true in the middle of the room where there were more wooden tables and chairs the busboy was working busily and would be for some time matt noticed some motion across the room and looked to the centuryold ornately carved oak bar it ran from the front window almost back to the wooden stairway leading to secondfloor seating the bar was threequarters full and at its right end nearest the front window that looked out onto the street stood michael j mickey ohara the irishman exuded an infectious energy and now used that to enthusiastically wave his right hand high above his very curly red hair standing next to him wearing his usual wellworn blue blazer and gray slacks was tony harris hed noticed mickeys manic wave and looked over his shoulder when tony saw matt he shuffled to the left making a place for him at the bar his move gave matt a clear view of mickeymore specifically of what he wore under his tweed jacket a green tshirt that had a fourleaf clover and read kiss me im irish as payne approached ohara said what the hell took you so long discretion being the better part of valor i believe ill dodge that one i had to walk her dog matt said oh ohara smiled as he motioned suggestively with his right hand the middle finger rubbing the top of the index finger he said is that what theyre calling it these days harris chuckled screw you mickey payne said but he smiled he changed the subject nice shirt but wrong holiday its the closest to a costume ive got mickey said but dont be so damned sure of yourself matty what do you mean payne asked tony harris had a bottle of hops haus lager beer to his lips about to sip when he nodded and said hes already gotten six kisses including two long ones from an incredibly cute quote angel unquote in all white she rubbed mickeys head and said he was her lucky charm matt laughed and the bartender walked up and slid two glasses on the bar before him one with ice cubes in a clear liquid and one with just a dark liquid both halffilled first round tonights on me said the bartender john sullivana hefty fortyyearold secondgeneration irishamerican with an ample belly friendly bright eyes and a full white beard happy halloween matt i guess i shouldve said trick or treat to earn my singlemalt huh payne replied reaching for the glass that he knew held the ice water he poured it into the glass that contained the dark brown liquor mixing it fiftyfifty thanks john the bartender grinned as payne held up his drink and said cheers gents clinked the glasses and bottle of john the bartender tony and mickey then took a healthy sip he turned to looked at harris so tell me what the hell that was all about tonight in old city harris glanced at mickey ohara you want to start ohara gestured grandly after you harris shrugged then nodded and said all off the record right ohara sighed you know youll see what i put together before i post it online from the look on tony harriss face it was evident that he was genuinely embarrassed for the slip of tongue sorry mickey old habits and all four as a rule cops didnt much like reporters and accordingly didnt share with them more than they absolutely had toand a good deal of the time not even that those who made up the thin blue line were a guarded group outsiders simply didnt understand what it was that they did what their brotherhood meant and apparently no amount of education changed that you either were a copand understoodor you werent mickey ohara wasnt a cop i couldnt get on with the police department he joked with his cop friends because i knew both of my parents and knew that they were married butas invariably rules had exceptionsohara did indeed understand he had long ago earned the respectand in cases like matt payne the friendshipof many on the police department including more than a few of the white shirts some of whom even wore stars on their uniforms it was said of mickey ohara that he knew more people on the police force than most of the cops did themselves and certainly more cops recognized him than could identify in a crowd the top cop himself police commissioner ralph j mariana oharas history with the police was almost but not quite as long as his history with the bulletin hed begun with a paper route at age twelve throwing the afternoon edition from his bike at the stoops of west philadelphia row houses every day after school for four years by the time he turned sixteen a series of events had served to dramatically change his career in newspapers the series was triggered by his being expelled from west catholic high school monsignor dooley had made it clear that gambling would not be tolerated when he found out that the ohara boy had illegal numbers slips that could be traced back to francesco frankie the gut guttermo and that mickey would not rat out his coconspiratorno matter how immoral the monsignor declared it all to bethe monsignor said that left him with no choice but to throw mickey out of school before being caught by the monsignor and being shown the door mickey had heard that the bulletin had a copyboy position open hed never had the time to pursue ituntil now and now he really wanted it because it offered far more money than throwing papers from a bike and it was indoor work so no more riding in the rain or racing away from the snapping maws of those goddamn rabid street dogs mickey actually got the position but with a ninetyday probation period he took his new job seriously probation or not and that did not go unnoticed after his probation period expired he came to be mentored by the inkstained assistant city desk editor who dumped on mickey more and more of the research assignmentsdrudge work that no one else wanted to do before mickey knew it the research he was turning in was becoming actual articles albeit short ones printed under the credit staff roundup then late one friday afternoonhe clearly remembered it as if it had happened yesterday not nearly two decades earlierhed been summoned to the managing editors office the office had a huge glass window overlooking the entire newsroom and as mickey approached he saw that the managing editor was looking at a copy of that afternoons front page the assistant city desk editor was in there too looking his usual deeply introspective self mickey ohara days shy of turning eighteen was convinced that this was the end of his newspaper days clearly his mentor had been caught abusing his official duties by helping develop the questionable skills of a lowly copyboy and now said copyboy was about to lose his job and be sent back to the streets ohara figured that if he was lucky they might let him pedal around town slinging papers at stoops again but of course that had not happened after an initial awkward exchange of pleasantries the managing editor had tossed the afternoon paper that he was holding to mickey mickey had glanced at it recognized the headline hed written then under that seen his namehis byline there on the front page as mickey ohara speechless looked between the two men the managing editor said congratulations mickey nice work this is usually the part of the interview process when i ask when can you start but it would appear that you already have ohara rose rapidly in the hierarchy of the bulletin city room eventually writing follow the money the hardhitting series of articles on graft and gross incompetence in the citys child protective services it was the series that won him a pulitzer prize for public service ohara had thought that he was on top of the world particularly considering how far hed come from the day monsignor dooley had shown him the door he was being paid hed thought damned decently for something he enjoyed doing and he believed the stories that helped better the lot of kids trapped in the hell that was cps was alone worth it all but then his childhood buddy casimir bolinski showed up in town and told him he was a fool his exact words face it mickey those bastards are screwing you those bastards being the bulletins management ohara was told that they were not paying him his due mickey listened to his buddy especially when bolinski offered to represent him as a small token of appreciationi can never adequately repay youfor taking the fall at west catholic high if youd ratted me out to dooley the drooler as your fellow numbers runner casimir said id have been out on my ass too thered have been no the bull bolinski no allamerican trophy no scholarship to notre dame no career with the green bay packers and without the cushion from the packers both the pay and offseason time id probably never have considered law school and certainly not become a sports agent after retirement and as an agent the bull proved every bit as effective off the field as hed been on it players liked the bull personally but the athletes really liked what he could do for them financially and the bull wound up making more money by repping the sports worlds top playersfootball basketball golf et ceterathan he had earned actually playing the game negotiating mickey oharas new contract with the bulletin had been no challenge compared to the highpressure worlds of sports and product endorsements and as happy as ohara had been with his new benefitsfrom more pay and holiday time to a new lease car every yearthe bull showed his brilliance by including an exit clause in the contract it was brilliant because the bulletin signed off on it and because everyone believed mickey happy with the contract terms would write for the paper forever everyone including mickey but then came the newsroom brawl in which mickey punched the city editor roscoe g kennedy was no great fan of oharathough he did grudgingly admit that mickey could be a helluva writer despite not having attended the glorified university of missouri school of journalism as kennedy had and there was no question that kennedy resented the money and perks that the unschooled ohara enjoyed thanks to his buddy the bull squeezing the newspaper management kennedy thought that mickey ohara had become a prima donna in his expensively furnished office someone who had the audacity to demand more space in the newspaper for his articles and photographs than the bossjschool grad kennedyfelt he deserved ohara whod been at the italian restaurant la famiglia the night that matt payne put down the two robbers whod beaten up a couple in the parking lot had written a long article for page a hed also delivered the photograph hed taken of payne in his tuxedo standing over one robber lying on the ground payne had his cell phone in his left hand and his colt officers model in his right what had set mickey ohara offand it happened in the presence of the bull and his wife antoinette bolinskiwas kennedy wanting to put a smartass headline on the photograph main line wyatt earp bad guys o in shootout at the la famiglia corral kennedy justified it by saying that payne looked like a goddamn gunslinger who obviously liked shooting people ohara put up his dukes then dodged kennedys swinging fists putting him down with a left punch to the nose followed by a right jab to the abdomen casimir j bolinski esq then grabbed his client andwith kennedy disparaging ohara before the entire newsroom staff then declaring him fireddragged him out of the city room never to return the bull that day pulled out oharas contractthe signatures barely dryand easily negotiated with the bulletin management a thirtyday coolingoff period with pay for mickey plus public apologies from kennedy for the city editors treatment of a pulitzer prize winner before newsroom colleagues ohara decided to use his downtime to research a book on fort festunga despicable shit from philly who had been found guilty of murdering his girlfriend and stuffing her body in a steamer trunk where shed been found mummified mickey convinced matt to accompany him to france in hopes of finding the fugitiveif only for a current photograph for the book and toward the end of their time in france they finally tracked down the arrogant festung longhaired and goateed living comfortably on wine and cheese with a new girlfriend in a french village mickey got his photographand it was of philadelphia police department sergeant matthew m payne collaring the fugitive and only weeks after their return to philadelphia casimir j bolinski esq ever diligent in delivering for his clients presented michael j ohara with the contract for his new position as chief executive officer and publisher of crimefreephillycom mickey after signing the contract in midseptember called matts cell and told matt to meet him at liberties bar for some good news as ohara slid in the booth across the table from payne he said you may kiss my ring matty as im now a tripledipper say congrats mick matt looked at the blue tshirt mickey wore in white it bore a representation of a pair of dangling handcuffs and lettering that read make his day kiss a cop at crimefreephillycom okay congrats but what the hell is a tripledipper and what the hells up with that shirt mickeys animated face lit up and he said two weeks ago the bull told the bulletins management that his clientmewas unhappy with the tepid apology et cetera of their city editor and that at the expiration of the thirtyday coolingoff period i planned immediately to execute the exit clause of my employment contract that happened the following day and triggered a lump payment equal to a months pay for every year that id been employed by the newspaper dating back to when i threw the rag from my bike in west philly so thats one deep dip into the moneymaking machine and i just got the check less the bulls five percent commission for the publishers acceptance of my book on fort festung that check makes for a doubledip and the third he pointed to his shirt and said im now running crimefreephilly i have a fiveyear contract renewable annually which means every year i know if i have another five to go if i ever get canned i walk with the equivalent of four years pay and i have stock options that vest if certain goals are accomplished which gives me both incentive and a nice nest egg on top of what i walked away with from the bulletin thus making me a tripledipper impressive but arent you going to miss newspapers mickey shook his head hell no matty forget that havent you been paying attention newspapers are deader than a doublecrossing gangbanger in south philly just like the tv nightly news killed afternoon papers theres this thing now called the world wide web thats killing all newspapers you really should try to keep up payne flashed him the middle finger of his right hand then changed to his index finger and pointed at the tshirt ive heard about that but never looked it up you should heres the deal its basically brand new it was originally quietly funded by a philanthropist a good citizen whos simply fed up with philly sinking in a cesspool of crime the idea is pretty damned simple support the good guys and get rid of the bad guys maybe too simple mick theres already a lot of money being thrown at crime and speaking of a lot of money i didnt think newsy websites made money most dont most are losing money but profit isnt the point cleaning up the city is people are fucking fed up amen to that payne interrupted count me among the disenchanted mick went on and when the bull heard about it he put money in a number of his clients did too some of them guys who broke out of the ghetto and want to help those still stuck there even though crimefreephillydotcom doesnt have to make money i think it will theres also the sweetheart deal it has with keycom the cabletvslashinternetslashphone conglomerate based here thats fiveeffs which means francis fulton is your secret moneyman ohara shrugged some questions dont need to be asked all i know is i have both the funding and the moral backing of some heavy hitters to help this city no pun intended concerning the bulls clients he paused then his infectious energy kicked in get this matty i can run live breaking news on crimefreephilly and then keycoms massive computer servers send itfor freeout to any tv computer and even better to any cell phone worldwide i could never do anything like that at the bulletin where i fought for inches of copy anyway with criminals infesting every city we plan eventually to roll out a crimefreedotcom everywherecrimefreenyc crimefreela et cetera et cetera all overseen by yours truly why would i ever work at a newspaper again payne nodded then said you think itll make a difference im beginning to think it might be time to get off this sinking ship of a city ohara grinned widely oh yeah matty its already working people love those copsandrobbers tv shows you know like most wanted in america homicide were taking that a stepstepsfurther were a onestop shop for fans of those kinds of shows plus have news articles on crime and crime prevention and profiles of the bad guys we list whos offering rewards for which criminals and for how much and show how to search databases for criminals and submit tips on where they might benew ones old ones fugitives like violators of megans lawand on and on megans law was the catchall name for any number of federal and state statutes concerning sexual predators it was named after a sevenyearold new jersey girl who had been abducted by a neighbor right after the pervert had gotten out of the slam where hed been serving time for sex crimes he raped and killed the little girl outraged citizens demanded that they had the right to know when dangerous people moved into their neighborhoods leading to the passage of sex offender registry laws first in jersey then across the nation payne said arent you worried that thats essentially encouraging people to take the law into their own hands like fullers lex talionis is doing not that im surprised considering your secret benefactor uhuh mickey quickly said shaking his head vigorously making the red curls bounce like tiny coiled springs in that area were simply a clearinghouse of sorts for a lot of things that are already available all over on the internet the key to any good source of information matt is making it easy on the person looking for that information whether its where to get the cheapest ground sirloin or how to finger a bad guy you ever hear of a company called google yeah the eighthundredpound gorilla of internet search engines payne said i take your point im just not convinced hell matt the fbi has a page devoted to a wanted poster for that raghead whatshisname the terrorist with a twentyfivemilliondollar price tag for his head and all sorts of bounties for lesser criminal shits how the hell is that any different if we add it to our website after a moment matt nodded okay youre convincing me mickey went on and were also a place to give attaboy accolades to cops who otherwise dont get noticed like a patrolman walking the beat in your neighborhood who unlocks your car after youve left your keys in it he pointed to his shirt kiss a cop now that sounds like a stretch aw cmon matty you ever read a positive piece on a cop everyone likes a pat on the back now and then well youre absolutely right about that rare is the day you ever hear anything good about cops doing their job just mention the name wyatt earp of the main line he smiled sounds like were on the same side of this fight mick just different teams exactly iv one standing at the bar at liberties harris looked from mickey to matt took a sip of beer then said you remember danny gartner matt payne his glass to his lips raised his eyebrows in surprise really the shittiest lawyer in all the commonwealth of pennsylvania as they call him in the das office never could forget a prick like that cant count the times in court during questioning that he tried to make me look stupid or crooked so hes the one who got dumped at francis fullers door harris nodded and said gartner and one of his loser clients a cocky little shit by the name of john nguyen aka jaycee johnny cannabis age twentyfive and mean as hell then he mimed that his right hand was a pistol he put the tip of the index finger in the base of his skull and moving his thumb forward dropped the hammer and mouthed bang he said apparently a fairly bigbore weapon really made a mess of their skulls i think im about to cry payne said more than a little sarcastically then sipped at his singlemalt he feigned wiping at a tear under his eye and went on nope guess i was wrong ohara chuckled payne smiled he said to harris should i know the punk client too only if you were in on any of his dozen drug busts for possession with intent to distribute just two of which ever went to trialboth for running roofies and other daterape drugsbecause gartner kept playing the threestrikes game there was also a sexual assault charge that got tossed because of a broken chain of evidence three strikes eh ohara said that has to be one of the worst rules ever whatever happened to the notion of a speedy trial as opposed to a speedy dismissal clearing out cases so there could be speedy trials was precisely why at least in theory the municipal court had invoked rule in the criminal court procedures despite the shared name phillys threestrikes law had nothing to do with laws across the land which declared that if someone racked up three felony convictions he or she was clearly a habitual criminal who hadnt learned a damn thing the first two times in the court systemand accordingly deserved a long sentence that essentially locked them up and threw away the key phillys three strikes in fact could be argued to have the polar opposite effect of those laws rule actually put criminals back on the streets when someone was arrested they came before the court for a preliminary hearing but due to any number of reasonsbusy work or school schedules miscommunications even having second thoughts about testifying against a known thugnot all the victims or witnesses would show up for a hearing and if they were not there in court at the scheduled time then the prosecutors had to inform the judge that they were not prepared and that they had to request a rescheduling of the preliminary hearing an occasional request for rescheduling might be manageable for the court system but with the understaffed das office overwhelmed with cases the constant juggling of hearing dates made court scheduling chaotic if not impossible in response the judges came up with rule it allowed prosecutors only three attempts at a preliminary hearing if on the third hearing date the victims or witnesses still had not made it before the court the judge slammed his gavel and announced on grounds of no evidence case dismissed and the accused walked criminal defense lawyers were not held to such a standard and the manner in which danny gartner and others of his ilk abused the system was equal parts clever and slimy one type of abuse was for the defense attorney to ask his client on the day of a hearing if he or she saw anyone waiting in the courtroom who could be called as a witness against them if they did the defense attorney told the accused to scram when the judge called the case the defense attorney came up with an excuseyour honor my client could not get free from his job and didnt have bus fare were popularand promised the court that the client would absolutely make a later court appearanceeven if i have to fry those mcburgers myself your honor then chauffeur him here the lawyer would request a delay that wasnt strike one two or three for the prosecutor but it damn sure was an inconvenience for the prosecution and especially for the victims and witnesses who unlike the judges and lawyers and cops were not paid for their time in the judicial system accordingly they genuinely might not be able to get another day free from their job or school duties and would end up a noshow and then their absence did trigger a strike against the prosecution another type of abuse was for the accused or an associate of the accused to intimidate the victims or witnesses back in the hood so that they simply gave up on pressing the case altogether the messagesnitches are not toleratedwas not lost on anyone in the ghetto it didnt matter that such an act was illegal it still effectively caused a case to go nowhereand the accused to go free and thus rule made the das job of bringing cases to trial more difficultif not damn near impossible now mickey said where were we on the popanddrops tony was describing how they found gartner and his punk pal harris nodded then said well both of the victims were bound they had their wrists and ankles taped with packing tape you know its clear and maybe three inches wide designed for those handheld dispensers yeah ohara said ive got one i just use the rolls by themselves because every time i tried with the dispenser that jagged row of teeth always wound up slicing my hand or arm payne snorted ive had that happen anyway harris went on it appears that the doer also used the tape without the dispenser through the clear tape you actually could see dirty fingerprints that were picked up on the adhesive side the doer didnt wear gloves payne said harris shrugged unless the doer made either gartner and jaycee bind the other or made someone else whatever the sequence whoever did it left prints we will just have to see if they match those of the deceased or whatever prints they can lift at gartners office he stopped and gestured upward with his left index finger speaking of which he paused and finished off his hops haus lager then signaled the bartender for another round of drinks for all three of them speaking of which harris went on when we idd gartner at the scenehis wallet including drivers license and sixtyfour bucks cash was still in his hip pocketwe sent crime scene units over to gartners apartment and to his office the apartment manager didnt seem particularly upset with his demise except for the fact he owed three months back rent anyway the manager let us in there was no apparent sign of anything having happened in the apartment and the office payne asked where is it over on callowhill not far from the ice office really payne said mentally picturing the building that housed the local office of immigration and customs enforcement the federal agency that was under the us department of homeland security was gartner into immigration law too i doubt it i dont think he was that smart you know those guys can be real lowlifes ohara put in some poor immigrant wanting to do the right thing and become a legal citizen of the united states willingly goes through all the hoops including hiring an immigration attorney to help him understand all the legalese the immigrant gives the lawyer his fivegrand cash retainer then the lawyer doesnt do shit and the poor immigrant who probably drove a cab to hell and back to earn that five large and now is even poorer winds up deported and the lawyer keeps the retainer never again to see the client for whom hes done nothing payne shook his head nice mickey looked furious if i ever find a way to put stuff like that on crimefreephilly those guys are toast too john sullivan delivered their drinks and after theyd all had a sip harris continued gartners office was a mess but it appeared to be just a normal office mess there was no sign of a struggle there and no forced entry curiously both the front and back main exterior doors of the building had been left unlocked as had the interior door to gartners office we found drugs on one of the desks what looked like coke or crank in one ziptop bag and another bag with roofies there was even a line of powder on the desktop that hadnt been snorted thats strange payne said like someone had to leave fast but no signs that either he or his punk client was popped there harris shrugged the csu boys were still working it when i stopped by on the way here but for now it appears the answer is no and jaycees motorcycle was parked on the sidewalk he paused sipped his beer then said something did happen there thoughsomething really weird he looked between matt and mickey whose curiosity clearly was piqued after a moment they said in unison what piss piss they repeated in unison harris nodded there was piss everywhere he said and i mean everywhere youd think gallons animal urine like some dog got loose in there payne asked you said the doors were unlocked maybe theyd been open too i dont know maybe judging by the amount though something bigger i mean who has that large of a bladder mickey glanced over at a couple at the bar in a twopart cow costume cows he offered then he looked back at harris and said or maybe the doer is a deer hunter once when i was up in bucks county i found a place where they were selling bottles of animal pissi think it was doe urinethat hunters poured on themselves to mask their human scent in the woods or maybe it was meant as an attractant to draw out horny males or something payne looked at ohara raised his eyebrows and said so youre thinking that fucking bambi is the doer ohara and harris laughed payne then looked at harris and said im assuming theres enough piss to run a dna analysis harris snorted enough to float a boat there was a pool of piss in the plastic bag alone the dope that hadnt dissolved just floated in it was there piss at the scene at francis fullers office in old city harris nodded yeah on jaycees pants crotch but that was more like hed just pissed himself nothing like the pools of it in the office anything else out of the ordinary define out of the ordinary sergeant payne they all chuckled harris looking deep in thought then said not really gartner was wearing a tshirt that read peace love justice payne snorted file that under irony detective not extraordinary harris shrugged after a minute he added well the only other thing that comes to mind is that there wasnt any paperwork attached really payne said visibly surprised now thats out of the ordinaryoutside the mo of the other popanddrops that is paperwork ohara asked looking from matt to tony like police forms then he looked at payne wait ohara said back up explain that outside the others modus operandi oddity thing what method of operation payne took a sip of his singlemalt then said the mo in the other cases is that someones shooting fugitives in the head or chest and dumping their bodies further the dead guysand theyre only guys so farare wanted on outstanding warrants a couple of them jumped bail the others violated parole for sex crimes against women and children involuntary deviant sexual intercourse rape aggravated indecent assault these shits get popped pointblank then dumped at a district station one we assume is closest to where they got nabbed none dumped at the roundhouse none at least not yet thatd be an interesting situation ohara nodded as he took all that in now the difference between those dumped at the districts and these two tonight is that tonight there was no paperworkprintouts of the bad guys wanted info downloaded from the internet all the others had their paperwork stapled to them stapled like to their clothes payne nodded usually but one bastard whod raped a tenyearold girl had his sheet stapled clean through his prick multiple times ouch ohara said instinctively crossing his legs payne then said you know its funny because your website is one place from where more than one of the wanted posters has been downloaded you can tell because the line at the foot of the page shows the date the page was printed and its source url thats great to know ohara said that means that crimefreephilly is working only payne said dryly to create more crime it would appear as far as i know as much as a miserable dirty rotten shit danny gartner was he had no criminal record ohara shrugged chalk it up to collateral damage you associate with swine youre going to get muddy too jaycee harris put in had charges against him of involuntary deviant sexual intercourse and rape of an unconscious or unaware person in one case that gartner got tossed payne nodded then took a swallow of his singlemalt and glanced at his watch i need to get the hell out of here im trying to have a life outside of work he said then looked at ohara okay mick thats all we know at this point now tell me what you know ohara raised his glass not a goddamn thing matty thats why youre called the confidential source close to the roundhouse and im called the reporter ohara took a sip of his drink as payne gave him the finger sorry pal i really wish i had something for you you know that eventually i will and when i do its yours they all then stared into their glasses quietly thinking after some time ohara suddenly said so matty what do you think are the chances of solving this seriously ohara nodded seriously hell i dont know right now id say that the odds are about as high as the number of rs in fat fucking chance zilch which is maybe slightly better than say finding all those fifty thousand fugitives harris said hey you got fort festung he was in the wind whoopie one down another fortynine thousand nineninetynine give or take to go and dont forget that he took almost twenty years tony harriss cell phone then chimed once and vibrated he pulled it from the plastic cradle on his belt and glanced at the lcd screen its jenkins he said as his thumb worked the bbsize polymer ball to navigate the phones screen he rolled and clicked to where the text messages were stored hes working the wheel the homicide unit had a system called the wheel basically a roster that listed the detectives on the shift at the top of the roster was the detective currently assigned to man the desk when a call came in with a new murder the desk man got assigned to the case the detective listed below him on the rosterwho was said to be next up on the wheelthen became the next desk man harris pushed again then saw the message and exclaimed holy shit ohara looked at payne and casually inquired how come you dont get holy shit texts from the wheel guy youre a sergeant that outranks a lowly detective like harris tony handed matt the phone for him to read the text message correction payne said im a sergeant assigned to a desk tony gets the fun job of working the streets he looked at the screen holy shit payne repeated rereading the message as he said well mickey do you want an exclusive for crimefreephilly sure what matt handed the phone back to tony then his eyes met mickeys minutes after the last crime scene unit drove off from lex talionis matt said another body got dumped there someone walking by thought it was a vagrant passed out on the sidewalk then they noticed all the blood holy shit ohara joined in then downed his drink you cant run with this just yet mickey but theres something different with this popanddrop what he was strangled and beaten but no bullet wounds ohara banged the glass on the wooden bar and making a circular gesture with his hand over their drinks barked to the bartender johnny all this on my tab weve got to go two loft number hops haus tower n lee street philadelphia sunday november am tossing his suit coat and kicking off his loafers h rapp badde jr chased the beautiful and giggling cleopatra past the floortoceiling windows of the living room his intent to make the beast with two backs after ripping off the halloween outfit as fast as humanly possible i love that therere no other highrises near here so no one can see us through those big windows i can do whatever the hell i want it wasnt the first time that the idea of doing whatever the hell he wanteddamn the consequenceshad entered the mind of h rapp badde jr for almost all of his thirtytwo years baddea fairly fit fivefooteleven twohundredpounder with a thin face closecropped hair and mediumdark skinhad learned that what he could not get with his charisma or his arrogant badgering he could always get by subtly or sometimes not so subtly playing his favorite card that of being a disadvantaged minority it was a tactica remarkably effective one considering that philly as a whole was half black some sections up to threequartersthat he had learned from his father horatio r badde sr had used it successfully to work himself up from being a smallbusiness ownerfirst a barber in south philadelphia then the owner of a string of barbershops throughout the cityto being elected to the philadelphia city council and then almost ten years later to the office of mayor which was exactly rapps planned next step to become mayor he was banking both on the name recognitionmayor badde still was familiar to voters despite the eight years since his father held the officeand what he considered to be his own accomplishments as a city councilman and he was going to let nothing get in his way thered already been rumors trying to tie him to voter fraud but he publicly dismissed them as exactly thatrumors that were simply a part of petty politics rapp badde did as he pleaseddamn the consequencesand the hop haus tower condominium was no exception the tax rolls of the philadelphia county recorder of deeds in room at city hall showed loft number a yearold squarefoot twobedroom twobath condominium on the twentieth flooras being owned by the urban venture fund in care of mr james r johnson jrj certified public accountants walnut street suite philadelphia pennsylvania there was similar information on the books at the complex the building management kept a regularly updated computer file known as property owners permanent residents amp registered guests it listed everyone who was officially on file and showed that s permanent resident was named johnson james r and its listed registered guest was a harper janelle while it wasnt unusual for the names of owners and guests to be differentthere were for example many unmarried couples who cohabited as well as many lawfully married couples whose surnames were not the sameneither james johnson nor janelle harper had a genuine financial investment in loft number in fact the apartments official owner the urban venture fund was a corporate entity solely owned by one h r badde jr walnut street suite philadelphia pennsylvania that was in technical terms practically speaking unit s permanent resident and its very regular guest were actually jan harper and rapp badde never mind that mr james r johnson cpa had never set foot in the place and never mind that badde had purchased with cash the piedaterre love nest and certainly never mind that the funds for the purchase were a small part of those provided to his mayoral election campaign chest by a generous businessman who believed in the politician in his future at city hall and his influence therein for old friends twentyfiveyearold jan harperwho had a full and curvy fivesix oneforty body and a silky lightbrown skin tonewas down to barelymore than cleopatras goldencolored sheer panties and plasticjeweled collar and crown as she ran into the bedroom rapp was hot on her heels and just as she jumped on the kingsize beds thick goosedown comforter her legs flying up and ample breasts bouncing rapp heard his go to hell cell phone start ringing in his pants pocket damn he thought badde shared the number of his go to hell phone one of two he carried with next to no oneonly his accountant his three lawyers and a select few others who were friends or business associates or both had the number even jan didnt know it being his executive assistant she could call him on his main cell phone hed given it that name because when somebody who did have the number called chances were damn good that something had just gone to hell or was about to jan was now busily unbuttoning rapps white dress shirt as he quickly dug into his pants pocket retrieving the phone he looked at the screen hissed the word shit then pulled away from jans hands he walked toward the windows what she said surprised then a little indignantly she added who the hell is that at this hour he held up his left index finger to gesture give me a minute then flipped open the phone put it to his head and said everything okay man he listened for a moment wait he suddenly said who the hell is this and howd you get this number after a moment he said goddamn it his eye caught jan now sitting up on the comforter with her arms crossed over her naked breasts her head cocked looking at him curiously hold on a minute brother he said into the phone then to jan he said im sorry honey ill be right back badde slid open the glass door in the wall of the floortoceiling windows and stepped out onto the small concrete balcony the view from the twentieth floor was extraordinary and for more than just the beauty of the lights twinkling in the night h rapp badde jr enjoyed the feeling he got from being up so high and seeing so many parts of the city that made up his life it made him feel literally on top of the world or at least on top of what he thought of as his worldphiladelphia okay kennyi mean kareem badde said when hed closed the sliding glass door calm down and start from the beginning for his first twentytwo years kareem abdulqaadir answered to the name kenny jones that had changed two years ago when kenny jones not the brightest bulb on the marquee had gotten arrested for selling crack cocaine to undercover philly cops in germantown then fled the justice system by jumping his twothousanddollar bond the jones family whod lived in a brickfaced row house across daly street from the baddes in south philly had four brothers kenny was second oldest after jack whod been a classmate and friend of baddes seemingly forever when kenny went on the lam he called his big brother for help and advice jack then turned to his old buddy rapp badde the city councilman had connections with the authoritiesmaybe he can get the whole case thrown out or something jack told kenny and if for some reason badde was not able to use those connections he had other resources well beyond the joneses badde hadnt hesitated beyond being old neighbors the jones family had campaigned hard for his election to office he couldnt do anything with kennys case that he told jack was a matter involving the court system and the district attorneys office over which a city councilman such as himself had absolutely no sway even in a place like philadelphia so he called the manager of his campaign office in west philly which was run from a rented row house and told him to let kareem live there in the basement bedroom which had its own door to the street and to pay him in cash to work as one of baddes community voter canvassers badde even helped kenny pick out the cover name abdulqaadir which was arabic for servant of the capable badde quietly enjoyed the implication of that at first kareem abdulqaadirs job had been to go door to door pretending to be a volunteer with the city of philadelphia working for the forgotten voters initiativea program that had anyone actually bothered to investigate wouldve been found not to exist he asked the residents if they were registered voters if they said no he helped get them registered but then came his real job the compilation of the names and addresses of all these voters especially noting the elderly immigrants and others who could easily be convinced that they needed to request absenteevoter ballot forms more important once those ballots arrived in the mail kenny would help those voters with filling out the formsspecifically under city councilman marking the box next to h rapp badde jr kenny had then stumbled across an idea that had turned out to be borderline brilliant as he was canvassing a far section of west philly knocking on door after door he walked up to a retirement community fernwood manor at cobbs creek the tenstoryhigh building overlooked the greenbelt of the small treelined streamand curiously on the opposite side of the creek fernwood cemetery kenny whose experience with retirement communities could be equated to his knowledge of quantum physics had been excited to find the place was packed with really old people in no time he had talked his way into its community activity center a large building that reminded him of a high school auditorium there he found that the residents watched tv played card games and bingo and otherwise pleasantly passed time in their retirement before ultimately winding up across the creek at fernwood manors community activity center he didnt have to go door to door the retirees came to him they were happy to see a nice cleancut young man such as kareem especially the oldtimers who had failing memories alzheimers disease in particular and never remembered previously meeting himor filling out forms and when kareem had explained the purpose of his volunteer work everyone thought that the nice young man was extremely considerate to think of forgotten old folks that and to understand how difficult it was for them on voting day they said visiting polling stations that invariably had long lines was very painful for their aged bodies at the community activity center though they could at their leisure fill out the requests for absenteevoter forms then later when the forms arrived fill those out also at their leisure especially with the kind help of a nice young man like kareem kenny started visiting as many retirement homes as would let him in the door and then he went to nursing homes where he found the residents were more or less unconsciousalmost every one on medication that kept them in a mental fog or worseso all he had to do was forge their signatures on the forms even easier to sign up were those who in the last year or two had fallen into their own category deceased slipping the kid or old man in the mailroom a little stash of cocaine or cash with the promise of more guaranteed that thered be a telephone call alerting him when the absenteevoter ballots arrived in the mail over time kenny jones did one hell of a job collecting names and helping the forgotten voters of philadelphia support badde for city councilmanand soon for the office of mayor and rapp badde had been impressed ignoring the unfortunate fact that kenny was a fugitive charged with a felony hed thought that kenny was still pretty much the good if dim kid hed been when they were growing up and in two years since his arrestwhat the hells wrong with a little coke now and then that probably was a bullshit bust anywayhed never gotten into any other trouble until now what the hell do you mean somethings gone bad with you and reggie he said into his go to hell cell as he looked out over the city to the right toward west philly and the rented campaignoffice row house reggie was the baby jones brother but at age twenty and two hundred thirty pounds not much of a baby anymore rapp knew that reggie had never been really normalhis mother had had him late in life in her forties and thered been complications at birthand when reggie got mixed up with drugs he really went off the deep end worse while kenny had just sold dope reggie both sold and used the stuff unfortunately a lot more of the latter than the former and he was forever trying to pay off his dealer kenny said i got a call from reggie he was crazy crazy scared crying man said if i dont come up with thirty large to pay the man im dead he didnt and next day they grabbed him thirty thousand dollars badde thought jesus howd he get that deep in debt badde asked hell if i know snorting more than selling a lot of ious over time and some crazy interest on top of what he owed adds up fast who grabbed reggie badde asked the dude he bought his coke from the man his dealer badde sighed audibly so what would you have me do about it kenny was quiet a moment then with a tone that was incredulous said what else man you know what the money i need the money bad to get him back can i quickly put my hands on that much even if i wanted badde thought as he looked out at the city and mentally went over his cash reserves theres only ten eleven grand in my office safe he was silent for at least a minute you still there asked kenny badde didnt reply kenny said we go way back my familys done a lot for you man and ive not helped you and what the hell have you done thats worth thirty grand kenny added itd just be a loan you name the interest whatever right where the hell will you get that to repay me rapp you there yeah kenny im here isnt there any way you can work out an arrangement with this dealer just kenny jones interrupted him are you listening man we passed that point these people kill for less rapp stared off into the night silent kenny went on listen man it uh it wouldnt be good for folks to find out

do something bullshit then they really wouldnt get their money kenny as if reading baddes mind added his voice cracking and if they kill him theyre coming after me for it well then not paying would remove one problem immediately but kenny would still be mine especially if he went into hiding and started blowing the damn whistle on the absentee ballots the goddamn media would love that story itd become a bigger circus than the bermuda photographs and even if i gave him the money i cant keep having to wonder when dimwit kenny or reggie will fuck up again or if kenny will open his mouth about the ballots okay look kenny its going to take a little time especially at this hour but ill send someone first thing kenny interrupted no man you need to bring it he waited a moment then replied why me personally itd be better thats all badde lost his temper well you can fucking forget it kenny goddamn you you want the money or not there was a long pause while kenny thought about that fine then ill be here waiting as badde broke the connection looking out at west philly and shaking his head he heard the glass door slide open then jans voice everything okay honey i saw you kick the wall when he turned and looked at her he saw that she glistened from having just taken a shower now she wore a tan silk robe it hung open and he could see that she was completely naked beneath it badde took a deep breath and composed himself yeah just give me one more second ive got to make a quick call you do look incredible honey ill be waiting she said softly and slid the glass door shut h rapp badde jr felt a stirring in his groin is that from seeing her gorgeous naked bodyor because im about to have someone whacked three the roundhouse eighth and race streets philadelphia sunday november am lieutenant jason washington looked up from reading the front page of the mornings philadelphia bulletin in time to see his boss walking purposefully around a corner making a beeline for washingtons glasswalled office captain henry c quaire commanding officer of the homicide unit was a stocky balding man in his late forties like washington he wore khaki slacks but instead of the white buttondowncollar shirt washington had on henry wore a red knit polo under a navy blazer jason glanced at the wall clock and saw that quaire was fifteen minutes earlier than he had said he would arrive theyd spoken on the telephone an hour earlier quaire had called washington at home and announced that frank hollaran had just called him at home asking if they could be at the roundhouse as soon as possible quaire said that captain francis xavier hollaran the fortynineyearold assistant to first deputy police commissioner dennis v denny coughlin had told him denny wants us to be prepared before we meet with mariana and before marianas meeting with carlucci mariana said carlucci wants damage control and he needs to know what we know about the popanddrops police commissioner ralph j mariana a natty italian was the top cop with four stars on his uniform and the honorable jerome h jerry carlucci who had once been the top cop was marianas boss the mayor of philadelphia coughlin whose three stars made him the numbertwo cop in the department reported to mariana they were both appointed to their jobs by the managing director of the city but served at the mayors pleasure every policeman below them in rank on the forcewhich with some seven thousand in uniform was the fourth largest in the countrywas a civil servant washington saw that quaire was sipping from a heavy china coffee mug that bore the logotype of the emerald society the fraternal organization of police officers of irish heritage washington wasnt a member but he knew hollaran and coughlin had belonged to the emerald all their long careers well jason i see youve seen the good news quaire said by way of greeting he motioned at the desk and repeated the quote over the tv if it bleeds it leads the newspapers frontpage headline at the top of the fold screamed the halloween homicides triple murders terrorize old city quite the colorful headline if a bit sensational washington replied i have put the arm out for harris and payne henry they said they should be here any minute quaire nodded as he sipped good were going to need everything tony and matt have to put out this fire and no doubt more theyre good but this makeswhatseven or eight unsolved popanddrops while tony harris had a yearslong history in homicide matt paynes tenure could be measured only in months and if quaire had had any say in it payne never would have gotten the job certainly not ahead of three other sergeants who also wanted in and who quaire felt were far more qualified it was customary for the homicide chief to pick or at the very least have veto power over who got assigned to the unit but commissioner mariana looking for ways to encourage the best and brightest had announced that the five officers with the highest scores on the promotion exams got the assignment of their choice in the department and matt payne grabbed the brass ring by being not only in the top five scores but number one on the list of those whod earned promotion to sergeant and payne picked homicide a lessthanexcited quaire had no say one thing quaire worried about was how payne would be received he was only a fiveyear veteran and newly minted sergeant and he was getting a supervisor position over guys who had served longer than five years in homicide alone but when he brought that up to lieutenant jason washington and detective tony harrisamong homicides most respectedtheyd said that their experience with matt payne had been without problem both liked him and thought he was smartsmart enough to keep his eyes and ears open and learn how homicide works washington said and he had it didnt hurt either that he was well connected starting with being the godson of denny coughlin whom he was known to call uncle denny quaire did have absolute authority to choose which squad in the unit to assign payne and because paynes score on the sergeant exam proved he was as the commissioner would have put it among the best and brightest and because harris and washington already had worked with payne and clearly liked him quaire naturally put payne in the squad led by lieutenant jason washington here comes coughlin now washington said looking past quaire quaire turned and raised his china mug to acknowledge the first deputy police commissioner denny coughlin a ruddyfaced fiftynineyearold had graduated from the police academy nearly forty years earlier he was tall and heavyset with a full mouth of teeth and full head of curly silver hair he wore his usual welltailored gray plaid doublebreasted suit but no tie washington made the educated guess that coughlin kept at least two extra necktiesand probably another suitas backups in his big office on the third floor good morning gentlemen coughlin said once he was in washingtons doorway thank you for coming in good morning sir washington and quaire now said in unison and good timing commissioner washington added as he nodded toward the far side of the office here come sergeant payne and detective harris both matt and tony wore the same clothing that theyd had on when theyd left liberties bar with mickey ohara some six hours earlier and with baggy eyes and fiveoclock beard shadows both looked as if theyd just awakened from a very short sleep jesus you two look like the walking dead coughlin said by way of greeting you especially look like hell matty just call me an overachiever uncle denny payne replied dryly i was catching a nap in the car when the long arm of lieutenant washington reached out for us after tony and i left the scene in old city we went to check out a hunch the dead guy reggie jones had a sort of todo list in his coat pocket and we wound up staking out his house in south philly thought it was a long shot and boy was it and i thought coughlin said his tone suddenly cold as his irish temper flared that we all agreed you would stay the hell off the streets while all that wyatt earp of the main line business died if youll pardon my choice of words there had been a flurry of new storiesfrom print to tv to the internetafter the bulletin had run the photograph of the tuxedoclad payne holding his colt above the robber hed shot in the parking lot of la famiglia ristorante and then those were rehashed when the story broke about paynes foot chase and shootout with the assassin who fled temple university hospital the mayor who wasnt displeased with payne per se but was tired of constantly defending a good cop doing a good job simply called denny coughlin and suggested matt stay the hell out of sightand stay out of the news and coughlin had sent the order down the chain of command after telling matt himself coughlin looked from payne to washington to quaire well quaire began i take its my fault sir detective tony harris interrupted i should have known better the hell it is matt payne said looking at tony he turned to coughlin and added i invited myself along me and mickey ohara coughlins eyebrows went up what the hell was mickey doing we were at liberties payne said when the news came in about the third dead guy you know you cant tell mickey no nor apparently you coughlin said to matt his ruddy face turning redder by the second when i give an order i damn well expect it to be kept yes sir matt said his voice tired its resigned tone sounding like that of a schoolboy whod just been dressed down by the headmaster which a dozen years ago he had been on more than one occasion and you detective harris coughlin said yes sir same applies yes sir of course sir coughlin nodded and with a more gentle voice added i do commend you tony being the low man on the totem pole here for trying to take the bullet for everyone else guilty or not harris shrugged making his rumpled navy blazer look even worse i do feel responsible sir ive seen matt day in and day out at his desk up to his eyeballs with mostly paperwork from the other popanddrops i wanted him to see a fresh crime scene that thought had occurred to me earlier last night when the scene for the first two guys who were popanddropped was being worked but for whatever reason i didnt call him then when the news came about the third one and we were having drinks at liberties it just made sense for him to come along and see the scene its a helluva lot better than reading statements sir coughlin considered that a long moment he looked between them then back to harris and nodded from a homicide investigation standpoint i do see your point everyone in the room knew well that among the many other assignments hed held thencaptain coughlin had been the chief of the homicide unit and detective f x hollaran had been his righthand man even back then he looked at his wristwatch okay matty you have ten minutes tell me what i need to know before going upstairs to face the wrath of the bosses payne nodded all of the dead he began looking at coughlin then the others have been adult males both the earlier popanddrops and the three found last night thats where that thread ends of the first five all were shot at pointblank range in the head the ballistics tests on the only two bullets recoveredevery other round passed through their bodiesshowed them to be millimeter and caliber three were black males one a white male and one a hispanic male and all were wanted on outstanding warrants either for parole violation or for jumping bail for sex crimes committed on kids or women they got popped somewhere other than where they were dropped how do you know that for sure frank hollaran asked is that an assumption due to lack of evidence payne shook his head and said because they were all dropped one per week beginning back on september sixteenth at the nearest police district hq correction at a police district hq nearest is speculative on my part reason being why would you drive around with a dead body farther than necessary there were chuckles stranger things have occurred matthew jason washington offered payne nodded i know anyway the other consistency among these first five popanddrops is that they each had their wanted poster attached to them their wanted poster coughlin repeated yes sir like the ones we post on the police department website nice color mug shot with their full name and aliases last known address crimes committed et cetera coughlin nodded motioning with his hand for matt to go on payne said two of the fiveboth rapistswere printed from our special victims unit page on the internet the rest were from the listing of megans law fugitives on oharas crimefreephillydotcom thats mickeys coughlin asked his face brightening thats where he went after he quit the bulletin payne said its had some growing pains coughlin said but what ive seen ive mostly liked anyway continue for a moment payne was impressed that coughlin paid attention to the internet but then he realized it shouldnt have come as such a surprise coughlin was smart as hell and while he could be old school he was also always embracing whatever might aid him in his duties with maybe one exception denny coughlin had told matt he wasnt crazy about carrying the new departmentissued glock semiautomatic millimeter pistol mariana had successfully lobbied the city for the cops to have more firepower than thecaliber revolvers theyd carried almost since the ice agephillys first foot patrol began in the late s and he said coughlin needed to carry the glock to set an example denny who had never drawn his service weapon his entire career didnt think he needed on his hip what he called a small cannonand especially not one of the alternative service weapons glock models chambered forcaliber andcaliber rounds that were more powerful than the millimeter but he followed the order nonetheless payne went on each dead guy had his rap sheet stapled to him usually to the clothing but on one bad guya really despicable bastard on the run from a charge of raping a tenyearold girlthe doer stapled the wanted poster multiple times to the guys wang there were groans jesus hollaran exclaimed coughlin now somberfaced shook his head couldve been worse i worked a case maybe two decades ago where a guy who thought that he quietlyand successfullyhad ratted out a mobster was found dead on his front porch for all the world to see thats worse payne said in his mouth looking like a droopy third eye was his severed penis there was a mix of grunts and chuckles from the group so payne then said those are the ones ive been trying to connect the dots on i have more details on each one not for now thanks coughlin said payne looked at harris and said tony knows about last nights batch coughlin said detective it appears you have the floor he looked at his watch and a little less than ten minutes yes sir as matt said all the dead are male adults we got the call on the first twodanny gartner and his longtime client coughlin grunted derisively i know who gartner was no great loss to mankind there harris went on that call came in at precisely tenohtwo last night and the call on the third guy at twelvetwelve this morning both gartnerwhite male age fiftyfiveand john jaycee nguyenasian male age twentyfivewere shot pointblank at the base of the skulltony mimed the shooting with his hand again as hed done at liberties barwith a largebore round we believe it was a glock caliber as a shiny spent casingwith gap for glock automatic pistol stamped on the basewas found behind gartners office cause of death though may not be by gunshot both men had their mouth and nose wrapped with clear plastic packing tape and both also had a plastic garbage bag covering the head and taped tightly at the neck the same tape was used to bind both men at their ankles and wrists no wanted posters like the others coughlin asked tony thought how did he know that simple answer because he didnt become the second most important white shirt in the building by being a lazy cop the uniform shirt for all ranks sergeant and above was white thus the expression white shirt those in ranks of corporal down to police recruit wore blue shirts and were referred to accordingly now his wellhoned investigative mind has been putting together the pieces and one piece is that gartner wasnt wanted for any crime no sir tony harris said after a moment none of the three last night tell them about the piss payne said what hollaran blurted everyone looked at matt then at tony when we got the search warrant for gartners officeoutside of which was parked nguyens motorcyclewe found no obvious signs anybodyd been whacked inside but we did find piss poured all over the place tony said it had to be gallons payne added lightly were guessing some animals i mean fourlegged animal coughlin shook his head in wonder doesnt matter if it turns out to be from a human quaire said urine is mostly worthless for our purposes really payne said uhhuh quaire said i thought you knew it doesnt have enough traceable dna to make it useful its just well piss there were chuckles at the risk of repeating myself matthew jason washington offered we do come across strange things in our business coughlin then said okay and what about the third guy one reginald reggie jones black male age twenty a great big boy maybe goes twoforty twofifty and with one of those round baby faces well before he got beaten up someone kicked the living shit out of him brutal beating he could have died from that or from strangulation two of those plastic zip tiestwo short ones put end to end to make one long onewere cinched tight around his throat he paused as they considered that then harris said jones was a smalltime dealer what he had was more of a consumption habit but he did have a couple busts for selling coke he was on probation for possession word is that this is not exactly pc oh no payne gasped dramatically weve never heard something that was politically incorrect uttered in the roundhouse there were grins including tonys say it tony coughlin said his face serious we need to know e verything reggie jones was backward backward more or less retarded tony said and now hes deceased payne said making him number eight no warrants coughlin went on his investigators mind is still on high speed no sir not on the deceased his brother however is in the wind hows that kenneth j kenny jones black male age twentytwo skipped out on a charge of possession with intent to distribute jumped his twothousanddollar bail after getting picked up in germantown like his brother reggie kennys not the sharpest knife in the drawer tried to sell crack cocaine to a couple of our guys working an undercover task force coughlin snorted thought a moment then said maybe the doer popped the wrong brother by mistake possible and the others whod been popanddropped all had some sexual crime component yes sir all but the lawyer and all the others had been shot but not the jones boy he was strangled harris nodded correct coughlin looked at hollaran youre thinking what im thinking frank hollaran had worked with denny coughlin so many years he could finish his sentences that its possible hollaran asked sure boss if somehow theyd heard about the popanddrops but i doubt its happened in this case not enough time has elapsed it can happen probably will happen especially with the cash rewards being offered whatre we talking about payne asked copycats folks who mimic crimes they see in the news that fifteen minutes of fame andy warhol talked about quaire gesturing again at the newspaper on washingtons desk put in and now we havecue the dramatic musicthe halloween homicides payne offered playing devils advocate maybe its not so much a copycat as it is someone taking up frank fuller on the hefty bounty he offers forwhats his phrasethe evildoers think that through matthew washington said who is going to claim those rewards at least for the dead critters theyd be admitting to murder payne shrugged regardless coughlin said jerry carlucci is going to want to know what were doing about the problem hes planning on having a press conference at noon in the executive command center what he talks about depends on what he hears from us and im sure he will denounce fullers bounty isnt denouncing the bounty a bit hypocritical payne asked in what way coughlin said the philadelphia police department is in bed with for example the fbi and the dea which do offer big rewards for fingering bad guys and that nationwide crimestoppers program pays five or ten grand for information leading to a convictionjust call their tollfree number it pays up even if you remain anonymous itd make my job a helluva lot easier if someone called with something on these popanddrops we do ask for tips on catching criminals matty coughlin said reasonably but we dont encourage killing theres a difference one somebody needs to point out to frank fuller he sighed deeply but good point carlucci will have to spin it in a positive way he glanced at his watch okay everyone follow me upstairs this was just the dress rehearsal payne didnt move causing coughlin to raise an eyebrow in question everyone as in everyone matt asked am i allowed to leave the office coughlin his voice taking an official tone then said as of this moment sergeant payne assuming you can at some point soon get a decent shower and shave i hereby order your release from desk duty coughlin looked around the office everyone think they can follow that order there was a chorus of yes sir four ridgewood street philadelphia sunday november am there were three official emergency vehicles parked at the curb in front of the bazelons row house all with various doors open and the redandblue light bars on their roofs flashing two were white chevy impala squad cars assigned to the twelfth district and the third was a somewhat battered white ford panel van that had a blueandgold stripe running the length of the vehicle and blue block lettering that spelled out medical examiner on the wooden front porch of the row house two philadelphia police department blue shirts were on either side of a rocking chair one a male standing and writing notes and the other a female down on one knee the young woman cop was speaking softly to eighteenyearold sasha bazelon who sat in the rocker her face in her hands her body visibly shaking as she sobbed standing nearby on the sidewalk was a small crowd of fifteen people mostly adult men and women holding bibles all watching with looks of deep sadness or abject helplessness a couple of the women were dabbing at their cheeks with white cotton handkerchiefs they wore what mrs joelle bazelon would have said was their sunday gotomeeting clothing any other week joelle bazelon also would have been in her church clothes usually a darkcolored billowing cotton dress joining the group as it made the regular walk to worship at the church of christ three blocks over at warrington and south fiftysixth street this morning however the sixtytwoyearold widows cold dead body clad in a rumpled housecoat was about to be removed from her living room couch and placed inside a heavyduty vinyl bag by two technicians from the medical examiners office the techs were dressed alike in black jeans white knit polos and stained wellworn white lab coats that were thighlength with two big patch pockets on the front they had transparent blue plastic booties covering their black athletic shoes their hands wore tancolored synthetic polymer gloves the body bag was on a heavyduty metalframed gurney that had been positioned alongside the couch its oversize rubber wheels locked to prevent it from rolling the tech who was lifting the body by holding the lower legsjust above the swollen and bruised ankleswas kim soo a smallbodied man with short spiked black hair and puffy round facial features hed been born in philly twentyeight years earlier to parents from south korea who became naturalized americans soo had spent the last two hours carefully photographing the row house with a big bulky professionallevel nikon digital camera its body badly scratched and dinged hed moved through the residence fluidly with the camera documenting the scene the strobe had been so intense that its pulsing flashes were easily seen by the small crowd on the sidewalk soos face was stonelike as he looked at the lead technician javier iglesia soo had known iglesia going back to south philly high where kim had been two grades behind him iglesia a beefy but fit thirtyyearold of puerto rican ancestry was normally a very talkative sort always ready with an opinion on anything now however holding the body at the shoulders iglesia was being unusually quiet finally iglesia said i knew being a tech for the me wasnt going to be all glory kim but days like this when it gets personal i honest to god genuinely hate this damned job iglesia looked at soo who said i know after getting a stronger grip on the housecoat iglesia said ready on three one two three the lifting took considerable exertion and they both grunted with effort as the body began to budge the lift was actually more of a slide off the couch then a slight drop to the black vinyl body bag that was positioned on the gurney the bigboned obese body made for a fairly tight fit in the body bag it also made the bag more or less droop over the gurneys tubular frame principal bazelon was a good and decent woman javier said then i remember the year before she retiredit was my first year at shaw middle school this woman was so strict but also so kind soo nodded his face looking sympathetic ill tell you he went on she was a major influence on me back then and so many others she taught me a lot a fool thinks himself to be wise but a wise man knows himself to be a fool thats shakespeare she got me reading him he looked down at the body in the bag and now this ill tell you something iglesia said then glanced around to see if anyone could be listening he went on in a softer voice what i think is she didnt just die in her sleep is what i think he paused no i know she didnt just look at her wrists and ankles bruised and swollen from something tied with something some rope something thats been taken off and thats called tampering with evidence he paused again then nodded as he added mitchell will make it he misses nothing the medical examiner their boss was dr howard h mitchell a very busy bald man with a dark sense of humor he was usually found in a wellworn rumpled suit and tie either performing an autopsy or dealing with the paperwork of a place that had to deal with an average of a murder a day plus the questionable deaths such as that of mrs joelle bazelon iglesia shook his head then closed the top flap and began working the web straps over the bag that would secure the load to the gurney that done he and soo grabbed the tubular handles at each end of the heightadjustable gurney and lifted once again grunting under the weight they raised the top of the gurney to about the level of their waists they wanted it high enough to have better control while wheeling it but not so high that the center of gravity could cause the gurney to become ungainly and topheavy and dump onto its side kim soo unlocked the rubber wheels and he pushed as javier iglesia began pulling the gurney toward the open front door as they went javier shook his head and quietly said i was there when they threw principal bazelons big retirement goaway thing it was a big deal it was she was a big deal and whatever happened to her this just isnt right what i think is that girl of hers isnt saying what really happened after iglesia and soo had first arrived at the house and were processing the scene before preparing to remove the deceased javier had overheard a good bit of what sasha bazelon had been telling the two blue shirts iglesia had been impressed with herat eighteen she was a year younger than his baby sisterand while she was just shy of hysterical it was clear that on any other day the slender lightbrownskinned young woman would be absolutely beautiful the five of them had all been in the living room the two cops interviewing the girl while the techs did their work officer geoffrey pope nineteen years old was a railthin fivenine with closely cropped blond hair and a youthful face javier knew he had exactly one year on the philadelphia police department corporal charlene crowe was a black stout thirtyyearold with a friendly face and warm smile she stood a head shorter than sasha and she had to look up at the girl while asking questions the shoulder patches of crowes blue uniform shirt had two blue chevrons outlined in silver in fits and starts interspersed with crying jags sasha had told corporal crowe i came home late last night from my friends house down the street grammy was sound asleep on the couch snoring so i quietly went to my room when i came downstairs this morning she was still there but no longer breathing when i checked for a pulse her body felt cold and hard and then came the waterworks and then shed basically repeated what shed said and then came the waterworks again javier found it curious that sasha almost never looked corporal crowe in the eyes and when she did it was for only a split secondthen shed bury her face in her hands and sob it wasnt that he felt the tears were not authentic the girl was clearly in deep emotional distress and damn near inconsolable shes shaking to her core shes crying so much but theres something thats just not right something thats missing not being said yet when asked if anything at all suspicious had happened in the last days weeks even months shed said thered been nothing she said grammy got sick a lot mostly from her diabetes and her weight i guess i guess her heart just couldnt take it anymore kim soo and javier iglesia rolled the gurney out the front door and the wooden boards of the porch creaked under all the weight the two uniforms talking with sasha bazelon looked over their shoulders and made eye contact with the medical examiner techs sasha looked up from her hands saw the packed body bag strapped to the gurney and let out a wail officer pope javier iglesia said when you get a moment javier dipped his head once sideways in the direction of the white ford panel van pope nodded soo and iglesia wheeled the gurney past the small crowd trying to remain professional and not make eye contact but then a tiny ancientlooking black ladyjavier thought she easily could be in her ninetiesheld her bible up to her forehead and cried go with god sweet joelle rest in peace praise be the lord javier saw that she was clearly upset but unlike the other younger women had her crying under control a strong and brave lady iglesia thought as they made eye contact and with sad eyes and thin pensive lips he nodded far braver than i amen he said softly to her as kim swung open the two rear doors of the white ford panel van javier said you know this and south philly have been my home all my life and its all changing its all slowly going to shit mine too the whole city is kim replied so whats your point my point is good people are getting hurt and someone needs to step up is my point i mean i know we did pot and stuff at south philly high but now dealers are selling to middle schoolers and not just pot but bad stuff like candy smack candy smack yeah i mean black tar heroin is what i mean cheap deadly shit from mexico mixed with sugar and other junk and then the kids get hooked then need money to go score more so then they go rob some old lady maybe tie her up and kill her thats what i mean man kim soo looked wideeyed at javier iglesia you dont know thats what happened to her soo said glancing at the body bag iglesia glanced up at the row house porch then turned and stared soo in the eyes and said i know two things one that girl knows something that she isnt telling about principal bazelon and two im not going to sit around while my neighborhood goes to hell he gazed down the block across the street three houses down he noticed that another group had gathered five boys they were sitting on a short brick wall and watching the activity at the bazelon house they looked to be teenagers a couple maybe a little older and in their baggy jeans oversize gangster jackets and hoodie sweatshirts they did not appear to be on their way to church the only thing they worship is trouble see these punks iglesia said as he nodded at the group i guarantee you theyre up to no good ten bucks says theyre using five says selling and who knows whatever the hell else kim soo turned to look then faced iglesia and said aw hell javier you dont know that a lot of kids do that gangstafromthehood look we used to hang out in high school wearing tough looks too uhuh iglesia said shaking his head its different now is what it is soo shrugged his shoulders after a moment iglesia added you see any of the speech that ben franklin rich guy gave last night on the news while jimmys team was at the old city scene of the first two popanddrops popanddrops yeah thats what a sergeant i know in homicide says theyre calling them there was five to start now theres eight and theyre all stacked up in the meat locker waiting for mitchell and his buzz saw the homicide sergeant came by the office one day and took a look at them yeah i saw that eyeforaneye guys speech right before i hit the sack hes paying ten grand for anyone bagging a bad guyevildoers he called them yeah javier iglesia said his face lighting up soo realized that javier was quickly getting his talkativeness back javier went on now thats what im talking about i mean someone has finally had enough of the city going to hell and theyre stepping up to help fix it is what i mean ten large per evildoer is some seriously high stepping up he paused and looked down at the body bag too damn bad its too late for principal bazelon javier then softly repeated rest in peace praise be the lord he shoved the gurney causing its framework to collapse as it rolled up and inside the rear of the van then he gently respectfully closed the left door then the right one police officer geoffrey pope was standing on the curb behind where the right door had been open making javier wonder how long hed been there and how much hed heard hey geoff javier said to him you standing there long long enough to hear the news flash that the citys going to hell and your short prayer for the deceased he paused then added you dont look too good javier im he stopped as he glanced at the small crowd on the sidewalk a few were watching the conversation between the cop and the tech with rapt interest step around here javier said walking around to the far side of the van to block the view of the curious javier pulled out his wallet and from it extracted a business card he held it out to officer pope heres my card geoff its got my cell phone number on it i live

police work v one wilder street philadelphia sunday november am will curtis drove the rented white ford freestar minivan up onto the cracked south philly sidewalk braking to a stop in front of the tiny rundown twostory row house he studied it and thought hope this sonofabitch is in there i cant believe that last sonofabitchs address was so old the house was completely gone burned to the damn ground dont want two dead ends to start my day curtis wore his federal express uniform complete with the greasesmeared fedex cap the driver and front passenger doors of the minivan each had a threefootsquare polymer sign displaying the redandblue fedex logotype and the words home delivery he knew his makeshift package delivery van wouldnt pass muster with anyone back at the distribution warehouse but so far it had looked like the real deal to everyone else curtis got out from behind the steering wheel and glanced around the neighborhood it wasnt that early in the morning but the street was quiet there were only the sounds of dogs yapping down the block and not too far off in the distance the horn blare from a septa lightrail train he saw a skinny mangy gray cat across the street it was eating halloween candies that had been dropped and squashed on the sidewalk probably stolen from some poor kid but whod go door to door for candy in this dump of a place for drugs sure which is why its quiet now damn lowlifes up all night chasing ass and doing dope but catching them now all good and sleepy will be some sort of justice he reached back inside the door of the minivan there was a stack of he reached back inside the door of the minivan there was a stack of six thin white paperboard envelopes on the dashboard and he pulled the top one off the stack each of the envelopes bore the distinctive fedex logotype as well as a clear plastic pouch holding a bill of lading stepping carefully curtis carried the envelope toward the front door of the row house parts of the crumbling sidewalk were broken down to bare dirt and there were kneehigh dead weeds in the cracks the house itself built of masonry blocks with a front facade of red brick was also in really bad shape there were several holes in the wall where bricks were completely missing the house hadnt been painted in far too many years leaving bare wood that had rotted in places racks of rusty burglar bars covered the solid metal front door and the four doublewindowstwo upstairs and two at street leveland the firstfloor windows were fitted with poorly cut pieces of weatherwarped plywood to the right of the concrete steps on the sidewalk and up against the foot of the house curtis saw five or six black trash bags they were packed full piled high one on the bottom with a big torn hole they looked to have been there for some time easily days if not weeks curtis went up the flight of four concrete steps leading to the battered front door he saw out of the corner of his eye what at first he thought were two black cats theyd been along the wall behind the trash bags then theyd bolted away running behind some weeds in front of the small woodframed window of the basement those arent cats theyre goddamn rats he now noticed that the basement window was open pulled inward from the top the rats had disappeared into it curtis shook his head in disgust as he reached the barcovered metal door a breeze blew past bringing with it a vile stench he gagged he looked at the garbage bags jesus whatever it is has to be in there its worse than raw chickenor maybe dead ratsthats gone bad he looked to the window where the rodents had run inside or could it be coming from the basement what a shithole he pulled back his sleeve testing the air the breeze had stopped and the stench had subsided for now i need to see whos home then get the hell out of here there was no doorbelljust a crude little hole where it had once been mountedso he balled his fist reached between the bars and pounded on the metal door as he waited for some kind of life to wake up insideother than the vile verminhe glanced at the fedex envelope in his hand its bill of lading had a return field that read united states department of the treasury pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc will grinned he knew that was the address of the white house and had listed it as an inside joke he had no idea where the hell the us treasury had its main officeand didnt give a damn because he knew the recipient wouldnt know either the field for recipient read kendrik mays wilder street philadelphia pa also on the bill of lading was a bold black x in the box beside the line that stated governmentissued id amp personal signature of recipient required for delivery after knocking again and waiting another few minutes hed yet to hear anything moving inside the house dammit not even another rat another dead end move this one to the bottom of the stack with the other dead end maybe try again later at least theres a house at this address just as he turned to go down the steps to the minivan he saw movement in the left downstairs window where he noticed a knothole in the warped wood so you use that as a peephole eh nervously he readjusted thecaliber glock that he had stuck under the waistband of his pants right behind the buckle of his heavy leather belt this mornings work wasnt wasted after all curtis turned back to the door at five oclock that morning will curtis had awakened and gone downstairs to the kitchen to make his coffee just as hed done every day for as long as he could remember easily twenty years all the while careful not to wake up his wife not even a week after wendy had been attacked linda had moved into her old bedroom it was on the back side of the row houses first floor it had not exactly been left as a shrine after wendy had moved out and gotten her first apartmentif only because wendy had needed a lot of the furniture and other items to kickstart her new independencebut it still had a lot of her personal items from growing up things like the many trophies she had won playing soccer in junior and senior high school and the walls were practically covered solid with framed and pushpinned photographs of wendy and her countless gal pals from birthday parties to summer trips at the jersey shore all from various points of her teen years a lot of memories for linda to recall as she lay there and ever more the recluse she spent more and more time in wendys old bed theyd told wendy that a new life required a new bed and among the apartmentwarming gifts theyd given her had been a queensize bedthe one shed been attacked on i dont know whos going to take care of linda when im gone but i do know she wont want for anything especially with the house being paid off and the fat payout from my life insurance policy coming which is damn convenient because shes barely holding on to her teller job and im feeling worse every day as the coffee brewed will curtis went down into the basement shortly after moving into the house hed begun converting the basement into a recreation room it had a pair of soft deep sofas that faced a monster flatscreen plasma tv in the corner was a freestanding bar hed built himself and just about every nook and cranny was filled with philadelphia eagles memorabiliahed started the collection in his youth and later had help from wendy whod grown into a genuine fan too and in the corner of the rec room his desk held a desktop computer every morning by the time hed finished checking his email the pot of coffee would have finished brewing hed then go up and pour a big cup to bring back down and drink while catching up on emails and then reading phillybulletincom the online edition of the philadelphia bulletin up until a couple years ago he would go out to the front stoop and pick up the paper version that hed subscribed to forever but as it had never arrived until at least six in the morningand on rainy days arrived wethed let the subscription lapse after getting in the habit of reading the news online and not just news lately hed started following a new website the name of which he really liked crimefreephillycom it had news articles but also a lot of information about crime and criminals and so in the last month it had become an indispensable tool for curtis now a cup of freshly brewed coffee in his left hand he used his right hand to click onto crimefreephilly the mornings lead headline was three dead in old city police hunt gunman in popanddrop murders three dead had been curtiss first thought as he sipped from his coffee cup then popanddrop thats an interesting way to put it he noticed that michael j ohara had written the news article curtis had seen the byline in the bulletin for a long time and he liked the articles the ohara guy wrote but he hadnt seen oharas name in some time and hed wondered if something had happened to the reporter but now here was his name appearing on this new website curtis read oharas news story it was short only six brief paragraphs stating the basic information that three men had been left dead in old city at lex talionis it didnt list the victims names or how theyd been killed and it mentioned absolutely nothing about the popanddrops at the police stations curtis saw that the article referenced both the reward offered by lex talionis and the speech made by francis fuller both references were underlined meaning they were links to other pages with more information when curtis clicked on francis fuller the page with the popanddrop article was replaced with a much longer piece on fullers speech on the evildoers written by someone named dick collier he skimmed it then went back and read it in its entirety then he went back and clicked on the underlined lex talionis and the link took him to the page at lextalioniscom announcing the tenthousanddollarreward program for information leading to the arrest and conviction of an evildoer he knew about the program but he read the page anyway to see if there was anything new there wasnt and curtis again clicked back to oharas article on three dead in old city where the hell did the third body come from a coincidence oh sure someone just happened to have one lying around and dropped it off on halloween is some asshole copying me except theyre not dumping bad guys at the police stations not that i know of anyway there havent been any stories about those mine or anyone elses in deep thought he drained his coffee cup then he slammed the cup on the desk some asshole has to be copying me what does that mean well for starters it means more dead perverts not that i have a problem with that but theres gonna be cops on every corner looking for me and whoever else is dumping bodies and that means if im going to enforce the law of talion in whatever time i have left im going to need to do something different two will curtis had his balled fist inside the iron burglar bars and was again banging on the filthy metal door fedex delivery now he could hear footsteps inside they were moving toward the door then came the sound of a chain rattling against the back side of the door then a deadbolt unlocking then the doorknob turning the door cracked open just barely judging by the sliver of a gaunt face that curtis saw through the crack it was a woman old enough to be kendrik mayss mother she stared at him with only her left eye and she looked absolutely awful well what the hell did you expect to find here miss america curtis held up the envelope so she could see the bill of lading got an express delivery for a kendrik mays the lone visible eyeball darted between curtis and the envelope aint today sunday she asked look i dont like working weekends any more than the next guy she nodded as she considered his answer after a moment the woman said with a shaky voice he down at his cousins dont know when he come back you leave it with me she pulled the door open wider to where the chain became taut and stuck out a badly bruised hand fingers clawing for the envelope now curtis could see more of the woman the entire right side of her face including all around the right eye was deeply bruised she stood her feet bare at maybe fivetwo she was clearly malnourished and couldnt weigh a hundred pounds torn and dirty black jeans and a ratty tshirt hung on her curtis trying to get over his initial shock pulled back the envelope im sorry he said but its gotta be signed for by the person its addressed to she squinted her sunken eyes and looked harder at the envelope who it from will curtis turned over the envelope pretending to read from the bill of lading says the us treasury in washington treasury you sure you got the right address he read it off the envelope then said kendrik mays right she said think that may be a check in a tone he hoped showed he was uninterested he replied yeah thatd be my guess pension check irs refund maybe some of that stimulus money the governments been giving away thatd be a good reason they want it delivered to the right person will curtis looked her in the eyes and could see she was considering her options she said i sign for it kendrik my boy i see he gets it curtis shook his head sorry maam im just a delivery guy and i got to follow rules i guess ill come back she slammed the door shut in his face what the hell he thought then he could hear the chain clanking against the inside the door swung all the way open hurry up she said shakily maybe he got money he dont beat me no more maybe he move out for good curtis looked around the inside of the house it was a shambles the only furniture was a threadbare sofa with torn cushions and two white plastic patio chairs you know thats not right no one should beat you she said i knows i do but he dont mean to its drugs they make him mean different you know no maam i dont know i cant begin to understand it where is he she pointed to the floor indicating the basement and started to cry he was such a sweet little boy the street turned him bad that i know what he held up the envelope then grabbed the tab at the top peeling it open he reached in and pulled out a sheet it was a wanted poster from the listing of megans law fugitives at crimefreephillycom one hed downloaded and printed in his basement next to a color mug shot of an angrylooking young black man with a full beard and dreadlocks was name first middle last kendrik leshawn mays description black male lbs date of birth last known address wilder street city state zip philadelphia pa convicted of involuntary deviant sexual intercourse amp rape of an unconscious or unaware person phila police dept case no kendrik leshawn mayss mother raised her eyebrows but she did not appear at all surprised nor at all concerned that will curtis had her sons wanted sheet she sighed yeah she said that him guess he lied said he took care of that she looked at curtis no check huh more like a reality check curtis thought he shook his head no check will curtis went down the unstable wooden steps into the basement his left hand slid along the wooden handrail and his right hand holding thecaliber pistol followed the wall of mostly busted sheetrock there was some light from the small window at the far end of the roomthe one the rats had gone throughbut not enough for him to make out anything but vague shapes in the pitch dark there was a stench although not like the putrid smell that had assaulted his olfactory senses at the front door the odor here was a sickly sweet stench that became stronger the farther down the stairs he went so far though it hadnt triggered his gag reflex and he was grateful for such small favors at the foot of the stairs curtis stopped and listened he could hear snoring about midway in the room thats two people snoring one deep as hell he felt around on the wall for a light switch as best he could tell there wasnt one just bustedup drywall he took another step reaching farther down the wall then felt his foot catch on a rope or cord or something some kind of trip wire he carefully reached down with his left hand till he felt it it was a vinylcovered electrical extension cord that had been run from upstairs when he tugged on it something attached to its far end started sliding across the basement floor toward him he pulled and pulled and finally found at the end what had once been the guts of a lamp all that was left from the lamp was a threaded metal rod attached to the receptacle that held a lone bare lightbulb his thumb found the stick pushswitch on the receptacle and after positioning himself in a crouch and aiming his pistol in the direction of the snoring curtis pushed the switch on the bare bulb burned brightly damn near blinding him until his eyes adjusted the only response from the middle of the room was another loud deep snore after his eyes adjusted will curtis could not believe what he was seeing the basement was the worst thing hed ever seen in his life it was completely trashed the sheetrock walls were all busted as if someone had taken a sledgehammer to them in search of whatever treasure might be hidden behind them and then he saw why the wiring had been ripped from the wall power outlets and light switches it probably was cheap aluminum not copper wiring making the effort mostly worthless idiots desperate idiots trash was strewn all across the floor there were piles upon piles of dirty clothes that hadnt been touched in years dust and dirt were everywhere and in a far corner by a plastic bucket he saw the source of the sickly sweet stench mounds of dried human waste indescribable filth animals wouldnt live in this just then a rat ran across his booted feet away from the light and toward the darkness of a far corner along the way scattering what looked like rolling waves of cockroaches jesus h christ this place shouldve been condemned a decade ago then he looked to the middle of the room to the source of the snoring there he saw a dirty and torn mattress set up on wooden palletspresumably to keep it safe from the sea of cockroaches belowand on the mattress were two human forms lying side by side one the deep snorer was a black male whose coarse face made him look older than his picture in the wanted mug shot his hair was cut short and he had a goatee the other was a very young black girl twelve thirteen that sonofabitch both were naked the girl curled under a dirty bath towel she used as a makeshift blanket kendrik had a rolledup jacket under his head his right hand under it and his left hand resting on the girls exposed bony buttock it looked as if they had been spooning but the girl had crawled forward away from kendrik they look so dirtyso foul will curtis called out kendrik mays mays didnt move the girls left eye opened suddenly then closed she pretended to still be asleep curtis walked closer to mays then kicked the mattress kendrik he saw a groggy mays struggle to turn his head then he opened his right eye to look at whoever was disturbing his sleep from under his jacket he suddenly pulled out a small snubnosed revolver oh shit curtis thought as he instinctively leveled the glock at mays then curtis saw that mayss hand was shaking so severely he couldnt keep a grip on the gun curtis kicked the hand his heavy boot causing the pistol to fly across the basement it landed in a pile of dirty clothes sit up you sonofabitch curtis barked at mays it took mays forever to comply when he had finally done so the girl turned to look at curtis and will curtis ached she was as badly bruised as kendriks mother she wasnt as young as hed thoughtshe cant be over seventeen eighteenand she was terribly skinny from the drug abuse her skin sagged from her small frame and curtis could see her bones clearly delineated under the loose flesh when kendrik moved his hand to scratch his head the girl flinched shes conditioned to getting hit for the slightest thing you curtis said to her kicking a ratty dress toward her get dressed and get the hell out of here she looked back wordlessly her sunken eyes wide then she looked to mays seemingly for permission mays his head cocked stared belligerently at curtis his look saying who the fuck does this honky think he is aiming a fucking glock at kendrik fucking mays curtis motioned with the pistol toward the female go now kendrik said go on bitch i deal with you later she slid the dress over her head not bothering to put on any panties and then moved to the wooden stairs she looked back over her shoulder then turned and went upstairs as fast as she could curtis the pistol aimed at mayss face handed him the wanted poster this you will asked mays looked at it then at curtis then he smiled will curtis thought jesus what rotted teeth at least the ones he still has he must be living on crystal meth kendrik then said fuck you what if it is old man he spat on the floor you do what it says you did fuck you he repeated he tried to stare down curtis but then he suddenly started to shake uncontrollably after a moment he said maybe whats it to you he shook again then tried to puff out his chest yeah i done it all that and more two years ago why you here now id say may god have pity on you but i think youre past that point kendrik barked fuck you motherfucker will curtis nodded and he squeezed the trigger of the glock thecaliber round entered kendriks right cheek making an entrance wound just below the eye that looked like a pulpy crimson hole kendrik leshawn mayss eyes rolled back as he suddenly slumped onto the filthy torn mattress when he got to the top of the stairs will curtis found kendriks mother standing solemnly in the middle of the shabby living room she had her head down her face expressionless her arms were tightly crossed over her chest her hands squeezing her biceps the girl was nowhere in sight id like to say im sorry for your loss will curtis said evenly but you lost your boy a long time ago that wasnt him down there she shook her head no it wasnt you right it aint no good aint none of it no good she looked up and met his eyes he saw that hers were stone cold had it coming to him she said he hurt a lot of folk good folk not just me that girl he abuse her a long time months now he wont and i wont be beat up no more for his meth and shit will nodded he walked toward the door then paused what the hell i cant take it with me and lindas set for life he reached in his pants pocket and came up with a wad of cash folded over and held together with a rubber band he peeled off five twenties and a onedollar bill this is for you he said handing her the twentydollar bills then he pulled a fedex ballpoint pen from his shirt pocket and on the onedollar bill wrote lex talionis third amp arch old city you find someone to help you get kendrik down to here theres a tenthousanddollar rewardhe paused to let that sink infor criminals like him you wont go to jail if i have to ill call and say i did it but you make sure you get the reward money maybe it will help you start a new life then will curtis turned and went through the front door behind the wheel of the rented ford minivan will curtis pulled the next envelope from the top of the stack on the dashboard he read its bill of lading under recipient was leroi cheatham n mutter street philadelphia pa kensingtonwhat a lovely part of town as least when the damn drug dealers arent having shootouts on the street corners he put the rented ford minivan in gear and accelerated off the busted sidewalk three executive command center the roundhouse eighth and race streets philadelphia sunday november pm youre on in fiftynine seconds mr mayor kerry rapier said the master technician was seated in a wheeled nylonmeshfabric chair behind a black fourfootwide control bank also on wheels that had a series of panels with buttons and dials its main feature a keyboard with a joystick and a color video monitor a fat bundle of cables ran from the control bank to the wall and ultimately to a rack of video recording and broadcasting equipment including the sodacansize digital video camera that suspended at the end of a motorized boom seemed to float overhead rapier a police department blue shirt whose soft features and impossibly small frame made him look much younger than his twentyfive years had shoulder patches on his uniform bearing two silver outlined blue chevrons he manipulated the joystick and the camera overhead zoomed in to tightly frame the face of the honorable jerome h jerry carlucci who stood at a darkstained oak lectern carlucci his brown eyes smiling said son are you sure youre even old enough to be a policeman let alone a corporal corporal rapier grinned with respect mr mayor thats not the first ive heard that carluccis brown eyes depending on his mood could be warm and thoughtful or intense and piercing largeboned and heavyset he was a massive fiftyoneyearold with dark brown hair he wore an impeccably tailored dark gray woolen twopiece suit with a light blue freshly pressed dress shirt and a navy blue silk necktie that matched the silk pocket square tucked into his coat standing shoulder to shoulder behind mayor carlucci was a veritable wall of white shirts police commissioner ralph mariana wearing his uniform with four stars and denny coughlin with the three stars of the first deputy police commissioner were directly behind the mayor and standing on opposite ends of them were homicide commander henry quaire whose uniform bore the captains rank insignia of two goldcolored bars and homicide lieutenant jason washington with the insignia of one butter bar on his uniform looming on the wall behind all of them was a grid of flatscreen tvs the screens alternately displayed either an official seal of the city of philadelphiathe newly designed one a golden liberty bell ringed by city of philadelphia life liberty and you in blue letteringor the blue philadelphia police department shield which bore the older seal of the city and honor integrity service in gold lettering earlier official city phrases had been the city of brotherly love and the place that loves you back the latter falling into disfavor after some wits in the populace reworded the slogan to read the place that shoots your backand worse variants thereof carlucci was about to give a prepared statement concerning the previous nights triple murders and the first five popanddrops in order to lend weight to his speech the mayor of the city of philadelphia was borrowing from the playbook of the police commissioner by using the executive command center ralph mariana held almost all of his press conferences in the ecc a stateoftheart facility that held an impressive display of the latest hightech equipment the electronics made for terrific photo opportunitiesand more important as mariana said helped give the public a sure sense of confidence that the police department had the best tools to safeguard its citizens during a crisis the eccs main objective was to collect assimilate and analyze during a crisis a mindboggling amount of wideranging raw informationpeople and places and events and morein a highly efficient manner and then to act on itinstantly if not sooner and thats exactly what the hell were doing this morning carlucci had bluntly told mariana when hed asked for everyone to gather in the ecc if this goddamn situation escalates it has the potential to turn the city into something out of the wild west the bulk of the ecc was given over to a massive pair of tshaped conference tables each dark gray formicatopped table seated twentysix and each of these fiftytwo seats had its own multiline telephone outlets for laptop computers and access to secure networks for ondemand communications with other lawenforcement agenciesfrom local to federal to the international police agency interpolas necessary along the back walls were more chairs to accommodate another forty staff members the focal point of the room however were three banks of sixtyinch highdefinition lcd flatscreen tvs there were nine tvs per bank on the tenfoothigh walls mounted edge to edge the frameless tvs could create a single supersize image or could display individual pictureseach tv could even be used in splitscreen mode usually when the screens were not showing live feeds from cameras mounted in emergency vehicles at the scene of an accident or crime they showed continuously cycling images from closedcircuit tv cameras that were mounted all over the cityin subways public buildings and main and secondary roadwaysand the broadcasts from local and cable tv news stations images could be pulled from almost any source even a cell phone camera as long as the signals were digitized the ecc fell under the purview of the science amp technology arm of the philadelphia police department which included the forensic sciences information systems and communications divisions its twostar commander deputy police commissioner howard walker reported to denny coughlin acting on an order issued that morning by the mayor walker had alerted the local news media that a live feed of mayor carlucci would begin at precisely pm eastern standard time the timing gave the tv news programs the opportunity to start their noon newscasts with the announcement that an important statement by the mayor of philadelphia concerning the rash of recent murders was coming up in five minutes stay tuned were back with that breaking news right after this commercial break thirty seconds gentlemen corporal rapier said four hours earlier when coughlin had led his group into the executive command center hed found the mayor and the police commissioner already seated at conference table one they had heavy china mugs steaming with fresh coffee before them on the table marianas mug read science amp technology executive command center the mayors mug read genos steaks south philly penna everyone in the ecc was casually dressed even the usually stiffly buttoneddown carlucci wasnt wearing a necktie and he had his shirt collar open and matt payne and tony harris still looked rumpled and messy the result of having been up most of the night running down leads in the death of reggie jones good morning gentlemen carlucci said in a solemn tone suggesting he meant that it was anything but a good morning he did not move from his chair except to grab his coffee mug handle there was a chorus of good mornings in reply mariana added fresh coffee in there he waved with his mug across the room indicating a door that led to a kitchenette carlucci then said sergeant payne no offense but you and detective harris look like hell considering what weve been through mr mayor payne said dryly hell sounds like an absolute utopian paradise i enjoy the thrill of the chase as much as the next guy but this ones a real challenge right now we dont know if were dealing with a single shooterslashstrangler or if there are othersthat is as someone put it earlier halloween homicide copycats ordinarily a lowly police sergeant speaking so bluntly to the highest elected official of a major city would be cause for disciplinaryif not more drasticmeasures but carluccis relationship with payne and most everyone else in the group was anything but ordinary back when hed been a cop carlucci had known and liked matts biological father and that went way back to when sergeant john f x moffitt had been the best friend of a young denny coughlin before being killed in the line of duty mayor carlucci was also well acquainted with matt paynes adoptive father whom he also liked very much and not only because brewster cortland payne ii was a founding partner of philadelphias most prestigious law firm and there was another connection between matt and hizzonor carlucci had been coughlins rabbihis mentorand had groomed the young police officer with great potential for the larger responsibilities that would come as he rose in the ranks of the department denny coughlin had gone on to groom peter wohl son of augustus wohl chief inspector retired and then peter wohlindeed among the best and brightest having at twenty graduated from temple university then entered the police academy and later become the youngest staff inspector on the departmenthad been in recent years matt paynes rabbi and more or less completing the circle the elder wohl had in his time been the rabbi of an upandcoming police officera young man by the name of jerry carlucci if i didnt know better matt mayor carlucci now said his face and tone suggesting more than a little displeasure surprising payne id say you were on the street working all night he paused to make eye contact with the white shirt hed mentored decades earlier then went on but i do know that must not be the case because wed all agreed that the wyatt earp of the main line would stay the hell out of sight for a certain cooldown period he looked again at denny or am i mistaken mariana quaire and washingtonthe direct chain of command also somewhat directly responsible for seeing that payne drove a desk so as to stay out of the newslooked a little ill at ease payne saw that howard walker was more than a little interested to see denny coughlin in the mayors crosshairs but coughlin while deeply respectful of carlucci and cognizant of carluccis iron fist and occasional temper was not cowed by him over the years hed learned a lot from his rabbi and one of the most important lessons was to make a decision then come hell or high water to stand by that decision time and again carlucci had told him ones inability to be decisive gets people killed make up your goddamn mindbased on the best available information or your gut or better bothand move forward denny coughlin now said evenly almost conversationally jerry i had the same initial reaction earlier this morning but in light of what were dealing with i decided to end the cooldown period as of today matts been all over the paperwork on these popanddrops and if we have any chance of quickly figuring out whos doing whatand we need to or its likely going to get ugly very fastwe need to be able to put him back on the street carlucci looked thoughtfully at coughlin a long moment then at payne then back at coughlin he grunted and put down his china mug with a loud thunk for the record denny color me not completely convinced maybe its because i recently spent so much time tryingkey word tryingto dissuade the media that we have a loose cannon in our police department he exhaled audibly but i do know better than to micromanage the people in whom i have absolute trust with a deadly serious face he looked at payne just try not to add to the goddamn body count got that marshal i dont want to have to answer any more questions from the damned press about you payne nodded yessir duly noted sir carlucci met his eyes and added that doesnt mean that i dont support you in what were righteous shootings you were doing your job and you did it well thank you sir okay everybody have a seat carlucci then said lets hear what youve got on the popanddrops matt yes sir payne said but as you noticed tony and i have been up all night i cant speak for tony but i could use some caffeine ill get em harris said heading across the room as the others sat down at the conference table four sergeant matt payne drained his second cup of coffee then made a grand sweeping gesture at one of the banks of tvs on its screens were images of the first five dead fugitivesboth their wanted sheets and crimescene photos from where theyd been droppedas well as detailed maps and lists of data showing where the bad guys had lived where they had committed their crimes and ultimately where they had been found dead he looked at mayor jerry carlucci and said and that is essentially what i put together from the files of the first five popanddrops theres no question that they were targeted killings by the same doer but the new ones from last night dont quite fit the profile targeted killings the mayor repeated payne nodded todays buzzword for assassination carlucci made a sour face lets stick with targeted killings in the statement and elsewhere or even just murders by perps unknown at least for now he looked around the ecc conference table and everyone nodded agreeably you said carlucci went on that with the exception of one of the first five all were dropped by the same doer at the district pd closest to the critters last known address and all had the same mo payne pointed to one of the tvs yes sir thats shown on number all were bound at their ankles and wrists all shot either in the chest or head and all with the same doers fingerprints which makes ushe glanced at tony harrisbelieve that we will find hes also responsible for at least two of the three dropped last night he left prints everywhere prints and piss carlucci cocked his head did you say piss when payne explained about the gallons of piss all over the lawyers office carlucci shook his head and said if id known i might have contributed never did like that gartner matt chuckled carlucci went on so piss and prints could be the doers just careless or stupidor worse or maybe he wants to get caught harris offered payne raised an eyebrow maybe hes damn sure leaving ample opportunity for that to happen just a matter of time so carlucci said again all we have for sure is one doer linked to the first five popanddrops thats correct payne said and maybe at least two of last nights threethe two who were shotif we find that the prints on them match those prints on the first five same for the third even though he wasnt shot exactly payne said strangled and beaten carlucci then wondered aloud what could be the significance of that payne shrugged maybe the doer ran out of bullets carlucci snorted lets hope so he said if not then we have two or more goddamn doers to collar so when do you get the prints that were taken last night back from iafis before noon in time for the statement iafis the fbis integrated automated fingerprint identification system was the largest biometric database in the world it held the fingerprints and other information collected from local state and federal lawenforcement agencies on more than fiftyfive million people lawenforcement agencies could access it at any time and run a search with the fingerprints they lifted from a crime scene it wasnt uncommon provided the submitted print or prints were clean to get a response in a couple hours as to whether there was a match in the database payne shook his head were still waiting for forensics to process the prints that were lifted you know what their motto can sometimes be enlighten me carlucci said dryly if we wait until the last minute to do it itll only take a minute there suddenly was a cold silence in the room and payne then realized from the furious look on walkers face that given difference circumstancessay the absence of walkers three immediate bosseshe would have reamed the hotshot homicide sergeant a new one nice job payne ol boy matt thought forensic sciences belongs to walker screw it maybe this will get them moving faster payne remembered one night at liberties bar when more than a couple of stiff irish whiskeys under both their belts coughlin had let slip that he was not a fan of walkers walker who spoke with a clerics soft intelligent voice cultivated a rather pious air coughlin felt that walker used all the bells and whistles of science amp technology as smoke and mirrors to disguise his incompetence but ralph said he had his reasons for asking me to give walker the job and write this down matty never argue with your boss still id love to know what angle walker is working on ralph mayor carlucci guffawed breaking the tension im going to have to remember to use that line back at city hall nothing gets done there not even in the last minute its always late if at all there were the expected chuckles okay carlucci said then i wont ask about ncic if we dont have prints to run we dont have a name to run the national crime information centeralso maintained by the fbi and available to law enforcement at any time day or nighthad a database containing the critical records of criminals additionally ncic tracked missing persons and stolen property its data came not only from the same lawenforcement agencies that provided iafis but also from authorized courts and foreign lawenforcement agencies ill go stoke the fire under them for those prints walker then offered lamely he stood and went over to use one of the phones at the other conference table bingo payne thought thatll get em moving faster ralph mariana then spoke up jerry what should be done about frank fuller payne put in ive had an unmarked sitting on fullers old city office thats fine matt mariana said but i meant what should be done about his nowinfamous rewards carlucci his face showing a mixture of anger and frustration said ive spoken with fuller privately about that bloodthirsty reward system of his ive tried to dissuade him suggesting that its encouraging criminal activity he said he didnt care that hed spend his last dime on lawyers defending that eyeforaneye thing the law of talion payne offered carlucci shot payne a look of mild annoyance for the interruption then went on especially he said after what happened to his wife and child what happened to his family mariana asked quaire offered i had that case in homicide it never got solved primarily because we believe the doers involved killed each other before we could get statements let alone bring charges anyway the wife and the girl a tenyearold i believe made a wrong turn at the museum of art and wound up a halfmile or so north in the wrong neighborhood at the wrong time cut down in a crossfire of singleaught buckshot jesus mariana said shaking his head thats tragic the table was silent a moment carlucci then said but i have no choice but to denounce him or at least what hes accomplishing with his reward denny coughlin cleared his throat you have something denny carlucci said say it just a point jerry giving credit where its due matt did bring up that for us to condemn the reward system would be somewhat hypocritical carlucci made an unpleasant face you cant be a little pregnant payne said what the hell is that supposed to mean carlucci asked looking at payne we cant say that fiveeffs paying out tengrand rewards fiveeff carlucci interrupted payne nodded francis franklin fuller the fifth long ago had his name boiled down to simply foureff you said five carlucci challenged payne looked around the table and all eyes were watching him with more than a little curiosity he thought there may have been a trace of wariness in coughlins payne raised an eyebrow then said francis can be pompous as you well know and when he annoys me i call him fiveeff short for fucking francis franklin fuller the fifth carlucci guffawed again a couple others followed his lead by chuckling coughlin shook his head all right carlucci said as hes come to annoy the hell out of me ill now say how does my denouncing fiveeff make me pregnant payne grinned he knew carlucci understood what hed meant by the analogy my point is sir that our department has partnerships with other agencies that offer rewards the fbi violent crimes task force for example he gestured with his thumb in a southerly direction the fbis office at arch street across from the federal reserve bank was damn near outside the back door of the roundhouse and im sure youll recall that we have our own tips hotline payne went on that through the citizens crime commission pays out rewards that go from five hundred bucks or so on up to thousands and when a cop gets murdered the fop administers rewards for info that leads to catching the doers so we already do what fiveeff does we just dont as was pointed out to mehe exchanged glances with coughlinencourage the killing of the critters carlucci started nodding all right i take your point we can massage that in the message so to speak now lets boil all this down to what im going to say thirty seconds mr mayor corporal kerry rapier said from behind the control panel jerry carlucci scrunched up his face and assumed a serious expression corporal rapier said in five four three two then pointed to mayor carlucci on the monitor mayor carlucci was perfectly framed in a tight shot of his face with mariana and coughlin looking over his shoulders carlucci said good afternoon citizens of the great city of philadelphia thank you for letting me into your homes today i respect your time and will be brief while it saddens me to have to appear here today to address a rash of murders i must tell you that i am very proud to be speaking to you from the roundhouse in the company of some of the finest lawenforcement officials anywhere as you may be aware in the last month five known criminalsall fugitives guilty of sexual offenseshave been killed and brought to the door of the philadelphia police department and last night three more murdered men were left at the door of an organization that offers rewards for the capture of criminals the city of philadelphia and our police department are grateful for any help in keeping our communities safe we encourage citizenswho can remain anonymousto provide tips that lead to the arrest and conviction of criminals simply call or tips depending on the case there are cash rewards for information that leads to a criminals conviction while we do applaud the removal of any criminal at large in our free society we cannot condone any such act that results in death that is murder and those responsible will be prosecuted to the fullest he paused to let that point sit with the various audiences since i have served both as your police commissioner and now as your mayor crimes have declined in our fair city major crimes such as homicides by as much as half while we are not where we would like to beone robbery or murder or rape is one too manywe are committed to crime prevention and criminal apprehension it is what we are well trained to do and i believe the statistics prove that we do it exceptionally well now in response to last nights criminal activity today i am pleased to announce that police commissioner mariana has formed a special task force to capture the armed and dangerous perpetrator operation clean sweep will be led by homicide unit sergeant m m payne carlucci paused as his image was replaced for a threesecond count by one of matt payne and carlucci payne in a crisp brooks brothers twopiece suit and tie was shaking hands with carlucci their left hands held up a plaque that at the top was emblazoned with the words valor in the line of duty whose name you may recognize as one of our highly decorated officers he could not be here in person as he already is fully immersed in the investigation carlucci now gestured to the white shirts behind him and went on sergeant payne will be fully supported not only by the philadelphia pd but by any other state and federal agencies whom we partner with in such initiatives as the fbi violent crimes task force and of course operation clean sweep will have the full force of all departmental assets which are legion he motioned to the panel of tvs corporal rapier worked the control panel and each screen instantly was replaced with images of nearly everything in the departments arsenal there was a pair of the aviation units bell l helicopters hovering over a grassy field their floodlight beams lighting up a suspect his hands up as uniforms on the ground converged members of the special weapons and tactical swat unit were rescuing a hostage a marine units twentyfourfootlong boston whaler its light bar on the aluminum tower pulsing red and blue was screaming up the delaware river and more dramatic imagery of the police department in action you have my word that our dedicated police department will apprehend the perpetrator and soon again thank you for your time and for your confidence may god bless you and keep you safe at least long enough for us to catch the damned murderer carlucci thought as he stared somberfaced at the camera as the boom swung pulling back from him payne was standing with harris and walker behind corporal rapier and the control panel as he heard corporal rapier say and were clear off the air payne felt his telephone vibrate he looked at its screen and saw the call was from the uniform hed stationed in the unmarked in old city he answered it payne then after a moment he said loudly what oh shit he felt eyes on him and looked up to see that everyone was indeed looking at him particularly carlucci payne was shaking his head as he listened to the phone then after another moment he said whats the cctv id number there he took a ballpoint pen from his pocket and not quickly locating any paper awkwardly held the phone to his ear with his shoulder while he wrote the code on his left palm thanks ill get right back to you he held out his left hand in front of corporal rapier kerry please punch up the feed from this cctv on the main screen payne nodded at that bank of tvs which had a realtime feed of the front facade of city hall as corporal rapiers fingers flew across the keyboard the main screen went to snowlike gray pixels what is it matt carlucci asked you are not going to believe this looks like fiveeff has received another charitable donation at his doorstep what the hell are you talking about matty coughlin blurted not ten minutes ago a woman arrived at the offices of lex talionis in a gypsy cab it was a minivanan oldermodel tan toyotaand when the side door opened onto the curb the woman got out she met the driver at the rear door of the van and together they wrestled a rolledup carpet out of the back they rolled it onto the sidewalk then the woman handed the driver his fare like it was something she did every day and he sped away gypsy cabstheir drivers unlicensed unregistered and usually uninsuredwere illegal but they were plentiful because they charged far less than legit cabbies and they were everywhere making them hard as hell to crack down on the tv screen came alive with the alltoofamiliar view in old city the office building at arch and north third that housed lex talionis everyone looked to it they saw that on the sidewalk by the front door four uniforms had formed a perimeter of sorts around a bloodsoaked ratty carpet it had been unrolledand on top of it was the motionless body of a naked black male just to the left of the carpet and its perimeter of cops was a fraillooking black woman she was gesturing wildly with a sheet of paper at the office buildings front door while another uniform both hands shoulder high with palms out tried calming her payne to no one in particular announced well that makes popanddrop number nine shall we assume the old lady is our doer harris said you cant be serious you dont really think payne turned and looked at him hell no tony not all nine anyway all i know is that my uniform in the unmarked just now said that that paper shes waving is a wanted sheet and shes screaming at that uniform on the sidewalk i want my reward is that mickey jason washington suddenly asked matt and tony turned and saw the wiry irishman with a video camera in his hands he was holding it high above his head clearly recording the confrontation between the uniform and the woman he now wore the blue tshirt with the white handcuffs and make his day kiss a cop at crimefreephillycom payne grinned sonofabitch must have been staking out the place too going to take some doing to get him to sit on that videoif thats even likely then he felt his cell phone vibrate and he looked at the text message on its screen amanda law armed amp dangerous when were you planning on telling me matt last i heard was that you were going to liberties to talk about the popanddrops now i have to find out from the mayor on the noon newscast that youre not only back on the street but in charge of a task force a oh shit matt said again i have to agree with matt carlucci said i want my reward oh shit five loft number hops haus tower n lee street philadelphia sunday november pm h rapp badde jr wearing baggy blue jeans and a red sweatshirt with temple law across the chest in white lettering was seated at the large rectangular marbletopped table in the breakfast area adjacent to the gourmet kitchen he had the television remote control in his right hand and was aiming it at the flatscreen that was mounted to the living room wall he stabbed at the mute button as he looked with some disgust at the image of a solemnfaced mayor jerome carlucci keep it up jerry and youll make it even easier for me to kick your italian ass out of office badde turned his attention to janelle harper who stood across the table from him skimming a massproduced flyer titled pennsylvanias property rights protection act amp you she was wearing a spandex sport outfit black with purple accents that clung to her curvy frame like a second skin and athletic shoes she had her hair pulled back and wore a pair of blackframed gucci designer eyeglasses more murders he said almost happily i can probably run on the crime issue alone and get elected mayor she looked away from the flyer and at him youre not really taking any joy out of those people being killed are you sorry honey but only because theyre already dead hell if nothing else ive probably lost a voter or not if whoever takes over for kenny can register their names to vote absentee speaking of kenny i wonder what the hell happened to him he glanced back at the television and there was now a live shot from old city showing policemen stringing up yellow crimescene tape the text at the bottom of the screen read fourth halloween homicide mother turns in fugitive sons dead body at lex talionis offices for reward mother says sons death was drugrelated jesus christ badde said jan looked at him then at the tv oh my god how awful theyre animals out there badde said then was quiet a moment hell look at the silver lining at this rate the outcry over all these killings might get so bad that carlucci resigns and i get appointed to take his place jan looked at him dont hold your breath badde gestured at the massive threering binder thick with looseleaf pages at her elbow its cover had in black block lettering the title philadelphia economic gentrification initiative when are we supposed to get the second wave of fed funds for pegi badde asked pronouncing the acronym peggy pegi was a special program devised by the housing and urban development committee one of dozens of such committees of the philadelphia city council the city council had seventeen members ten elected in their respective districts the remainder elected at large in the interest of balanced racial representation the seventeen chose a council president from among themselves and the president then decided which council members would serve on which committees as the number of committees far exceeded the number of council members it was common for the president to appoint each member to six or eight committees occasionally even more ask any council member though and theyd quietly admit that the sheer workload of serving on just one damn committee was daunting serving on many others became a logistical impossibility thus it was common for council members simply to choose a favorite committee and pay only lip service to all the others to which theyd been appointed not surprisingly any oversight by fellow council members within the committees was replaced by an unspoken agreement you pay attention to the business of your committee and ill pay attention to mine in other words mind your own goddamn business and so the chairman of each committee more or less had free rein he or she completely controlled the committees dealings with commerce in and out of city hall the letting of contracts the hiring of vendors and so on it actually proved to be an efficient model in the sense that it avoided the frustrating backandforth process of committee decisionmaking instead the chairman made a decision andvoilait was done without further debate to the city of philadelphia housing and urban development committee the president of the city council appointed city councilman at large h rapp badde jr as its chairman hud chairman badde upon returning from an urbanrenewal conference in bermuda conceived the philadelphia economic gentrification initiative he then funded the special program with a modest fifty thousand dollars from huds exploratory budget lineall of it federal moniesand immediately entered into an openterm vendor contract thereby avoiding a lengthy lowbidder selection process with commonwealth law center llp of philadelphia the law firm its practice heavily vested in real estate law would assist chairman badde and his committeein effect only badde and his executive assistantin the exploratory steps for two major gentrification projects volks haus and diamond development the latter created what was termed a multipurpose professional entertainment venue it would be an indoor coliseum with a retractable roof and convertible flooring it could house sixty thousand fans of everything from sports football basketball hockey soccer motocross racing et cetera to music concerts it was planned to be built just west of interstate in the upper end of northern liberties thus it would displace thousands of residents in order to demolish a vast chunk of city the former volks haus was to serve as one solution for the relocation of those residents the peoples house would be lowincome housing constructed on ten square blocks a few miles to the west in the fairmount area reclaiming what chairman badde called a damned unsightly black hole of moneylosing federal government propertyotherwise known as the eastern state penitentiary which happened to be a united states natural historic landmark smack dab in the middle of a struggling residential neighborhood the exploratory process was completed within twentyfour hoursalthough on paper the period was listed as three monthsand two minorityowned construction firms were awarded contracts conditioned on federal dollars fully funding pegi and the completion of the eminentdomain process janelle harper looked over the upper rim of her gucci eyeglasses at rapp badde she said those additional fed monies i was told after i finally got my calls returned from commonwealth badde interrupted why cant you just say her name he paused and shrugged and with a weak smile said wandas not that bad why ill tell you why because your wife treats me like your little girlfriendactually sometimes more like your little hoand not like your goddamned executive assistant she pulled at the spandex at her hips adjusting it then added im damned tired of it shes not the only one with a law degree from beasley temple university and its beasley school of law was a couple miles west of the condo tower on north broad jan met rapps eyes and said she needs to be your exwife badde suddenly sat up almost spilling his coffee are you kidding he said his voice almost squeaking do you know what the hell that would cost me i mean not only in money id lose political capital too so you dont want to do right by me make me an honest woman yes i mean no jan put her hands on her hips and cocked her head well which is it he sighed its not that simple honey dont goddamn honey me rapp its just better this way if i sued for divorce a lot of things would change he knew how much jan liked living in the luxury highrise especially for free this condo would go away for one she considered that a long moment what if she sues you for divorce for what for infidelity everyone saw that photograph of us in bermuda with more than a little confidence if not arrogance he shot back pennsylvania courts dont give a shit about cheating and my wife knows it how do you think i got away with that photo being run he saw jan eye him more carefully suspiciously like that was painful proof that she aint the first regular piece ive had on the side or maybe not the last i know because i asked rapp went on more evenly my lawyer told me even if the photos are in flagrante delicto in what in the act rapp screwing oh yeah even that i asked now why the hell did she ask that would she go that lowsend wanda photos of us fuckingthinking she could become mrs mayor instead but she could sue for other reasons could even say you beat her if she got mad enough to go after you he didnt say anything jan quoted hell hath no fury like a woman scorned badde sighed and said she wont how can you be so sure shes got the badde name got all that money and everything that comes with it why change what if she blows the whistle on pegi oh now that wont happen she likes the money too much once you been broke you dont ever want to go back if all the padded payments from pegi go so do all those billable hours the commonwealth law center gets from handling the business that will come from volks haus and diamond development and she can kiss goodbye those big steady retainer checks kwame construction has paid from the start jan looked at him a long moment and shook her head rapp im telling you that wives get revenge for a lot of reasons and theyre not thinking about money when they do it im telling you she wont he said smugly look were kind of like the us and russia were with that mutual asset deduction the what you know with missiles aimed at each other to knock each other out one fires both sides are toast after a moment jan figured it out and corrected him mutually assured destruction he looked at her and shrugged same difference if she tells on me i tell on her and away goes all her money and her license to practice law or anything else itd be suicide their met eyes again badde thought and if you havent realized it yet honey you and i are now in the same boat you know that kickbacks are funneled through commonwealth which also happens to be a nice contributor to my campaign for mayor and youre helping funnel them after a moment she nodded after a moment she nodded okay i guess youre right rapp i sure hope so she pointed at a thin sheaf of papers stapled at the top left corner the fed funds for pegi at least the lowincomehousing matching dollars were due here last week as was the paperwork that turns over possession of the prison to pegi and the volks haus initiative we need those funds before the next step there weve already cut checks for the first empty properties in northern libertiesbulldozers began some demolition last weekand then well be cutting checks for those holdouts maybe the bulldozers will convince them its time to take the money and move on and we wont have to evict and tell me again whats the next step at volks haus same as it was for the diamond project she handed him the thin sheaf of papers he glanced at the cover sheet it had the expected familiar letterhead commonwealth law center walnut street suite philadelphia pa the law center office he knew was two floors below his accountants office below that was printed in large lettering title eminent domain just compensation and measure of damages eminent domain has two stages jan said the first is to prove that its legal to take property and meeting that the second is to determine a fair price for the property he nodded then turned to page two of the document a table of contents and began reading pacsa just compensation other damages pacsa measure of damages pacsa fair market value he felt his eyes start to glaze over then scanned the rest stopping at the last one pacsa attempted avoidance of monetary just compensation he tossed the papers back onto the table jesus im glad i hired you to deal with this bullshit he smiled at her and when she smiled back he added hope we dont have any trouble with that last one i mean whats a fair price for abandoned buildings condemned buildings she corrected him the supreme court fixed that for us with the kelo vs city of new london decision there wont be any fifth amendment problems with the properties badde then motioned at a long cardboard tube on the table has the russian seen the architects drawings yuri had his assistant personally messenger them over from the diamond development office in center city she grinned slyly then added you know i think that messenger boy of his is really his concubine his what his young lover his concubine rapp stared at her with an incredulous look you shitting me whats a billionaire russian businessman doing with something like that i mean ive seen him with some incredibly hot women she shrugged female intuition maybe just dont say anything to him he has a mean goddamn temper guess thats how you get to be a billionaire jan said as she pulled the large sheets of architectural drawings from the cardboard tube badde got up from the chair and walked around the marbletopped table as he stood behind jan looking over her shoulder at the architects renderings for volks haus his hands slipped down to her waist he rested his chin on her shoulder as he squeezed her hips pay attention she said i am paying attention he said as he buried his nose in her neck and inhaled her lightly scented perfume attention to you ill pay even better attention with this fancy outfit of yours off she giggled then let her head drop back toward his just as she said i surrender baddes go to hell cell phone started ringing dammit badde said grabbing it and quickly checking the caller id it read unknown caller dammit he stepped back from jan and started walking toward the sliding glass door to the balcony yes he said into the phone the caller was yelling so loudly that badde had to hold the phone away from his ear jan could almost clearly hear what the caller was telling badde reggies dead theyre coming after me vi one ridgewood street philadelphia sunday november pm javier iglesia parked his silver dodge avenger across the street from the bazelon row house he counted at least a dozen teenagers and slightly older thuggish types milling about on the sidewalka handful of whom hed seen earlierand almost that many teens mostly girls sitting on the wooden porch and steps sasha bazelon sat in the same rocker shed been in when hed wheeled away her grandmother three hours earlier at first glance he mused someone could easily think that a crowd of troublemakers had swooped in to take advantage of a poor teenage girl right after the death of her only kin but javier now knew they werent troublemakers at least not all of them because he was very well acquainted with at least one person on the porchhis baby sister nineteenyearold yvetteand was familiar with a handful of the others including keesha cook who was sitting between sasha and yvette theyre here supporting sasha is what theyre doing and not trying to take advantage of her during this dreadful time even these punks who are looking at me suspiciously javier got out of the car and made eye contact with yvette as he started walking across the street she popped up out of her chair and went quickly down the steps toward him he was surprised what the hell is up with her but knowing his baby sister as well as he did nothing she did should ever have come as a surprise to javier iglesia what the very petite yvette iglesia lacked in physical heightshe stood fourfeettenshe more than made up for with a bubbly oversize personality she spoke almost nonstop mostly in rapidfire bursts gesturing wildly with her hands to make her points she had straight black shoulderlength hair framing a pretty face that clearly showed her puerto rican heritage her dark eyes were full of life and her small mouth was impressive not only for its dazzling smile but also for the raw expletives that came out of it when she was angry ones that javier said would embarrass a port of philly longshoreman dont forget yvette often said with a smile almost as a provocation that dynamite comes in small packages three hours earlier just as javier had backed up the van carrying principal bazelons body to the medical examiners office his cell phone had pinged alerting him to a new text message when he had looked at the phones screen the message surprised him yvette hey big bro so sad about principal bazelon must be very upsetting for you to have picked her up youre in my thoughts amp prayers love you his first thought what a sweetheart then how the hell did she find out so fast after processing the body of mrs joelle bazelon into the system that was the medical examiners officeputting the body bag in one of the stainlesssteel refrigerator compartments then entering the report and photographs taken at the scene into the computer filing systemjavier had called his sister hey i got your text thanks youre welcome she said her usual bubbly tone gone its its all just so awful yeah she was a terrific lady howd you find out so fast and that it was me i mean id barely left the scenehe paused and thought wrong wordthat is principal bazelons house when you sent that some guys walking around the neighborhood saw the me van and stopped to watch she knows those thugs watching from across the street maybe kim soo was right they were wannabe gangstasfromthehood you know those guys no not really they think theyre bad news jorges little brother paco he hangs with them which makes jorge mad then i was right and soo was wrong i knew i had that gut feeling they were up to no good yvette went on anyway paco told jorge he saw you at the bazelons and jorge texted me about the me van and principal bazelon dying and all javier knew only vaguely of either ramirez brother and then keesha called crying keesha keesha cook oh that keesha hows she connected she and sasha live on the same street longtime neighbors and friends and you know keesha used to come over and hang out yeah i remember that okay it all makes sense now words gotten out fast javier i mean theres already a big memorial at the middle school by the back door people coming by and leaving flowers and stuffed animals theres these big white bedsheets that theyre drawing on and writing poems and memories and stuff about her and theres already a memorial page dedicated to her on the internet people from around the worldand i mean around the world javier like china and shitare writing about what an influence she was to them someones even made a page with a map of the world and every time someone writes one of those notes or posts a photo of them one of these red pushpins pops up on the map showing where these people are in the worldafrica europe all over most of them are in philly though real thick red here then it gets thinner going out thats amazing all inwhatjust two hours amazing is what that is i just texted keesha and shes headed over to sashas im going to go over too talk her up you know i remember how terrible i felt when we lost our abuela and even then we had each other to lean on sashas so very alone now yvette you know sasha real good sort of sure why is she in any kind of trouble that you know of sasha no never why while i was there i heard her answering questions from the police what she told them wasnt much just that she came home late last night saw her grandmother was asleep on the couch then went to bed when she came down next morning her grandmother was dead yeah and look i think theres more i know theres more like what javier somebody had tied principal bazelons hands and wrists he heard yvette gasp he went on but when we got there whatever theyd been tied with was gone just bruises left you think sasha did something to her i cant imagine no but i do think something happened that she wont tell anyone especially the cops nobody talks to the man javier not if theyre smart and dont want no trouble no offense big bro i know that look im not saying sasha did anything wrong but something is not right about those bruises on her grandmother ones dr mitchell is going to see and question if he thinks the death wasnt as simple as just an old lady going to sleep and never waking up hell have to tell the police and then sasha might get in real trouble oh my god javier thats terrible im not saying she did anything to hurt her just that shes not telling everything that happened to her grandmother sasha is deeply hurt no question shes hurt but theres more than just sadness in her eyes theres fear is what there is fear of what javier sighed loudly then said i dont know what do you want me to do maybe just keep your eyes and ears open when you go over there was a long silence then she said okay sure anything id like to stop by too i didnt get a chance to tell her how sorry i was okay im walking over now see you shortly yvette iglesia ran to intercept her brother in front of the bazelon row house javier glanced at the crowd of tough guys on the sidewalk and saw that they were following his every step he recognized paco ramirez and thought hed look like the nice kid next door if not for the wannabe gangsta clothing javier nodded at him and paco nodded back as javier reached the sidewalk yvette met him he saw that her eyes were tearing as she hugged him she softly said you were right big bro about what she took a step back crossed her arms over her chest and looked up at javier shes only told keesha she said and keeshas only told me what he asked quietly she turned her back to the boys on the sidewalk then keeping her voice low practically spat out that fucking shit xpressxavier smith she paused and after javier nodded that he knew him went on he was here last night getting revenge on sashas grandmother for calling the cops on him she saw him stealing a neighbors tv he hid on the porch last night and when sasha got home from keeshas he forced his way inside she sniffled then wiped at her nose and cheek javier said what happened then you were right about principal bazelon being tied up he used the phone cord then he then he put a gun to sashas head and made her javier saw the tears flowing faster she angrily wiped them away and finished that fucking shit make her blow him and made her abuela watch thats what killed her jesus christ javier said softly he looked over his baby sisters head to the porch keesha was stroking sashas hair her abuela died of a real broken heart dr mitchell told me about those where stress damages the heart muscle especially an old weak one to the point of triggering a deadly cardiac arrest jesus yvette added and he threatened sasha said not to tell nobody that he could come back anytime and that he could get her anywhere javier shook his head and said no wonder shes terrified now she has no family and is constantly worried that xpress will come back she nodded were going to get her away from this walk over and see the memorial at the school you know maybe thatll make her feel a little better they both glanced back at the porch sasha was moving down the steps with keesha cook at her side everyone along the way stepped back making a path for her when sasha and keesha reached yvette and javier javier said i didnt get a chance to say earlier how much your grandmother meant to me sasha i am terribly sorry for your loss i really am sasha looked him in the eyes and simply said thanks javier looked at keesha and said good to see you glad you can be here for sasha keesha nodded then she said you going over to the memorial at the school i wouldnt miss it for anything he gestured for them to lead the way but when they turned to walk to fiftyfifth street sasha looked toward the intersection and froze her wide eyes terrified and from deep inside her came a gutwrenching moan that turned into a wail coming toward them having just turned the corner was a mediumsize black male in baggy jeans his head covered by the hood of his black sweatshirt when he looked up at the sound of the scream the hard face of xavier xpress smith was clearly visibleand judging by its shocked expression clearly caught off guard by the crowd at sasha bazelons house javier thought smiths eyesnow hugelooked particularly bloodshot hes hopped up on something hes come back sasha then cried out and she started bawling uncontrollably keesha holding her arm struggled to keep her from collapsing to the ground yvette gesturing wildly at xavier smith exploded that bastard stuck a fucking gun to sashas head last night made her go down on him in front of her grandmother the eyes of the crowd were all on yvette everyone was either not sure theyd heard what they thought theyd heard or was processing the incredibly awful news what paco ramirez asked its true yvette said almost killed sasha too then the eyes turned to xavier smith hed already started walking away from the group now glancing over his shoulderand looking guilty as hellxavier smith bolted across ridgewood and that nogood nigger just tried to get sasha again keesha screamed yvette started running dont let him get way cmon oh shit javier thought yvette wait when she didnt javier took off after her two male teenagers ran to a small red ford pickup truck they got in and tires squealing roared up the street almost everyone else took off to follow yvette who was furiously sprinting everyone but keesha who now sat on the sidewalk consoling a sobbing sasha see sasha said he said he would anytime a crowd at least twenty strong closed in on smith who now ran down the middle of fiftyfifth street barely dodging a chevy sedan its horn blaring and tires squealing he then bolted across beaumont avenue looking as if he were going to take a shortcut through the asphalt parking lot of shaw middle school there was a small group by the door to the school looking at and adding to the makeshift memorial for principal joelle bazelon they turned and watched smith approaching then saw the angry mob that was chasing himand fled the school grounds xavier smith turned to look over his shoulder and as he glanced back he tripped on the uneven surface of the parking lot he went down fast and hard hitting the asphalt facefirst it dazed him the crowd still led by yvette iglesia caught up in no time they circled xavier smith he remained motionless not much of a bad ass now are you yvette yelled between gasps for breath were sick of your shit pendejo paco ramirez saidand suddenly angrily began kicking him others immediately joined in shoes and boots striking him on his back and legs some of the girls were throwing their weight into their kicks their arms swinging with the exertion smith recoiled he pulled into the fetal position protecting his face with his arms oh shit street justice javier thought the punks getting what he deserves but the rest of the crowd joined in and javier could see that the frenzy was building on itself theyre going to kill him and then their lives are really ruined smith managed to roll over and reach underneath his sweatshirt he pulled out a chromeplated snubnosedcaliber revolver he waved it up at the crowd back off now the circle of angry teens instinctively took a couple steps backward two of the older males pulled out knives and anotherjavier recognized him as the driver of the pickup which he now saw was parked close bycame up to the circle carrying a baseball bat xavier smith jumped to his feet but stayed in a crouch as he cradled his torso with his left hand they must have fractured or broke some ribs javier thought smith waved the pistol at the crowd then one teenage boy in the crowd laughed he taunted him woohoo you crazy xpress smith aimed the pistol at him as the boy went on you got only five maybe six bullets in that gun theres a whole lot more of us than that and you aint getting no chance to reload said another teenage boy smith jerked the pistol to aim it at him then a teenage girl added yeah you cant shoot us all he aimed the gun at her then another laughed and said you must be snorting too much of your own shit suddenly someone in the crowd behind xavier smith threw a broken red clay brick one that had once been part of the old school buildings wall it struck smith square in the back of the skull causing him to crumble to the cracked black asphalt he dropped the pistol as he went down the gun bounced twice but did not go off as the circle again closed in on smith a lone hand reached down and grabbed the gun the pistol disappeared into the mass of teenagers now they are going in for the kill javier iglesia thought thats enough javier shouted stop or youll kill him so one teenage male in the crowd shouted in reply yeah after all the things this shit has done to people another voice added the beefy javier started muscling his way into the circle grabbing elbows and pulling shoulders he forced open a path to the center just as he reached the limp and bloodied body javier saw an elbow swinging toward him he failed to duck in time and the elbow caught him in the corner of his right eye shit javier screamed out in pain instantly covering his injured eye with his right hand he swung his left hand over his head goddamn it everybody just fucking stop yvette get them to stop paco ramirez stepped next to yvette iglesia and waved his arms at the crowd hey everybody stop who hit javier it took a moment for the momentum to slowthere were a couple last kicks at xavier smithbut finally the crowd stood still and stared down javier javier said listen to me you kill him youre going to run from that the rest of your lives itd be worth it a male teen in the crowd shouted javier went on its not worth it is what im telling you you need to let him get arrested get charged with murdering principal bazelon no cops paco said no way the reward javier suddenly remembered let that rich guy fuller turn him in he said take xpress in and get that tenthousanddollar reward yvette looked at her brother and her face lit up as she said thats right then she looked at the crowd and said javiers right this piece of shit actually is worth something and we can share the reward with sasha she looked again at javier wheres the place he thought back to the medical examiners office unit that had picked up the three bodies the previous night in old city arch and third place is called what the hell was it lex talionis yvette nodded she then turned to the male with the baseball bat and said go get your truck he ran to the red ford pickup got in and sped back two teenage males were already waiting with the unconscious xavier smith in their hands everyone watched as the pair threw his limp body into the back of the truck like some sack of trash then climbed in after him five others followed filling the small truck until its rear seat sat low with their weight then the truck roared away yvette turned to javier she reached up and gingerly pulled back his right hand inspecting the injury oh wow she said wincing thats going to be a nice shiner then she smiled and added big bruise for big bro great just what i need he said he pulled out his cell phone scrolled the list of stored numbers and called the one hed entered as sgt payne wonder what the odds are of xpress being alive when they get there two homicide unit interview room ii the roundhouse eighth and race streets philadelphia sunday november pm i want my reward shauna mays repeated to sergeant m m payne yes youve said that and ive told you we need some questions answered about kendriks death payne felt his cell phone vibrating he carefully pulled it from his pants pocket he glanced at its screen but did not recognize the caller id number so he let the caller get routed into voice mail and i want these damn handcuffs off she said i aint done nothing wrong interview room ii was small ten by twelve feet and held only a single bare metal table and two metal chairs all pushed up against one wall the chair that shauna mays sat in was bolted to the floor one end of a pair of handcuffs was clipped around a bar on the seatback the other cuff around her left wrist on the opposite wall was a fourfootsquare oneway mirror the room was harshly lit and it was cold shauna mays her arms and legs crossed shivered in her dirty loosehanging tshirt and torn black jeans payne was not sure if the cause was the clothing or her obvious lack of a recent bath but she gave off a musty odor that reeked of filth he tried not to come too close to her there was a handheld digital audio recorder on the table between them but the real recording equipment audio and video was behind the oneway mirror in the small viewing room tony harris watching the interview with jason washington was running the camera it had taken no time at all to bring in shauna maysthird and arch was only four blocks from the roundhouseparticularly after mayor jerry carlucci let loose with his famous temper when he saw her and her dead son on the bank of tv monitors in the executive command center after saying oh shit his very next breath had been get that damn uniform to arrest her right damn now on suspicion of murder and bring her here for questioning i damn well just said that those responsible for any death will be prosecuted to the fullestand goddamn it thats whats going to happen matt payne now looked down at the gaunt and badly bruised woman and took pity someones really slapped her around especially in the face and her hand which she must have tried to use for protection she could barely stand on her own two feet while they were rolling her fingers for prints and checking her hands for gunpowder residue the only person shes a danger to is herself he said ill remove the cuff but one thing goes wrong and it goes back on she nodded taking out his handcuff key payne asked who hit you who you think kendrik he nodded can i get you something to eat or drink he asked as he removed the cuff maybe a soda payne looked to the oneway mirror he couldnt see anyoneexcept of course the reflections of himself and shauna maysbut he knew that on the other side of the glass theyd see him looking and that theyd bring the drink from the small refrigerator that was kept stocked in the unit a moment later there was a knock on the door and when payne unlocked and opened it a crack a massive black paw of a hand reached in with a screwtop plastic bottle of grapeflavored soda and a snacksize bag of tastykake thanks jason he said taking them and then closing and locking the door payne placed both on the table before shauna mays as she reached for them her bruised hand trembled he said would you like me to open them she nodded she ate the whole bag of tastykake in about three mouthfuls washing it down with half the soda in two swallows then she loudly belched she looked at payne but said nothing payne pulled from his pocket a small notepad and pen then reached over to the recorder and pushed its red button to begin recording he glanced at his wristwatch and said today is sunday november first time is onetwenty pm this interview is being held in the philadelphia police department homicide unit and conducted by me sergeant m m payne badge number he looked at shauna mays who seemed to be mesmerized by what payne had just said either that or all of a sudden the sugar and salt in her system is throwing off her blood sugar balance he said would you please state your name shauna shauna mays and where do you live ms mays in philadelphia okay and your address is uh over on wilder that would be wilder street philadelphia she nodded uhhuh that right have you been read your miranda rights ms mays my what you have the right to remain silent the right to have an attorney oh yeah she interrupted that first cop did that and youre freely willing to now answer any questions yeah sure just so i gets my reward right well get to that ms mays first kendrik mays is your son correct yeah he my boy can you tell me what happened to kendrik he got hisself killed yes maam im aware of that how did it happen he was doing bad long time he had it coming because he beat you you did say hes responsible for the bruises on your body she looked at him oddly i dont understand did you kill him no i told that first cop that okay then how did it happen ms mays i guess that bullet killed him payne exhaled audibly okay lets start from the beginning who had the gun a delivery guy he come in with kendriks paper that paper i had that the cop took the wanted sheet yeah thats it he come in andno wait first he say he got a check for kendrik and when i let him in he give me the paper the sheet said there was no check this began at what time she cocked her head time this morning all i know aint no clocks in a crack house payne nodded as he wrote that on his notepad and thought right if somethings not nailed down its sold for drugs my god what a way to live what did this guy look like and was he alone anyone else in the house just him old white guy maybe my age tall kinda skinny payne wrote that down and asked he give you a name you ever see him before nope she said shaking her head i think kendrik did something bad to this guy or maybe to his family robbery rape something once my boy got in the drugs he was no good payne noted that on his pad then said this old white guy your ageanything unusual about him anything at all special or different you remember about him she thought about that for a moment then she grinned he give me money a hundred dollars he did how many times that going to happen some white guy come in your house and give you a hundred dollars then tell you how to get ten thousand more shes almost giddy the sugar must really be kicking in she squinted her eyes at payne and wagged her right index finger at him and i want my reward this man had a gun she looked at payne with an expression that suggested he was nuts how else kendrik get shot had to i never saw it but it made a loud noise sounded like a cannon boom in the basement thats where kendrik was shot in the basement do we have your permission to go through it and search your whole house she nodded then snickered if you want sure just try not to make a mess she looked at payne and said her tone flat that was a joke now shes feeling so good shes a damn comedienne payne nodded then said you do know its against the law to tamper with the scene of a crime remove or otherwise alter evidence she shrugged payne raised an eyebrow then went on okay do you know the cabbie who helped you she shook her head no he just the first one whod help me had to walk four blocks till i found him on reed street only charged me twenty bucks said he was sorry for me but glad to see kendrik got what he deserved nobody liked that boy payne wrote that as he asked and this cabbie helped you do what hes a really big guy he took that rug and rolled kendrik up in it then carried him to the car ms mays thats the tampering with evidence im referring to you shouldve called and she laughed call what i aint got no phone and i sure as hell wouldnt call no police if i did payne stared at her amazing you get beat to hell and back someone blows away your son in your basement but whatever you do dont call the good guys he went on are you also aware its against the law to harbor a fugitive harbor let him live with you she sat up in the chair puffed up her chest and in as loud and angry a voice as she could muster said i didnt let him live with me i throwed him out over and over but he come back and when i try throwing him out again after he been in jail thats when he beat me really bad what can i do i got no money to move out so i just deal with it all her voice trailed off she reached for the soda bottle and drained it then she crossed her arms and glared at payne i want my reward payne looked back at her then glanced at his watch and said to the recorder interview paused at oneforty pm he stood stuck his notepad in his pocket and said ill be right back he left the handcuff off her but using the sliding bolt locked the interview room door from the outside only jason washington was in the small observation room when payne entered the minute you got her permission washington said his deep sonorous voice answering the unasked question tony went to get a search and seizure warrant signed by the judge and sent the crime lab to her house if that house is anything like its resident i doubt were going to get anything of real use other than maybe a bullet fragment the shooter probably collected his shell casings washington nodded and said youre probably correct matthew but you know to never say never and always check the rock under the rock payne said with a smile citing washingtons wellknown rule of thumb for conducting thorough investigations i learned you well young matthew washington said mockseriously payne looked at shauna mays through the window and parroted her i want my reward washington chuckled but then in a serious tone said and she should get it considering the hell she went through payne looked at him then back at her after a long moment he said jason are you thinking what im thinking she didnt do it washington immediately answered shes arguably guilty of a whole host of other mistakes in life but murder isnt one of them and after one look at her physical condition the da isnt going to go after her for harboring a fugitive payne nodded we could throw tampering with evidence charges at her or even accessory to murder but why i doubt the da would press charges if they caught her jaywalking washington said well hold her till we see what if anything they find at the scene then let her loose to collect her reward they looked at her again after a moment payne said coldly im betting this wont be the last we hear of shauna mays and not alive great minds follow similar paths matthew i agree therere ten thousand reasons why the whole hood will be after her money matt payne then felt his phone vibrating again when he pulled it out he saw the call was from the same number as the call hed ignored earlier he looked at washington shrugged and said excuse me he answered it payne after a moment he said hold on then hit the speakerphone key you still there sergeant payne javier iglesias voice came over the speaker yeah javier payne said im here with lieutenant jason washington hey lieutenant javier interrupted havent seen you in quite a while how are you javier washington asked not real good i was just telling sergeant payne that im near my home in kingsessingsouthwest philadelphia we know it payne said whats this you just said about a principal bazelon being murdered we got the call from twelfth district this morning that shed died in her sleep iglesia began but i just found out she really died during a home invasion by a really bad dude named xpress jones and now part of that crowd is taking xpress down to collect that tengrand reward iglesia finished some five minutes later it being a homicide and all i thought youd want to be the ones who grabbed him give me this animals name again javier payne said pulling out his notepad and flipping to a clean page xpress smith xavier smith aka xpress black male twentyfour payne wrote it down okay got it any unusual features to look for to id him javier snorted other than being attached to an angry mob of wannabe gangbangers and the teng price tag on his head dont worry sergeant you cant miss him xpress is pretty messed up thanks javier weve already got someone down there ill give him a headsup later javier said payne broke the connection then slipped the cell phone back in the left front pocket of his pants matt payne looked at jason washington and said so we have a mother bringing in her dead son and now we have streetjustice punks cashing in a really bad guy and those first eight popanddrops killadelphia indeed the vigilantesand now we know theres at least oneare everywhere worse im beginning to think operation clean sweep has been commandeered by fiveeff well francis fullers reward system is certainly superior to ours in attracting attention washington said to start with hes not a cop and as we well know nobody on the street wants to talk to cops payne grunted he said carlucci is really going to blow his cork when he hears about the street vigilantes turning in this thug and that kendriks doer is still loose and we can presume still active next time you see my head itll probably be on a platter payne looked at washington a long moment then sighed he said youre smarter than i am jason what the hell do i do next applying for the monastery ever cross your mind three jefferson and mascher streets philadelphia sunday november pm bobby what the hell does five fucking minutes matter thomas little tommie turco glanced at his wristwatch and anxiously tapped his steeltoed work boot the permit says two oclock start time were wasting daylight not to mention burning rental money go on and swing it puffing on a stub of a cigar stuck in the corner of his mouth the bulky thirtyeightyearold turcowho was anything but littlestood on the step outside the cab of a redandwhite linkbelt crane hed rented two hours earlier a weathered cardboard sign cut somewhat square was taped to the door of the cab it was poorly handlettered with a black permanentink marker turco demolition amp excavation not for hire under contract with city of phila hud you got it boss said bobby the ballbuster bucco who was sitting at the controls he fired up the linkbelts diesel engine little tommie then gave a thumbsup to jimmy dirtball turco his cousin was at the controls of a massive caterpillar dk bulldozer that sat next to a pair of bobcats with frontend loading buckets and a line of five heavyduty dump trucks waiting to haul away debris the bright yellow nineton dozer roared to life then its twin tracks and giant front blade began kicking up clouds of dust as the dozer started pushing into piles the scattered busted debris of the onetime residential neighborhood this was the second time in the last ten days that turcos beefy crewnot one of the men weighed an ounce under twofiftyhad worked this northern liberties job site the first time during a solid week of working dawn to dusk every day but sunday they had taken almost the entire block down to bare earth little tommie himself would have admitted that it wasnt really all that impressive an accomplishment if only because over the years almost half of the row houses had burned and their shells had been removed by crews from the city of philadelphia turcos equipment only had to scrape up and truck off the concrete footings and sometimes not even those were left just weedchoked dirt the reason turcos crew had not been able to finish the job all at onceand had to return todaycould be explained in part by the signs recently posted on the property there were four shiny new large ones fourbyeightfoot sheets of plywood painted bright white and nailed to fourbyfourinch posts each erected on a corner of the block lettered in black was moving philly forward coming soon to northern liberties new jobs project cost to taxpayers zero another fine development for your future from the philadelphia economic gentrification initiative a project of the city of philadelphia housing amp urban development councilman h rapp badde jr chairman and there were a score or more smaller signs that had been made with a stencil they had been spraypainted on the exterior doors and walls of the last five standing row houses on the block all of which were in a group at the southwest corner of the job site the stencils read official notice condemned property certified unfit for human habitation under state of pennsylvania urban redevelopment law no trespassing fortyfive days earlier the entire block had officially been declared a blight and then condemned every owner of the individual properties had been served a notice of condemnation that week and allexcept for the five holdoutshad let expire the thirtyday period for challenging the condemnation they had taken their checksmost of the owners grumbling that pegi paid them only pennies on the dollar for their properties never mind that many of the houses had been genuine hazards and public nuisances or damn close to itand moved on they understood that they were powerless to fight the inevitable and change was inevitable theyd spent at least the last year looking at the looming twentyonestory hops haus complex just three blocks to the south and right next to the fancy new schmidts brewery development the five holdouts however were not easily persuaded they had protested every day marching with signs and chanting even as turcos crews and their heavy equipment created an intimidating environment while tearing down the rest of the block right up to their doorsteps the holdouts had even plastered homeprinted handbills all over the neighborhood including on the brandnew bright white signs at the four corners of the block the handbills displayed a crude image of a black politician wearing a tiny black bow tie above the words councilman rapp badde wanted for crimes against the poor amp disadvantaged of philly last seen stealing homes amp tearing down neighborhoods help stop him or yours is next but then little tommie had gotten the call that the holdouts had finally been dealt with and that turco demolition and excavation had the green light to reduce the remaining properties to rubble that call had come in two days earlier after office hours on friday afternoon and it had been from some fellow who announced to little tommie that hed been tasked at hud as the new expediter for pegi projects he said were all good to go little tommie had told bobby the ballbuster after hed hung up the phone they were sitting in turcos office cutting the dust of the day with a couple glasses of scotch whisky but i just turned that damn crane back in to the rental shop turco had then had to call and reserve another crane a slightly smaller one that at least was cheaper than the one hed just turned in but he wasnt overjoyed with the news that the earliest it could be available was sunday noon i hate working sundays hed said when hed slammed down the receiver now from his seat in the cab of the rental crane bobby the ballbuster could see a few of the protest signs the holdouts had carried one that he could clearly see read eminent domain theft by govt another said th amendment yes and had the international symbol for noa red circle with a red backslashacross the words philly hud and pegi the signs were in the dirt beside the first twostory row house he was about to tear down using a fourthousandpound forgedsteel wrecking ball the pearshaped ball was on a rusty hook at the end of the thick heavy steel cable that hung from the tip of the cranes sixtyfoothigh boom a secondary steel line attached to the top of the wrecking ball ran laterally to a drum right beneath the cab the drum had a clutch that when released would allow the drum to turn freelyand the twoton ball to swing like a pendulum after the ball struck the building the drum would reel it back so it could be released again to knock another hole in the structure and so on until nothing remained but rubble now aimed at the brick siding of the fadedred row house the ball was positioned ten feet above the ground and directly in front of the cabs windshield bucco could almost reach out and touch it instead he put his hand on the lever that worked the clutch on the lateral drum whatre you waiting for little tommie said as he removed the cigar from his mouth and spat out a piece of tobacco leaf bobby the ballbuster threw the lever and there came an earpiercing metallic screech as the drum spun and the wire cable unspooled the two tons of forgedsteel wrecking ball swung toward the row house the ball struck more or less on targetand sailed right on through the brick siding the impact caused the ground to shake bucco then threw the lever to engage the lateral line drums clutch the cranes huge diesel engine roared there came another screech as the wire cable wound back on the drum the pearshaped ball appeared in the pearshaped hole it had made then slowly returned to its position in front of bucco go again turco said impatiently bucco threw the lever the drum screeched and the ball swung and the row house shook on impact this time though the kinetic energy punched a hole in the wall that was three times the size of the ball itself wood splinters flew turco dodged one of the small pieces that managed to fly all the way to the crane the cranes diesel engine roared again as bucco retracted the ball as it came out they suddenly saw a small tan mongrel dog peering out of the big hole on the second floor it had no collar it looked around nervously then jumped down to the ground tumbling when it hit the dog got to its feet shook its head and ran off as if it were on fire oh for petes sake bucco said i thought these houses were finally cleared looked like a damn stray turco said reasonably and now the mutts gone bucco looked at him and said i dont know tommie im getting a bad vibe maybe id better go and doublecheck turco looked at his watch then said it was just a fucking mutt just swing it again we can knock these shitforhouses down in a couple hours and i can return this crane by five and only pay for a halfday rental then we can get the hell off this job and on to the next one bucco looked at him a long moment then at the big hole in the wall then back at turco he shrugged and said awww all right youre the boss the next swing of the twoton ball took out almost all the rest of the upstairs exterior wall which caused the roof to partially collapse and again bobby the ballbuster threw the lever that caused the drum to begin reeling in the lateral line this time though there was something stuck on the ball bucco and turco knew it wasnt unusual for either the ball or the cable to snag somethinganything from electrical wiring to abandoned furnitureand carry it outside but as the ball exited the massive hole in the secondfloor wall it was clear that this wasnt any building material as the ball was reeled closer to the cab they had a stomachturning view of what had gotten snagged shit shit shit bucco said as he stared through the cab windshield at the wrecking balland at the limp body of one of the male holdouts his jacket caught on the rusty hook that held the ball his lifeless eyes stared back at bucco bobby the ballbuster struck little tommie with the cab door as he flung it open buccos vomit splashed all over turcos steeltoed work boots four executive command center the roundhouse eighth and race streets philadelphia sunday november pm thank you commissioner walker sergeant matt payne said into the receiver of one of three multiline telephones on the conference table in front of him he looked at detective tony harris seated next to him and rolled his eyes as he added im really grateful for your having pushed the processing of those prints he looked past harris and saw that not only had corporal kerry rapier caught the unflattering gesture he was grinning at it hes not one of his starchy bosss biggest fans either payne looked at the desk sign on the conference table between him and harris as sort of an inside joke payne had fashioned it out of a sheet of legalpad paper hed folded lengthwise twice to make an inverted v handprinted on it was task force operation clean sweep the sign reminded payne that deputy police commissioner howard walker had been among the first to flee the ecc after mayor carlucci had stormed out still fuming over kendrik mayss mother bringing in his bloody body for a tenthousanddollar reward police commissioner ralph mariana had then told payne what jerry announced about you having the full support of the department wasnt just thrown out there for the benefit of appeasing the public hed paused and smiled i think though that the part about calling in the fbi and others for help was jerrys never been a fan of the feds coming in and telling us how its supposed to be done i know im not mariana had looked from first deputy police commissioner denny coughlin to deputy police commissioner howard walker to captain henry quaire to lieutenant jason washington all were standing in a loose group near the doorway and all nodded their agreement whatever you want matt youve got just say i appreciate it payne had said but i believe that right now what i havehe motioned to harris and to corporal kerry rapier seated at his control panelis all operation clean sweep needs running lean and mean to start will help keep us focused and the confusion to a minimum i can always add people as i go but if i get too many people in here too fast well spend more time and effort keeping the navelgazers busy than actually hunting the doer understood your call all i ask is for someone to keep me posted so i can keep jerry in the loop mariana nodded once and went out the door walker had then said kerry you heard him anything sergeant payne needs and hed looked at quaire and washington and added if theres anything i can do let me know then walker had bolted payne had seen the exchange of looks between coughlin quaire and washington while not one of them would have said it aloud payne knew what they were thinking that walker was headed to forensics to chew out in his snooty manner whomever he deemed responsible for the delay in processing the halloween homicides fingerprintsand the resulting egg on his face before the mayor of philadelphia coughlin had simply said let us know matty and they were all gone payne had walked to the door and swung it almost completely closed then hed turned and looked between tony harris and kerry rapier and said either of you buy that leanandmean bullshit they had grinned me neither i havent a fucking idea of what to do first he gestured at the banks of tv monitors that showed all the images of the popanddrop victims the volumes of evidence and live feeds that included a video of shauna mays being handcuffed except after interviewing this woman hizzonor wants to make an example of to run a finetoothed comb back through everything payne took a sip from his china mug of black coffee then said kerry would you please punch uphe glanced at the second bank of nine sixtyinch flatscreen tv monitorsnumber seventeen reggie joness file on the main bank the monitor still displayed various images and data from the first eight popanddropsthe five from the previous month and the three from last nightnow all collected on the monitors numbered ten to eighteen and within the last hour rapier had added that of kendrik mays including the video of paynes interview of shauna mays the third bank of nine monitors numbers nineteen through twentyseven now showed the rotating feeds of video from the departments various cameras around the city as well as feeds from two local tv news broadcasts yes sir rapier said and his fingers flew across the keyboard the image from tv monitor number seventeen was then duplicatednine times largeron the main bank of monitors the image was from a digital video recording that had been shot at the crime scene the previous night and showed the old city sidewalk with the battered body of reggie jones lying inside the yellow policeline tape the scene was brightly lit by a pair halogen floodbeams that were mounted high on the side of the medical examiners office panel van which also held the video camera in the bottom righthand corner of the image was an id stamp richard saunders holdingslex talionis third amp arch hours nov corporal rapier then typed a few more keystrokes and up popped another text box it contained name reginald reggie jones description black male age ft in lbs lka daly st phila call received nov hours prior arrests total possession of cocaine and distribution of cocaine on probation for possession of crack cocaine cause of death blunt force trauma andor strangulation case no popndrop notes badly beaten by suspects name unknown snu snu ligature strangulation caused by plastic zip ties two inchlong zip ties put together to make a single inchlong tie mildly mentally retarded body transported to lex talionis old city brother is kenneth j jones black male age a fugitive wanted on warrants for crack cocaine possession with intent to distribute payne and harris were looking at the image and reading the text still using popndrop as the code for the master files kerry payne asked the youthful corporal grinned then said yes sir it just made sense to stick with the obvious what about the fact that jones wasnt shot hey getting beat up can be called getting popped rapier said reasonably besides i didnt want to have to recode all the others to fit this way its consistent from the start he looked at payne who was still studying the main screen then felt he needed to explain better with the master files all linked by popndrop the system can build on any of the previous composite reports tables graphs maps et cetera that you created with the information from the earlier case files payne turned to him and nodded he said okay kerry i really have no problem with that it was just an idle question yes sir rapier said rapier knew that payne was well versed in how the system worked that it went into the digital files and took key wordsnames locations weaponry et ceteraand attempted to crossmatch them first to the files coded popndrop and then to all the other master case files in the system if the system found a possible connection it would generate a digital report citing those cases and the connections and of course it was able to then feed all that information to the fbis national crime information center and attempt to crossmatch with ncics vast criminal database that was constantly updated by law enforcement across the country so theres commissioner walkers handiwork in the notes section tony harris said casually pointing with his ink pen in the direction of the text box on reggie joness image and its not good news payne said looking at it forensics it appears has found more than one doers prints on jones well then harris said with a smile on the positive side that means we have twice the chance of getting lucky with iafis putting a name to those snus iafis was the fbis integrated automated fingerprint identification system snu was the abbreviation for suspect name unknown kerry payne said would you click on reggies snus thought youd never ask marshal rapier said payne ignored the curious sudden reference to his nickname wyatt earp of the main line but saw out of the corner of his eye that rapier was grinning then on the monitor over the text box a cursor appearedand he immediately understood it is different kerry payne said harris snorted the digital pointer onscreen was not the usual black arrow it was an actual image of a colt acp officers model pistol rapier knew it was paynes favorite sidearm i thought youd like it marshal changing the cursor image was easy enough this next part took a little work all the underlined words in the case file were hyperlinks that allowed a system user to access additional information on the case corporal rapier moved the colt pistol over the underlined snu when he clicked on it three things happened in rapid succession first the sound of a pistol firing emanated from the speakers second a puff of smoke appeared and disappeared from the muzzle of the pistol cursor and third a box popped up that was headlined suspect name unknown it held digitized images of fingerprints that had been lifted from reggie jones now harris laughed out loud thats great payne looked at rapier and said have a little extra time on your hands lately corporal rapier looked back appearing a little embarrassed and shrugged didnt take that long you dont like it no i think its great too kerry payne returned his attention to the big monitor and rapier moved the cursor to the underlined snu after another click of the cursor complete with firing pistol effects a second box popped up with digitized images of fingerprints this one headlined suspect name unknown as in the previous box there was a hyperlinkreginald reggie jones case no popndropreferencing back to reggie joness master case file that meant at least for the moment that the two sets of fingerprints were associated with only a single crimehis murder well the good news is that both doers left really clear prints even if theyre far from a full set payne said iafis should have no trouble with them assuming theres a match on file harris said payne grunted he knew that had been the problem with the first five popanddrops when they ran the prints though iafis nothing came back it was possiblethough hard to fathom payne thought considering the shooter had killed five peoplethat the doer had never been fingerprinted well we should know in a couple hours payne said he turned to rapier and said lets see what weve got on gartner he looked at the second bank of monitors looks like lucky number thirteen kerry rapier worked his control panel and the image from tv monitor number thirteen replaced the main screens image of reggie jones it was somewhat similar to jonessa brightly lit shot of the sidewalk outside francis fullers office building in old city but this image from the medical examiners video recording showed two bloodied bodies with the smaller of the two slightly grayedout and blurred so it was instantly clear which of the dead was gartner the bottom righthand corner id stamp was also slightly different richard saunders holdingslex talionis third amp arch hours oct payne harris and rapier read the text box that next appeared name daniel o danny gartner description white male age lbs lka callowhill st phila and hall st phila prior arrests none call received oct hours cause of death gunshot andor suffocation case no popndrop notes snu gartner was a

old city well no surprise there matt payne said whys that matt harris asked kerry go ahead and click on his snu i think i know where this is going the colt pistol pointer fired and smoked over the hyperlink a box headlined suspect name unknown popped up it had seven different sets of fingerprints some with two or three fingers one with only a finger and thumb and it had seven case file

popndrop juan rivera case no popndrop holy shit tony harris said the prints are from the same doer yeah payne said his tone frustrated i thought i recognized that snu number when i saw it and not a single hit with iafis nope not one payne said the problem is all we get with this guys fingerprints is more of his fingerprints he makes no effort to cover his tracks its incredible and piss corporal kerry rapier said dont forget the piss right payne said and the useless piss payne looked at the list i can damn near recite from memory everything about those first five mostly because what little we have on them is pretty much the same starting with of course whoever the hell shot them all male fugitivesthree black one white and one hispanic an illegal alienwith a history of sex crimes against women or children all shot either in the head or chest at pointblank range the only autopsy results we have so far are from them riverahe gestured at the second bank of monitorsthere on number sixteen had two fullmetaljacket millimeter rounds in his chest whitey walsh on number fifteen the lone white guy must have had one helluva hard head because somehow a jacketed hollowpointcaliber round went in at the base of his skull and stayed there after scrambling his brains jesus harris said thats the kind of thing that generally happens only with acaliber round yeah payne said which suggests that maybejust maybeour doer is loading his own ammo and making light loads for his targeted killings or just a bad round either way shot from a glock ballistics of course caught the unique scoring made by the rifling in glock barrels harris nodded there was that glockcal shell casing behind gartners office itd be a long shot but wouldnt surprise me to hear the doers prints also came off that brass yeah payne said nodding thoughtfully then he went on and get this the autopsies also found that all five had stds how nice harris said dryly the gift that keeps on giving especially when you rape someone damned animals payne said which ive come to learn is not that unusual particularly in certain circles rapier offered the stats are that one out of five people over age twelve in america has herpes harris shook his head unbelievable one in five over twelve payne repeated thatll put the fear of god in you howd you become such an expert on the subject kerry you know what they say forewarned is forearmed rapier replied mockformally then he smiled and lightly added if i were you marshal i wouldnt worry much about those odds payne and harris exchanged glances then payne looked at rapier he raised an eyebrow and said okay ill bite why shouldnt i worry well normally i would counsel caution faithful use of condoms and all he paused but im almost certain you cant get stds from your palm harris burst out laughing this one sergeant matt payne asked innocently showing corporal kerry rapier his right palm then payne immediately turned it and folded all but the middle finger thats what i think of your counsel corporal both exchanged grins and the other thing they all had in common payne continued is the wanted sheet they were all printed on the same paper stock same bond same whiteness factoror lack thereof really cheap paper almost gray wanted sheets for everyone but gartner and nguyen he motioned at the main bank of monitors kerry can you punch up nguyens the colt pistol pointer floated over john jc nguyen case no popndrop the pistol fired and smoked and the image from monitor number fourteen appeared in place of gartners the timestamp id was identical and the paused image was almost so the only difference being that in this image it was gartners body that was grayed out they read the text name john jc nguyen description asian male age lbs lka s colorado street south philly prior arrests total possession of marijuana possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine possession with intent to distribute gamma hydroxybutyric ghb involuntary deviant sexual intercourse amp rape of an unconscious or unaware person on probation for ghb distribution sex crime charges dismissed due to technicality broken evidence chain of custody outstanding bench warrant

containing cocaine and one with tablets of rohypnol and a large volume possibly in excess of a gallon of urine source unknown poured around office body transported to lex talionis old city so payne said after studying the information for a moment with the exception of gartner all the dead have a sexcrime component and the exception to that being that gartner got his client off on a technicality ergo our doerhe looked at the text box and read aloud from itsnu whose prints are linked to seven of the eight popanddrops make that nine kerry rapier interrupted pointing to the third bank of monitors here comes xpress on number twentysix he manipulated the console panel and the video feed from the departments cctv camera at eighth and arch in old city appeared on the main bank it showed a small red pickup packed with teenagers pulling up in front of francis fullers office buildingand being immediately surrounded first by plainclothed policemen then by uniforms using the control panels joystick rapier first panned the scene then zoomed in to look inside the open back of the pickup after a couple teenagers hopped out the camera had a clear view of a motionless bloodied black male lying there this would appear to be one xavier xpress smith rapier said i pulled his sheet earlier who doesnt really count in our manhunt of the popanddrop doer payne said miracle of miracles were right now looking at the guysthese streetjustice vigilanteswho popped smith wish our other doer was so damn easily collared rapier said his rap sheet shows twentytwo cases of petty robbery possession of stolen goods and possession of and intent to deliver crystal meth to which payne said we can add a charge of murder at least according to javier iglesia assuming of course xpress himself is not dead hes not moving at all in the back of that truck they watched the cctv feed as the uniforms began handcuffing the very unhappy teenagers after a moment payne said getting back to what i was saying about our snu whose prints are linked to seven of our eighthe exchanged glances with rapierour nine popanddrops the doer is targeting criminals with a history of sex crimes against women and children he looked at harris ergo plan a the obvious thing to do would be to list every critter fitting that profile then have their last known address immediately put under surveillance kerry rapier offered i can generate a report listing them harris looked at him then at payne and said then just wait for the doer or doers to show up thats not going to work i mean at least logistically payne nodded i know i know if even one percent of the citys fifty thousand fugitives were sex offenders thatd mean wed need five hundred guys on the street to stand watch and thats for just one shift itd take fifteen hundred to go round the clock and then theres the megans law offenders harris shook his head no way we could get that kind of manpower we may as well put in a request for a magic wand to wave payne sighed audibly he said so plan b which is what they say to do when nothing goes right harris shook his head go left harris looked at him a long moment then said back to square one payne nodded and looking under the rock under the rock vii one n mutter street philadelphia sunday november pm driving up north mutter street a narrow oneway lane that ran through kensington will curtis thought that this godforsaken section of philadelphia looked not only like time had forgotten it but also like it had suffered curses worse than all the biblical plagues combined lice disease death of firstborn hail and fire hell its all here and more finding the row house at had been no problem whatsoever its the only damn house standing in the entire block curtis bumped the tires of the rented white ford freestar over the curb he stopped the minivan opposite the house where a set of marble steps was all that remained of one row house and threw the gearshift into park he was still sweating profusely despite having had the windows down to let the chilly november air flow inside he dropped his head back against the top of the seat and let out a long sigh never thought id get here he was only a little more than three miles from the mays row house on wilder street but after leaving the mays house he had barely made it six blocks down dickinson street before his stomach had twisted into a nasty knot curtis wasnt sure if the cause of his distress was the chemotherapy treatments for his prostate cancer or his confrontation with kendrik mays or both while the physical exertion of tracking down the bastard in that basement had worn him out the mental aspects had taken a genuine toll on him too hed been deeply disturbed by the filthy living conditions and by seeing that poor teenage girl being held captive in the basement and sexually abused which of course had made him think of wendy and her being bound and attacked by that pervert john jc nguyen who now will never harm another he and mays and all the others are in that corner of hell reserved for such miserable scum what had not bothered will curtiseither mentally or physicallywas the actual killing of kendrik hed found that shooting vile perverts troubled him less and less each time especially when he saw that eliminating them forever freed otherssuch as the young girl and shauna maysfrom their awful abuse whatever the cause of curtiss distress it was the effect that he was more concerned about right now and if he didnt do something fast it was going to get ugly speeding down dickinson he desperately looked for someplace that was open on a sunday morning and would have a toilet he could use but in this residential stretch of dickinson there was no gas station no fastfood restaurant nothing hed just about decided that he would have to take a chance and knock on the door of a random house when he saw something a block up on the right a big red church thank god literally the churchhe couldnt readily tell which denomination it washad no parking lot and there were no spaces along the curb available so he nosed the minivan up on a basketball court at the rear of the building and then he awkwardly bolted for the church door with signage reading banquet room he passed a few parishioners but no one appeared to give him a second thought he found two restrooms in the corner just inside that door thank god he thought again as he was leaving thirty minutes later he saw a small crucifix and a collection jar by the door hed come in he reached into his pants pocket and pulled out his wad of cash then put a twentydollar bill in the jar and crossed himself once back in the minivan he started to sweat heavily then felt faint what the hell is going on he turned the van to head back up passyunk avenue and made it as far as the genos cheesesteaks before feeling like he really was going to pass out he found an open parking spot at the edge of a park across the street and quickly pulled into it and shut off the engine he took a deep breath inhaling the smell of cheesesteaks from genos then he exhaled slowly and decided he should close his eyes for a second he awoke four hours later groggy and weak it had taken him some time to get his bearingswhere he was and how the hell hed wound up parked near genos but then it had all come back to him as had very curiously he thought his appetite has to be the damned chemo they said it causes some really weird things to happen shakily he got out of the minivan and made his way across the street at genos he ordered his and wendys favoritea provolone cheesesteak with extra grilled onions a side of freedom fries and a cocacola with the crunchy pelletsize ice will curtis having slurped the last of the drink now chewed on the tiny ice pellets as he looked at the rundown row house on mutter clearly there once had been walltowall row houses all along the block but now only one house was still standing some ramshackle fencinga mix of chain link and fourfoothigh rotted wooden pickets spraypainted with gang graffitisurrounded a few of the abandoned lots the fenced lots held nothing more than weeds and trash everything from piles of old car tires to a couple of discarded water heaters curtis thought that the lone row house two stories plus a basement that couldnt total fifteen hundred square feet altogether looked like it could fall at any moment especially without the added support of the row houses that once had been on either side the red brick of its fronttagged with gang graffitihad a spiderweb of gaping cracks that ran from the sidewalk all the way up to its sagging roof the rusty white front door was visible through the upper half of an aluminum storm door where the window glass was missing the storm door was partly open and hung crookedly to its left the downstairs window barely held a battered air conditioner that looked as if it had been targeted for theft more than once curtis thought it was odd particularly in a neighborhood as rough as kensington that there were no burglar bars mounted over the windows and doors of the structure then he decided that the occupants likely could not afford the iron bars and even if they could pay for them there was probably nothing of real value inside to protect against theft why bother there was a short flight of three marble steps from the narrow sidewalk up to the front door the steps had been painted red long ago and now the paint was faded and chipped someone had drawn on the steps with white chalkand very recently as there were two broken stalks of chalk lying next to the drawings the drawings clearly had been made by a child they showed three stick people a tall one a mediumsize one and a small one that was maybe toddler size the child had drawn the sky with a couple clouds and a disproportionately enormous sun the suns raysa heavy series of chalk lineswere shining down on the three stick people despite this squalor the poor kid seems to have some sort of sunny optimism or maybe its a quiet despair and the kid wishes those rays would shine on his family well if the chalk family is any indication the good news is that someones in that house he took the top fedex envelope from the stack on the dashboard and glanced at the name on its bill of lading leroi cheatham wonder if one of those larger stick figures is supposed to be leroi if it is leroi the kidll soon have one fewer stick figure to draw and maybe the other large stick figure can go collect a tengrand reward curtis remembered that cheatham a big eighteenyearold with droopy eyes and a goatee hadnt even completed middle school the wanted sheet inside the envelope stated that he was a fugitive from megans law having failed four months earlier to register as a convicted sex offender after enjoying an early release courtesy of the prison parole board unsurprisingly it also stated that cheatham had failed to maintain contact with his pennsylvania state parole agent an offense for which there was an additional warrant leroi had the habit of snorting bumps of crystal meth then entertaining himself during the adrenaline rush that followed by raping the first female he could snatch off the street and drag into an alley or park hed stupidly dragged his last known victim the one whod helped finally put him behind bars back to his bedroom in the standalone row house on mutter street the police found him there hours later passed out and naked on the floor after the fifteenyearold victim had escaped and led them back to the address that was impossible to miss curtis thought he detected movement in the house he looked back first to the artwork on the steps then to the doors the rusty white front door was swinging inward a very skinny black boy about five feet tall stepped into the opening he looked to be ten maybe twelve and was drinking from a yellow plastic cup that covered most of his narrow face he wore oversize khaki pants with the cuffs rolled up a faded and stained navy sweatshirt and dirty white sneakers his dark almond eyes darted in the direction of the white fedex minivan parked across the street but he didnt seem concerned about it he then pushed on the storm door and stepped outside could he be the mediumsize stick person which would mean theres maybe an adult and an infant inside the cup still to his face the young boy pushed the storm door shut then sat down on the top step curtis saw that hed situated himself so that his back was mostly to the fedex minivan but he could still see it out of the corner of his eye then he put down the cup picked up a piece of the broken chalk and went back to working on his art project curtis slipped the glockcaliber pistol under his waistband behind his belt buckle then stepped out of the minivan carrying the envelope addressed to leroi cheatham when he was halfway across the street curtis called out this is the cheatham home right young man the kid did not look up but just shook his head he kept drawing his eye darting a couple times to follow the approaching deliveryman thats nice art curtis said as he stopped at the steps who are the people the kid didnt reply curtis pointed to the smallest figure is the little one your baby brother the kid shook his head as he scratched out another cloud your sister curtis pursued he shook his head again he tapped the stick figure with the chalk then proudly declared it be me muthafucka what curtis thought he found himself somewhat shocked first by the outoftheblue expletive from the young boys mouth and then by the disconnect between what he saw in the drawing and what the boy said it was supposed to be weird the kid has no sense of scale but wait a twelveyearold drawing stick figures he must really be backward maybe some mental defect from his mother smoking crack when she was pregnant or from bad diet or just being dropped when he was a baby maybe hes got thatwhats it calledtourettes syndrome then again he probably hears people swearing all the time and no one tells him not to do it himself the kid went back to drawing clouds nice clouds curtis said whats your name michael the boy said then he nodded once as if making a point michael well at least somethings normal around here but i bet its probably spelled weird like leroy is leroi michael what michael floyd he said and again nodded once nice to meet you michael floyd the kid suddenly pointed to the mediumsize stick figure that be mama he said very nice who is the other one your father the kid shook his head and said that my uncle does he live here michael shook his head again whats your uncles name uncle leroi he said punctuating that with a nod dingding we have a winner will curtis thought as he glanced at the door of the house and if hes in the family drawing he said leroi cheatham is he home dont live here no more told you that muthafucka is your mother home he shook his head youre home alone he nodded look michael i have this very important envelope for your uncle curtis held it out toward the boy who turned to look at it see says right here to leroi cheatham do you know where i can find him so he can have his mail the boy nodded he at demetris can you tell me where that iscurtis motioned with the envelopeso i can give him this it that way michael said pointing with the chalk to the south whats the address he shrugged is it close can you show me he shook his head then said dont walk there no more why not gangstas muthafuckas hit me kick me he gets beat up nobody will bother you with me around michael the boy shook his head vigorously well he mustve really gotten his ass kicked no surprise law of the jungle is to prey on the weak michael listen to me this envelope is very important im sure your uncle would really want to have it curtis pointed to the minivan you want to ride in my new delivery vehicle you show me where he lives well give him the envelope then ill bring you back here the boy jerked his head to look across the street his eyes grew wide then he turned back to curtis and nodded enthusiastically yeah muthafucka i ride to leroi i tired of drawing two executive command center the roundhouse eighth and race streets philadelphia sunday november pm okay matt payne said rubbing his eyes lets bring up the last one kendrik mays not that its likely well find anything new on him yet but in the spirit of leaving no stone under the stone unturned matt felt a brief vibration in his front pants pocket and he reached in and pulled out his cell phone he looked at the screen it read text messages from amanda law oh shit he said aloud then he thought two i never felt the damn phone vibrate before as he started thumbing the phone to read the texts he saw the signalstrength icon not even one goddamn nanobit or byte or whatever of signal he looked at kerry rapier and said is it just me or is the cell service in here worthless just you marshal rapier said with a straight face harris snorted then said my signal receptions lousy too matt payne eyed rapier who smiled back seriously rapier then added its ironic that we have some four million bucks worth of hightech commo equipment in here but except for over there by the window we cant get decent cell service he paused then added if its any consolationas in misery loves companyi heard the top guy at at ampt couldnt get a signal in his hops haus tower penthouse so he personally ordered that a cellular antenna be added on the roof of the buildingand he still couldnt get a reliable connection payne shook his head gotta love technology he said his eyes falling to his phones screen the text message which had a time stamp of pm read amanda law hey baby sorry for the tone of my last message i know you have a job to do i was just caught off guard by the mayors announcement i hope your silence is because youre busynot because youre upset with me xoxo a payne felt his throat tighten what a wonderful woman all i had to do was shoot back sorry ill make it up to youor something but being a cad i didnt and still she sends this i damn sure dont deserve her then he scrolled to her most recent text message amanda law sorry to bother you again baby think you might get a break maybe dinner would love to see you if only for a moment i have to run by the hospital but will be back by to let out luna hope your day is going as well as it can xoxo a damn its nice to have someone like her to look forward to after a day like this hope i dont manage to fuck up this relationship matt had a mental image from the previous night of amanda walking completely naked toward the master bath her thick ponytail of wavy blond hair bouncing as her toned athletic body floated fluidly across the room what a goddess then he grinned at the thought of a reply love to see you too babystarkers he buried his face in both hands rubbing his eyes again as he did so he felt the stubble on his face and i do need a break if only for a shave and bath he thumbed the reply key then typed out hey sweetie i am really sorry i got your first message right as carlucci was blowing his cork i meant to reply but forgot im sorry really and there wasnt time before carlucci went on the news to let you know about my heading up the task forcewhich right now is just me tony amp kerry the ecc tech some force huh worse weve made no progress just keeping up with the body count has been challenging enough ill see if i can make a break by first need a shave amp shower be careful out there he reread what hed written hit send then stuck the phone back in his pocket harris trying to stifle a yawn was saying even as much as howard probably reamed those guys in the forensics lab i doubt theyve had time to pull anything off kendrik mays yet payne looked at himnoticing that he too had a face dark with a fiveoclock shadowand nodded number eighteen coming up kerry rapier said the main bank of monitors then showed an image of kendrik mays on the bloodsoaked carpet on the sidewalk at francis fullers old city office building then an inset image popped up it was his wanted sheet mug shot which showed an angry young man with foullooking black dreadlocks and a full black beard that was matted it was not difficult to see his nasty stubs of teeth and bad gums both severely eroded by the caustic chemicals used in the manufacturing of crystal meth the bottom righthand corner id stamp read richard saunders holdingslex talionis third amp arch hours nov the text box read name kendrik leshawn mays description black

robbed or raped by kendrik mays assailant left wanted sheet with body body transported to lex talionis old city well no surprise no snu number yet payne said and even if it was our doer all wed know is that hes added another bad guy to his exclusive death club wed still be no closer to figuring out who the hell he is then payne glanced back at the image and saw that wilder st was blinking that what i think it is kerry corporal kerry rapier said ill bet dollars to doughnuts that were now getting a live feed coming in from the mays crime scene rapier typed a couple commands on the keyboard then clicked on the blinking address with the colt officers model cursor after the pistol fired and smoked the bigscreen image of kendrik mays returned to monitor eighteen then two new images appeared on the main bank of monitors which rapier had turned to splitscreen mode the top row of three monitors had a stationary digital image of the exterior of the mays house in the bottom righthand corner was a white orb that contained the images numerical designation a next to that a text box read wilder streetexterior the middle and bottom rows of monitorseach with a black b in a white orb next to the text wilder streetinteriordisplayed the feed from a portable digital video camera the shaky image was mostly black as the cameras lone beam of light pierced a circle in the darkness lighting up bits and pieces of the trashed house my god payne said it looks as if theyre going down into some hellish black hole harris said yeah like out of a horror movie the unseen technician who carried the camera was carefully walking down a flight of unstable wooden steps as he went the beam of light showed bustedup sheetrock and exposed wooden studs on the wall then when the technician was almost to the bottom of the stairs the lens caught images of roaches and a black rat scattering unbelievable payne said then the room began to fill with more artificial light and when the tech panned the camera back to the wooden steps another tech could be seen slowly descending he wore blue jeans a light blue tshirt with a representation of the crime scene unit patcha cartoon sherlock holmes and basset hound sniffing the philly skylineon its left chest and transparent blue plastic booties and tancolored synthetic polymer gloves a white surgical mask covered his nose and mouth he carried a pair of telescopic lightpole standseach of which had two halogen floodlamps burning brightly at the top and a power cord snaking back up the stepsand a telescopic tripod the tech reached the bottom of the steps he then set up the stands at opposite ends of the basement adjusting the brilliant floodlamps so that the entire room was more or less evenly lit next he set up the tripod and the tech with the camera walked to it the camera image shook then became stabilized as it was mounted on the tripod the cameras lens was adjusted so that the entire room was visible the brilliant halogen lights clearly showed all the incredible filth there were clothes scattered everywhere pile after pile of pants and shirts and more and stacks of suitcases the walls were mostly bare wooden studs and in the middle of it all a stack of wooden pallets with a bloodsoaked torn mattress on top on the wall behind it the exposed brick and the wooden studs were covered in blood and brain splatter that resembled some sort of morbid rorschach inkblot test well theres where kendrik mays went off to meet his maker harris said more like to meet satan payne said shaking his head out of disgust though this place looks like hell on earth no wonder shauna mays looked and smelled so damn awful someone busted all the sheetrock off the walls rapier said probably to pull out the electrical wiring harris said pretty common if its copper wiring and they also rip the copper from airconditioning units to sell it as scrap payne then remembered thinking after shauna mays had said crack houses didnt have clocks that everything not nailed down got sold for drug money and heres proof that even things that are nailed down get hocked unbelievable and all the suitcases and clothes rapier asked from home invasions harris said those wheeled suitcases make it easier to haul off all the loot the clothes cover up whatever they stole and theyre easy to sell too they dont sell the suitcases some are sold some reused who knows about the rest maybe its hard to hock them if they have someones name written on them in magic marker harris shrugged hell if i know hard to say what dopeheads thinkor dont think as the case may be harris then pointed to a far corner of the basement is that what i think it is a shit bucket payne said disgustedly the first tech who had carried the video camera down came into the frame he held a professional nikon digital camera with a squat zoom lens and an enormous flash strobe they watched as he began putting out the fourinchhigh invertedv evidence markers the first yellow plastic marker bore the black numeral it was placed in the middle of the bloody mattress next to a pair of torn womens panties he then raised the nikon to his eye and took a series of four photographs of the panties and marker overlapping the angles of the shots so that later a computer could create a threedimensional rendering of the evidence a couple minutes later after repeating the process with three other markers the tech bent over in a corner of the basement he placed an invertedv marker bearing the numeral next to a shiny black metal object that was on a dirtencrusted sweatstained tshirt its a pistol kerry rapier said the tech raised the camera and popped four overlapping images of the pistol then he reached down with his gloved hand and carefully picked it up now they had a better view of it on the tv monitor a snubnosed revolver rapier added looks like maybe an s ampw model uhuh payne said shaking his head the bodyguard has a hammer shroud and that hammer is not only exposed its cocked back then its a chiefs special rapier said with more conviction at least both are caliber yeah payne said absently they watched as the tech with what obviously was practiced skill put the thumb of his gloved right hand on the knurled back of the hammer and keeping a steady pressure with the thumb squeezed the trigger with his index finger the released hammer rotated forwardbut slowly the pressure from the thumb preventing it from falling fast enough to fire off a possible live round then he thumbed the release that allowed the cylinder to swing open and carefully removed the round that had been under the hammer it was a live one he shot another series of four photographs of the pistol in that position then he extracted all the bullets from the cylinderthree spent rounds and two live onesand photographed them he threaded a plastic zip tie through the barrel and clasped it in such a way that it was visually obvious that the gun could not be fired either accidentally or on purpose finally he put the fired and live rounds in a clear plastic evidence bag put the pistol in a separate clear bag and labeled both bags payne sighed okay ive seen enough he said it will take some time for them to process all of that hellhole and then even more time to begin updating these master case files with the information and images rapier said after a moment rapier added what do you think are the odds of that being the doers weapon payne shrugged who the hell knows kerry you heard kendriks mother say in the interview that the gunshot made a big boom arguably a is a helluva lot more of a boom than aas more like a bang but what does she know a damned cork popgun would probably sound like a boom to her he looked at the video feed of the basement maybe theres a embedded in the wall there with kendriks blood splatter or maybe its acal round which could bring us back to our mystery shooterhe looked at his notesgood ol snu who now has at last known count seven notches on his gun but if there is a in the wall maybe theres another doers fingerprints on that snubnosed smith and wesson which means another candidate for task force operation clean sweep and on and on until we get lab results were basically in hurryupandwait mode and were at least an hour away from getting a response from iafis on the two prints taken off reggie jones as payne looked at him and nodded he felt his cell phone vibrating he pulled it from his pants pocket read the caller id on the screen and said aloud wonder whats on the black buddhas mind he put the phone to his head and said boss i sure as hell hope youre not calling for a progress report on task force operation clean sweep because weve yet to make any ground matthew jason washington said we just got a call from the twentysixth district more bodies were found a little over an hour ago three dead jesus more popanddrops waitthe twentysixth thats north of here not old city that news caused harris and rapier to look at payne curiously no theyre not popanddrops in old city washington said in fact quite interestingly theres no obvious cause of death at all with two of them they say the third looks like he succumbed to blunt trauma may or may not be a connection with your doer but because carlucci says your op clean sweep gets priority you are hereby officially in the loop wheres the scene jason payne pulled out his notepad flipped to a clean page and wrote jefferson amp mascher on it on our way he said thanks three n mutter street philadelphia sunday november pm michael floyd sitting up in the front passenger seat of the ford freestar was grinning from ear to ear under the brim of will curtiss greasesmeared fedex cap curtis steered the minivan off the curb because mutter was a oneway street northbound he headed for the next street up cumberland no no michael began shouting will slammed on the brakes forcing them both against the shoulder straps of their seat belts the fedex cap flew off michaels head and landed on the dashboard michael pointed over his shoulder and said that way curtis pointed out the windshield this street is oneway michael looked at him with an expression that suggested the statement was meaningless to him he live that way michael then said pointing south again well curtis thought he probably only knows how to get there by walking if i drive around until i find a street that has southbound traffic he may not have the first idea where he is oh hell this is a oneway street officer but i was only going one way will curtis drove up on the sidewalk checked his mirror for traffic then cut the steering wheel hard left to make a uturn he had to back up once to make the turn on the narrow street curtis was somewhat surprised that theyd had no trouble driving the wrong way down mutter then the wrong way down colona street and at mascher street he was relieved to find that it was a oneway going the right direction south but then a block later at susquehanna avenue they reached a dead end they were looking at a park curtis turned to his navigator who was pointing straight there michael said through the park curtis said incredulous oh for chrissake that way michael said well hell thats the way he walks then thats the way well drive curtis checked for traffic then drove across susquehanna avenue and hopped the curb there was a concrete walkway crisscrossing the park and he followed it michael floyd seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the drive he scanned the park as they cut across it about threequarters through he suddenly pointed to a small stand of maple trees gangstas he said curtis looked there in the maples shadows were four or five toughlooking teenage boys hoodlums in baggy jeans and hoodie sweatshirts and sneakers those must be the ones who beat him he expected michael to recoil or at least hide but the next thing he knew the kid was rolling down his window and throwing the bird with both fists at the punks then michael floyd yelled at the top of his lungs fuck you gangsta muthafuckas now what the hell else is going to happen will curtis thought that tourettes if thats what it is is going to get him killed he accelerated not waiting to find out if there would be any gunshots from the gangsta muthafuckas at the far end of the park he picked up mascher again and following michaels pointing drove south another nine blocks crossing oxford curtis noticed that the block on his left south of oxford was somewhat like the block of mutter streetbasically barren but for a clump of the last remaining row houses there michael said pointing to the end of the block will curtis followed the direction of michaels finger and saw that there were five houses altogether on the southwest corner of the block he also saw that there were police squad cars everywhere there will curtis repeated he stood on the brakes and studied the scene he saw other emergency vehicles including a big van with crime scene unit lettered on its side and a bunch of heavy equipmenta tall demolition crane a big caterpillar bulldozer and heavyduty dump trucks wow michael said pointing at them what the hell will said aloud ahead at the next intersection jefferson street was a squad car its every exterior light flashing white or red or blue it was parked at an angle to force traffic onto jefferson and away from the other emergency vehicles a policeman in uniform was beside it directing traffic he signaled for the fedex van to keep moving down the street toward him dont like no cop michael said leroi say cop bad news curtis looked at him no surprise there and no surprise that generation after generation in the ghetto grows up hating copsits all they know all theyre taught then will realized he hadnt considered what he would do with michael if they actually caught up with leroi i cant let him see me take leroi out michaels done nothing to deserve that the only lesson he needs to learn from this is you do bad you pay a bad price shit ill have to figure that out will curtis reached over grabbed the fedex cap from the dashboard and put it on the boys head thatll keep you hidden from the cop michael michael considered that then nodded once as they rolled up to the intersection the traffic cop waved for the van to take the turn curtis did so and avoided making any eye contact michael suddenly yelled dont like no cop muthafucka michael curtis barked he checked his mirror and saw the cop look at the van but only for a second before he turned back to directing traffic if the cop heard that probably wasnt the first time at least the kid didnt throw him the bird too curtis his heart beating fast shook his head that was close he looked over at michael who now was pointing down jefferson to the next intersection hancock street there leroi house he said indicating the boardedup row house on the corner got wood window and just beyond the house curtis saw someone peer out from around the corner he drove on and as they came to the corner curtis saw that there was more than one person standing in an alleyway behind the boardedup row house were three young black men including a great big one with droopy eyes and a trimmed goatee and there leroi michael said excitedly well ill be damned hes been standing and watching those cops work that scene back there just hiding in plain sight and the cops dont have any idea that theres a fugitive living just fifty yards away but then how could they so damned many punks in this city theres no way to keep track of them all michael suddenly moved quickly rolling down his window again he stuck out his head the hat hitting the top of the cars frame and falling to the floorboard lookit me leroi michael shouted pumping his right fist i be riding muthafucka leroi cheatham was momentarily caught completely off guard he did not immediately know how to react to the sight of his twelveyearold nephew hanging out of a fedex delivery vehicle and yelling his name at the top of his lungs especially with who the hell knew how many cops only a block or so away but the two other teenage punks standing with leroi were more quickwitted in a flash they hauled ass across hancock street and disappeared into a wall of huge thick bushes that had grown wild on the deserted lot curtis saw leroi watching his buddies run away then leroi looked back at the van then back to the bushes as leroi started to cross hancock to follow his buddies curtis held up the big square envelope to the windshield and tried to mime that it was intended for him it didnt work leroi kept walking michael curtis said as he turned the minivan onto hancock and drove up on the cracked sidewalk tell your uncle hes got a package michael yelled you gots a package leroi leroi slowed and warily looked over his shoulder curtis motioned again with the envelope stopping the minivan at the alleyway and putting it in park he rolled down his window and with a raised voice said this is my last try to find you you dont sign for it the check gets sent back today at the mention of money the expression on lerois face changed as leroi cheatham started back toward the alley curtis felt for his glock under his shirt then opened the drivers door he walked around to michaels door and opened it what up michael said curtis took a tendollar bill from his wad of cash and showed it to michael as he watched leroi coming closer you know what a lookout is curtis asked for cops michael said he nodded yeah leroi pay me to say if i see one right curtis said folding the tenspot and handing it to the kid go stand around the corner and let me know if any cop comes this way i will come tell you when were finished here michael nodded once took the money and ran back to jefferson street will curtis turned in time to see leroi cheatham come around the front of the minivan what this shit about a check leroi said looking at him hard those are some seriously bloodshot eyes curtis thought wonder what hes on youre leroi cheatham right damn right he nodded his head once so thats where michael got that nod from need to see some government id shit man he said staring at curtis with a look of disgust then he turned and spat behind him into the alley he turned back and as he began digging in the front pocket of his pants said just gimme my damn check curtis remembered what he had thought when shauna mays realized there was no money in the envelope this time as curtis pulled the glock from his waistband and aimed it at lerois chest he said it sure heres your reality check then he squeezed the trigger twice leroi fell backward into the alleyway not thirty seconds after that michael floyd came running back and called out cop after putting the warm pistol back under his shirt curtis walked to intercept him he tore open the envelope and pulled out lerois wanted sheet michael looked around who got shot he asked where leroi in the alley curtis said but dont go in there curtis put the wanted sheet on the van window then took his fedex ballpoint pen and wrote lex talionis third amp arch old city reward on the back he handed the sheet to michael give this to your mother and do what the cops say cops are good they will get you back home okay michael floyd looking confused took the sheet and stared at the mug shot of his uncle leroi after a moment he pointed to the last known address my house he said right michael thats from when leroi lived there that sheet says he did very bad things and when youre bad you have to be punished curtis paused to let that sink in that what mama said he was still looking at the sheet that why leroi live here you be good michael michael floyd looked up at will curtis then finally shrugged and nodded once as will curtis drove two blocks north he heard sirens coming from the vicinity of where leroi cheatham lay dead his pulse racing he quickly stopped the minivan and got out he peeled off the magnetbacked fedex signs from both front doors then hid them under the floor mat in the rear cargo area back in the car he pulled on his denim jacket to cover his fedex uniform shirt buttoning it up as he drove he turned left on cecil moore avenue and still hearing sirens had another idea after two blocks he turned down second avenue and followed it five blocks to where second fed into the new schmidts brewery entertainment complex as calmly as possible curtis pulled the minivan into the line of other cars waiting at a red traffic light to enter a parking garage the traffic light turned green but the brake lights of the vehicles in line stayed lit as their drivers waited for a police caran unmarked gray ford sedan with its emergency lights flashing from behind the top of the windshieldto come flying past its horn honking a warning five minutes later will curtis had parked the minivan in an open slot between a pair of fullsize suvs and begun walking toward the complexs multiscreen movie theater four s sixtieth and catharine streets philadelphia sunday november pm a frustrated h rapp badde jr at the wheel of the black range rover registered to his urban venture fund squealed its tires as he pulled a fast uturn on sixtieth and parked at the curb in front of the rented row house that served as his west philly campaign headquarters it took for damn ever to get hereand i really dont want to be here city councilman badde tried to keep at least two levels of separation from those who worked in his various campaign offices the separation afforded him a godlike persona so that when he finally went to the offices and met with his worker bees he was looked upon as the allpowerful one coming down from the holy temple that was philadelphia city hall more important though the levels of separation gave the asscovering politician a buffer for when something invariably went sour badde had plausible deniability that he had knowledge of any lowerlevel act which could easily and credibly be blamed on a wellmeaning but unfortunately overzealous campaign volunteer ever wary he knew that coming to the campaign headquarters effectively removed that buffer and that he had to be careful the last thing he wanted to do was face the medias questions of what did you know and when did you know it yet when roger wynne calledyou need to get here as soon as possible to see whats happened and deal with this kareem situation before it blows up in our faceshe was really left with no option he couldnt get across town fast enough but just getting out of the hops haus tower had turned into one helluva challenge first hed had to try convincing janelle harper that she hadnt heard anyone screaming over his cell phone about somebody getting killed and that he wasnt rushing off to see his wife or another woman hed been completely unsuccessful in persuading her on either count then to reach his range rover hed had to wait an eternity for one of the three elevators to ride down to the multilevel parking garage in the belly of the building then he had to drive the luxury suv around and around circling seemingly forever to reach street level and then hed had to wait for the metal overhead security door to slowly clankclankclank up and out of the way the sign affixed to the door told drivers to wait until the door was completely raised before exiting but badde after some smug selfcongratulating had used the maddeningly long wait to hit the lever that caused the air suspension to lower the vehicles height and as soon as the suv barely had cleared the rubber gasket on the doors bottom lip he floored the accelerator pedal only then to have to hit the brakes for a variety of other delays driving from the far eastern side of phillythe delaware river was only blocks from the hops haus complexto far west philly was only a matter of five or so miles but it was a sunday and that meant that sunday drivers were outand in no particular hurry it also meant that there were sunday pedestrians among them tourists to the city of brotherly love who apparently were unclear on the concept of using crosswalks at the appropriate times badde had felt compelled to help educate them all and freely laid on the range rovers very loud by appointment to her majesty the queen british horn the horn did not help after he picked up the vine street expressway and immediately hit stopandgo traffic due to road construction but crawling along had given him time to think before speaking privately with roger wynne as far as badde was concerned the kareem abdulqaadirkenny jones situation had kicked into damn high gear very early that morning when kenny had called his go to hell phone and tried extorting him for thirty grand then it became even more dire when kenny had called just after noontime screaming that reggie had been killed after jan harper had heard that rapp had gone out on the condos balcony with his go to hell phone and slid the door shut hed said okay kenny tell me whats going on reggies dead hed repeated you made that perfectly clear the first time how jack called and said that the police came by the house he had to go down to wherever they take killed people the medical examiners office badde had provided yeah that was it he had to go down say if it was reggie or not it was and jack said hed been beat up really bad and choked to death im sorry kenny badde said trying to sound like he meant it and now they gonna come after me man listen to me kenny rapp they gonna do the same to me kenny i need that money bad man and now its thirtyfive thirtyfive thousand dollars badde had thought damn i thought you said it was thirty large it was now they added more interest and a penalty for having to deal with reggie where are you now uh in west philly how soon do you need the money like yesterday badde had taken a long time to consider all that then hed said listen to me carefully kenny ill start working on the money you stay there out of sight and thats when badde had tried to call roger wynne he planned to tell wynne to make sure kenny stayed in the row house basement but hed been routed to wynnes voice mail and instead left a terse message call me immediately extremely important and then badde had called an old acquaintance saying he knew the whereabouts of a fugitive who could easily be grabbed and asking if maybe the acquaintance had a friend who might be interested in making ten grand for turning in the bastard the vine traffic finally cleared at the schuylkill expressway which badde followed to walnut street he took walnut through the heart of the university of pennsylvania campushonking when delayed by strolling studentsand all the way out to south sixtieth there he turned down sixtieth and followed it the fourteen blocks to where it intersected with catharine street his west philly campaign headquarters was on the northeast corner of the intersection directly facing the funeral home across the street the row houses in this neighborhood were fairly largefour and fivebedroom with three levels totaling up to three thousand square feet they were set far back from the wide twoway street and treelined sidewalk each with a concrete walk that had two tiers of steps leading up to a wooden front porch the homes were fairly nicely maintained their yards mostly kept trimmed when badde shut off the engine and looked to the campaign house he saw that roger wynne was already coming down the first tier of steps of the long walkway nailed to the porch railing behind him was a campaign poster moving philly forwardvote rapp badde for city council wynnea short pudgy mostly bald thirtyyearold who wore blue jeans a tan cardigan sweater over a black tshirt and tan opentoe sandals with black sockshad a look of concern as he puffed heavily on the pipe he held in his left fist badde thought that he could easily see wynne teaching a political science course at the university of pennsylvaniawhich wynne had done until tiring of the struggle for tenure and going to work for rapp badde as a political advisor while continuing to teach parttime at u of p badde was not nearly as impressed with wynne as wynne was with himself but felt that he served some purpose in helping rapp get legitimate votesand keeping any questionable ones quiet wynne pulled the pipe from his teeth as he offered badde his hand good to see you rapp he said sorry to make you come all the way out here badde shook the hand and said miserable damn day to be out driving but you said it was important wynne nodded as he took two heavy puffs of his pipe itll be better if i show you badde followed him down the sidewalk to the side of the house along catharine street there was a weathered wooden door with another badde campaign poster on it badde knew that this was the separate entrance to the basement another was inside the house under the stairwell that led to the upper floor wynne unlocked the door went inside and flipped on a light switch badde followedand immediately saw what wynne wanted him to see firsthand the basement which kenny had set up as his combination bedroom and office was completely trashed the mattress was overturned the old wooden desk was up on its side and all three of the rusty and battered metal fourdrawer filing cabinets had been ransacked some of the drawers still contained papers and folders but most were empty when the hell did this happen badde asked wynne puffed on his pipe once then exhaled smoke as he said sometime in the last twentyfour hours it was okay after lunch yesterday when i was down here you dont know exactly when this had to have made one helluva racket i told you on the phone that i didnt get back here until after i got your voice mail thats why there was the delay he looked at badde and saw anger roger wynne took two hard puffs on his pipe then he got mad too what the hell rapp last night was halloween and there was a great party at u of p i live here im not a prisoner nor am i a goddamn warden watching that moron kareem i never liked the idea of him being here when you first forced him on me but you said it was an important political favor and that hed be fine in the basement and i reluctantly agreed which of course i obviously now regret roger wynne then made a sweeping gesture at the destroyed room how the hell was i supposed to know this was going to happen badde glanced at him then looked back at the destruction and sighed audibly okay roger besides the obvious whats the damage he pointed at the filing cabinets what was in them mostly kareems logs the lists of all the voters he collected and he also had many of their absenteevoter cards or forms i was dumbfounded how he could collect so many he wouldnt tell me he just showed them to me and said it was because he was a hard worker and you were going to reward him for that badde raised his eyebrows at the word reward i do have a reward in mind for you kenny just not the one youre probably expecting wynne continued so i uh came down here one day while he was out canvassing for the socalled forgotten voters initiative i had a little look around and found all the records in addition to going door to door hed gone to retirement homes and signed up voters en masse then hed moved on to nursing homes badde already knew this of course but replied really well you have to give him credit for thinking outside of the box badde walked over and pulled an officiallooking governmental form from one of the metal file drawers the letterhead had the familiar crest of the city of philadelphia and city commissioners county board of elections room city hall philadelphia pa the first line of the sheet read absentee ballot application amp requirements he read farther down and saw the requirements for alternative ballots if you are a registered voter who is disabled or age sixtyfive or older and who is assigned to an inaccessible polling place you are qualified to vote using an alternative ballot badde looked up at wynne and said and i do give the bastard credit he found groups of voters who probably really had been forgotten by the system well some anyway wynne shrugged and went on then some weeks back harvey wilson across the street badde shook his head at first but then he recognized the name the mortician wynne nodded he came banging on the front door said hed caught kenny in his office at the funeral home what the hell was he stealing drugs do they even have drugs wynne shook his head no drugs and wilson said he wasnt really stealing anything per se at least nothing of real value to wilson as they were just records but wilson didnt like the idea of kenny just making himself at home in his office and told me to keep him the hell away so what was kenny doing he got caught going through their files why he was methodically copying all the names and addresses of wilsons recent clients identity theft of the dead wynne nodded not that any of them were about to complain if he could apply for the absenteevoter cards before the city got notice that these people were deadand you know how muddled and long that kind of bureaucratic process can bethen hed have even more quiet voters badde grinned smart never wouldve expected that from the dimwit wynne nodded yeah and for all his faultsand there were manykareem was a stickler for detail maybe it was because he had so much time on his hands he logged and filed everything badde nodded toward the upturned filing cabinets and took it all with him he said stating the obvious as long as those records were in there and you already had been elected to office badde affecting a bit of a french accent authoritatively said it would have been faint plea of course wynne cocked his head as he puffed his pipe a what wynne said you know a faint pleathe french saying for the cow is out of the barn or even you cant get the toothpaste back in the tube its a done deal and you cant go back you mean fait accompli wynne said an accomplished fact thats it badde said wynne noticed that badde was wholly unembarrassed by the correction anyway wynne said if someone pulls those forms down at city hall or wherever the hell theyre warehoused theyre going to see a lot of the same signatures at the same mailing addresses they exchanged a long glance and then wynne went on its not fait accompli because if theres voter fraud the courts get involved and then badde nodded slowly at the implication he said and you think kenny kareem whatever the fuck you want to call him has the forms as your political advisor i think its important that we proceed as if he does him or someone more dangerous city councilman h rapp badde jr inhaled deeply then let it out slowly then a cell phone rang in his pants pocket and badde quickly grabbed his go to hell phone but when he looked at the screen there was nothing and the ringing was still coming from his pants pocket other damned phone about time its not the go to hell phone he exchanged phones then looked at the caller id what does jan want whut up honey he said into the phone damn it rapp i thought i told you not to do things with pegi without my knowledge she said with absolutely no pleasantries uhoh bad tone shes way beyond pissed now all i have to do is figure out which thing ive done without telling her that list could be endless im sorry honey but dont goddamn honey me rapp whats this about an expediter an expediter rapp repeated yeah the one who just got us in a whole helluva lot of hot water what expediter apparently someones saying hes the new expeditor at hud and pegi one i didnt hire and i thought you put me in charge of this i did i mean i didnt i didnt hire anyone is what i mean and i did put you in change honey knock off the honey crap rapp i know where you are who youre with im out at the west philly row house badde said somewhat piously want to talk with wynne smiling smugly he exchanged glances with roger wynne jan said dont change the subject rapp we got problems here h rapp badde jr then looked at the empty filing cabinets and thought honey if you only knew viii one jefferson and mascher streets philadelphia sunday november pm speeding down girard avenue just past the schmidts brewery development and just before the hops haus complex sergeant matt payne pulled a hard left onto howard street putting the unmarked gray ford crown victoria police interceptor into a tiresquealing fourwheel drift moments earlier jason washington had reported that not only were there three dead at the northern liberties scene but a call had come in saying that a blue shirt at the scene reported another shooting had just taken place a block away matt had floored the accelerator pedal out of the corner of his eye he saw in the rearview mirror that the maneuver had thrown corporal kerry rapier against the right rear door hey marshal rapier said his tone casual think you might want to take it a little easier on the car detective tony harris chuckled this things a tank kerry payne replied calmly as he steered in the direction of the skid to correct it then squared up he stepped harder on the gas pedal and the engine roared heavy deetroit metal big iron block v and you couldnt throw a turn like that back there without the rearwheel drive its not as nimble as my porsche but then i wouldnt attempt a pit with my these cars are built to take it rapier knew that pursuit intervention technique was basically tactical ramming in a pit the reinforced nose of the police interceptor smacked the tail of the car being pursued so that its driver suddenly lost control turning sideways or spinning out before skidding to a stop not built to take the way you handle cars rapier replied i heard you got that nice sports car all shot up harris chuckled again hes got you matt by the way whats up with your that happened months ago still mired in the purgatory known as insurance adjuster arbitration payne said i hate insurance companies the bastards dont want to write me a check for what its worth to replace i dont know if ill ever get it back so while i was killing time stuck at the desk going over the popanddrops i found out a halfdozen unmarkeds were about to go back to the fedsthey were on loan to dignitary protection from the department of homeland securityand i managed to get this ones transfer paperwork misplaced for the foreseeable future harris grinned smooth move itll take the feds forever to figure out ones missing yeah and my conscience is clear thanks to budget cuts we dont have near enough cars and were at least putting this one to good use the paperwork showed the other five are just getting parked either warehoused or tasked to a possible highvalue target translation being harris said left sitting empty with the wigwags flashing outside the us mint or fed reserve here to give the impression that one of the alphabet agencies under dhs is on the ball exactly kerry rapier went on did you guys know these are about to become dinosaurs fords not going to make the crown vic anymore and no crown vic means no crown vic police interceptors theyre going to be replaced with a hoppedup ford taurus what a scrawny v frontwheeldrive like our impala squad cars payne said making a mock gasp horrors you corporal rapier have ruined my joyous thoughts of being forever able to abuse police pursuit vehicles i may as well put in my transfer to the bike squad payne saw in the mirror that rapier was smiling out his window and then he saw that rapier wasnt wearing his seat belt when theyd first gotten in the car at the roundhouse both payne and harris had climbed into the front seats it wasnt lost on rapier as he automatically went to latch his seat belt that matt and tony had sat on their seat belts the belts had already been buckled across the seats hey guys didnt your mothers teach you to always put on your seat belts payne was putting down the unmarked squad cars two sun visors so that they would be visible at the top of the windshield from the outside on the drivers visor was a white sticker with red block lettering that spelled police strapped to the passenger visor was a light bar with redandblue strobes the twelvevolt dc power cord for the emergency lights was snaked over the stalk that held the rearview mirror to the windshield and ran down to the cigarette lighter as payne stuck the plug in the lighter receptacle he said yes but that was before dear ol mummy knew that id be carrying a pistol on my belt whats that got to do with it i was going to say didnt they teach you at the police academy then realized that if they had it would have been on the qt why quiet payne badly mimicking a shakespearean actor said to buckle or not to buckle that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer either the slings or the arrowshe went back to his normal voicethe slings in this case being seat belts the arrows being bullets harris put in you really butchered that matt you people clearly have no couth payne said simply put then its a judgment call as to which you consider the safer option wearing a seat belt so that youre better off in case youre in an accident or not wearing one so that you can exit the vehicle and draw your weapon faster when going after a bad guy having numerous times had to exit vehicles in pursuit of bad guyssome of whom thought it a good idea to shoot at uscertain of us have chosen not to buckle payne looking in the rearview mirror had seen rapier considering that and now as they had turned onto jefferson he saw that rapier was sitting on his seat belt payne braked hard bringing the crown vic police interceptor to a screeching stop not far from a crime scene unit van a medical examiners office van was parked farther down jefferson and a gurney holding an obviously full body bag was being rolled into its rear cargo area unrestrained by seat belts the three men were almost instantly out of the unmarked shiny gray police interceptor thats one massive steel ball kerry rapier said looking up at the towering redandwhite linkbelt crane that in the lateafternoon light was casting a huge shadow across the dirt must weigh two maybe three tons could be a contender for the largest murder weapon on record harris snorted if in fact it was the cause of death remember that the black buddha said the other two victims showed no known cause of death with payne leading they walked past a big bright white sign announcing a philadelphia economic gentrification initiative project by city councilman rapp badde and the coming of three thousand new jobs thats a lot of jobs matt thought especially here probably another political lie payne couldnt help but notice that the sign was plastered with homemade flyers that bore a crude representation of the city councilman badde wanted for crimes kerry rapier then wondered aloud everyones got their own idea of what constitutes a crime payne said as far as i know badde hasnt broken any laws on the books arguably hes bent the living hell out of a few but then thats what politicians do payne saw that except for a line of five row housesmake that four and a half considering that hole in the one on the endonly smelly raw earth remained on the onceresidential city block there was some heavy equipment and the white pegi signs in each corner of the block and that was it yellow police line tape was strung from the halffallen wooden back fence of the semidemolished row house to the rear of the redandwhite linkbelt crane then to a fourfoothigh iron pole in the concrete sidewalk that once held a parking meter then past the medical examiner offices van and all the way down the sidewalk to the farthest row house at the corner of jefferson and mascher payne looked at the small group gathered beside the crane and saw a familiar face detective harry mudd of the crime scene unit mudda muscular fivefooteleven thirtyfiveyearold with fiercely inquisitive eyes and saltandpepper hair trimmed shortwas a tenyear veteran of the department payne knew him to be a nononsense and damned thorough investigator mudd stood with his arms crossed and head somewhat cocked as he listened to one of the three beefy men who looked like construction workers or heavyequipment operators payne thought when he saw the sloppily handlettered cardboard square signturco demolition amp excavationthat was taped to the side of the crane mudds eyes darted to payne who was leading harris and rapier toward him he held out his right index finger as a hold that thought a moment gesture to the beefy guy who was doing the talking then mudd turned and started moving to intercept payne sergeant payne good to see you detective mudd said offering his hand its matt harry he said taking it then he gestured to the others you know tony harris and this is corporal kerry rapier harry mudd kerry he said shaking the corporals hand kerry rapier nodded more than a little impressed by mudds grip he was almost afraid he was going to pull back his hand and find his fingers crushed to a bloody pulp nice to meet you detective rapier said tony harris said how they hanging harry its been a while mudd nodded it has and if you mean how are the bad guys hanging i wish i could say by a noose otherwise the answers the same one lower than the other he and harris exchanged grins payne looked over at the three men standing beside the linkbelt crane the tallest one who appeared somewhat pale and had his chin almost to his chest had a real look of gloom the shortest of the three who had a cigar stuck in the corner of his mouth glanced at his wristwatch as he anxiously kicked the raw dirt with his boot toe then glared in paynes direction im assuming one of those guys is mr turco mudd glanced over yeah two actually the tall ones name is bucco bobby the ballbuster bucco he was running the crane when the ball found the deceased the owner of the company is the short one whos sucking on the cigar stub thomas little tommie turco and hes ten kinds of pissed off whats his problem you me i just got the hell here mudd nodded and thats why hes pissed i told him i was under orders to wait for the head of the homicide task force to get here youre here in that shiny undercover carnice wheels by the way whered you steal themand hes probably guessing that im talking with the man payne decided it best to ignore the hotcar question but the fact that mudd raised it indicated that it wouldnt be the last time someone was going to ask how he came by a nice new vehicle when almost everyone else in the department was driving battered handmedowns with six digits on their odometers it damn sure wasnt the kind of vehicle that was going to hide in plain sight very well so payne said i still dont get why hes pissed at me he wants to return the crane to the rental place which he says is now charging him sunday double time but i told him i couldnt release him or his equipment until you gave the goahead payne raised his eyebrows like i said matt im just doing what i was told you know how antsy the departments chain of command gets when mayor carlucci holds a press conference and that shit flows downhill so fast payne nodded understood harry you know i have full faith in your skills so we can skip the formalities what the hell is going on here mudd pulled out his spiral notepad and began thomas little tommie turcos company was hired by hud to turn the whole block back to dirt and hes really pissed at that expediter sonofabitch whos really going to pay for all this mudd finished a few minutes later so three dead payne said but no idea why they were in the condemned buildings and no idea what killed the other two mudd was shaking his head no idea and of course until we hear from dr mitchells autopsy we wont know for sure if the third died of blunt trauma the one thing that is clear however is that there were people living in these houses right up until sometime today really yeah these folks were holdouts they didnt want to move they refused the buyout from pegi he pointed down the street that middle house we found one of the dead at the kitchen table slumped over with his face in a bowl of apparently justmade tomato soup possibly putting the time of death around noon payne asked possibly mudd said who knows payne looked at harris and rapier any thoughts gentlemen you know as much about the cases as i do kerry rapier shrugged then grinned death by drowning harris and payne groaned only the obvious fact tony harris then said that this doesnt fit the popanddrop mo in any way at all unless were missing something mudd glanced at the line of five remaining row houses and said do you want to take a look inside not right now payne said its going to be dark soon lets talk about the other dead guy even better mudd said lets go over to the scene payne gestured that mudd should lead as they started walking along the sidewalk in front of the halfdemolished row house they heard an italianaccented voice bark aw what the fuck youse guys when they all turned they saw a frustrated little tommie turco standing with both arms above his head palms up detective harry mudd held up his right index finger again this time in a gesture meant to signal back in a minute they heard turco then bark oh for fucks sake and watched as he tore the cigar stub from his mouth and threw it to the dirt two as they rounded the corner from jefferson to hancock matt payne saw that there was yellow police line tape strung between two boardedup row houses blocking the entrance to an alleyway the first thing payne saw behind the yellow tape was the blood trail he took another step forward his eye following the trail up the alleyway until he saw in the shadows the body of a very big black male on the concrete beside his head was an invertedv plastic marker with a black numeral on it parked on the street blocking off the alleyway was a chevy impala squad car the right rear door was open and a young black boy was sitting in the rear seat turned so his back was to the scene thats the deceaseds nephew mudd said he says he didnt see the the shooter which i doubt were trying to find his mother payne nodded poor kid is probably in shock as he glanced around he thought three dead back there another deada possible popanddrophere two crime scenes two blocks apart or is it just one big scene and all this is going on just three blocks from the fortress then he thought oh shit amanda he tugged back his left shirtsleeve cuff and checked his wristwatch almost six he pulled out his cell phone and pounded out a text message with his thumbs hi baby sorry im just now getting back to you good news amp bad news bad first i obviously cant make it by just got to a scene with more dead good or maybe more bad news its only blocks from the condo really good news so see you soon sorry baby he hit send as he started to put back his phone it almost immediately vibrated with the reply amanda law ok see you when i see you xoxo a uhoh do i read between the lines that was a fast reply like she was waiting correction a fast and terse reply or dismissive on the one hand she shouldnt be pissed she said she understands why i have to do this the damned popanddrop body count is probably up to nine then theres the three dead next door someones got to stop it but on the other hand amandas emotional because shes not completely over her abductionwhich i can understandand shes not happy with my job and the idea of my being in danger having been shaken to her very core shes wisely questioning where things will go for herfor us and ultimately who will i owe my allegiance to in five ten twenty years to the police department of a wild city whose crime rate doesnt seem to be improving or to the goddess whos the loving mother of my children his thumb hovered over the reply key while he contemplated what he should say i cant lose this woman i should say something i just dont know whats matt you need to see this harris called payne looked up then glanced at the phonethen slipped it back into his pocket nice job matty ol boy you just proved once again that you dont deserve her what is it tony matt said as he walked toward him harris was pointing in the direction of another evidence marker this one somewhat obscured by weeds and shadows it was close to the yellow tape next to it was a pair of spent shell casings any chance theyre gap payne asked they are mudd offered just two of them butcal glock kerry rapier said number nine our mystery shooter strikes again payne exhaled audibly then looked at mudd well hell harry let me guess he said gesturing toward the alleyway the guys got a history of sex crimes mudd stepped over to the impala reached in and from the front seat picked up a plastic evidence bag he handed it to payne payne looked through the clear plastic at the wanted sheet and its mug shot of the huge goateed droopyeyed leroi cheatham you got it matt mudd said cheatham served time for rape and was out on early release then because he thought he could make only one visit with his parole agent he got on the megans law list theres just no damned end to these perps payne said he read the back of the sheet handwritten in blue ink was lex talionis third amp arch old city reward check out the back payne said handing the bag to harris id say kerrys right number nine for our mystery shooter or ten if reggie jones turns out to be his handiwork too harris held up the bag then passed it to rapier and said and as kerry likes to say ill bet dollars to doughnuts that well find the same doers prints on that sheet looks like the same cheap gray paper stock as the others mudd said the kid said the doer told him to give that to his mother well thats evidence so its not going to mama shell have to figure out how to convince fiveeff to cough up the ten large without it mudd looked at him clearly confused after payne explained that fiveeff was francis fuller mudd made the connection to the reward mudd then went on cheatham had a hundred twentytwo bucks cash on him a rusty switchblade knife that didnt really switch itself open and two eightballs of what we suspect is crystal meth which the wanted sheet tends to confirm as he has a history of doing meth too payne glanced at the young boy in the back of the squad car and what about him harry the kids name is michael floyd age twelve or age four depending on the direction the winds blowing now payne harris and rapier looked confused payne held out his right hand palm up and wagged his fingers in a lets have it gesture mudd made a sour face hes a simpleton backward you know may even have a bit of brain damage he isnt saying much but even if he did say something we might be able to run with id be very skeptical of it payne glanced at the kid and said well hes got to be in shock seeing his uncle dead mudd shrugged then again he said it could all be an act at least the backwardness just playing dumb you know reason i say that is one of the blue shirts who was directing traffic at the first scenehe pointed eastward toward mascher streetsaw a white minivan with fedex logos roll past a minute before he heard the two gunshots we asked the kid about that andhe flipped a couple pages on his notepad and read from ithe said quote what be a fedex motherfucker end quote payne raised his eyebrows looking at michael for a moment before turning back to mudd rapier handed mudd the evidence bag with the wanted sheet mudd said he pointed at cheathams last known address on here and said thats where he and his mother live not cheatham he said his uncle lived in this abandoned house here maybe the kids mama got sick of her brothers bullshit payne said must be difficult enough raising a kid with a mental disability payne then bent over to look at the spent shell casings theyre damn near still warm we were that close harris said whatre you thinking matt payne looked up at him and said how close we were and now harris said how close were not again payne stood erect and clearly in thought stared at tony a long moment nothing personal detective harris but you look like shit and im beginning to feel like it weve been banging away at thishe glanced as his wristwatchhell i cant even do the math i think we need to take a break clear our heads as a very wise person once told me these guys will still be dead in the morning you dont need to make a mistake and join them that was me matt harris said payne smiled i know he turned to mudd and handed him his business card thats got my cell number harry let me know if you find something will do as they walked back to the gray crown vic payne thumbed out a text message hey baby on my way be there shortly he hit send and thought hope youre still thereand still talking to me three hops haus tower n lee street philadelphia sunday november pm it was well past dusk as matt payne drove up the cobblestone drive to the circle entrance of the highrise condominiums after dropping harris and rapier at the roundhouse hed run by his tiny apartment on rittenhouse square grabbed a fast shower and shave and changed into an old comfortable pair of clean khakis a longsleeve navy cotton polo shirt and boaters deck shoes his shirttail was out concealing the colt officers model tucked under his belt on his right hip parking in a slot across from the massive water fountain on the circle drive he looked up and marveled at the impressive main entrance the soaring threestory stainlesssteelframed wall of thick clear glass gave a fantastic view of the lobby all the more striking at night with its brightly lit gleaming marble floors and walls payne walked through the main entrance doors and waved to the concierge on duty behind the main marbletopped desk david suder was a darkhaired darkeyed twentyeightyearold with a muscular frame that looked as if it had been forged from hardened steel he wore a nice twopiece dark woolen suit a starched white shirt and a dark necktie that almost looked out of place on him how you doin david payne called out good he replied smiling how goes it with you sarge i mean mr payne you look like youve had a rough one its matt david and indeed i have but its getting better by the moment glad to hear it check six matt you too david payne called back as he reached the heavy sliding glass door that led to the elevator bank he punched in the unique code for unit on the keypad in midoctober amanda had changed it to for september the day she said her life had been profoundly changedthe day when matt had saved her from her murderous abductors the glass door whooshed open sideways inside the elevator he entered the code again and hit the button on the panel for the penthouse floor as he rode up he thought about the day that hed met david suder who he knew wasnt really a concierge as a general rule of thumb concierges didnt address guests as sergeant and caution them to watch their back for bad guyscheck six being goodguy jargon that meant for them to be wary of who might be sneaking up behind them also known as their six oclock suder now worked for andy hardwick and hardwick had introduced them when hed told matt thered be extra protective eyes watching the penthouse floor and the owner of unit but until recently david had been philadelphia police department officer suder a rising star assigned to the elite narcotics strike force earlier in the year he had taken the corporals exam and passed both oral and written parts with scores high enough to put him in the top ten percent and on the list only those on the list got immediate promotions everyone else would have to wait for a slot to open which could take weeks monthsor maybe never even happen after the list expired in two years those not promoted would have to retake the exam with a new group of candidates but there was one caveat funding and because of severe budgetary cutbacks this year there were fewer corporal slots and only the top five percent had been immediately promoted officer suder had not been happy about that to put it mildly shortly thereafter andy hardwick had been buying a few rounds down the street at liberties bar catching up on roundhouse scuttlebutt with old buddies still on the force and hed heard all about suders displeasure at getting the shaft thanks to city hall bean counters the next day hardwick had taken suder to lunch before theyd even been served their desserts hardwick had effectively poached him from the philadelphia police department with the offer of a salary that was almost twice what any corporal could ever dream of earning but i simply could never do residential security payne thought fortunately i dont need the damn money thats moot but more to the point where the hells the thrill in private security the satisfaction whatd be the equivalent of what im doing now heading up task force operation poolhouse clogged toilet maam the sign clearly states that no personal sanitary items are to be flushed im afraid were going to have to write you a ticket on this one he snorted as the elevator made a ding stopped and the doors parted on the twentyfirst floor then again marshal earp no one would be shooting at you and youre not exactly going gangbusters with collaring the doers in op clean sweep as he put the key in s heavy brass deadbolt lock matt could hear luna softly whining on the other side of the door her wagging tail was thumping against the door having her so happy to see me is a nice welcome after a long lousy day now i only hope that i can get amanda to wag her lovely tail too when he turned the knob and pushed the door inward luna stuck her black nose and curlyhaired muzzle around its edge matt reached down to scratch her head as he opened the door good girl he said now take me to your gorgeous master as he stepped inside the doorway matt heard amandas sultry voice she already has he looked up from luna and saw amanda standing there she was barefoot but wearing a stunning gold sequined cocktail dress it clung flawlessly to her welltoned body as if it was almost a second skin and it shimmered miraculously the front was cut low and wide generously enough to show a great deal of incredible suntanned cleavage while not revealing more than a sexy suggestion of her marvelous bosom her thick wavy blond hair hanging free and full was silky and luminous wow payne thought the goddess glows she looks so full of life her eyes so warm and inviting and that dress it radiates like a sea at sunset sorry luna your greeting just got bested far far and away and he saw that amandaperhaps even better though itd be the absolute last damn thing id ever admit towas holding a cocktail napkin wrapped around a squat heavy crystal glass that was dark with what had to be an intoxicant glad you could make it she said her tone warm genuinely meaning it i was beginning to worry as she turned her head slightly to the right offering her left cheek matt said sorry baby crazy day and kissed her affectionately she held out the glass and flashed her dazzling smile macallan eighteen half water two ice cubes he took it and grinned you not only have an incredible mind but also a very dangerous memory she smiled again ill take that as a compliment thank you that said youre not only an angel but a lifesaver ive been longing for one of these all day as he took a big sip she reached for his other hand and tugged him toward the interior of the condominium come on and sit down relax with luna leading the way they went into the living room and sat on the big soft black leather couch it faced the floortoceiling windows and the lights of the city twinkled far into the distance from the highfidelity digital music player that matt had bought amanda when she started spending so much time at home came the soft soothing voice of diana krall singing besame mucho matt looked at amanda thought kiss me much indeedthen leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek again she smiled almost shyly he sat back and suddenly said youre not having anything oh yeah she said brushing her hair behind her ear and glancing back toward the kitchen she pushed herself up off the couch and said ill be right back how was your day baby payne asked as she went amanda called back interesting thanks for asking i was going to tell you about it but first enjoy your drink uhoh was that a red flag or maybe a yellow caution one that just went up matt watched over his shoulder as she disappeared into the kitchen as he looked back at the lights outside he could hear the sounds of her getting something out of the refrigerator and unwrapping it oh shit shes had food prepared so she was waiting for me to reply when i sent that text but i was up to my ass in alligators then that made him think surreal four dead just three blocks from here absolutely surreal he heard the soft padding sound of bare feet approaching here you go sweetie amanda said putting an enormous platter of antipasto on the low marble table in front of the couch her other hand held a crystal stem its huge goblet full of red wine i thought we could do this instead of any dinner it looks marvelous i love it thank you he reached down and grabbed a giant black olive and wrapped it in a large thin slice of salami then shoved the whole thing in his mouth he chewed nodding appreciatively at her his eyes following her as she dropped back onto the couch she scooted closer beside him holding her wineglass up and then tucking her bare feet under her goldensequined fanny just beautiful he thought and so damn sexy he touched his glass to hers and said cheers he then watched as she reached to the table and picked up a salad fork she attempted to delicately spear a prosciuttowrapped rectangle of cantaloupe twice on the third attempt made very slowly she hit her target she chewed the morsel and followed it with a very generous gulp of her wine over the top of her glass she made eye contact with him when shed swallowed the wine she smiled my god she truly is a goddess but why do i suspect that may not be her first glass of vino or her second and that is a huge glass matt drained the rest of his eighteenyearold singlemalt ill make you another sweetie she said immediately kicking her feet out from under her he leaned over and kissed her on the forehead to keep her seated you stay youve already made all this i can pour my drink think ill move on to the cheap stuff he walked over to the wet bar he filled his glass with ice cubes then poured a hefty double of jamesons irish whiskey he looked over to the couch luna now had her head in amandas lap as amanda absently petted her and looked out the window while sipping more wine this is certainly getting interesting shes clearly in thought about something and damn near in her cups he caught himself suddenly yawning oh shit hope i dont fall asleep that will really ruin the mood and leave it to me to really piss her off i dont see you forever and the few minutes youre here you fall asleep as he sat back on the couch amanda was holding the glass by the stem and swirling the wine around the goblet kind of anxiously nervously then he noticed her left foot moving back and forth if that was attached to a churn at an amish dairy she could be making butter for all of lancaster county amanda turned to him want to talk about your crazy day she said its horrible that more people are dead and just up the street do you know who did it and are theyyou i guess i meanclose to catching them matt took a sip from his drink then said the simple answer is noto all that no we really dont know who and im really mentally racked from thinking about the whole thing so that means id really rather not talk about it i hope you dont take that the wrong way amanda smiled oh not at all she said i do understand sometimes you have to step back how about you anything at the hospital she nodded then she leaned forward and put her wineglass beside the antipasto platter on the marble table she really is in deep thought she turned to him and suddenly he could see tears starting my god what the hell has got her so upset matt you saved my life i will never forget that terrifying moment i realized who they were and what theyd doneand knew that was the end for me but then then you suddenly were there and i heard your voice calling out to warn tony harris its me matt payne i truly thought i was hallucinating oh shit in vino veritas matt stared into her eyes and felt his throat constrict and i remember that moment too inside that pillowcase theyd taped over her head she whimpered when i cut her free the last person in the world i expected to find a prisoner in that hellhole was the woman i loved it was an unimaginable moment she reached back for her glass took a big sip and said you saved my life matt now its my turn four how does survivors guilt fit matt payne was saying reaching for another slice of salami and wrapping it around another big black olive even though the platter was now nearly threequarters empty all the meat and cheese and fruit hed eaten wasnt keeping up with the alcohol he was washing it down with he was starting to feel a bit tight or maybe its a combination of that and being exhausted hed made them both fresh drinks luna was asleep at their feet snoring softly survivors guilt amanda law said because skipper died and becca didnt twentyfiveyearold becca benjamin just shy of two oclock in the morning on september had been sitting in her mercedes suv waiting for j warren skipper olde her twentysevenyearold boyfriend to come out of a seedy philly inn motel room which he did right after the meth lab inside had blown up the damn place turning it into an inferno the blast demolished the mercedes becca suffered a head injury from the blast that had almost killed her skipper was critically burned matt had known them while growing up since they were all at episcopal academy both came from families of significant means and both had a history of getting in trouble with booze and drugs because of the severity of their multiple injuries both had been taken to temple university hospitals advanced burn center where the chief physician was one amanda law md facs fccm matt ill never tell anyone else this amanda said but its my brutally cold assessment that jesus jimenez probably did skipper a favor by killing him skipper was either going to die from his burns or suffer a long recovery and never be the same again matt nodded but becca she went on nonetheless is feeling responsible saying they wouldnt have been there if skipper hadnt wanted to make her happy with some of those goddamned drugs to get past this damned survivors guilt i sent her to amy thats interesting matt said amy never mentioned she was now beccas shrink shes a doctor sweetie just because shes your sister doesnt mean shes going to tell you and break the physicianpatient confidentiality he shrugged amanda said there can be a variant of survivors guilt among doctors they get a guilty feeling that they didnt do enough to save a patient luckily ive never had it but that doesnt mean i dont understand it and i know that those who do have it need to look at the glass as being half full not half empty confident in their skills that they did the right thing ive had a few of those myself matt thought it wasnt that long ago that i held susan reynolds in my arms as her very life poured out from that bullet hole in her head and i loved her like i love amanda right down to the roadside cottage with the picket fence i endlessly questioned if i couldve done anything different to save her from that madman of a killer and bottom line the answer was i couldnt still finally realizing that didnt ease the pain of loss he took a sip of scotch as he glanced at amanda am i about to lose amanda amanda was saying i also understand that sometimes things play out the way they do no matter what anyone does in fact in some cases we probably prolong the inevitable by taking the heroic measures which was why someone in a wise moment came up with dnrs do not resuscitate orders matt said she nodded he sipped his drink again and tried to understand where she was going with this maybe its her body clock ticking the abduction was a real wakeup call for her sense of mortality and maybe thats some manifestation of survivors guiltin part because she lived while that young teen honduran girl after being forced into prostitution died a brutal death then she said two months ago matt i went to hawaii for an m and m i know she cant mean candy its a conference doctors attend she went on as if reading his mind morbidity and mortality this is about mortality he said i heard those conferences are really just an excuse to write off trips to fancy places like hawaii so you can play and take a business deduction the idea of m and ms is peer review we look at how others cared for patients and how it could have been done better particularly cases in which a mistake was made and the patient died being head of the burn unit i tend to be the one doing the reviewing its not exactly a pleasant task no one likes to be told they screwed up but we do want to do right by our patientsfirst do no harmand the peer review while sometimes painful does help you learn to modify behavior and avoid repeating mistakes she looked at him a long moment matt i dont like repeating mistakes i cant of course not i understand therere lives at stake yes there are ours what she said were at a critical time in our lives i feel weve both been given second chances and i want us to get this next one right oh i had a long talk with my father matt had met charley law only once but had heard stories about him from jason washington whod known law during his twenty years with the department in northeast detectives washington had said that her old man always had been full of commonsense gems that hed been a good cop because he could quickly strip away the bullshit and cut right to the chase law had been off duty when he took a bullet to the hip hed walked in on a robbery of a gas station on frankford avenue returning fire hed shot the critter dead then and thereand wound up being offered disability and retirement and hed taken it saying he was glad to get the hell out if only to get past all the lame jokes about his namewell well here comes the law when matt had first tried dating amandaright before the abductionshe had made it damn perfectly clear what a toll her fathers job had taken on their family she told him about the daily pain of watching him go to work and fearing that that would be the last time theyd see him alive amanda went on when i turned thirteen dad sat me down at the kitchen table he said this is your birdsandbees speech pay attention were on this planet basically to do two things eat and reproduce and we eat in order to have the energy to reproduce everything elseyour clothes tv music vacations whateverits all filler for between the reproduction times thats what were hardwired to do understanding that you will know that boys want nothing more than to get in your pants and will tell you whatever you want to hear to accomplish that so understand that youand only youcan control who gets in your pants payne avoided eye contact as he took a long slow sip of his drink then he said im afraid to ask but am i supposed to respond to that she smiled no im just trying to paint a picture he chuckled nervously thats one helluva picture the picture im painting is that my dad and i have a close connection and recently dad and i were talking about relationships he told me that nobody has the first damn answer why two people ever get together only that there was the hardwiring but he could offer me the benefit of looking back at his marriage and those of others his experience he said amanda so many women go into a relationship thinking theyre going to change the man make him better civilize him it just doesnt work matt looked in her eyes then said i need civilizing amanda shook her head no its not that at all its more that both people in the relationship need to be in concert from the start not as my dad said have one trying to fix the other along the way matt took a sip of his scotch and nodded i fully agree with that amanda was silent a long moment oh shit did i just paint myself into a corner then why wont you quit playing cop matt and trying to get yourself killed i wonder if shes been talking about this with amy whos been banging that drum forever the smooth voice of diana krall was now singing the look of love and matt thought shes got the player on shuffle has she been playing those cds all night amanda took a sip of her wine then said okay now the fun part what bear with me she said not too long before she died at seventythree looking gorgeous even at the end anne bancroft she paused and looked at him questioningly matt said sure wife of one of the funniest guys ever mel brooks not just a wife she was a successful actress on her own you know really like what shes one of the few with a tony an emmy and an oscar to her name and you still only know her as mel brookss wife payne shook his head sorry she was mrs robinson mrs robinson the graduate never heard of it frustrated she sighed matt you cant be that dense he grinned then he started whistling the simon amp garfunkel hit tune from the soundtrack appropriately titled mrs robinson amanda punched him in the shoulder he thought it was somewhat playfully done but the sad look on her face didnt seem to support that oh you are just impossible she said her tone exasperated then upended her wine stem emptying it he made an attempt at a smile but she was having none of it then he leaned forward touched her chin with the thumb and index finger of his right hand to lift her head and kissed her on the cheek sorry i was just playing what were you going to say well matt im not playing goddammit im serious she inhaled deeply exhaled then said not too long before anne bancroft diedand she didnt say it because everyone knew she had cancer she was very private and no one knew she was dying but mel brooks and her doctorsshe was asked in an interview what the secret was to her successfuland quite clearly lovingfortyyear marriage oh shit i think i see where this is going he said okay and what do you think she said matt watch out matty ol boy this is a minefield step carefully or boom he thought for a long moment then said i dont know what with being married to a brilliant writer actor director probably something about patience and about respect and real love of course yes and no she said yes and no no what she said was all that you saidand more but she didnt list them it was the way she phrased it with his right hand somewhat anxiously he made a gesture that said and that was then he saw her face and immediately regretted it amanda said didnt you just in your last breath suggest that patience was a virtue to have in a good lasting relationship well kaaafuckingboom matty nice job you may as well have just taken a running dive onto that minefield im sorry baby well damn it matt you should be because this is really important to me because youre important to me she paused and she looked deeply and genuinely lovingly into his eyes it was powerful and he felt his throat tighten she truly is a goddess and i truly am a complete and utter ass amanda im sorry what she said was this when i hear the tires of his car come crunching up the stone drive of our house in connecticut i visualize him and think now the fun begins amanda stared matt in the eyes again do you see amanda said softly there was an excitement to their relationship they werent together for any reason other than enjoying one another love too but enjoyment he looked at her and thought the way it is in the beginning when just the thought of your mate makes your heart beat faster she added theirs was a true companionship a real relationship joyful he nodded now the fun begins she repeated i want that matt i need that now and especially later when most dont have it she looked down a moment then back up at him and softly added i felt that when i heard your key in the lock earlier now the fun begins they looked each other in the eyes and after what seemed like a very long time amanda said you dont have any response to that matt didnt trust his voice to speak he raised his eyebrows then cleared this throat only he said carefully that i really admire mel even more now and yeah i want that too they stared at each other for a moment it sounds like there was a but coming amanda said do you think its possible he hesitated then rolled his eyes nah he said obviously only in the movies her eyes grew wide with shock what then he smiled held her hand and said baby not yes but hell yes its possible he wrapped his arms around her she rested her head on his shoulder as he gently squeezed he said i do want that too i want you amanda more than anything did i just prove her fathers pointthat ill say anything she wants to hear particularly to get her naked but its more than that i meant what i said i do want her i just have no damn idea what to say if she asks about me quitting the department he felt her arms wrap around him and she squeezed gently back she buried her nose behind his ear and softly kissed his neck as he thought he heard her begin to sniffle he picked her up and carried her into the bedroom ive got you under my skin came softly from the speakers ix one fairmount avenue philadelphia sunday november pm h rapp badde jr sitting in his range rover parked at the curb near the corner of corinthian and fairmount avenues knew that his sudden dark mood had not been caused by his view of the medieval eastern state penitentiary but the haunting and imposing twohundredyearold structure damn sure wasnt helping his attitude despite the signage hed days earlier ordered bolted to its massive stone walls the signone of a dozen fabricated by the same local company that did all of pegis projectswas a fourbyeightfoot sheet of plywood painted bright white its bold black lettering read moving philly forward coming soon to fairmount the volks haus affordable apartment living four unit highrise towers another fine development for your future from philadelphia economic gentrification initiative a project of the city of philadelphia housing amp urban development councilman h rapp badde jr chairman though pegi had not yet received the paperwork from the bureaucrats in washington dc releasing the decrepit property to them badde felt enough time had been wasted and had given the goahead for the posting of the signs it had taken more of his political skills than hed expected for his housing and urban development committee to take over the property from the nonprofit historical association that oversaw it and hed really wanted to rub it in the faces of the people whod tried tripping him up every step of the way for chrissake jan hed said in the beginning even those damned dogooders call it a preserved ruin if we have to we can play the eminentdomain card and say its a neighborhood hazard a danger that needs to be condemned who the hell wants something that ugly in their neighborhood thats not even being maintained not when we can take federal funds and build housing for our voters to fight the battle for possession badde had educated himself about the property and knew far more than he really wished he did like that the prisons gothic architecture was intentionally harsh the medieval style of the dark ages was meant to intimidate those incarceratedas well as anyone who might consider committing a crime which he thought staring at it damn well may be why its bothering me right now the prison had been conceived in ben franklins house in and opened in it promoted a new type of incarceration one encouraging rehabilitation by locking up prisoners by themselves it was believed that being alone in the cold hard cells would force inmates to consider their crimes and perhaps find god as they sought penancethus the word penitentiary the cells each even had a small skylight a simple glass panethe eye of godthat was meant to remind the prisoners that they were always being watched probably the only thing about the place that rapp badde really found fascinating was that at one time it had housed the infamous al capone badde appreciated that even behind bars the ruthless gangster broke rules thumbing his nose at the system capone had packed his cold hard cell with creature comforts from woolen rugs to fine linens even a small library with reading lamps and a wooden secretary desk for his writing the prison started going downhill after being abandoned in when prisoners started getting sent to the new graterford facility outside of philly then some moron gets it made a national historical site badde had said to jan incredulously its controlled by a nonprofit organization what part of notforprofit doesnt anyone understand rather than subsidizing a damned ancient eyesore thats taking up valuable land in the middle of the city we can put the place to good use for our citizens which means for us too and against the odds and the protests hed flexed his considerable political muscle to make the peoples house a reality at least this far he thought which could all fall apart if i dont make these problems go away baddes office cell phone rang and the caller id announced janelle harper since leaving the basement of the west philly row house badde had been using both cell phones almost constantly at one point hed been on both at the same time requiring him to manipulate the range rovers steering wheel with his left knee first hed had a long talk with janelle harper then an even longer one with his personal lawyer then another call with jan to report the gist of what the lawyer had said which basically had been next to nothinghed said he was going to have to think it all over thoroughly then as badde pulled ten grand in cash from his office safe and stuffed it into a black duffel bag hed set up the rendezvous here at eastern state penitentiary and now jan was calling again yeah honey she said the russian just called and said now that the diamond property is cleared its time to talk

the medical examiners office to id the brutally beaten body you know we cant let what happened to reggie happen to him there was another long moment of silence no shit rapp jack said disgustedly you wouldnt believe how bad they beat him man about the only way i could tell for sure it was him was those scars on his ass from that dog that bit him when we were in middle school there was nothing recognizable of his face the medical guy said he thought theyd used a baseball bat then poured some kind of acid on him nobody deserves that rapp rapp heard a taptap on the window of the range rovers front passenger door he looked and saw allante williams standing just outside the door williams was a nicely dressed cleancut black male in his late thirties he was also baddes second cousin while williams tried to project a straightlaced professional appearance in reality hed just gotten paroled after serving seven years on a tenyear rap for murder he now ran what he called a private security business and throwing family a bone badde had had urban ventures put him on retainer badde reached for the master doorlocking button and pressed it williams opened the passenger door and climbed into the seat with his right index finger badd made a gesture that meant just one more second then after williams shut his door hit the master lock button again look jack make goddamn sure kenny calls me asap got it this is a lot of money and i just cant wait for him later he broke the connection then made a fist with his right hand and bumped knuckles with williams good to see you rapp you too man badde then reached into the backseat where he had his italian black leather briefcase beside a small black duffel bag he pulled from the briefcase two of the ten photocopies hed made at the campaign house they were all the same copies of the bogus badge that kenny jones had laminated in clear plastic it was strung on a black metal bead chain taken from one of the ceiling fans at the west philly row house the badge showed a color headshot of him with long locks and a full beard underneath which was kareem abdulqaadir community representative city of philadelphia forgotten voters initiative

was just talking to lives with their parents his younger brother reggie got whacked last night kennys on the run he jumped bail a couple years back after trying to sell crack to some cops allante

yo rapp its kenny he said his tone flat baddes eyebrows went up he pointed at the phone and mouthed to williams its him badde went back to his smooth politicians voice hey brother hold on a second while i get rid of this other call badde putting his left index finger to his lips signaled to allante for silence then he hit speakerphone where are you kenny badde said casually kenny ignored the question you got the money ive got something even better there was a long pause in the silence badde could hear a familiar sound what the hell is that in the background badde thought that is a bingo game that means that bastard jack is with him badde then said kenny did you know the basement of the house got broken into kenny was quiet another moment really he finally said unconvincingly they took whatever was in the filing cabinets badde went on dont know why kenny said clearly lying just old voter files dont know why anybodyd want those he paused then said whats the something better you got the money or not i got the cash wasnt easy good man rapp kenny said his voice suddenly more chipper i knew youd pull through badde looked at williams and rolled his eyes bullshit he thought youre

its going you dont want to end up like reggie you goddamn well better tell me what i need to know kenny was quiet a long time while he considered that and badde definitely heard someone calling bingo in the background dudes name is cicero kenny then said cicero badde repeated a drug dealer named cicero uhhuh i think its marcus cicero we just call him cicero badde looked at williams who shook his head not recognizing the name okay kenny heres the deal ill do even better than the thirtyfive thousand whats that ive got a fortyfivethousanddollar payday for you how much ten gs more than the

grabbed the duffel theres ten grand cash in there enough to look like a lot of money before they try counting it should buy you plenty of time allante williams nodded then took the bag ill be in touch as he was closing the door his cell phone rang he answered it big al badde took a long last look at the intimidating ancient prison walls and thought i may never win another election but i sure as hell am not going to jail he dumped the range rover in gear and sped away two hops haus cinema de lux n front street philadelphia sunday november pm will curtis had been having a fantastic dream one of those he called technicolor dreams because they seemed so extraordinarily real and cinematic in it everything was bright and pleasant complete with amazing sensations that made him feel warm and relaxed that was all abruptly interrupted by someone shaking his shoulder hey mister you gotta wake up a teenage boys voice was saying cmon wake up youve done slept through the movie twice nobody likes stan colt flicks that much the movie star stan coltreal name stanley colemanpromoted himself as being as rough and tough as his hometown of philadelphia a groggy curtis cracked open one eye he was sitting in the highest row of the movie theaters stadium seating all the way up and back in a corner he saw that the theater lights were all up and below him all the seats were empty there was a large soft drink cup in the cupholder of his seats armrest oh yeah still in nolibs he remembered that hed come into the northern liberties cinema after the shooting both to hide and to await the safety that the dark of night offered he stared back at the pimpled face of a lanky kid who looked to be asian and was maybe thirteen the kid wore black slacks and a white shirt and he held a trash bag and a fourfootlong trashcollecting device that he spun on his arm like some kind of nunchuck manager finds out the kid said youre gonna have to pay twice will curtis nodded he put his hands on the armrests and when he leaned forward to push himself up to stand suddenly felt a stickiness in the seat of his pants what did i spill my drink when i fell asleep no its in the cupholder he stood and then he smelled it dammit that dreams warm fuzzy feeling was me shitting myself goddamn greasy cheesesteak the kid now looked at him with a wrinkled soured expression he went to the far side of the theater and occasionally looking over his shoulder began sticking the pole between the theater seats and pulling out discarded candy wrappers and paper cups as carefully as he could will curtis made his way down the carpeted steps of the theater then out into the corridor he stopped looked to the right then to the left and saw a pair of restrooms two screening rooms away he found the mens room empty after grabbing some paper towels he entered a stall closing and locking the door he unbuttoned his denim jacket then reached under his shirttail to pull out the glock he looked around the stall but could not find a flat surface to put it on and he could not simply set it on the floor as he had done at the church earlier in the day here the stall walls were a foot off the tiled floor and anyone walking into the restroom would immediately see the gun in plain view and no doubt go screaming like a banshee into the corridor he looked from the floor to the back side of the door there was a standard metal hook there and he turned the gun upside down and slipped its trigger guard over the hook that works good he then undid his pants to inspect the damage he saw red thats a lot of blood not good he kicked off his black athletic shoes then slipped off the slacks and hung them by a belt loop on the hook then he peeled off his fouled underwear and wrapped it in paper towels he was now naked from the waist down and he suddenly felt very cold chilled to the core and then there was a rumble in his abdomen a half hour later feeling clammy and completely spent will managed to dress himself and exit the stall washing his hands he looked in the mirror and truly didnt recognize himself he was saddened by the ashenfaced sickly old man staring back at him he thought he looked worse than ever i know i damn sure feel worse than ever and i keep passing blood he dried his hands then started for the door feeling dizzy he took his steps carefully at the door he pulled it inward then stopped damn the gun he retrieved the pistol from the toilet stalls coat hook stuck it behind his belt buckle then made his way out of the cinema and across the complex to the car park the white ford minivan was where hed left it but the fullsize suvs that had been on either side were gone as were half the vehicles in the lot he got behind the wheel and started the engine looking at the dashboard he saw the small stack of the four remaining fedex envelopes he picked them up and flipped through them the first had a last known address that was in far south philly almost to philadelphia international airport the second was on richmond the other side of kensington the third was on ontario near eighteenth street and the fourth was the last known address that had been a dead endthe house that had burned to the ground the richmond one is too close to here for tonight he flipped back and looked at the ontario address thats allegheny west on the way home what the hell he put the minivan in gear flicked on the headlights and drove out into the night he took girard avenue west to broad streetgiving a wide berth to jefferson and hancock where hed shot leroi cheatham earlier in the daythen drove north on broad all the way to ontario there he made a left just before crossing over germantown avenue will considered pulling to a stop to reapply the fedex signs to the doors of the vehicle but he decided that the signage really didnt matter at night the guy is going to see the new white minivan and my uniform thats enough and i really dont want them on the doors if the cops are still out looking for a white fedex minivan who knows what that retard michael told them then after this ill take germantown home and finish the rest tomorrow then he did pull over but only to hit the overhead light and reread the waybill on the fedex envelope it had jossiah miffin w ontario street in his research at crimefreephillycom will curtis had learned that originally it had been miffins girlfriend whod turned in the thirtyyearold to the police miffin had been babysitting her elevenyearold daughter at her house when she had left work early to surprise him and surprise him she had she walked into the living room carrying a storebought angel food cake in a plastic togo bag and a long slicing knife she found the two of them on the sofa he was teaching the girl how to masturbate the daughter after quickly pulling on her pants had loudly defended miffin declaring it all a simple misunderstanding using the vernacular of the street she explained that miffin had been teaching her selfstimulation only because hed told her that it was very wrong for him to continue orally stimulating her with his tongue her mother had responded to that information by also drawing from the street she lunged for miffin and tried cutting out his tongue with the angel food knife she failed but did manage to slash a nasty gash on his left cheek in the shape of oddly a j after his arrest jossiah miffin had been found guilty of indecent assault and corruption of a minor the mother claimed it had been selfdefense that had led to the cheek cut miffin was sentenced to probation which included his getting and keeping a job obtaining intense sexoffender treatments and maintaining absolutely no unsupervised contact with minors having made no effort whatsoever to meet even one of the requirements of his probation miffins wanted sheet hit the megans law list and it hit will curtiss law of talion pervert list on ontario street just shy of nineteenth street and the septa train tracks will curtis slowed and started looking for it was damn difficult on the dark street here too there were huge gaps where row houses had once stood and he had to start with a known address and try to count from there to guessing how many ghost addresses there were between existing houses and this easily could turn out like that other addressnonexistent he was amazed that his decent middleclass house was only a couple miles from this rundown ruin of a neighborhood the houses were literally falling apart and all the cars here were older models some very much older including the carcasses of two that clearly had been wrecked and abandoned long before as the minivan rolled down the street its headlights picked up an occasional addressand twice a group of young boys walking down the broken sidewalk trying to stay in the shadows they look like theyre up to no good he finally saw in the headlight beam counted the gap next to that house as and decided the next ratty row house had to be he stopped the minivan at what he presumed was parked grabbed the envelope peeled off his denim jacket and got out as he looked at the darkened househe could not see one light on insidehe now worried that this address may be deserted one step away from falling down and becoming a gap too but when he knocked on the old wooden doors glass pane which was covered on the inside by a dusty curtain a dog barked loudly from deep inside the house he faintly heard footsteps inside then the lone bulb of the porch light came on bony fingers pulled aside the dusty curtain and an elderly black woman with a deeply wrinkled face and thinning gray hair peered out at him she looked half asleep and judging by her expression she was not expecting to find a white man in a fedex uniform on her porch can i help you she squeaked out sorry to bother you so late maam its my last delivery he held up the envelope got a special delivery from the us treasury for a jossiah miffin at this address a what its an envelope from the treasury department in washington been delivering these all day im guessing theyre some kind of refund check check she repeated taking a long moment to consider that just leave it at the door be good sorry maam cant do that need for thishe glanced at the bill of lading and pretended to read itjossiah miffin to personally sign for it he live here she nodded he my grandson i sent him to the drugstore in my car you can wait if you want will curtis felt his stomach start to knot up again he looked at the woman nodded and said im going to wait in the van suit yourself she said and the dusty curtain fell closed in the fifteen minutes that will curtis had sat in the minivan hoping not to experience another unfortunate personal accident hed again seen the group of three boys whod been walking down the sidewalk earlier they simply have nothing better to do or choose not to find something better to do no wonder they get in such trouble you look long enough for trouble youre damn sure going to find it there was still a knot in his stomach and he still felt terribly weak and drained the dizziness had not completely gone away he pulled the glock out from under his shirt and laid it on his lap then realized he hadnt been keeping track of how many rounds hed fired more important how many i have left all i know for sure is that theres one round chambered he pushed the magazine release on the side of the weapon and the magazine dropped out of the grip its capacity was ten rounds he held the magazine up to the overhead light numbered holes up its back side allowed for a visual count of the bullets but in the poor lighting he had trouble seeing exactly how many were there with some effort he started thumbing the rounds out the top of the magazine and into his lap he counted a total of five left six including the one in the throat he reloaded the magazine with some effort slipped it into the pistol and using the heel of his left hand slammed it home okay now where the hell are you jossiah a minute or so later his eyes were slightly blinded by lights reflected in his rearview mirrors he blinked then looked he saw a yellowish pair of big round headlight beams bouncing up and down the street toward him then he heard the sound of the engine valves knocking noisily as the driver accelerated thats one old damn car the shocks are shot and it sounds like the engine is just about to go too the car rattled to a stop at the weedchoked curb in front of the row house at ontario street the air became heavy with the smell of raw gasoline and halfburned exhaust will curtis pulled on his greasesmeared fedex cap and swung open the minivans door he stepped out swaying a bit then walked back and stood in the beam of the cars left headlight so that the fedex logos on his hat shirt and the envelope were clearly visible to the driver he held the envelope in front of his crotch concealing his hand holding the pistol as will curtis carefully continued stepping toward the carwhich he now could see was a mids amc gremlin in his opinion one of the ugliest and most worthless vehicles that had ever been producedthere came the sound of tortured metal as the driver pushed open the rustedout door you stay there girl the driver a black man with shoulderlength hair said to someone in the passenger seat curtis could barely make out what he thought was a thin young teenage girl sitting there she wore a white sleeveless jacket so hes still got a taste for the young ones the black male turned to will curtis and aggressively said what the hell you want your grandmother said i should wait for you to deliver this envelope curtis said youre jossiah miffin right as curtis stepped closer he saw the black mans attention turn to the envelope then despite the nowlong black hair will saw the face from the mug shot including the jshaped scar what up with the envelope whats in it unexpectedly a delirious will curtis heard in his head stan colts voice colt playing an overthetop toughcop character was saying one of the lines in the shootemup movie that curtis had just sat through twice curtis tossed the envelope at miffins feet miffin instinctively tried to catch it will curtis then leveled the glock at miffins head and in his best deep gravelly stan colt voice recited the line a heavy diet of lead with a side order of penance curtis squeezed the trigger twice the first round pierced the hook of the jshaped scar causing miffins head to jerk backward the second round then went into the roof of his open mouth and exited through the top of his skull miffin collapsed to the asphalt street the teenage girl in the car began screaming hysterically and suddenly feeling very dizzy will curtis saw nothing but black he collapsed beside miffin dropping the glock as he went down will curtis didnt know how long hed been passed out only that hed definitely been out cold he had a lump on his forehead from where it had hit the pavement he figured that he couldnt have been out too long because the teenage girl was still screaming in the passenger seat and jossiah miffin of course was still where hed fallen dead as will curtis tried to stand he quickly discovered that he had almost no energy whatever he made it up to his hands and knees and began crawling back to the ford minivan it took an eternity to pull himself up into the drivers seat then get the door closed with a lot of effort he started the engine put the shifter in drive and rolled forward he looked in the mirror and saw three young black teens rush out to the gremlin he watched as one reached under the car and pulled something out what was oh the envelope those savages will steal anything they think is worth something wont they be surprised when they find the wanted sheet then again maybe theyll turn him in for the reward the kid shoved it inside his sweatshirt then took off running will curtis turned at the corner and headed for germantown avenue three hops haus tower unit n lee street philadelphia sunday november pm in the middle of the plush kingsize bed facing a panoramic view of the lights along the delaware river and beyond matt payne and amanda law were lying on their left sides spoon fashion resting in the glow of the carnally exhausted matt had his arms wrapped around amanda and across her slowly rising and falling bosoms his right leg was draped over her right hip his toes tucked back in just above her ankles when he inhaled he marveled at her soft warm scentat once sweet and from the perspiration lightly saltythat felt rich in pheromones this is as good as it gets he thought and he gently kissed the back of her neck she grunted softly appreciatively then even though his cell phone was in the pocket of his khaki pants that had been unceremoniously dropped on the floor at the far side of the bed and were now under a curledup luna he heard the phones distinctive ping that announced he had an incoming text message okay weve been lying here like this for at least ten minutes neither of us saying a word or moving an inch just intimately intertwined and its been nice incredibly nice so would i really ruin everything by checking that message i really really really dont want to fuck up the moment becausewowwhat a helluva romp that was where does she get the energy and the deep passion incredible then he heard another ping in his arms amanda moved a little youre not she softly said but it was more of a question he didnt reply are you she then said her tone somewhat incredulous he thought you probably would if it was yours going off he said of course not baby and then there was another ping then two others in a row ping ping what the hell whats going on matt i dont know baby i told you im not going to check those but i should what the hell ping she moved again then suddenly squirmed out from under him well she said if youre not i sure as hell am she reached down the side of the bed and grabbed the waistband of the khakis tugging hard when she felt the weight of luna on them sorry girl amanda said as she dug in the pocket and pulled out the phone luna slinked across the room and went into her crate in the master bath it sounded as if she threw herself down onto the hard plastic liner then luna gave a heavy sigh amanda looked at the phones screen she said three from tony what the hell he said sitting up and adjusting the pillow to lean back on one from kerry and the last ones from denny denny he said she held the phone out to him that cant be good matt said he doesnt like texting and only does it out of necessity wonder why he didnt just call he glanced at them then saw that the time stamps of the various messages were not all from the last few minutes as the multiple pingpings would have suggested instead the first one from harris went back almost an hour that suggested the messages had been stacked up somewhere unable to get through he then looked at his signalstrength icon and it was flickering from the weakest signal to the icon that read no signal payne shook his head then read the first message from tony harris anthony harris yo matty turn on keycom cable channel amp back it up to the top of the hour trouble brewing when hops haus tower had been built the entire property had been wired so to speak with superhighspeed keycom plastic fiberoptic digital transmission cables the lines allowed for the advanced technology of keycoms various communications packagestelephone internet televisionto be exclusively provided by keycom to the residents and the retailers there was a simple reason for this select relationship keyproperties was heavily invested financially in the complex and while some complained that such a noncompetitive environment effectively violated at least a dozen antitrust laws in the commonwealth of pennsylvania alone the man who controlled both companies argued differently frances franklin fuller the fifth said that everyone did indeed have other options they are free to choose to live anywhere else and purchase the inferior communications packages offered there matt looked at amanda and said tony says i need to see something on channel real quick she nodded but be aware if you run out the door on me two nights in a row matt smiled then picked up the remote control turned on the sixtyinch flatscreen television mounted on the wall and hit the button on the keypad three times because the highspeed system was all digital the control box for the television had a function that allowed any recorded program to be replayed or fastforwarded for up to two hours the fastforward mode did not of course work for anything that was airing live now thatd be revolutionary payne had said when an installation tech was showing him all the systems bells and whistles because if it could do that itd be tantamount to looking into the future but a live newscast once recorded on keycoms massive servers could be replayed hey matt said this is the cable channel for the live streaming news from mickey oharas crimefreephilly website the news live stream looked exactly like any conventional television network newscast it had a slick news center a studio set that consisted of a brightly lit anchor desk behind which sat a pair of young perky and polished talking heads on the wall behind them crimefreephillycom newscast was spelled out in gleaming chrome letters that were splashed with various colors from filters on unseen klieg carbon arc lamps that hung from the studio ceiling below the chrome letters the wall held a bank of four giant flatscreen studio monitors each showing some working news story matt hit the button on the remote control that restarted the newscast at its beginning good evening said the goodlooking male talking head with dark hair and a bright smile welcome to the nineoclock edition of tonights newscast at crimefreephillydotcom im dusty meyers and im jessi sabatini said the attractive redhead with a dazzling display of teeth who was sitting beside him tonights top news this weekends halloween homicides continue to mount in philadelphia matt saw that the image behind her on the upperright flatscreen studio monitor was of francis fuller standing at a lectern matt hit the fast forward button causing the audio to go temporarily silent and the two talking heads to begin bobbing as if on coil springs they made very fast gestures then the camera zoomed in on jessi sabatini as she jabbered a box popped up beside her bobbing head in the box appeared a progression of photographs mostly mug shots of all the popanddrops with their names shown beneath them then there was a picture of francis fuller with his name underneath and payne hit the normal play button on the remote jessi sabatini was saying corporate titan frances fuller whose lex talionis has been very busy this weekend gave a press conference earlier at which he presented tenthousanddollar rewards to some heroic citizens of philadelphia our own michael j ohara was there and has the story the image of fuller filled the entire television screen and so the circus continues matt said to amanda hell it was inevitable fiveeff my favorite puritan would make an appearance there was a text box to the right of fullers head reading francis fuller ceo lex talionis distributes rewards along the bottom of the screen was a line of text that moved from right to left reading breaking news mayor carlucci announces police department emergency task force as halloween homicides continue to rise body count in old city now up to five the voice of ohara who was offscreen came from the television speakers this is michael j ohara reporting from lex talionis in old city where frank fuller has just made some philly residents much richer for having helped make the city much safer the camera pulled back and showed more of the room francis franklin fuller the fifth was in what appeared to be a conference room of his richard saunders holdings office building the short portly fortyfouryearold wearing his customary benjamin franklin outfit stood behind a solid black lectern both hands gripping its top the front of the black lectern had a bronze plaque bearing the lex talionis logotype with the stylizedeyeball o the camera then pulled farther back and showed a line of people standing to the side between them they held three ceremonial bank checks fashioned from heavy white plastic sheeting three feet high and six feet long each had in the upper lefthand corner a large red representation of the lex talionis logotype and each had been filled out in handwritten lettering with a fattipped black permanent marker payne immediately recognized one of the women who held the reward checks she was the first on the left closest to the lectern and look who hes with matt said thats the mother of one of the dead popanddrops it was confirmed by the name written in her checks payee field shauna mays matt added we think that my mystery shooter popped her son and then she and a gypsy cabbie dropped the body at fiveeffs matt thought women really can be the more ruthless of our species despite her face and hand being deeply bruised and still looking malnourished and dirty in the torn clothing shed been wearing when payne interviewed her earlier in the day shauna mays stood there beaming she heldbarely as it was bigger than she wasa ceremonial check made out in the amount of ten thousand dollars to her rightbehind another tenthousanddollar ceremonial check that was written out to paco ramirez yvette iglesia et alii for sasha bazelonstood a small pack of teenagers holding the check at each end were a toughlooking latin male wearing baggy jeans and an oversize jacket and a pretty petite latina with fiery eyes matt said those in the middle must be the crowd javier told me about the ones who caught the punk responsible for principal bazelons death and that pretty teen girl looks like she is probably javiers baby sister matt did not recognize the woman holding the third oversize reward check but like shauna mays she appeared roughlooking and underfed judging by the name on the check it was most likely michael floyds mother then matt noticed the two extra legs standing beside her and when the check moved michaels head appeared around its right end matt turned to amanda and said thats the kid i was going to tell you about very strange hanging on the wall behind them was a white banner emblazoned with your home for helping clean up your hometown wwwlextalioniscom and wwwcrimefreephillycom the camera went back to fuller and the voice of ohara said lets now go directly to fullers press conference as if trying to bring attention to them francis fuller took an inordinate amount of time to straighten the tiny round ben franklin glasses at the tip of his big nose then he cleared his throat he smiled and leaned forward to speak into the black stalk microphone that curved up from the lectern thank you for coming fuller began i do have an important announcement today my assistant however tells me were to start with your questions he pointed forward toward the unseen reporters yes madam a female reporters voice asked thereve been a total of six dead dropped here five dead evildoers he corrected and one looking like he soon may join them okay five dead one nearly so what is your reaction to mayor carluccis statement earlier today that clearly was triggered by these dead men left here at lex talionis well of course i agree with mayor carlucci whom i consider not only a fine leader of our city but also a close personal friend bullshit matt said fuller went on we agree that evildoers must be held accountable for their actions i fully support jerrys efforts and those of our hardworking police department which is why today its been my great honor as a citizen of philadelphia to present the reward checks for ten thousand dollarshe gestured toward those holding the ceremonial checksto these fine folks who have helped rid our society of those who chose not to be lawabiding today alone we have two additional evildoers who will never again roam our free society to harm the innocent and we have xavier smithnow at hahnemann university hospital in critical condition and under police guarda career criminal with more than twoscore arrests who has been brought to justice regardless of any differences the mayor and i may or may not have i would suggest that real progress in cleaning up our city is being made here at lex talionis amanda said you know rationally i cant say that i disagree with fuller not you too matt said incredulously she shrugged and said its really no different from what my father said about humans not being very far removed from other animals he compared the criminals particularly the most heinous to hyenas saying they were nothing more than opportunistic savages and that it took a predator like a lion to weed them out essentially cleaning up its environment if someone had done that a long time ago with delgado and jimenez a lot of people would never have been hurt matt looked at her for a moment well i can understand her wanting vengeance for being abducted he then said im afraid to ask what you think about the mating ritual of the female praying mantis she looked at him out of the corner of her eye grinned playfully and replied nothing to lose your head over sweetie onscreen fuller was taking his time pointing toward the crowd then said you sir your question a male voice said how do you respond to those who say that your reward to remove evildoers from free society actually encourages killing as opposed to simple capture and arrest fuller tried to square up his short paunchy body and then said with strong conviction i believe the results as noted speak for themselves next question and the law of talion is above our legal system the same reporter asked no of course not i would simply characterize it as a more effective system both for dealing with the worst of our criminal element and for discouraging others who consider crime acceptable people have choices some make very bad ones time and again he picked up from the lectern the wanted sheet for kendrik leshawn mays he held it out toward the crowd and cameras the mug shot was clearly visible on the television take as an example this latest evildoer among his many other crimes kendrik mays preyed on children forever corrupting their innocence for his sexual pleasure he was a fugitive on the run for years after serving time for involuntary deviant sexual intercourse and rape of an unconscious or unaware person it is my understanding that his victim was a fourteenyearold girl whom he drugged and then committed unspeakable acts upon mayss mother told me that he continued such corrupt and contemptible behavior right up until his moment of lex talionis fuller paused dramatically then went on i put to you that the traditional legal system failed not only to either change or stop mays but that it also failed to protect us citizens from him and there are countless other evildoers just like him ones fearless of the legal system amanda said and i dont disagree with that either matt caught himself nodding then he stopped himself just before he said aloud thats whats known in my business as job security baby fuller pointed to another reporter yes what are your thoughts about operation clean sweep matt said now this should be interesting fuller nodded solemnly took a long moment to gather his thoughts then said my first thought on the police departments task force is this if anyone can make it successful its the wyatt earp of the main line he paused and almost grinned matt blurted fiveeff you sonofabitch fuller went on and i mean that sincerely sergeant payne is not only a fine lawenforcement officer but a fine friend of mine too bullshit matt said again now fuller said with all due respect to my good friend mayor carlucci i say this to his statement concerning this new task force why waste effort trying to stop someone who is doing good by removing the evildoers from our city such people should not be condemned and hunted but rather encouraged in whatever way indeed rewarded and thats why lex talionis is here today and its why it will be here tomorrow and the days after francis franklin fuller the fifth then smiled and raised his right index finger wagging it at shoulder height and that brings me to todays big announcement he said i am genuinely honored to say that henceforth lex talionis will double each new reward tohe poked the air with his index finger for each wordtwenty thousand dollars the microphone picked up the loud and indignant voice of a young male just out of camera view say what and we only get ten grand muthafucka matt payne chuckled that was that backward kid then he thought wait hes doubling the reward he thumbed the remote control to back up to where fuller raised his finger then watched him poke the air and say twenty thousand dollars sonofabitch therell be mayhem in the streets amanda said youre right now what happens matt looked at her i dont know exactly but its going to have to come from someone with stars on his white shirt or higher and soon matt looked at his phone and quickly read through the other texts the second one from harris timestamped almost thirty minutes earlier than the other read anthony harris good news the prints came back from iafis on reggie jones one was a nomatch but the other was a hit for i shit you not a drug dealer named marcus cicero aka marc james white male age long list of priors matt shook his head some druggie murderer trying to pass himself off as a roman emperor whats up with that then he read harriss third text the most recent which was timestamped fifteen minutes after the second one anthony harris fyitheres now an undercover sitting on jamess lka in port richmond hes working a couple cis too well maybe one or both confidential informants will want to cash in the wannabe roman for a twentygrand reward matt then went to rapiers message cpl kerry rapier thought youd like to know that i heard from forensics on the prints from kendrik mayss house got a hit its your old buddy snu damn but no surprise there the mystery shooter strikes again finally he got to coughlins payne was amazed that coughlin had actually thumbed out a cleanly written text message and he wondered how long the two sentences had taken him they read uncle denny be prepared for conference in ecc tomorrow your pal f just caused carlucci to really blow his cork again oh shit matt said as he quickly thumbed and sent the reply yes sir ill be there what matt amanda asked i was right something from very high up uncle denny says that carlucci has blown his cork and that he will hold another conference first thing in the morning which means ill have to be there at ohdarkthirty anytime he plays the boy scout motto card its code for me to really be on my toes be prepared she said reading the screen uhhuh amanda then reached over and picked up the television remote from beside his knee she hit its red off button she then snuggled up to him and tugged his cell phone out of his hands she turned it off too and slipped the phone back into his pants pocket then she put her head on his shoulder and softly said thats tomorrow sweetie now its be prepared for tonight four two liberty place thirtyseventh floor south sixteenth street philadelphia sunday november pm seriously jan harper said her tone sharp and incredulous she tried keeping her voice low to avoid being overheard in the fivestar restaurant high atop one of phillys tallest buildings rapp i dont know if you can cover your ass this time those guys are dead and the demolition company is raising hell that wehudsaid it was clear to take down those condemned buildings and i dont know who gave them the goahead badde heard jan but he was paying more attention to how she looked in the posh vista fiume restaurant and thinking how when theyd walked in shed looked like she owned the place the young bankers and lawyers and other professionals had turned the beautiful people badde thought and im with one of the prettiest women in the room not bad for the son of a barber from south philly this really is a classy joint maybe after i get through all this and the fund makes a little more money ill get a condo here move on up i heard risken bought a sixmilliondollar one just before he ran for governor not bad company for me to be associated with taking up half of the entire thirtyseventh floor river view had a highclass international feel more like a large openair nightclub than a restaurant all its gleaming woodinlaid tables featured undulating lounge seats that faced the windows and their commanding views of the city and the rivers bracketing it the ambience thrummed with a high energy while vista fiume set a new nightlife standard for philadelphia it still wasnt on par with the chicest and toniest restaurants and nightclubs that were offered in new york the city that never sleeps and the philly nightlife certainly wasnt anywhere near that of say buenos aires where the argentines began partying well past tenthirty and did not slow down until the sun came up but judging by the international clientele badde thought scanning the room its coming those foreign models are gorgeousand jan fits right in when he had driven the range rover up to the cobblestone circle drive of the hops haus tower jan had been waiting just inside the main glass doors the bright lights of the lobby made her look like a model her curvy body looked stunning in a black velvet dress her silky lightbrown face complemented with an elegant short strand of pearls although baddewho had stopped by his city hall office and changed into a plain dark twopiece suit and opencollared shirt hed worn two days earlierwould never have admitted to it he felt far out of her league and that had only become more apparent to him when theyd arrived at two liberty place a firstclass highrise that was the citys thirdtallest building it featured executive offices and condominiums costing upward of seven million dollars among the most expensive in town then jan had really proven she owned the place when she told the maitre d the reservation is under harper and its for table eightytwo please after they were seated and rapp badde could tell the table had the best view in the place he said youve been here before she smiled no i just made a few calls while getting ready then made the reservation a friend said table eightytwo is supposed to have the best sunset view and she said i should have crab cakes and lobster and my date should get either the tenderloin or veal or if youre feeling adventurous the mini cheesesteaks get some before yuri arrives badde then thought and what the hell does the russian want to talk about all of a sudden ive been racking my brain over that since jan said we were coming here he really is an impatient onean impatient one with a temper fortyeightyearold yuri tikhonov was an international investor who had earned his first billion dollars between the ages of thirtyfive and fortyafter it was rumored having more or less left the employ of the sluzhba vneshney razvedki russias external spying and intelligence gathering agency formerly the kgb tikhonov now had investments in companies around the world though primarily in russia europe and the united states he held fortynine percent of diamond development in philadelphia while the other fiftyone percentthe majority of shareswas owned by minority investors or minorityowned companies including one urban ventures llc tikhonov was quietly friendly with various members of the russian mafia a group viewed as far more merciless than the italian mob it was said that the only reason the russians hadnt come in and simply wiped out la cosa nostra was that they felt the crimes of the sicilianspetty by comparisonwerent really competition the wops kept the cops plenty busy chasing cheap hookers and sports bookies and were thus a convenient diversion from the russians own highdollar illicit activities everything from corporate fraud to money laundering badde had learned that it didnt take a mathematical whiz to put two and two together and figure out that a lot of the investment money going into the diamond development projects was dirty cash getting cleansed but no oneparticularly a politician hoping to run for mayor of philadelphia in the next electionwas ever going to question the minority lead investors brought together by tikhonov about where their funds had been borrowed from venture capital firms serving as shells for the russian mob if that happened the moneyand the multipurpose professional entertainment venue and other major projectswould find a city not so inquisitive and unfriendly to capital investment jan harper took a bite of her crab cake appetizer then carefully picked up her martini glass and sipped the bright green appletini seriously badde said nodding after taking a swallow of his vodkaandtonic cocktail whos anyone going to believe more the office of a city councilman or a bunch of dago dirt movers ive got that possible liability plausible deniability rapp she interrupted her tone now slightly disgusted i told you that its called plausible deniability what you deny is believable and to that point im not sure thats the case here three people are dead and it looks like hud sent a crew out to do it she looked at him as she went to sip her martini he looks pissed and he is but its not because i corrected him its because i interrupted badde then shrugged i dont know if we didnt do it then we didnt do it its perception jan said people believe what they see not necessarily what the facts are then maybe we can blame it on miscommunications throw some poor campaign volunteer under the bus he paused in thought actually that might be a really good idea an extra diversion jan harper didnt say anything but she was coming to realize that the more she knew h rapp badde jr the more she found that he wasnt at all shy about making people sacrificial lambs for his purposes sure its not unusual in politics where the rule is always to protect the politician but he almost does it for blood sport and whos to say he wouldnt do it to me jan glanced around the room then looked at badde who she saw was also scanning the crowd suddenly his eyes went wide dont look now he said looking behind her toward the entrance wait till i tell you what yuri just walked in she turned when she saw him she smiled and waved once then turned back toward badde yuri tikhonov had a slender compact fivefootfive frame his dark hair was cut stylishly long the back touching his collar he had a narrow face with piercing bluegray eyes he wore a custommade dark twopiece suit and iceblue shirt with french cuffs tikhonov was making a direct line for the table stopping only to shake hands with a few of the welldressed men and kiss the cheeks of many more ladies badde still looking in his direction was starting to stand he said somewhat disgustedly the bastard acts like he owns the place jan said simply he does rapp i thought you knew when she saw him standing she suddenly said in a loud whisper badde he looked at her with an annoyed expression that was meant to say what now she nodded toward his crotch and waved her hand over hers your napkin he looked down said shit then removed the black linen napkin from where hed tucked it into his belt he tossed the napkin onto the lounge seat just in time to hold out his right hand he turned on his best politicians charm yuri how very good to see you again the russian ignored baddes hand and instead first leaned over and lightly kissed jan on both cheeks it is a pleasure to see you janelle he said taking a step back and spreading his arms you look fabulous a movie star then he turned to badde and offered his hand we do need to talk he said by way of greeting badde motioned for him to have a seat and he took it this wont take long the russian said all businesslike a waiter arrived and delivered to him a glass of ice water how soon does the project move forward now that the holdouts have left the property rapp looked to jan she said theoretically crews could start tomorrow realistically probably a month they watched as tikhonov sipped his ice water and considered that not good enough he then said sooner too much time has been wasted ever the politician badde smiled and lied of course yuri sooner he looked at jan and said sooner right rapp im not sure sooner badde repeated almost as if it were an order then looked at tikhonov tikhonov locked eyes with him no promises the russian said i want it done badde then said just so you know there may be a small delay we first have to manage a misunderstanding that we killed one of the holdouts by sending the wrecking crew and tikhonov interrupted him it will be no problem that will be found to be nothing more than an unfortunate accident rapp interrupted thats what i thought he said giving jan a glance and they will find that the others died of natural causes unknown tikhonov concluded how can you be so sure badde asked clearly surprised tikhonov considered his reply a long moment then simply said succinylcholine what a muscle relaxant tikhonov said conversationally sometimes called suxamethonium injected it causes the heart muscle to relax till it stops has a very short halflife undetectable after perhaps an hour badde again glanced at jan then at tikhonov you did it tikhonov stonefaced took a sip of his ice water then said of course not friends badde thought ice water is fitting just like the blood in his veins badde said so then you called the demolition crew tikhonov shook his head dimitri his assistant passed himself off as the new hud expediter yuri tikhonov sighed time is money and it is time for the development to move forward he paused and locked eyes with badde just make sure it continues to do so tikhonov suddenly stood and said youll please excuse me then he leaned over and kissed janelle harper once on the cheek and left as jan and rapp looked at each other wordlessly his business cell phone vibrated in his pocket in the dim light under the table its glowing screen read roger wynne badde slipped it back into his pocket then looked at jan who was downing her martini i need to visit the mens room he stood and made his way toward the bar then to the windows on the other side he called wynne back as he looked out at the grand view the thirtyseventh floor offered found him rapp wynne said when he answered well where kennys been anyway a nice old woman by the name of irma graham just called here looking for kenny said she missed him tonight at fernwood manors bingo and that she hadnt seen him since he put a bunch of boxes in the storage room of their community activity center that was bingo i heard in the background get someone over there to whatever you said fernwood manor at cobbs creek wynne furnished and im already on my way destroy every goddamn shred of paper i dont care if we ever have those votes again badde ended the call looking out the window over the city he thought well at least thatll get rid of the absenteevoter stuff now kenny cant squealwhos going to believe him without proof i may again have just dodged going to jail on the way back to the table badde paused at the magnificent bar there was a muted large flatscreen television tuned to the eagles broncos national football league game badde acting as if hed stopped to catch the scorephiladelphia was just barely beating denvertook in the crowd particularly all the attractive women well ill damn sure be coming back here the tv broadcast went to a commercial break one of the tv news talking heads came on with a tease for the eleven pm newscast the box that popped up next to the news anchors head showed francis fuller awarding at least three ceremonial tenthousanddollar reward checks the text below the popup box said halloween homicides coldblooded murder turns into cold cash and kennyand that drug dealer ciceroare going to be next x one the roundhouse third floor eighth and race streets philadelphia monday november am the executive command centers main bank of monitorsall nine sixtyinch flatscreen televisionswas filled with the beetred angry face of the honorable jerome h jerry carlucci mayor of the city of philadelphia pennsylvania he stared right into the camera with a searing fire in his intense brown eyes as he said with great force and never in all my years in this cityboth during my years in the philadelphia police department and my time in elected office as your mayornever have i witnessed such careless disregard for our laws and i am here to tell you that this is lawless chaos of the worst sorthis fist could be heard pounding the lecternand i will not let it stand there will be law and order in the great city of philadelphia if i have to bring in the state police and our national guard troops and i am also telling you again that if you have information about any crime you are to call our police department or the tips hotlineand no one elseand the police department will respond appropriately this will not in any way cause anyone to be ineligible for any possible reward it will however restore decorum to our fine city and dignity to its citizens now to show how absolutely serious i am in this regard just this morning four people who went to lex talionis in old city the image on the screen then cut to a shot of what had become the familiar scene at third and arch except this time there was a sea of dark blueuniformed police lining the sidewalks shoulder to shoulder as far as the eye could see and there were police cruisers parked bumper to bumper all along the curbs there was a medical examiners office van parked on the sidewalk its rear doors open and a gurney with a full body bag being pushed inside and in front of the van were four people their hands cuffed behind their backs being led by blue shirts to the open rear doors of two chevy impala police cars parked at the curb the first was a tiny ancient grayhaired black woman in a sacklike dress then a skinny young teenage black girl in a white sleeveless jacket and two teenage black males in jeans and hoodie sweatshirts a tow squad wrecker rolled past on arch street a rustedout mid s amc gremlin hanging backward behind it were each arrested on multiple counts of suspicion of murder tampering with evidence at the scene of a crime and various other criminal charges in connection with the murder last night of one jossiah miffin arrested were his grandmother and three teenagers two boys who identified themselves as miffins neighbors and a girl who said she was his niece the image went back to carluccis face he went on pointedly if these people had followed the proper procedure and called for the police to handle the case of miffins murderand not brought the deceased to lex talioniscertain charges would never have been brought against them he paused exhaled audibly and in a calmer manner added so in conclusion let there be no mistake that as i swore to do when i took my oath of office i will see that the laws of this fine and just city are enforced to the letter and together you and i will see philadelphia return to normalcy thank you for your time and may god bless you and the great city of philadelphia corporal kerry rapier was in his wheeled nylonmeshfabric chair at the control panel manipulating the images on the three banks of monitors he rewound the recording back to where carlucci was forcefully saying and never in all my years in this city i think three times is enough kerry sergeant matthew payne said it was difficult enough to watch live the first time i was convinced that his anger was being directed at the head of task force operation clean sweep who has accomplished exactly zero in his appointed duty payne was sitting at conference table one detective anthony harris sat beside him each had a commanding view of the three banks of tv monitors all brightly lit with various images ones that now included the new popanddrops before them on the table each had a notebook computer wired into the communications network matts screensaver image showed a hundred tiny acp rounds continually ricocheting across the screen looking like a copperjacketed hollowpoint meteor shower next to matts computer was a coffeestained mug with the representation of a patch on the patch was the downtown philadelphia skyline with the statue of william penn atop city hall overlooking that was a grim reaper in a black cape and holding a golden scythe and in gold letters the words philadelphia police homicide divisionour day begins when yours ends circled the patch kerry rapier said but matt i just love that part where the spittle starts flying and he pounds the lectern with his iron fist while declaring and i will not let it stand brilliant just brilliant theater payne raised an eyebrow im pretty damn sure he wasnt acting ive seen him blow his cork a time or three before he looked to the second bank of monitors getting back to the task force task at hand so to speak lets see if we can turn over some damn stone under the stone kerry rapier checked the notes hed written on his pad then looked at the banks of monitors and said we have new information in the case files of kendrik mays leroi cheatham reggie jones and now jossiah miffin he paused then added oh and those three dead we saw at the demolition site in northern liberties not those now payne said they were a block away from where cheatham got popped but theyre not even remotely connected to any of the popanddrops including cheathams i agree harris said unless the medical examiner finds some obvious cause of deathmaybe poisoningmy gut tells me that those are fast on their way to becoming cold cases all we know is what caused the blunt trauma on the onea damn wrecking ballbut that wasnt necessarily the cause of death gotcha rapier said he manipulated his control panel kendrik mayss case file went to the main bank of monitors his ugly mug staring down at them rapier took the colt cursor and clicked on the link that took them to the crimescene video but the pointing device didnt fire or have any muzzle smoke what happened to that payne asked i disabled it before the mayor came in this morning kerry said decided it was a bit over the top anyway as i told you in that text last night matt forensics matched the prints at the mays house to our mystery shooter snu the video showed the mays basement with invertedv evidence markers everywhere rapier moved the cursor over the marker bearing the numeral in the corner of the basement it was next to a pistol on a dirtencrusted sweatstained tshirt a box with a series of digitized buttons at its bottom then popped up it held a sharp image of the revolver that theyd seen being photographed on the live feed the day before matt you were right about the snubnosed it was a chief s special not a bodyguard manipulating the console joystick rapier rotated the image of the pistol showing all the angles at which it had been photographed he then moved the cursor to the series of digitized buttons he clicked the button with a question mark on it and up popped a translucent text box over the image of the pistol it read weapon smith amp wesson model special revolver serial number unknown removed by grinding or filing sold unknown seller unknown buyer unknown notes airweight chiefs special shot stainlesssteel cylinder and inch barrel aluminum alloy jframe black rubber uncle mikes grips only two rounds of federal caliber p loaded in cylinder other three were spent shell casings of same round barrel riflings show evidence of firing fingerprints belonging to kendrik leshawn mays popndrop then the boom that killed mays was the payne said not our mystery mans cal no no it was almost certainly the fortyfive rapier said what do you want to bet that when we run the ballistics on those plusp rounds the will be linked to some other murder harris said payne nodded as they watched rapier move the cursor to the basement floor to the marker with a black at the foot of the dirty mattress lying on wooden pallets next to it was a single spent brass casing rapier put the cursor over the marker and a box popped up with a digital photo closeup of the brass round he clicked on the boxs question mark button spent casing gap notes possible bullet that killed kendrik leshawn mays popndrop snu then he went to the opposite end of the bed to the basement wall that had the blood splatter he clicked on the evidence maker and up popped a box showing a closeup photograph of a crime scene unit techs hands in tancolored synthetic polymer gloves holding a heavyduty needlenose pliers device that had just extracted a mushroomed coppercovered lead bullet from a wooden stud the question mark button brought up copperjacketed hollowpoint caliber notes possibleprobable bullet that killed kendrik leshawn mays popndrop snu okay payne said so we know its our mystery shooter next rapier then said working the control panel mayss case file was replaced with leroi cheathams on the main bank of monitors they read the notes section and chuckled at detective harry mudds thoroughness hed written michael floyd age nephew of deceased when asked about possible involvement of a driver of a fedex white minivan responded with what be a fedex motherfucker i forget who it was harris said but someone once questioned mudd about leaving something out of a report once and hes never not put everything he knew into one i heard that once when a guy got shot in the pisser of a bar he included all those for a good time call suzy phone numbers he copied off the walls only some pompous ass like howard walker would question a pro like him payne said then he immediately realized rapier probably had heard him speak ill about his boss when he glanced his way rapier was nodding that and i like mudds sense of humor rapier then went to the crime scene units imagery of the cheatham scene in northern liberties and then went through the same motions with the spentcaliber casings there payne felt his cell phone vibrate once staring at its screen and seeing that he had no tower signal and that the time stamp of the new text was twenty minutes old he blurted goddamn cell service or i should say goddamn lack of service he glanced at rapier kerry how come text messages are more reliable than voice call me skeptical but it seems like its the phone companys evil plan to screw the consumer you either pay the outrageous price for an unlimited usage plan or you pay through the nose for each individual text rapier swiveled in his chair and replied texts use less data than voice making them easier to get through the pipes they actually use the tiniest part of the bandwidth that the cell tower uses to constantly link to your phone the rest of the bandwidth is for the heavier data users the actual talking and internet surfing he paused and smiled but im betting youre right about it being an evil plan matt grunted as he read the text from amanda all morning hed figured that he was going to catch hell from her after she woke up and found on the pillow beside her only a noteand not him hed written you look like such an angel while you sleep i couldnt find the haloi lookedbut theres definitely a heavenly glow sorry i had to leave so early see you soonm hed then gone back to his rittenhouse square apartment atop the cancer society building that he rented from his father hed shaved and showered and changed into nicer clothes he now wore a navy blazer gray woolen cuffed trousers a crisply starched lightblue shirt with a red striped tie and highly polished black laceup shoes but apparently i missed that bullet he thought rereading it amanda law got your note thanks i way overslept amp woke up not feeling well going down to drugstore then its back to bed xoxo a hmmm back to bed but no fun there if shes ill guess that glow was a fever hope its not me shes sick of could be from sheer exhaustion then he thumbed the reply im really sorry baby can i bring you anything aspirin chicken soup how about eternal happiness see you soon he hit send then he put the phone back in his pants pocket two a minute later the main door to the ecc suddenly began to swing open payne harris and rapier could hear the soft humming sound of an electric motor on the other side then in the doorway appeared a black male in his late teens he was in a wheelchair but it was a highly maneuverable power chair he controlled its speed and direction with a joystick on the right armrest he fluidly rolled inside the ecc well hell matt payne said look whos still on the right side of the law how are you andy great marshal andy radcliffe said with a smile radcliffe with gentle black eyes and a round kind face had a full head of dark hair trimmed to his scalp his jeans and slightly oversize cotton dress shirt were neatly pressed his navy blazer was somewhat worn payne admired the intern not only because he was a sophomore at la salle doing a double major in computer science and criminal justice and planning to get on with the department he was also genuinely impressed with andys attitude after the teen had been robbed three years before in north phillythen paralyzed when the robbers viciously stabbed him in the back radcliffe looked at rapier anything i can do to help he asked he pointed at paynes mug more java marshal and theres that positive attitude payne thought willing to fetch coffee anything were reviewing some cases payne said never hurts to have a fresh set of eyes and ears make yourself comfortable at the miserable rate were going well be here some time radcliffe nodded yessir okay kerry lets move on to reggie jones can i first read this one on cheatham radcliffe asked wait ill pull it all up on the laptop you guys go ahead payne looked at him and thought and hes got confidence just walks in as if hes been doing it for years the motor of andys power chair hummed as he went over to the end of the conference table close to rapier and pulled out a laptop from a sleeve behind his chair he plugged the box into the departments communications system and started pounding its keyboard payne and harris exchanged glances then looked back to the main monitor the fat baby face of reginald jones was looking down on them radcliffe looked up from his laptop and saw rapiers custommade pointer onscreen he snorted thats some sweet cursor kerry watch this rapier said he typed a command on his keyboard then put the cursor over reginald reggie jones case no popndrop and clicked the overhead speakers then filled with the report of a gunshot and a puff of smoke blew from the muzzle of the pistol pointer now that radcliffe said shaking his head might be a bit too much finally payne said a clear voice of reason is heard on the task force harris snorted radcliffe looked at him as if wondering if he was being mocked then judging by paynes expression realized that wasnt the case he returned his attention to his laptop fingers tapping the keyboard as he stared thoughtfully at the screen rapier did something at the control panel and when he went to the notes section of reggie joness case file and clicked on fingerprints the gunfire and smoke effects were gone he turned it off again payne thought but he doesnt look like hes pissed or anything heres this new guy james matt rapier said as two boxes popped up with digitized images of fingerprints one was headlined suspect name unknown the second had the new live link marc james case no harris said the prints on the stillunknown doer are being run again forensics got a hit with jamess only because they reran his too they said they didnt find a match the first time because his prints on record from a previous arrest didnt have sufficient ridge detail for comparison but the second goround they lit up just enough payne looked at rapier punch up james kerry reggie joness fat baby face was now replaced with that of a shinyskinned black male with a round face and malepattern baldness toilet seat hair payne remembered hearing someone describe it its shape was similar to those seats found on public commodes and the upper part of his garment looks like a hospital gownor romanlike robe who does this cicero guy think he is payne said looks like hes in a toga too all kinds of crackpots in this city try to stand out from the crowd andy radcliffe said theres that voice of reason again payne said this time radcliffe didnt at all feel like he was bring mocked payne read off the screen marc james aka marcus cicero age twentyeight looks like a nice guy if you can just overlook all those unfortunate priors for running meth and roofies and for good measure he racked up a conviction on involuntary deviant sexual intercourse guess he wanted to test his product harris snorted yeah really nice guy whos sitting on him now charley bell in that old peco van payne nodded the philadelphia electric company van was always a good choice its paint shot but the faded peco logotype on it easily recognizable okay payne then said its no doubt way too soon to have much on this new one thats got hizzonor spitting mad but punch up number twelve on the main bank please rapier worked the keyboard and the case sheet for jossiah miffin appeared it showed both his mug shot in which he had closecropped hair and his medical examiners office photo where he had long black hair both showed the nasty jshaped scar on his left cheek name jossiah a miffin description black male age lbs lka w ontario st phila prior arrests total possession of marijuana possession of methamphetamine convicted of indecent assault amp corruption of a minor and sentenced to probation of intense sex offender treatments amp no unsupervised contact with minors call received nov hours cause of death gunshots to head percent probability case no popndrop notes fugitive warrants issued for multiple probation violations has prominent jshape scar on left cheek takeeta smith yearold female witness who claims to be niece of deceased stated in interview that she saw him killed nov hrs by snu in street at lka amp described snu as a skinny white male approximately years of age wearing delivery uniform assailant left wanted sheet at scene in fedex envelope that was discarded body transported to lex talionis old city check out the notes matt harris was saying looking at the main monitor payne looked up at the main monitor and read it a fedex delivery there at ninethirty on a sunday night then he turned to rapier punch up that interview with the girl the animals socalled niece the main bank of screens then showed homicide detective jeff kauffmana tall darkhaired thirtyfouryearold who had a quick laugh when he wasnt interviewing murder suspectsin homicide interview room ii with takeeta smith she was sipping from a plastic bottle of grapeflavored soda the empty wrapper of a tastykake lay on the metal table they were almost exactly halfway through the interview when takeetas scratchy voice coming through the speakers in the ecc ceiling said it be a fedex envelope and dude had a fedex uniform youre positive she looked at kauffman like he was from another planet then said yeah fool i be positive i mean he be standing in the headlight clear as damn day cant miss no fedex sign it be on every box my cousins black tar shit come in from texas harris chuckled then said look at her oh shit whatd i just say expression now whos the fool takeeta what a brain trust payne said they just dont know better reminds me of that arrogant hank whatshisname the us congressman from somewhere near atlanta who was grilling an admiral on capitol hill about the navys plans to station some eight thousand sailors and their families on guam he lectured the admiral that the island was only twentyfour miles long seven at its least widestthats what he said least widest shore to shoreand that he was afraid that with all those extra people the island would tip over and capsize harris laughed youre kidding payne shook his head i shit you not my friend thats the kind of brilliant example of the geniuses in our government that kids like her get to look up to as role models he looked over at radcliffe andy whove been your role models in life well my momma of course he said immediately clearly without thought she taught me hard work discipline never to give up and theres will parkman that really good cop who was a marine and helps me go to school so i can eventually get a job here he paused and thought then added and you marshal payne looked at radcliffe thinking that he now was being mocked but when matt saw andys face he knew andy was sincere payne said id be damned careful about that last guy hell only lead you to trouble he sighed and damn sure not to catch any bad guys whats up with the badguy popanddrops having histories of sex crimes radcliffe said and stds whered you get that payne said impressed he pointed at his laptop screen from the master file case notes youve gone all the way back to the beginning sure isnt that what youre supposed to do when trying to turn over a rock under a rock payne nodded yes indeed it is and to answer your question theres not any single answerwith the exception of what kerry recently suggested none apparently knows what the hell a condom is radcliffe said ive been feeding key data into my skunkworks search engine radcliffe had managed to get his hands on an early version of a superpowerful software program developed at mit and payne had seen him use it before and payne said all the popanddrops whod been shot had either been charged with or served time for a sex crime all but the lawyer and his client right jaycee harris put in had charges against him of involuntary deviant sexual intercourse and rape of an unconscious or unaware person in one case that gartner got tossed tossed on a technicality radcliffe said the chain of evidence of the rape kit was broken it was deemed inadmissible in the trial but the results still are on file they state that the blood test from the girl he raped showed that she had really early stages of the bacterial disease gonorrhea and payne said radcliffe shrugged nguyens master case file from those charges says that he was undergoing treatment for gonorrhea so nguyen gave the girl the clap payne said would appear that way nothing new kerry has a story about one where the rape victim got whatever disease in her throat payne said he then appeared to be in deep thought he said which puts nguyen in line with the other popanddrops leaving only gartner with no sexcrime link he may just have been in the wrong place at the wrong time when jaycee got popped he paused then added lucky us you didnt like gartner nobody liked that slimy sonofabitch andy radcliffe raised his eyebrows nodded once then looked back to the laptop screen maybe i can find a link with gartner and some sex crime kerry lets take another look at the interview i had with shauna mays rapier worked his control panel and the image of matt with the malnourished and badly bruised woman in homicides interview room ii came on the monitor in the righthand bottom corner was a small date stamp nov run it up to about payne said rapier fastforwarded to that point on the clock hit play and shortly thereafter the sound of payne exhaling came through the speakers in the ceiling then his voice slightly frustrated said okay lets start from the beginning who had the gun a delivery guy he come in with kendriks paper that paper i had that the cop took the wanted sheet yeah thats it he come in andno wait first he say he got a check for kendrik and when i let him in he give me the paper the sheet said there was no check this began at what time she cocked her head time this morning all i know aint no clocks in a crack house in the ecc there was a chorus of chuckles from harris radcliffe and rapier as they watched payne in the video nodding while writing in his notepad kerry said gee marshal i thought everyone knew crack houses didnt have clocks payne gave him the finger as his voice came through the speakers what did this guy look like and was he alone anyone else in the house just him old white guy maybe my age tall kinda skinny okay you can stop it kerry payne said he looked at harris so a delivery guy a fedex delivery guy and mudd said the blue shirt had seen a fedex minivan rolling through right before cheatham took a bullet but that kid his nephew told mudd that he didnt see one which of course as mudd pointed out couldve been a straightout lie they were quiet a long moment each in deep thought then harris said you have any idea how many fedex trucks there are in philadelphia but it was on a sunday not a normal day for deliveries ill say it again matt you have any idea how many fedex trucks there are in philadelphia and just because they may not be delivering theyre still moving around the city for logistical and other reasons like maintenance and then again for all we know this one was stolen matt nodded agreed but its a rock to look under maybe well find another under it looking at the image of marc james payne said whoever he is our mystery shooters bright hes doing the reverse of a sweepstakes sting a sweepstakes sting radcliffe repeated payne explained you mail out say a thousand letters to the lka of people wanted on outstanding warrants the letter says the recipient is guaranteed a prize worth up to a couple hundred bucks and the first fifty people who show up have a chance to win a car the officiallooking but bogus letterhead has the address of some empty store in a strip center you get a civicminded owner to let you borrow the day of the event you furnish it with a couple desks and some chairs then put signs in the window that say keystone state sweepstakes headquarters and you borrow a nice new luxury sports car or suv to park in front with a sign saying win this then when the wanted ones show up an undercover posing as a secretary matches the letter to the warrant list to make sure its still outstanding then sends the idiot back to another room for his photograph and prizea nice shiny pair of handcuffs radcliffe grinned sounds like it works not as good as it used to but yeah theres still plenty of stupid critters out there one really bright one even brought his court papers as his proof of id so radcliffe said instead of the guy sending out letters to the lkas he went to them individually saying he was delivering fedex envelopes containing checks that appears to be it payne said everyone was silent a moment then radcliffe went back to his keyboard and stared at the screen then quickly typed something and smacked the enter key there he said pointing at the screen i dont know if it means anything but in nguyens file yeah payne said the district attorneys case notes say that william curtis is employed by fedex here says he lives on mount pleasant payne casually sipped from his homicide coffee mug then said who the hell is william curtis twenty minutes later harris returned the receiver to the cradle of the multiline phone on the conference desk he looked at payne this will curtis called in sick today his supervisorhe looked at his notesa guy named jeff allan said hes in a bad way curtis has been out sick most of the month and he said that judging by the look of him its the real deal he guessed its something terminal he asked but curtis wouldnt own up to it payne and harris looked at each other and theres no answer at his house on mount pleasant payne said harriss cell phone started ringing he checked the caller id then answered the phone with whatcha got charley payne looked at harris and saw his expression brighten how many harris said then okay got it let me know if anything changes were on our way he looked at matt as he broke off the call bell says two black males just entered the james place on richmond carrying a black duffel bag payne quickly stood up kerry you and andy run things here and call me the minute you find anything else on this curtis guy as payne pulled on his blazer and dug in his pocket for the crown vic keys he said to harris lets roll three richmond street philadelphia monday november am allante williams saw an open parking spot one block south of he liked it for two good reasons it was close enough to reach if the deal went sour and he had to run and his black dodge charger would be well hidden by the old peco truck right in front of it he shut off the car looked at kenny jones sitting in the passenger seat then reached back and pulled the black duffel from the backseat he unzipped it and took out a monster of a stainlesssteel pistol even kenny appeared impressed at the sight of the ruger redhawk a doubleaction revolver chambered for magnum you ever shoot a wheel gun allante asked any gun damn right big al allante wasnt sure if he believed him this redhawk is a cannon allante said handing it to him its mine dude and i want it back so dont get any goddamn ideas yeah sure man kenny said wrapping his hand around its big black grip and aiming it out the windshield keep it down dammit okay kenny said putting it on his lap and swinging out the cylinder to check if all the bullets were live rounds there aint no damn bullets in this gun kenny blurted what the hells it good for if it aint got no bullets calm down dude you saw how it looked when you first saw it thats all you need to do with cicero door opens you move inside with the bag of money first then hold the tip of this badass barrel in his face and with no bullets you wont be able to shoot me later besides ill be backing you up with this going in allante said pulling back his jacket to reveal the ruger millimeter semiautomatic in a holster on his belt kenny clearly looked as if he didnt like the idea but then shrugged he reached in his pocket and pulled out five or six footlong white zip ties not gonna shoot the bastard anyway kenny said pointing to the zip ties gonna do to him what he did to reggie with allante williams just to the right of the door at richmond street kenny jones banged on the door what are the fucking odds that some hothead inside is going to look out the peephole see this dumbass holding the sack of cash then drill the doorand himwith lead damn good thats what the odds are this better be worth forty gs the door opened a crack and kenny said cicero i got it like i said man he held up the bag with his left hand the hand cannon was in his right hidden by the bag the door closed and there was the clanking sound of its two chains being removed then the door swung open and kenny surprising the hell out of allante did exactly as hed been told allente went in behind him whatre you doing kenny cicero said staring at the business end of the barrel then kenny swung the heavy stainlesssteel ruger fiercely pistolwhipping ciceros mostly bald head cicero quickly backed up shielding his head from the blows with his arms kenny wait allante yelled stop cicero then turned and tried to run down the basement stepsbut kenny got one last hard swing in and cicero went tumbling down the steps in the basement were two small dirty rooms one with a twinsize bed and a wooden table there were bags of pills stacked two feet high kenny dragged the limp but breathing body to the bed then pulled the zip ties from his pocket and cinched them tightly around ciceros neck ciceros body began to convulse but within a minute it went slack damn that was fast allante thought kenny turned and said im gonna look for some acid be right back and he ran back up the stairs after allante was sure kenny was out of earshot he called rapp badde hey man i know you were worried everythings under control the cicero guy is gone and look badde interrupted you dont have to do kenny too we got back everything that he stole alls good just turn him in for the reward too okay man youre the boss he said but realized that he was talking to a broken connection badde had already hung up then allante starting to paw the bags of pills wondering what they might be heard banging on the front door upstairs what the he threw all the bags of pills he could fit in the duffel then headed for the stairs will curtis curiosity getting the best of him on his way to port richmond drove to where leroi cheatham had had his lex talionis moment because of the various oneway streets he had to make a huge circle around the block then there on hancock was a shred of yellow police line tape flapping in the breeze and thats all then he thought he saw a bloodstain on the alleyway but it was in shadow and he couldnt be sure a block later he did a double take at the cleared city block down theres where all those cops were but i thought there were some houses on that corner now its all smelly raw dirt he drove on and ten minutes later just before eleven oclock he turned the white ford minivan onto richmond street then rolled up the street looking for during the drive will curtis had decided he wasnt going to handle this delivery like the others he didnt think he could go through the whole charade then maybe have to wait if the bastard wasnt here he felt so ill in fact that he almost had not come at all even after a nights sleep he had not felt significantly better hed regained a little energy from forcing himself to eat a banana and half a turkey sandwich on the drive over but he was still weak far more so than usual the only good thing he decided was that he hadnt had another unfortunate accident the lump on his forehead hurt enough but i really want this evildoer to pay the sonofabitch not only sold those damn daterape pills but hed been convicted of using them too so the minute the door opens im just going to go in i know what the bastard looks like then its wham bam thank you maam and im done four richmond street philadelphia monday november am flying up the delaware expressway in the gray unmarked crown victoria matt payne killed the siren over ann streetwhere this part of i went from being elevated to ground levelthen caught the next exit the offramp actually went over allegheny and he had to go up a block to westmoreland then double back around a park as he did so he listened to tony harris talking on his cell phone with charley bell the hefty thirtyyearold detective who was sitting undercover in the old philadelphia electric company van okay got it harris said into the phone he broke the connection and looked at payne he said nobodys come or gone since the last two went in and that itd be a good idea to go around the back and check that first said its the house with the black cadillac escalade in the drive payne nodded harris then said give me your phone payne did and he saw harris key in a number then call it its harris tony said just making sure you have matt paynes number now you both have each others number ready to speeddial in your last call list he ended the call without another word then handed the phone back to payne because the crown vics had been on loan from homeland security and no one knew for sure how long the loan program would lastwhat the fed giveth the fed can taketh away at any damn timethe police department had had no intention of spending the money to buy more of its police radios and installing them in the cars when theyd have to uninstall them at the end of the loan it had been decided that the portable handheld police radio units could be used and failing that a cell phone as matt made the right turn onto westbound allegheny he reached down and tugged the plug for the light bar out of the cigarette lighter receptacle harris then flipped the two sun visors up concealing the light bar and the police sticker payne turned left onto richmond then left again at the next street which provided access to the rear of the properties it was next to the interstate highway and there was plenty of traffic noise along the back side of the buildings some of the row house backyards still had grass but it wasnt well kept others were cluttered with anything from storage buildings to busted aboveground swimming pools to junk cars and one had a shiny black luxury suv theres the ride payne said as he pulled out his colt officers model from inside his waistband with the muzzle pointed at the floorboard he thumbed back the hammer to cock it then thumbed up the lever at the back of the slide to lock it then as he continued to scan the area he held it on his right thigh but i dont see anything happening at the houseor any of the others for that matter me neither go up a couple more drives past it and ill get out and cover this back here while you and charley take the front just before making the right turn to get back to richmond matt saw in his rearview mirror that tony was rolling two rusty drums from the yard next door and putting them behind the escalade that probably wont stop someone trying to get away but it ought to slow them then matt saw ahead of him at the corner of richmond the nose of charley bells peco van it was parked against the right curb the row houses here were mostly identical all threestory and faced with red brick the front door right at the sidewalk and many of them had plastic garbage bags stacked at the curb as matt rolled toward richmond he saw a latemodel plain white ford minivan going up richmond its brake lights were lit in the split second when it passed payne saw a white male at the wheel and he thought that the driver wore some kind of uniform shirt he stopped the crown vic just shy of richmond nosing it up on the sidewalk he shut off the car then he put in his left ear a wireless speakermicrophone device for his phone speeddialed charley bell and slipped the live phone into his pocket matt heard bells voice in the earbud hey matt that white minivan that just went by has pulled up to our house no shit payne said opening his door can you make out the driver just that hes a white male older hes getting out now moving slowly payne closed the door of the crown vic he quickly went to the corner near the front door of an abandoned storefront he held his colt along his right leg as he peered around the brick edge of the wall and up the street he thumbed down the pistols lock lever now when he went to squeeze the trigger the hammer could freely fall to fire the round in the chamber matt could clearly see the man that is a fedex uniform and hes carrying an envelope but he is moving really slow almost like hes not going to make it to the door no doubt whatsoever thats will curtis bell said what do you want to do matt lets hold and see what happens be ready to move tonys covering the back door they watched as the man banged on the faded maroon metal door then waited for an answer then he banged again and after a moment the door opened charley i cant see who opened the door shit matt me neither they watched as will curtis held up the envelope in his left hand curtis said something but he was too far away for them to hear it then suddenly they watched as he surged at the open doorand disappeared inside oh shit lets go payne said he started up the sidewalk in a crouch after a few strides payne glanced over his left shoulder and saw the hefty bell lumbering after him like matt charley had his police badge clearly visible its leather holder hanging from a chain around his neck charley had his service glock out of the belt holster on his right hip i think i saw him pull something from his waist matt maybe a pistol before they reached the front door which was still open matt could hear angry voices inside i told you i aint him old man a male voice said put down the fucking gun curtis in a weak voice said then wheres this james put down the gun old man the other male repeated matt got to the edge of the doorway and carefully looked inside there were only the two males visible will curtis in the fedex uniform and a blackskinned man with scraggly long hair and a full beard they were in the large front room of the row house curtis was to the left and had a glock aimed at the chest of the black male who held up his hands shoulder high the fedex envelope in his right one payne saw that a woodfloored hallway led to the back of the house and to the flight of stairs leading to the second floor under that flight just barely visible was the entrance for the flight that went downstairs to the basement he felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see that charley bell was now right behind him payne reached into his pocket and broke the connection for their call then speeddialed harris charley listened in as matt told tony what hed seen inside ending with going to take it now payne then yelled around the corner of the doorway police put down your weapons when he peered around the corner he was amazed that will curtis had actually complied with the order on the first shout he was looking with tired eyes toward the front door sergeant matt payne with his colt raised in both hands close to his chest smoothly rushed through the doorway detective charley bell lumbering on his heels payne was shouting police nobody move hands on your head the black male still had his hands raised and now moved them to his head will curtis as quickly as he could complied too they could hear detective tony harris kicking in the back door matt motioned for charley to go let tony in and he hustled down the hall just as payne said to the black male wheres the other guy the old man pointed under the stairs and yelled coming out of the basement payne looked toward the basement entrance in time to see the head of a black malewhose hand was bringing up a black semiautomatic pistol the shooter swung the pistol at payne but before matt could squeeze off a shot will curtis stepped between themand then came three shots from the black male two of the bullets hit curtis in the left shoulder the third in his left chest as matt dove for cover at the foot of the steps leading upstairs he thought did he step in the way on purpose he did he took those damn bullets for me matt saw charley bell peering around a corner at the back end of the hall the shooter did too and fired three shots at him two struck the wall at the corner sending sheetrock flying the third found bells forearm fuck im hit he shouted curtis fell forward and grabbed the glock hed been told to drop then remarkably squeezed off five shots in the direction of the shooter then will curtis finally collapsed blood from his wounds beginning to pool around him the longhaired black male was now cowering behind payne lying flat on the floor against the wall payne carefully looked past the edge of the stairs toward the basement entrance trying to get a clear line of fire on the shooter he saw the entrance but not the shooter sonofabitch keeping low he stepped into the hallway and moved toward the basement entrance the worn wooden flooring squeaked under his weight you okay charley payne called out get that sonofabitch matt payne looked back at the black male he was still cowering against the wall but now he stared wideeyed at the old man lying in the pool of blood as payne moved closer to the basement entrance tony harris appeared from around the bulletpocked corner he motioned toward the basement then motioned that hed cover matt matt nodded when payne got to the top of the stairs he saw a heavy blood trail leading down the wooden treads will curtis hit the bastard police matt yelled down the steps drop your weapons payne and harris slowly descended the stairs when they reached the bottom there were two rooms they cleared the first then followed the blood trail to the door of the second a light was on inside it and when payne looked around the edge of the door frame he saw two black malesboth dead one was on the floor at the end of the heavy blood trail the shooter had at least one enormous hole through his neck the semiautomatic millimeter baretta was still in his right hand the other dead male was lying on an old twin bed he had been strangled two footlong plastic zip ties strung endtoend cut deeply into his bruised neck a black duffel bag with stacks of banded cash and clear plastic bags full of pills was on the floor matt and tony then heard fast footfalls on the wooden flooring above their heads then they heard charley bell yell stop police payne exchanged a fast glance with harris then bolted up the steps at the top payne turned toward the open front door as he heard the minivan starting and then its tires spinning as it squealed away he looked toward the back of the house and saw bell standing with what looked like a dirty dish towel wrapped around his left forearm it was bloodsoaked the sonofabitch grabbed the old mans keys bell said and got his glock too matt looked at the towel im okay bell said go go go matt pointed down the basement stairs clear the house with tony he said then stepping around the dead body of the old man whod sacrificed his life for matts payne was out the door five the first thing matt payne saw when he came running out of the row house was a huge nastylooking garbage truck it was stopped right beside the peco van and payne realized that if he didnt run faster to reach the crown vic the truck was going to move up and block him as he ran he yelled stop police to the driver holding his lefthand palm out anxiously signaling him to stay put but after he got in the car and finally had it moving off the sidewalk he saw the last plastic garbage bag from the corner being tossed into the back of the garbage truck as the truck moved forward matt hammered the heel of his right hand on the horn as he floored the accelerator yanking the steering wheel to the right he had to hop the curb to narrowly miss both the front of the garbage truck and the rear of a parked car payne pursued the ford minivan as it raced up richmond street he thought about calling in for backup but dismissed that immediately no police radio and im not about to try juggling my cell right now he flipped down the sun visors then reached down and plugged in the emergency lights and threw the switch for the siren two cars were stopped up ahead waiting for the traffic light at allegheny avenue he watched as the minivans brake lights came on for a second then went off the van then swung into the oncoming traffic lane to get around the two cars then it blew through the red light cutting a hard right and going down allegheny avenue matt came up on the two cars but could not pass because a pickup truck had just turned down richmond blocking his way he could see the redandblue strobes reflecting off the back glass of the vehicle ahead of him he hammered the horn out of habit but its sound was mostly lost in the loud whoopwhoop of the siren the traffic light cycled to green the first car started to roll then both finally moved quickly out of the way matt made the corner just in time to see the tail of the minivan going up an onramp headed southbound on the delaware expressway he pulled on the gearselector stalk on the steering column dumping the transmission into second gear then floored the accelerator just before the ramp at the next block with the highrevving engine roaring matt tapped the brakes once before turning then put the police interceptor into a squealing right turn he corrected the skid then floored the accelerator again and bumped the transmission into high gear this section of interstate was four lanes in each direction and matt saw that the minivan was weaving through the heavy traffic sonofabitch is using all the lanes the other vehicles were quickly becoming aware of the reckless minivan just past the point where the expressway became elevated some began moving out of the wild drivers way matt figured that the driver of a fullsize dodge suv must have seen the ford minivan flying up on its tail it tried to move quickly into the lane to its leftand immediately sideswiped the honda accord that was traveling in that lane oh shit the impact from the heavier truck forced the lighter compact car into the far inside lane which fortunately was unoccupied that honda was damn lucky it didnt slam into the concrete divider or completely lose control the ford minivan apparently anticipating the dodge suv swerving back into its lane then darted through a gap in the right lane it flew past a halfdozen vehicles before again having to brake heavily this time almost at the vine street expressway after checking the nearby lanes for traffic matt calmly steered to follow it i wonder how many violations ive made so far of our departments pursuit policies plenty im sure and im also sure someone will be more than happy to point them out as we review the video of it in the ecc his cell phone began ringing and he dug it out of his pocket and glanced at the caller id payne was amazed the earbud was still in his ear when he answered the call he wondered if all harris would hear would be his siren wails and horn honks tony hows charley all okay hes fine weve got the scene under control where the hell are you southbound delaware expressway about to vine hot on the tail of the white minivan you want to call in for units to try to head off this guy hes running hard and about to make a big mess out here payne closing the distance between them watched the ford minivan make jerky movements as the driver tried getting around four vehicles that were driving abreast and effectively forming a wall across the expressway they did try to get out of the way but every time a driver anticipated the minivans next move another driver wound up blocking him again the minivan was in the far right lane and when it came up to the twolane split leading to the exit for the vine street expressway it shot the gap and accelerated tony he just took the vine exit hell were almost to the roundhouse about a quartermile out maybe hes going there to give himself up he heard harris snort then start relaying that updated information payne made the exit for the vine street expressway and as the two lanes of the elevated concrete thoroughfare widened to four matt looked in the distance and saw the minivan heading toward the center city skyline also ahead at the point where the expressway crossed over fourth street there was a series of flashing caution lights and signage that read caution road repair ahead yo give us a brake the minivan was now just passing the first of the flashing lights the lights and signs became thicker as the expressway approached the fifth street overpass and payne remembered that that was where two eighteenwheelers had collided a few weeks earlier the mass of them together had taken out five sections of the threefoottall concrete divider that separated the eastbound and westbound lanes as a temporary patch a double line of fiftyfivegallon drums orange with reflective tape had been put in place with more caution signage and a temporary speedlimit sign had been posted matt saw ahead of the ford minivan that traffic in all the westbound lanes was slowing to a stop just past the construction crew looks like the vine expressway is shut down tony the minivan was beginning to make jerky moves from lane to lane looking for a route around the slow traffic matt moved into the far outside lane behind the minivan and eased up on the accelerator as he closed the distance between them no exit here nowhere to run looks like the end of the road but then he saw that not only was the minivan not slowing to the posted twentyfive miles an hour it was accelerating and then it suddenly shot from the right lane and across the other threethen went right through the orange barrels scattering them and causing the construction workers to dive for cover jesus h christ what matt he just crossed into the oncoming lanes how the hell did he do that he blew through a hole in the construction zone more important how the hell did he miss those oncoming cars at least theyre driving slow because of the roadwork the minivan then drove to the far left of the expressway and turned left onto a lane that was carrying oncoming traffic coming off the benjamin franklin bridge the vehicles swerved to miss hitting the minivan headon jesus and now hes headed the wrong way toward the ben franklin bridge payne with his hands on the steering wheel at three and nine oclock looked over his left shoulder then cut across the westbound lanes of the expressway stopping in the hole that the minivan had plowed through the rows of orange drums then he checked for a gap in the eastbound traffic there wasnt one immediately but as he waited one driver then two and three and more began to heed the siren and redandblue strobes either slowing to a crawl or coming to a complete stop jesus here we go payne put his right foot to the floor and the crown vic burned rubber as it shot forward the minivan had momentarily disappeared around the curves of the turns leading up to the bridge but its tail came back into view as soon as payne reached the first overhead gantry the five vehicles that had just crashed also came into view payne steered around them and headed for the bridge the eightyyearold steel suspension bridge spanned the delaware river connecting center city to camden new jersey it had a total of seven lanes for automotive traffic separating the east and westbound lanes was an articulated concrete wall called a zipper barrier depending on traffic demand the threefoottall zipper could be moved to create more or fewer lanes in either direction payne saw that the zipper had been positioned so that there were four lanes westbound which gives me more room the minivan was going right down the center whitedotted lines the oncoming cars parting to either side that created a path for payne and he gunned the crown vic closing more quickly than before need to do this pit fast he pulled up almost to the minivan setting up with his reinforced front bumper to the left rear of the minivan just forward of its rear bumper then he quickly turned the steering wheel to the right causing his front bumper to smack the minivans rearand the minivan to suddenly break loose and skid sideways matt slammed both of his feet on the brake pedal which triggered the chattering kickback of the antilockbrake system he watched the minivan slide sideways toward the concrete zipper barrier then go into a counterclockwise spin on its second almost complete revolution the right front bumper impacted the zipper barrier then the whole right side of the vehicle slammed into it forcing the van to almost flip over into the eastbound lanes the impact moved the zipper barrier into them causing two cars to collide on that side payne let off the brakes and dodging an oncoming volvo its woman driver looking terrified drove beyond the minivan he nosed the crown vic against the barrier at an angle so that it would serve as a buffer as he got out he saw that the minivan driver had already fled the vehicle and now was running with the pistol in his right hand he also saw that blood flowed from a gash on his forehead it was a feeble escape attempt he almost immediately tripped in a crack just before an expansion joint in the suspension bridge and bounced as he landed on top of the joint when he hit he loosened his grip on the pistoland it slid toward the gap in the expansion joint that glocks going to fall into the delaware but then it kept sliding and stopped in the middle of the westbound lanes payne then suddenly heard the horrible roar of screaming tires behind him and he immediately ran to the pocket that the minivan had made by moving the zipper barrier when he turned it was just in time to see a woman in a brandnew toyota land cruiser slam into the side of the crown vic the suvs windshield instantly filling with multiple inflated air bags jesus guess the car can go back to the feds now payne looked back at the black male he was still trying to get up payne ran toward him his pistol aimed at his back he shouted police dont move but then the black male did move bolting toward the zipper barrier now payne no longer had a clear field of fire there were countless vehicles zipping by in the three eastbound lanes just beyond the man stop payne yelled again as the man went over the low barrier the man paused there on the other side waiting for a gap in traffic and causing a sixwheeled big box delivery truck in the inside lane to lock up its brakes trying to avoid hitting him that suddenly slowed traffic and there was a gap and the black male decided to make his dash across but as he bolted into the next lane the large profile of the delivery truck obstructed his viewand he ran right into the path of a fastmoving lowprofile sports car payne watched as the car hit him in the lower legs the impact caused him to tumble like a rag doll over the top of the sports car he flipped through the air twice before hitting the bridge decking and then being run over by three other vehicles including a bus traffic came to a stop matt payne shook his head he decocked his colt then slipped it back under his blazer and beneath the waistband of his woolen slacks he could hear the sirens of the squad cars that harris had called in screaming toward him and what sounded like the heavy horns of the fire departments rapidintervention and major crashrescue vehicles then he saw one of the aviation units bell l helicopters approaching from the north glancing at the overhead traffic cameras he thought kerry probably called in every last one of the cavalry too standing there in his navy blazer his gray woolen cuffed trousers a once crisply starched lightblue shirt with a redstriped tie and his highly polished black shoes all scuffed he forced a smile and waved at the cameras and rapier and ratcliff and whoever the hell else is in the ecc the eastbound traffic slowly parted and two philadelphia police department chevy impalas rolled up to the dead black male the blue shirts began routing traffic around the scene another impala arrived and went to the cars that had stopped after hitting the man and there were paramedics talking with the woman sitting behind the wheel of the suv that had hit the crown vic payne turned and walked back to the minivan the window on the sliding center door had popped out on impact payne looked in through the hole the first thing he saw was a plastic sign with the fedex home delivery logo and then he noticed on the floorboard several scattered rounds ofcaliber gap hollowpoints theres the rest of will curtiss story so the popanddrops are over six hops haus brewery n lee street philadelphia monday november pm h rapp badde jr was sitting at the massive rectangular stainlesssteeltopped bar he chewed on his lunch of a steak sandwich while watching with fascination the police chase playing out live on the two giant flatscreen televisions behind the bar what the hell drives so to speak people to act that way he thought thats just insane to run from the cops then go the wrong way on the freeway who plays with fire like that he reached for his pint glass of lager which was almost empty he drained it then tried to get the barmaids attention it took a minute because everyone was glued to the image of the white minivan racing the wrong way into westbound traffic on the ben franklin bridge even some of the chefs had come out of the kitchen to watch after badde waved his hand for help for a bit longer one of the busboys saw him and flagged the barmaid and she got the signal to bring him a fresh pint who the hell am i kidding all ive been doing is playing with fire latelyand coming damn close to being incinerated but whats the saying close only counts with horseshoes and hand grenades badde was more or less hiding under a plain cloth cap and blending in with the crowd he wore an eagles sweatshirt faded blue jeans and athletic shoes trying to keep a low profile until the thing with allante williams kenny jones and that drug dealer was finally finished and i get back my ten grand from allante i wonder how much i can really trust him i did just feed him a job that made him forty grand richer badde had come to the brewery after visiting the demolition site and checking on the progress there it had been damned lucky that the cops had not released the scene until late the night before lucky because by then it had been too late and dark to move the heavy demolition equipment theyd been able to get the crews there at the crack of dawn for an early start by the time badde had arrived the crews were mostly done and hed taken a picture with his cell phone camera of that almost perfectly flat property then sent it to janelle harper with explicit instructions for her to email it immediately to the russian i dont know for sure if what he said about those holdouts being killed with a muscle relaxer is true or not but i do know that its smart to proceed with caution i dont want to get on his bad side and theres no question that that was a threat last night which is why i had janelle send those photos to him and why hell get more photos the minute the damn construction crews arrive there was a huge gasp from the crowd as the televisions showed the gray police sedan racing up behind the minivanthen ramming it the minivan slid sideways then spun twice before smacking the divider wall jesus it hit so hard it moved the wall hed already heard from roger wynne that the last of the recovered absentee ballots had been shredded into a fine confetti so that was not going to come back to haunt him unless wynne gets wise and thinks he can use that against me im going to have to keep an eye on him as he picked up his new pint of lager and downed a third of it in one swallow his go to hell cell phone rang he put down the glass and looked at the caller id what its gobbledlygook nothing but yes he said answering it i got your photograph the site is looking better the russian how the hell did he get this number yuri badde said i think we now better understand each other badde began im glad but then he realized that the line was dead he anxiously sipped at his beer as he tried to figure out just what the hell had happened there was another gasp from the crowd and he looked again to the televisions the camera showed a remarkably clear shot of a man running from the minivan being chased by a man in a coat and tie from the gray sedan that first one looks like it could be kenny being chased by a plainclothes cop and then the camera caught a clear shot of the man in the coat and tie someone said look its the wyatt earp of the main line then badde saw the man who was being chased trip get up and go over the concrete divider what happened next was obstructed by the big box of a delivery truck but the crowds gasp made it obvious what had happened damn talk about being thrown under a bus he took another sip of beer and thought a long moment bottom line im going to have to watch my back a helluva lot more closely waitress he called out to the barmaid and when she stepped over he said ill take a double jamesons rocks no make it a triple seven ben franklin bridge philadelphia monday november pm matt stood next to the zipper wall watching the tow squad wreckerits flatbed tilted down and touching the deck of the bridgewinch up the demolished gray crown victoria police interceptor every lane of traffic was backed up in both directions on the bridge and there was a cacophony of horns honking as matt scanned the maddening scene he thought about all the craziness that had led up to this very momentall the crimes that had been committed against the innocent which had led to all the shootings and brutal beatings of the career criminals and there are all the others still out there more crimes more killingsits not going to stop i just slowed it but im never going to be able to stop it he suddenly felt very small and alone is there any sanity left in this world as he ran his fingers through his hair and shook his head his cell phone began ringing in his pocket he pulled it out and glanced at the caller idthen smiled as he closed his eyes and visualized the last time hed seen amanda law the angel goddess peacefully asleepthere is

long time as he absorbed the news he looked past the cables of the suspension bridge in the direction of the hops haus tower then up to where amanda would be standing on the balcony and looking toward him matt she said very softly what are you thinking matt payne then smiled broadly and said im thinking thats wonderful amanda absolutely wonderful my angel goddess
