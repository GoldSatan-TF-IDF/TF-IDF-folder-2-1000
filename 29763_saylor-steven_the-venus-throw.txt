master belbo looked at me from under his brow and shifted from foot to foot uncertainly their names they wouldnt say familiar faces ive never seen them before master did they say what they wanted no master i pondered this for a moment and stared into the flames of the brazier i see two men not exactly master two visitors you said are they both men or not well belbo said wrinkling his brow im pretty sure that one of them is a man at least i think so and the other a womani think or maybe not he looked thoughtfully but without much concern into the middle distance as if trying to remember what he had eaten for breakfast i raised an eyebrow and looked beyond the flaming brazier through the narrow window and into the garden where the statue of minerva kept watch over a little fishpond the sun was beginning to lower days in januarius are all too short especially for a man of fiftyfour like myself old enough to feel the cold in his bones but the daylight was still strong enough to see clearly certainly clearly enough to tell if someone at the door was male or female was belbos sight beginning to fail belbo is not the cleverest of slaves what he lacks in brains he has always made up for with brawn for a long time this hulking mass of bulging muscles and strawcolored hair has been my bodyguard but in recent years his reflexes have grown noticeably slower i had thought i might be able to start using him as a doorkeeper reasoning that his long service at my side would enable him to recognize most of my visitors and that his size should intimidate those he didnt alas if he couldnt even tell the difference between a man and a woman it would hardly do to have him answering the door belbo ceased to ponder the middle distance and cleared his throat should i show them in master let me see if i understand you two strangers of indeterminate sex who refuse to give their names have come to call on a man with a lifetimes worth of enemies here in the most dangerous city in the world show them in you ask why not my sarcasm was apparently too subtle belbo nodded and left the room before i could call him back a moment later he returned with my visitors i stood to greet them and realized that belbos eyes were indeed still sharp probably sharper than my own had i seen this couple across the street or walking through the forum i might have taken them to be exactly what they appeared to be a rather small young man with delicate features dressed in an illfitting toga and wearing a broadbrimmed hat despite the less than sunny weather and a much older much larger woman wrapped in a stola that modestly covered her from head to toe but on closer inspection there was something amiss i could see nothing of the young mans body obscured as it was by the loose folds of his oversize toga but his face was not quite right there was no sign of a beard on his cheeks and his soft beautifully manicured hands moved with a delicacy that was not masculine also instead of lying flat around his ears and the back of his neck his hair appeared to have been pushed up under his hat which meant it must be unusually long the color of his hair was odd as welldark at the roots but turning blond where it was tucked up under the brim of his hat which he declined to take off as for the woman a woollen mantle draped over her head obscured much of her face but i could see that her cheeks had been painted and not too expertly with a rosecolored blush the wrinkles of her neck hung down in folds considerably looser than the folds of the stola that strained to contain her bulk especially around the middle her shoulders seemed a bit too broad and her hips too narrow nor did her hands seem quite right for roman matrons take pride in keeping their flesh as pale as possible and hers were dark and weathered as if by many years of exposure to the sun and while any woman vain enough to color her cheeks might be expected to take good care of her fingernails those of my visitor were ragged and bitten down to the quick the couple stood mute beside the brazier i understand that youve come to pay me a visit i finally said they merely nodded the young man pursed his lips and peered at me his face stiff the old woman tilted her head so that the brazier lit up her eyes between lashes stained black with antimony i saw a flash of apprehension i waved to belbo who fetched a pair of folding chairs and placed them opposite my own sit i offered they did demonstrating even more clearly that things were not what they seemed the wearing of the toga is an art as is the wearing of the stola i imagine from their manifest awkwardness it seemed highly unlikely that the little man had ever worn a toga before or that his companion had ever worn a stola their clumsiness was almost comical wine i offered yes said the young man sitting forward his face suddenly animated his voice was high and somehow too delicate like his hands the old woman stiffened and whispered no in a hoarse voice she nervously fiddled with her fingers then bit at her thumbnail i shrugged for myself i feel the need of something to stave off the chill in the air belbo ask one of the serving girls to bring some water and wine and something to eat perhaps i looked inquiringly at my visitors the young man brightened and nodded eagerly the woman glowered and struck at his arm making him wince are you mad she whispered gruffly i thought i detected a slight accent and was trying to place it when i heard her stomach growl yes of course exactly the young man muttered he too had an accent faint but vaguely eastern this was curious for only roman citizens wear the toga no food please he said how unfortunate i said for we have some very good mustcakes left over from breakfast this morning flavored with honey and pepper in the egyptian style my wife comes from alexandria you see i spent some time there myself as a young man oh that must have been over thirty years ago the egyptians are famous for their soft breads as im sure you know my wife says it was a baker at the mouth of the nile who discovered the secret of leavening and dedicated his first loaf to the great alexander when he founded the city the womans mouth began to twitch she pulled at her mantle to shade her eyes but i could feel her gaze on me as hot as the flames of the brazier the little mans face lost its animation and turned stiff again belbo returned with a small folding table which he set between us a serving girl followed with three cups and two ewers one of water and one of wine the girl poured wine into each cup and then departed leaving it to me to apportion the water for myself in the cold months i take it almost straight i said leaning forward and adding only a splash of water to the nearest cup and you i looked at the young man he held up his forefinger and pressed his thumb against the furthest joint a knuckles worth of water i said pouring then looked at his companion and will you join us after all she hesitated then copied the little mans gesture again i noticed her bitten nails and the sunweathered flesh of her hands you wont regret it i said this comes from my private stock i still have some jars of wine remaining from my brief tenure as a farmer up in etruria a few years ago it was a very good yearfor the wine anyway i handed them each a cup before i could pick up my own the woman quickly put hers down and reached for mine i changed my mind she whispered hoarsely less water will suit me if you dont mind of course not i picked up the cup she had abandoned and held it before my lips pretending to savor the bouquet she watched me intently and put her cup beneath her fleshy nose sniffing at it cautiously with no pretense of enjoyment waiting for me to take a sip before she would do the same it was an absurd moment like a scene in some hackneyed comedy except that had we been on a stage the audience would have hooted at us for playing our parts too broadly at last i put the cup to my mouth and drank letting the red wine linger on my lips for a moment before licking them clean to show her i had swallowed only then did she sip cautiously from her cup her companion having watched this interchange as if awaiting permission put his cup to his lips and drained it excellent he exclaimed his voice slipping into a higher register he cleared his throat excellent he said again in a voice that was deeper but still distinctly feminine for a moment we sipped our wine in silence listening to the crackling of the brazier you seem cautious about stating your purpose i finally said perhaps you could begin by telling me your names the little man looked at the woman who then turned away from the flames and hid her face in shadow after a moment the little man looked back to me no names he said softly not yet i nodded as you wish what do names matter anyway names are but a cloak a garment which men put on and take off a disguise if you will dont you agree the little man looked at me with gleaming eyeswas he intrigued or had he simply drained his cup too quickly his companion kept her face in shadow but again i felt the heat of her gaze a name is not the same as a thing she finally whispered i nodded so i was taught long agowhen i lived in alexandria as a matter of fact and yet without names we have no way of discoursing with one another about the things those names represent the woollen mantle nodded gravely up and down a thing is called one name in greek another in latin i said the thing remains the same that which applies to things must also apply to persons king ptolemy of egypt for example is king ptolemy whether we give him the greek title basileus or the latin title rex the figure in the stola drew a sharp breath and seemed on the verge of speaking but held back so it is with the gods themselves i went on romans call the father of the gods jupiter greeks call him zeus jupiter is an onomatopoeia for the sound of lightning striking the earth while zeus captures the sound of a thunderbolt cutting through the air thus do names convey to the ear what the eye and the soul of man perceive however imperfectly exactly whispered my visitor the head tilted to reveal the eyes which were fixed upon me with the excitement of a teacher who hears his pupil repeating back to him a lesson learned long ago but never forgotten still names are not things i said and while the study of names may fascinate us it is the study of things or more precisely our human perception of things which must occupy anyone who cares to discover philosophy for example i see the flame in this brazier yet how do i know that it exists the little man who had availed himself of more wine during my discourse laughed out loud simple put your hand into the flame i clucked my tongue disapprovingly you must be of the epicurean school if you believe that by sense perception alone we can determine the actuality of existence epicurus taught that all sensations are true still the fact that i am burned by the fire should be no proof to you of its existence since you would feel no pain ah but i would hear you scream perhaps but there are those who can endure such pain without screaming if i didnt scream would the fire be any more or less real what if i did scream and you happened to be deaf and looking elsewherewould i still have been burned then again if i were to scream and if you were to hear me you still would have no way of knowing whether my pain was real or a sham you seem to know a lot about such things said the young man who smiled and took another sip i noticed he had spilled a bit of wine on his toga a little philosophy is the creation of the greeks of course but a roman may attempt to comprehend it my old patron cicero made himself something of an expert on philosophy to help his oratory from the skeptics he learned that a proposition is always easier to disprove than to provea useful thing for a lawyer to know especially if he has no scruples about defending guilty men i took a long sip of wine the mood in the room had changed completely my visitors frosty suspicion had melted into trust the comforting cadence of philosophic discourse was familiar ground as i suspected it would be but just as a name is not a thing so appearance is not existence i went on consider two visitors come to my home at first glance they appear to be a man and a woman and this is clearly the impression they wish to give but on closer scrutiny this is only an impression not the truth thus do my senses tell me and my powers of logic deduce questions follow if the man is not a man and the woman is not a woman then what are they who are they why do they wish to be perceived as something they are not who are they trying to fool and why and why do they come to the house of gordianus the finder and do you know the answers to all these questions rasped my visitor in the stola i think so to most of them anyway though some things about your companion still puzzle me i looked at the little man who smiled in a way i couldnt account for until i realized that he was smiling not at me but at someone behind me i turned to see my daughter diana in the doorway her posture was tentative as if she had merely paused to have a look into the room and would move on at any moment she wore the longsleeved gown that children of both sexes wear but at thirteen she was already beginning to fill the garment in ways unmistakably feminine her dark blue gown merged with the dimness of the hallway so that her face lit up by the brazier seemed to hover in the air her skin which had the creamy texture and the rosy glow that my visitors painted cheeks so crudely mimicked made the darkness of her long eyelashes and her thick eyebrows all the more pronounced the flames caught the highlights of her long black hair which was parted in the middle and fell down her shoulders her brown eyes peered at us curiously and with a hint of amusement how like her mother she had always been and how more like her she became every day sometimes it seemed to me that i had nothing to do with creating her so completely was she cast in bethesdas image she smiled faintly and began to move on diana i called come here for a moment she stepped into the room wearing that mysterious smile she inherited from her mother yes papa we have visitors diana yes papa i know i saw belbo let them in at the front door i was on my way to tell mother but i thought id have a closer look first a closer look she gave me a bemused exasperated look such as bethesda gives me when i belabor the obvious well papa its not every day that a eunuch and a man dressed as a woman come calling on you is it she looked at my visitors and smiled sweetly they didnt smile back but instead looked glumly at each other i told you that the pretense was worthless even a child saw through it grumbled the old man in the stola no longer disguising his voice or his alexandrian accent he wearily pushed back the mantle from his head his silver hair was pulled back from his face and knotted at the back of his neck his forehead was wrinkled and covered with spots the folds of flesh hanging from his chin quivered and he suddenly looked ridiculous an unhappy old man with painted cheeks and painted eyes the eunuch in the toga covered his mouth and giggled tipsily but you look so pretty in makeup enough of that growled the old egyptian his mouth settled in a deep frown and his jowls drooped as he stared bleakly into the flames his eyes full of despair chapter two this is my daughter gordiana whom we call diana i took her soft smooth hand in mine diana we are honored by the presence of dio of alexandria philosopher teacher esteemed member of the academy and currently the chief ambassador to rome from the people of egypt with the unstudied dignity of a distinguished man used to being formally introduced and hearing his titles recited dio stood clasping his hands before him pulling his shoulders back his selfpossession seemed peculiarly at odds with his strange costume with his painted face and his feminine garments he looked like the priest of some eastern cultwhich was precisely what his companion turned out to be and this said dio gesturing to the little eunuch who likewise stood though a bit tipsily is trygonion a priest at the temple of cybele here in rome the eunuch took a little bow and pulled off his hat from which tumbled a mass of pale yellow hair the color was a bleached unnatural shade of blond he ran his fingers through his hair and shook his head to untangle the curls a philosopher and a gallus diana said wonderingly the last word gave me a start gallus is the latin term for a castrated priest of the great mother cybele all the galli are foreigners since by law no roman can become one the word is pious in the mouths of the goddesss adherents but others sometimes use it as a vulgar epithet you filthy gallus the idea of men becoming eunuchs even in the service of the divine remains foreign and repulsive to most romans i couldnt remember ever having taught the word to diana but then she is always coming out with things i never taught her she learns them from her mother i suspect yes dio said ruefully puzzle that gordianus what could a philosopher and a gallus possibly have in commonthe man who lives by reason and the man whose life is the surrender of all reason ha circumstances make strange bedmates the more desperate the circumstances the odder the bedmates he cast a sidelong gloomy glance at the eunuch then suddenly looked doubtful i do not intend this metaphor literally of course you do have this phrase in latin yes about circumstances and bedmates something close enough he nodded satisfied that he had made himself understood his latin was in fact impeccable though his accent was distinctly alexandrian with the particular inflections of those born in egypt whose ancestry and primary tongue are greek hearing him speak freely i now recalled his voice from many years ago it had grown coarser with age but was undeniably the same voice i had listened to so attentively on the steps outside the temple of serapis in alexandria when i was a young man eager to learn all i could about the world dios voice took me far back in memory and far away from rome introductions finished we sat except for diana who excused herself and left the room no doubt to go tell her mother dio cleared his throat you remember me then teacher i said for that was what i had always called him in alexandria and it now felt awkward to call him by his name though i was long past the age of deference of course i remember you youd be a hard man to forget i had thought after so many years and then when they told me your name how could i know for sure that it was the same gordianus whom i had known so long ago to be sure the name is unusual and also they seemed to think that you had been to alexandria as a young man and what they said of you sounded like the tree that would have grown from the saplingthis expression you have also yes and i have used the correct tenses good still with so much danger around me so many betrayalsyou understand why i could not come to you openly why i hesitated to reveal myself to you why i had to be suspicious even of your very fine wine he looked at me uneasily and chewed a fingernail even when i saw you i was not quite sure that you were the gordianus i had known in alexandria time changes us all and you wear a sort of disguise as well you know he gestured to something on my face i touched my chin and realized that he meant my beard i smiled yes i was cleanshaven back then alexandria is too hot for beards and i was too young to grow a decent one anyway or do you mean all the gray among the black gray hair and wrinkles are a kind of involuntary disguise i suppose worn by anyone who lives long enough dio nodded and studied my face still trying to decide whether he could trust me i have to be very careful he said yes i know something about your situation i said your journey from alexandria the attacks on your entourage after you landed down in neapolis the threats against you here in rome the fact that the senate looks the other way theres plenty of talk in the forum these days about what people call the egyptian situation still how did you guess it was dio asked the little gallus pouring himself another cup of wine our disguises got us safely through the streets granted they may be less convincing at such close quarters yes said dio how could you possibly have known it was me surely you didnt recognize my face hidden in shadow and painted like a womans and after all these years and surely it was not my voice for i tried to speak like a woman and as little as i could and you have not heard me speak for so long teacher im not sure exactly why youve come to see me but i assume it has something to do with the reputation ive made for myself finder im called i knew who you must be almost at once if i couldnt figure out as small a thing as that coming to see me would be a waste of your time elucidate said dio in his expressionless teachers voice yes make yourself clear laughed the little gallus lifting his wine cup and shaking out his bleached curls very well that you were not what you wished to appear was immediately evident to me as it was to diana and even to belbo my doorkeeper what gave me away said dio i shrugged little things who can list all the differences between the ways that men and women walk and talk and hold themselves an actor on the stage can convincingly portray a woman but an actor trains for the task to simply paint your face and put on a stola is hardly an impersonation then the pretense was not at all convincing be specific i have to know because if i cannot succeed with this disguise then i must find another it could mean the difference betweenbetween life and he bit at his fingernails again but finding nothing left to gnaw at pulled nervously at the wrinkles that hung from his neck your fingernails gave you away for a start roman matrons make a ritual of their manicures ah he looked at his nails with disgust a terrible habit its come back to me only since i arrived in italy i cannot seem to stop myself you might grow back your nails but your hands would still give you away such brown weathered handsno roman matron has hands like yours and neither does any citizen of standing only slaves and farmers have such handsor visitors from foreign climes where the sun stays hot all year long and burns everyone brown as a nut from king ptolemy down to the lowest field slave ptolemy dio spat the name yes i saw your agitation earlier when i spoke his name which gave further confirmation to what i already suspected that dio of alexandria had come to pay me a visit but you still havent explained how you came to have such a suspicion in the first place said the gallus elucidate he quipped mimicking dio by steps then my visitor is dressed as a woman but is not a woman my visitor must be a man then with a reason for concealing himselfi confess that i overlooked the possibility that either of you might be a eunuch a man in trouble perhaps in dangerthat seemed likely from your nervous mannerisms and the fact that you refused any food despite the fact that your stomach was growling from your brown hands and your accent i knew you must be foreign i shrugged but theres a point where explaining the discrete steps in a logical progression of thought becomes too tedious to bother with would you agree teacher like asking a weaver to explain how a tapestry was made by taking it apart thread by threadwhat a mess youd have suffice it to say that given what i had already deduced the supposition leaped to my mind that my visitor must be dio of alexandria ive heard of your plight rumor says that youve been hiding in private houses here on the palatine hill suddenly it occurred to me that this foreign stranger with a desperate demeanor might be dio to test the possibility i felt you out i spoke of philosophy my days in alexandria king ptolemy your reactions confirmed my suspicions this is not philosophy or mathematics teacher but i think you must see how my mind works and how i have put to use the ways of thinking which you taught me long ago dio smiled and nodded how curious that in the fifth decade of my life i could still be warmed by the approval of a teacher i hadnt seen and had scarcely thought about for thirty years and what about trygonion dio said yes what did you make of me asked the little gallus his eyes sparkling i say his eyes though many people perhaps most would say her eyes as often as not eunuchs are referred to as females which seems to please them i confess trygonion that you stumped me i knew that you werent what you pretended to be but i got it wrong i assumed you must be a young woman in a toga and hat trying to pass herself off as a man the gallus threw back his head and let out a throaty laugh a logical balance i suppose for those who think of things as one or the other a young woman in a toga to match an old man in a stola i nodded exactly the expectation of symmetry seduced me into error so you took me for a woman said trygonion sitting low in his chair and fixing me with a feline gaze who did you think such a woman might bethe philosophers slave his daughter his wife he reached over and stroked the top of dios wrinkled hand with his fingertips the philosopher made a face and drew back at the touch or his amazon bodyguard perhaps trygonion laughed i shrugged your features and your voice confused me eunuchs are rare in rome i overlooked that possibility i saw that you were unaccustomed to wearing a toga as might be expected of a womanbut also of a foreigner i did notice your accent but its faint and not egyptian phrygian i assume now that i know youre a gallus your latin is almost that of a roman you must have lived here a long time for ten years i came to serve at the great mothers temple here in rome when i was fifteen the very year that i consecrated myself to her worship by consecrated trygonion meant castrated dio winced so the gallus proved a harder riddle to solve than the philosopher the little priest said looking pleased with himself as is only logical said dio irritably given that philosophers strive for lucidity while the priests of cybele make a religion of mystifying the senses and yet our hosts young daughter perceived the truth at a glance said trygonion a beautiful girl said dio softly wrinkling his brow such insight on the part of a child seems almost preternatural dont you think gordianus trygonion looked at me shrewdly perhaps your daughter is a witch dio scowled and shifted uneasily but i decided to indulge the galluss sense of humor rather than take offense dianas mother grew up in egypt which has many eunuchs diana was born with egypt in her blood so i suppose she knows a eunuch when she sees one id like to take credit for her cleverness but certain insights definitely come from her mother perhaps they are both witches said trygonion enough of your rudeness growled dio these galli think they can say anything and behave however they choose under anyones roof they have no shame thats not all we lack said trygonion with a straight face whatever the source of her insight diana had also put her finger on the more perplexing mystery that lay beyond the thin disguises of my guests what were they doing together it was clear that they had no love for each other if youve had enough wine i said knowing that trygonion had drunk more than his share while dio had barely touched his cup and if weve talked enough of your disguises perhaps we should speak of more serious things why have you come to me teacher and what do you want from me dio cleared his throat you spoke a moment ago of what you romans call the egyptian situation i take it then that you know of the false will of king alexander the schemes of caesar and pompey to get their hands on the wealth of egypt the wholesale murder of my colleagues who have come to seek justice from the senate of rome i raised my hand perhaps you should begin at the beginning and explain to me each step that brought you to my door but to start i want only the simplest answers to two simple questions first why have you come to me dio looked at me for a long moment then gazed into the flames of the brazier his voice trembled i have come to you because there is no one else in all rome to whom i can turn for help no one else i can trustif indeed i can trust even you i nodded and second what do you want from me teacher i want you to help me to he choked on the words he turned his gaze from the brazier to me so that i saw the flames dancing in his eyes his jaw quivered and the fleshy folds of his neck shook as he swallowed hard help me please i want you to help me to to help you do what stay alive chapter three with his great mane of dark hair his towering physique not yet gone to fat and his amiable manner the philosopher dio had been a conspicuous figure in the alexandria of my youth like most of the upper class of egypt dio was of greek bloodwith a touch of the scythian he had claimed to account for his height and a bit of the ethiop to account for his dark complexion he had been a familiar sight on the steps of the library attached to the temple of serapis where philosophers met to debate one another and instruct their pupils as a young man i had ended up in alexandria after a long journey and had decided to stay there for a while that was where i met my future wife bethesda or more precisely where i purchased her she was a slave offered for sale at the great slave market very young and very beautiful and a troublemaker the auctioneer had begrudgingly admitted which was why i was able to afford her but if what she gave me was trouble i only craved more of it thus i passed the hot alexandrian nights in a haze of lust and during the day while bethesda kept herself busy in my shabby little apartment or went to the market i gravitated to the library steps and sought out dio was no student of philosophy i lacked the money for formal educationbut it was a tradition among alexandrian philosophers to engage common men in conversation from time to time at no charge now thirty years later i could recall only bits and pieces of those conversations but i vividly remembered how dio had fanned my youthful passion for truth into whitehot flames with his rhetorical conundrums just as bethesda had fanned my other passions in those days i had everything i needed which for a young man is not much an unfamiliar city to explore a partner in my bed and a mentor we do not forget the cities or the lovers or the teachers of our youth dio was attached to the academic school his mentor was antiochus of ascalon who in a few years would become the head of the academy dio was one of the great philosophers leading proteges in my ignorance i once asked dio where the academy was and he laughed explaining that while the name originated from a specific site a grove near athens where plato taughtit applied nowadays not to any particular place or building but to a discipline a school of thought the academy transcended borders kings might be its patrons but they had no hegemony over it the academy transcended language though of course all great works of philosophy including those of the academics are written in greek the academy embraced all men and yet belonged to none how could it be otherwise with an institution dedicated to discovering fundamental truths how does a man know what he knows how can he be sure of his own perceptions let alone those of others do the gods exist can their existence be proven what is their form and their nature and how can men discern their will how can we determine right and wrong can right action lead to an evil result or wrong action to a good outcome to a young roman barely twenty in an exotic teeming metropolis like alexandria these were heady questions dio had studied them all and his quest for knowledge was a profound inspiration to me dio was hardly more than ten years my senior but to me he seemed infinitely wise and worldly in his presence i felt quite out of my depth and i was immensely flattered that he would take the time and effort to explain his ideas to me sitting on the steps of the library while his slaves shaded us with parasols we would discuss the differences between intellect and sensation range the senses in order of reliability and consider the specific ways that men depend upon logic smell taste sight hearing and touch to make sense of the world thirty years had passed dio had changed of course he had seemed old to me then but now he truly was old the mane of dark hair had turned to silver his belly had grown big and his skin had grown loose and wrinkled but his broad back was unstooped unused to having his arms covered he pulled up the sleeves of his stola to reveal a pair of muscular forearms as brown and weathered as his hands he looked as healthy as myself and given his size and robustness he was probably stronger youd be a hard man to forget i had told him now as he implored me to help him stay alive i almost said you look like youd be a hard man to kill instead after a considerable pause i changed the subject what i find surprising teacher is that you should remember me after all these years i was your pupil only in the most casual way and my time in alexandria was relatively brief after i left i heard that your mentor antiochus succeeded philo as head of the academy your life must have become very busy after that conversing with kings playing host to diplomats advising the great and powerful how curious that you should remember making the acquaintance of a footloose young roman who liked to loiter on the library steps eavesdropping on the discourses of his elders and occasionally daring to converse with them you were something more than that dio said you say that you would be a poor finder if you could not deduce the identity of a visitor like myself well then what sort of philosopher would i be if i could not recognize and remember a kindred spirit when i met one you flatter me teacher i most certainly do not i never flatter anyone not even kings not even king ptolemy which is one reason i find myself in this terrible state he smiled weakly but in his eyes i saw the haunted look of a man oppressed by constant fear he stood and began to pace nervously around the small room hugging his arms to his chest and shaking his head trygonion sat with folded hands and watched him with a curious expression content to be silent do you remember the things we used to talk about on the library steps gordianus only bits and pieces im afraid but i remember your eloquence when you spoke of perception and truth of how the teachings of plato and the stoics had been clarified rather than refuted by the academy is that what you remember how strange thats not at all what i recall of our conversations but what else was there except talk of philosophy dio shook his head i dont remember talking of philosophy with you though i suppose i must have all those abstract fancies and highminded ramblingshow pompous i must have seemed to you not at all no what i remember are the stories you told gordianus what stories about your adventures out in the great world about your long roundabout journey from rome to egypt and your visits to the seven wonders along the way and your exploits in alexandria how dull my own life seemed by comparison how old you made me feel as if life had passed me by while my colleagues and i lounged under parasols debating good and evil you were out in the streets encountering good and evil in the flesh taking part in the whirling drama of life and death who was i to speak of discerning truth from falsehood when sitting beside me on the steps of the library was the young roman who had solved the riddle of the cat murdered in the rhakotis district which caused half the populace of the city to riot you remember that story i said amazed i have never forgotten it even now i can close my eyes and hear you telling the tale while philosophers and shopkeepers gathered around to listen in awe the killing of a mere cat caused the city to riot trygonion turned a heavylidded dubious gaze at each of us in turn you obviously have never been to alexandria where cats are gods said dio curtly only a few years ago a similar incident occurred the culprit was a roman or so they said but given the political climate in alexandria these days any pretext will do to stir up the mob to chase a roman through the streets cat killer or not he stopped his pacing and took a halting breath then another do you think we could retire to another room the brazier is too hot the air grows stuffy i could call belbo to unshutter another window i suggested no no perhaps we could step outside for a moment as you like i led them into the garden trygonion made a show of shivering and hugging himself flapping the folds of his toga in an undignified decidedly unroman fashion dio studied the fishpond with an abstracted air then gazed up at the darkening sky took several deep breaths and resumed his pacing which brought him to a startled halt before the statue of minerva the virgin goddess held an upright spear in one hand and clutched a shield in the other an owl perched on her shoulder and a snake coiled at her feet the whole statue was painted in such lifelike color that the goddess seemed to breathe and gaze down on us from beneath the visor of her crested helmet magnificent he whispered trygonion loyal to the great mother gave the goddess of wisdom only a cursory glance i stepped alongside dio and gazed up at the statues familiar face the only female in the place who never talks back to me but then she never seems to listen to me either she must have cost a small fortune probably though i cant tell you the cost i gained her by inheritance more or less like the rest of this house the tale of how that came to pass would fill a book dio surveyed the portico that surrounded the garden clearly impressed those multicolored tiles above the doorways fired by artisans in arretium so my late benefactor lucius claudius once told me when i was merely a visitor here and all these finely carved columns salvaged and brought up with great difficulty so i was told from an old villa at baiae as was the statue of minerva all are of greek design and workmanship lucius claudius had impeccable taste and considerable resources and now all this is yours youve done well for yourself gordianus very well indeed when they said that you lived in a fine house here on the palatine i wondered if it could be the same man whod led a wanderers life in alexandria living from hand to mouth i shrugged i may have been a wanderer but i always had the humble house of my father to come back to here in rome on the esquilinehill but surely that couldnt be as fine as this you have prospered remarkably you see i judged you rightly when i met you long ago in alexandria i have known many wise men philosophers who crave knowledge as other men crave fine wines or sumptuous clothing or a beautiful slaveas a glittering possession that will bring them comfort and earn other mens esteem but you sought after truth as if you wished to marry her you yearned for truth gordianus as if you could not live without breathing her perfume every morning and night you loved all her mysteries in equal measurethe great mysteries of philosophy as well as the practical mystery of discovering the killer of an alexandrian cat to search for truth is virtue for your virtue the gods have rewarded you i could think of no response but a shrug in the thirty years since i had last seen dio i easily could have died a hundred times for my labors had often brought me into danger or i could have fallen into ruin like so many other men instead i owned a fine house on the palatine and counted senators and wealthy merchants among my neighbors dios explanation of my good luck was as reasonable as any other though it seems to me that even philosophers cannot say what causes fortune to smile on one man and show spite to another watching him resume his fitful pacing i couldnt help thinking that dio for all his years of devotion to finding the truth had the haggard look of a man whom fortune had abandoned catilinas riddle st martins press it had been some time since i had conversed at length with a philosopher i had forgotten how much they loved to talk even more than politicians and not always to the point we had rambled far from the purpose of dios visit it was beginning to grow chilly in the garden come lets go back into the house if the brazier is too hot ill have the serving girl bring you some cool wine heated wine for me trygonion said shivering yes more of your very fine wine dio murmured im quite thirsty hungry as well i said my own stomach rumbled no he insisted but as he stepped through the doorway he tripped and stumbled and when i reached out to steady him i felt him trembling when did you last eat he shook his head im not sure you cant remember yesterday i dared to take a walk outside disguised as you see me now and bought some bread in the market he shook his head i should have bought more to eat this morningbut of course someone could have poisoned it while i slept then youve eaten nothing at all today the slaves tried to poison me at the last place i stayed even at the house of titus coponius i cant feel safe if one mans slaves can be bribed to kill a houseguest then so can anothers i eat nothing unless i see it prepared with my own eyes or unless i buy it myself in the markets where it could not possibly have been tampered with some men have slaves to taste their food for them i said knowing the practice was especially common in dios alexandria where the inbred rival monarchs and their agents were forever attempting secretly to do away with one another of course i had a taster said dio how do you think i escaped the attempt to poison me but the problem with tasters is that they must be replaced and my stay in rome has exhausted my resources i dont even have money to make my way back to alexandria once the weather warms and the sailing season begins he stumbled again and almost fell against the brazier but youre faint with hunger i protested gripping his arm and steering him toward a chair i insist that you eat the food in my house is perfectly safe and my wife i was about to add some extravagant estimation of bethesdas culinary skills but having just been praised as a seeker of truth i said instead my wife is not at all a bad cook especially when she prepares dishes in the alexandrian style your wife cooks said trygonion in such a grand house as this the propertys more impressive than my purse besides she likes to cook and she has a slave to help her here she is now i added for in the doorway stood bethesda i was about to say more by way of introduction but the look on her face stopped me she looked from dio to trygonion then back at dio who in his faint seemed hardly to notice her then at me all with a scowl that after thirty years of living with her i could not account for what had i done now diana told me that you had visitors she finally said her old egyptian accent asserted itself and her tone was even haughtier than usual she scrutinized my visitors so harshly that trygonion nervously dropped his eyes and dio finally taking notice of her blinked and drew back as if he had looked into the sun is something wrong i said secretly grimacing at her with the side of my face i thought this might make her smile i was mistaken i suppose you want to eat something she said in a flat voice the way she twisted her mouth would have spoiled the looks of a less beautiful woman ah that was it i thoughtshed been in the doorway longer than id realized and had overheard my qualified endorsement of her culinary skills even so a mere lifting of her eyebrow would have sufficed to express her displeasure perhaps it was the fact that i had packing to do for a trip the next day and was leaving the work to her while i entertained visitors in my studyand dubious visitors at that i took another look at dio with his rumpled stola and clumsy makeup and at trygonion who played with his bleached hair and nervously fluttered the folds of his toga under bethesdas harsh gaze and saw how they must appear to her bethesda acquiesced long ago to the parade of disreputable characters through our house but she has never hidden her disdain from those she dislikes it was clear that she thought very little of the egyptian ambassador and his companion something to eatyes i think so i said raising my voice to capture my visitors attention for they both seemed spellbound by bethesdas stare for you trygonion the little gallus blinked and managed to nod and for you too teacheri insist i wont allow you to leave my house without taking some food to steady you dio bowed his head looking tired and perplexed trembling with agitation and no doubt hunger he muttered something to himself then finally looked up at me and nodded yes an alexandrian dish you said what could we offer our visitors bethesda did you hear me she seemed to wake from a daydream then cleared her throat i could make some egyptian flatbread and perhaps something with lentils and sausage oh yes that would be very good said dio staring at her with an odd expression philosopher he might be but hunger and homesickness can addle the mind of any man suddenly diana appeared at bethesdas side dio looked more confused than ever as he gazed from mother to daughter their resemblance is striking bethesda departed as abruptly as she had appeared diana lingered for a moment and seemed to mimic her mothers scowl the longer i live with a woman the more mysterious the experience becomes and now that there are two of them in the household the mystery is doubled diana turned on her heel and followed her mother with the same quick haughty stride i looked at my guests in comparison to comprehending a woman i thought comprehending another maneven a philosopher in a stola or a gallus who had given up his sexwas really not so difficult the serving girl brought us wine and some crusts of bread to stave off our hunger until the meal was ready a chill had crept in from the garden so i called on belbo to stoke the brazier while i closed the shutters i glanced outside and saw that twilight had descended on the atrium casting the face of minerva into inscrutable shadow with more wine in his stomach as well as a bit of bread dio at last found the fortitude to recount the events which had reduced him to such a state of uncertainty and fear chapter four best to begin at the beginning sighed dio insofar as thats possible with such a twisted tale you know something of the story already refresh my memory i said very well all my life alexandria has been in constant political upheaval the members of the royal ptolemy clan wage unending warfare against each other for the people of alexandria this has meant bloody massacres and crushing taxes time and again the people have risen up to drive ruler after ruler out of the capital one ptolemy goes into exile another takes his placei wont recite the list whoever is winning occupies alexandria with its great granaries and royal treasury whoever is losing flees to cyprus and plots his return fortunes reverse and the rulers change places while the people endure i forget which ptolemy was on the throne when you were in alexandria gordianus alexander i believe yes thats right a couple of years later he was chased out of the city by an angry mob and died in suspicious circumstances then alexanders brother soter took the throne eight years later soter died leaving no legitimate sons that was twentyfour years ago dio put his fingertips together the only legitimate male heir of ptolemaic blood was soters nephew named alexander like his father he happened to be residing here in rome at the time of soters death under the dictator sullas protection this is where rome first enters the story backed by roman diplomacyand by funds borrowed from roman bankersalexander ii returned to egypt to claim the throne to do so he had to marry his aunt soters widow because she refused to step down as queen marry her he didand summarily murdered her the queen had been well liked her death ignited the fury of the mob the same mob which rioted over the death of a cat trygonion sniffed i shudder to imagine what they did over the murder of a popular queen you anticipate the story said dio slipping into his lecturing voice alexander ii then announced a rise in taxes so that he could repay his roman backers that was the final spark nineteen days after he ascended the throne the new king was dragged from the royal palace and murdered by the mob they tore him limb from limb it was tales such as this which romans like to cite to make themselves feel proud of the relative civility of our republic as a young man i had admired the alexandrians passion for politics though i could never accustom myself to their propensity for sudden extreme violence alexandrian healers peddle a poultice with the egyptian name cureforahumanbitewhichdrawsblood and most households keep a supply on handa fact which says much about the alexandrians now we come to the beginnings of the current crisisthe egyptian situation as you call it gordianus after the brief and inglorious reign of their cousin alexander ii two of soters bastards came forward to press their claim for the throne brave men quipped trygonion one bastard took cyprus the other took egypt and has since reigned for twenty yearsproof that a man can keep himself on a throne without possessing a single kingly virtue his full name in the greek dio took an orators breath is ptolemaios theos philopator philadelphos neos dionysos ptolemy god fatherlover brotherlover the new dionysus i translated dio curled his lip in alexandria we simply call him ptolemy auletesthe fluteplayer the piper trygonion laughed yes king ptolemy the piper said dio grimly whose only known accomplishment is his skill on the flute which he loves to play day and night sober or drunk he stages choruses in the royal palace and plays the accompaniment he debuts his own compositions at diplomatic dinners he organizes contests and pits his talent against common musicians how did egypt ever deserve such a ruler he epitomizes and exaggerates all the baser qualities of his decrepit lineindolent selfindulgent luxuryloving licentious lazy he should have been a gallus rather than a king laughed trygonion dio looked at him sidelong i am compelled to agree with you i remember something cicero said about him in a speech i said nearly everyone agrees that the man who occupies the throne of egypt today neither by birth nor in spirit is like a king and there are those who say the pipers reign is illegitimate and always has been because of a will that was made by his unfortunate predecessor ah yes and there you put your finger upon the heart of the matter said dio shortly after the death of alexander ii at the hands of the mob from the very start of king ptolemys reign a rumor began to circulate to the effect that alexander ii had left a will bequeathing all of egypt to the senate and people of rome trygonion raised his eyebrows a splendid prize the granaries the treasure house the crocodiles but surely no one could believe such a tale such generosity is preposterous dio sighed exasperated you show your ignorance of both politics and history gallus preposterous as such an idea may be it is not without precedent attalus of pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to rome over seventy years ago it became a province of the empire and to this day supplies the people of this city with subsidized grain forty years ago apion left cyrene to rome apion was a ptolemy and cyrene was once a part of egypt and less than twenty years ago bithynia was left to rome by its last king but why would any king do such a thing asked trygonion to save his country from the bloodshed of a disputed succession to spite his presumptive heirs to protect his people from being conquered by rival kingdoms even more oppressive than rome to bow to the tide of roman expansion dio sighed in my lifetime rome has gained pergamum cyrene and bithynia by inheritance and pontus and syria by conquest two years ago rome seized cyprus without a skirmish king ptolemys brother committed suicide rome has overrun the east of all the kingdoms that grew out of the empire of alexander the great only one remains egypt and now the rumors are circulating again about a will made by alexander ii bequeathing egypt to rome i said king ptolemys sleep must be uneasy trygonion nodded sagely i wouldnt care to be the slave who has to change his bed sheets vulgar vulgar dio muttered through clenched teeth rome now dominates the east this is a fact which no one denies but the people of egypt demand a ruler who will resist that domination our land was ancient beyond imagining even before alexander the great came and founded alexandria the kingdom he established flourished with beauty and learning while romulus and remus were infants suckling the shewolf we have no need of roman ways or roman government but instead of standing firm against roman domination king ptolemy quivers with fright and offers whatever concessions are demanded of him the people of alexandria demand that he redeem cyprus from roman rule and restore it to the kingdom instead he plays host to the roman commissioner sent to plunder the island to quiet talk about the alleged will he gives a gift of thirtyfive million denarii to caesar and pompey so that caesar can bribe the roman senate and pompey can pay off his own troops the bill is passed along to the people of egypt in the form of higher taxes our taxes go directly into the pockets of roman senators and soldierswe might as well be a roman province and what does king ptolemy receive in return a tentative acknowledgment by the roman senate of his legitimacy as king and a plaque set up on the capitoline hill inscribed to the honor of ptolemaios theos philopator philadelphos neos dionysos friend and ally of the roman people to be a friend and ally is all very well but to pay for the privilege he bleeds his own people white with taxes the peoples anger finally drove ptolemy to flee the city fearing for his life he fled all the way here to rome where pompey put him up in a great rambling villa with a vast household of slaves to serve him for thirtyfive million denarii he should expect such royal treatment said trygonion dio scowled he spends his time practicing his flute and drafting letters to the senate begging them to restore him to his throne against the wishes of the egyptian people but it is too late for that his daughter berenice has already been named queen of egypt a woman said trygonion who seemed genuinely intrigued it was not my choice said dio hastily philosophers have influence in alexandria but so do astrologers it was the stargazers who insisted that the time is right for a woman of the ptolemaic line to rule egypt it strikes me that you may be too hard on king ptolemy teacher i said cautiously all his life hes seen kingdom after kingdom swallowed up by roman imperialism sometimes by war sometimes by statecraft his position has always been precarious he must know that hes kept his throne this long only because the romans cant settle among themselves who should reap the rewards when egypt is taken over i know something of these matters teacher a man cant live in rome and be entirely ignorant of what goes on in the forum during ptolemys reign there have been several attempts by the senate to act on the alleged will of alexander ii and to stake a roman claim on egypt only the senates internal bickering and rivalries have prevented those attempts from being carried out during ciceros consulship i remember caesar and pompey tried to put themselves on a board of governors to oversee the takeover of egypt cicero killed the legislation with one of his brilliant speeches by claiming in so many words that caesar and pompey would ultimately make themselves kings now caesar and pompey have taken to extorting money directly from king ptolemy agitated dio began to speak but i held up my hand hear me out teacher if ptolemy bends to roman wishes so that he can stay in power even if he pays for the privilege with silver to keep the romans at bay how can you fault him for that so far by one means or another hes kept the romans from moving into alexandria and taking over the imperial palace that indicates to me that king ptolemy must possess more diplomatic expertise than you give him credit for he bends too far for the romans said dio sternly what does it matter whether they conquer us outright if they can use king ptolemy as their private tax collector to drain our lifeblood perhaps but i think i see a contradiction teacher why do you resist roman rule if you despise your own rulers so very much dio sighed because ultimately the ptolemies rule over egypt by the will of the people when they rule badly the people rise up and cast them out when they rule tolerably the people tolerate them such a system may lack the perfection of platos ideal republic but it suits the people of egypt and has done so for hundreds of years on the other hand if egypt should become a roman province under the sway of a roman governor its people will become mere vassals of rome and we shall have no say at all over our destiny we shall be drafted to fight in wars that are not of our choosing we shall be forced to abide by laws dictated to us by a senate of wealthy romans who live too far from alexandria to hear the complaints of its people we shall become just another outpost of romes empire watching our wealth become roman plunder our statues and carpets and paintings will decorate the houses of romes rich our grain will fill the stomachs of the roman mob and you can be sure that any payment will be far less than fair egypt is a great and free nation we will not become minions of rome dio took a deep breath a tear glinted in his eye and the gravity of his expression was oddly heightened by the feminine cosmetics that colored his weathered wrinkled face the absurdity of his costume could not disguise the depth of his emotion but this is all academic if youll pardon the pun said trygonion blandly but with a twinkle of mischief in his eyes if the former king alexander ii really did leave a will bequeathing egypt to rome dio exploded no one in egypt believes in the validity of the socalled will because no one in rome is able to produce it the will of alexander ii is a fiction a fraud a pretext for the roman senate to go meddling in egyptian affairs a device to make whoever rules egypt grovel at their feet you may hold sway for the moment they say but you cannot be legitimate without our approval and you can never be anything but an impostor for egypt was left to us by our puppet alexander ii and we may choose to exercise our hegemony at any time they wave an imaginary scrap of parchment in the air and call it a will king ptolemy was a fool to play along with such a lie friend and ally indeed the plaque on the capitoline should read piper and puppet of the roman people but now youve replaced the puppet i said the piper has been booed off the stage cried trygonion dio clenched his teeth the crisis which revolves around egypts throne may be a matter of amusement to you gallus but to the people of egypt i assure you it is not roman diplomats and merchants in alexandria seldom go out of doors these days for fear of being torn apart by the mob rabblerousers make speeches against roman greed and even my fellow philosophers neglect their teaching to engage in heated debate about the roman threat that is why i came to rome heading a delegation of one hundred alexandrians to demand that the roman senate stop meddling in egyptian affairs and to ask for their recognition of queen berenice i see a contradiction teacher i said quietly to request the senates approval of your new monarch implies in itself that the senate has a right to meddle in your affairs dio cleared his throat in philosophy we seek the ideal in politics as i have learned to my bitter enlightenment we seek whatever accommodates so it was that i came to rome at the head of the delegation of one hundred so many distinguished voices we thought simply could not be ignored even by your lofty senators and that is where this despicable farce turns to tragedy he put his hands to his face and suddenly began to weep so profusely that even trygonion was stunned indeed the little gallus seemed deeply moved by the old philosophers tears biting his lips in sympathy pulling at his bleached hair and rubbing his hands together in agitation i have heard that the galli cut off from the circle of earthly passion are given to sudden transports of extreme and inexplicable emotion it took dio a moment to compose himself the fact that a philosopher of his stature should have lost control and given vent to such an outburst even briefly testified to the depth of his despair this is how it was we landed down in neapolis at the very end of the autumn sailing season i had friends there members of the academy who offered us lodgings that night men armed with knives and clubs came crashing into the houses where we were staying they upturned furniture set curtains afire smashed priceless statues we were roused from sleep dazed barely able to fend them off bones were broken and blood was spilled but no one was killed and the attackers escaped the assault put such fear into some of our party that a few set sail for alexandria the next day dio stiffened his jaw the attacks were well organized and planned in advance do i have proof of king ptolemys complicity no but one need not see the sun to deduce its presence by the casting of a shadow the midnight attacks in neapolis were engineered by king ptolemy have no doubt he knew that we were coming to dispute his right to the throne his agents were ready for us after that we moved on to safer quarters in puteoli to regroup and plan our strategy for approaching the senate we stayed closer together and guarded ourselves at night but we made the error of thinking that we would be safe walking in the town forum in broad daylight one afternoon a group of fifteen men led by one of my academic colleagues onclepion went out to buy provisions for our journey up to rome out of nowhere they were set upon by a group of small boys who began to pelt them with stones the boys shouted curses when passersby stopped to ask why the boys told them that the alexandrians had been defaming the honor of pompey and his troops with vicious slanders some members of onclepions group simply to protect themselves began to shove at the boys and tried to drive them off by throwing stones in return one of the boys suddenly screamed clutched his head and collapsed in the dustor feigned collapse as i suspect for im told that his body was not found afterward the crowd that had gathered was sparked into a frenzy and soon a mob of grown men and women had joined the boys to stone the alexandrians who found themselves surrounded on three sides and trapped against a wall have you ever witnessed a stoning gordianus dio shuddered beside him the little gallus shivered in empathy thirteen of them were killed that day stoned or trampled to death only onclepion and his slave managed to escape onclepion boosted the slave onto the top of the wall and the slave managed to pull his master after him but onclepion was blinded in one eye and his slave lost several teeth that was the outrage at puteoli more men deserted the delegation that night until only sixty of the original one hundred remained i thought it best to head immediately to rome before some further incident occurred the trip was not easy the oxen we hired to pull our wagons fell to their forelegs just outside capua and died with bloodflecked bile pouring from their mouthspoisoned i had no doubt since they all died in the span of an hour more of the delegation deserted halfway to rome we stopped to spend a night off the appian way at an estate owned by my acquaintance palla it was a rustic house in the woods which he kept for hunting boar simple and without luxuries but with provisions for a great many visitors palla himself was absent staying at one of his villas north of rome but his slaves had been told to expect us to accommodate us all they crowded our sleeping couches close together blocking the hallways that very nearly proved disastrous it was a scream from onclepion that woke me in the night at first i thought he cried out in pain because of his ruined eye then i smelled the smoke it was only by the will of the gods that no one was burned alive that night for the doors had all been blocked from the outside by handcarts the type that slaves use for trundling bales of hay the building quickly filled with smoke we at last managed to break through one of the doors the cart blocking it had been loaded with heavy stones somehow we all escaped into the woods where we stood and watched as the house was consumed by flames i have never known such fear as i knew that night for at any moment i looked for king ptolemys henchmen to descend on us from out of the woods forcing us to choose between being hacked to death or fleeing back into the burning house but the attack never came why should king ptolemy mount a full assault when a handful of agents can set a fire and possibly kill everyone at once especially if they have the help of someone inside then you think that ptolemy had agents within the delegation from the beginning oh yes i have no doubt of that ashamed as i am to say it how else could his men have known which houses to attack in neapolis or known when onclepions party was setting out for the market in puteoli so as to set the little boys upon them how else did someone poison the oxens water trough that morning in capua without anyone taking notice king ptolemy has ruled egypt these twenty years by bribery treachery and terror his agents know how to use the weak and silence the strong on the morning after the destruction of pallas house beside a stream in the woods and with pallas slaves keeping watch for an attack i still dreaded might come i called a meeting of the delegation i expected some desertions but i was shocked at how few decided to continue on to rome only fifteen even onclepion joined the ranks of those who made up their minds to turn back that morning i told them that they would find themselves trapped for the winter in puteoli or neapolis unable to find ships to carry them home for the sailing season was over but they would not be dissuaded once king ptolemy saw that they had turned back from rome and no longer intended to address the senate he would stop his attacks against themso they reasoned and no argument from me could change their minds onclepion even engaged me in mock debate over the matter i was appalled at the tawdry way he excused his own cowardice with sophistry even more appalling was the fact that after our debate was over five of the men who had originally stood by me that morning claimed to have been won over by onclepions eloquence and joined the deserters only ten then remained of the one hundred who came from alexandria to confront the senate armed with righteous indignation and the certain favor of the gods for a just cause attended only by our slaves we made our bedraggled way to rome there was no grand entrance for us instead we slunk through the gates like thieves hoping to escape notice we dispersed ourselves about the city staying with friends and acquaintances many turned us away when they learned of the tribulations we had brought upon our hosts in neapolis and puteoli and the destruction of pallas property meanwhile we petitioned the senate for an audiencebut the senate answered us with silence he turned toward the brazier and stared into the flames what a winter no winter in alexandria was ever so cold how do you romans stand it i cover myself with blankets at night and still i cant stop shivering what misery and the murders he began to shake and couldnt seem to stop shall i call a slave to bring you a blanket i said no no its not the cold he hugged himself and at last managed to take a deep breath and stopped shaking during those terrible days in neapolis and puteoli and on the road i kept one thought in my mind when we reach rome i told myself when we reach rome but you see there was a fallacy in my reasoning for i never really finished that thought when we reach romethen what did i tell myself when we reach rome there shall be only ten of us left did i ever think that the senate would snub us and refuse even to hear me or that there would be still more treachery and betrayals until i would lose my faith even in the men i most trusted when we left alexandria or that we would be murdered one by one until only a handful remainedby the very fact of their survival traitors and tools of king ptolemy do you understand what has happened to me gordianus he held out his hands in a gesture of supplication and on his face i saw the full measure of his despair i left alexandria full of worry but also full of hope now murders you said here in rome yes at least three since we arrived we all stayed in different houses under the roofs of men i thought we could trust i feared another fullscale attack you see until i realized that rome is rome not neapolis or puteoli even king ptolemy would never dare to stage a massive assault or manufacture a riot in the shadow of the senate the men who rule rome tolerate such flagrant crimes at a distance but not in their presence no foreign king could be allowed to stir up the masses or set fires or practice open warfare in rome itself youre right senators reserve those privileges for themselves so the king changed his tactics instead of trying to kill us all at once he turned to assassinating us one by one by what means quietly by poison suffocation stabbing with the complicity of their hosts dio paused perhaps perhaps not slaves can sometimes be bribed or blackmailed but masters can be bribed or blackmailed as well especially when the pressure comes from the kind of men allied with king ptolemy men such as pompey he nodded and i suspect there are respectable romansperhaps even senatorswho are not above committing a murder or two to gain pompeys favor or repay some debt they owe him be careful dio so far youve accused your own king of being behind this slaughter now youre implicating a man who happens to be romes most beloved general and very possibly her future dictator i tell you these are the men behind the killings king ptolemy is not even in rome any longer hes retired to ephesus for the winter leaving everything in pompeys hands and why not pompey has as much to gain as ptolemy if the king can keep his throne so pompey has continued the attacks against the delegation since we arrived in rome his agents have snuffed us out one by one i shook my head you admit that you have no proof of your allegations against king ptolemy dio do you have proof of what you say against pompey he glared at me and was quiet for a long time a few nights ago in the house of lucius lucceius someone tried to poison me do you want proof of that my slave died horribly writhing and gasping on the floor only moments after tasting a portion of soup that was served to me in my private room yes but and my host lucius lucceius despite his knowledge of philosophy despite the disdain he espouses for king ptolemy is pompeys friend do you know where the poison came from earlier that day a certain publius asicius paid a call on lucceius a handsome young man i happened to see him as he was leaving the house and i asked lucceius his name that night my slave was poisoned the next morning after i fled from lucceiuss house i made some inquiries about his visitor they say this publius asicius is a young man of easy morals who indulges in poetry and wine and dabbles in politics with no fixed agenda willing to do anything to curry the favor of anyone who can advance his career i sighed you have just described a whole generation of young romans teacher many of them may be capable of murder including quite possibly this publius asicius but mere proximity to the scene of a crime is not asicius is also said to be in debt to pompey for some very large loans which the general made to him still you see you have no rejoinder for that gordianus the chain goes back to pompey and thence to king ptolemy your host lucceiusdid you confront him with your suspicions even as my taster lay writhing on the floor i insisted that lucceius come and witness the atrocity himself i demanded that he find out how the soup had been poisoned what was his response he pretended to be appalled of course he said that he would interrogate each of his household slaves himself and torture them if necessary perhaps he did or perhaps not i left the next morning desperate to be away from the place i told lucceius that i would be staying at the house of titus coponius but he has made no effort to contact me trygonion who had been silent for a while cleared his throat having escaped alive from the mans house perhaps you would have been wiser not to tell lucceius where you were headed next the gallus made a wry face and seemed to be in a mood to cause trouble again but what he said made sense am i then to behave like a fugitive or a criminal demanded dio skulking from shadow to shadow hoping no one sees me praying that the world will simply forget my existence already i put on this absurd disguise to go out during the dayis that not shame enough i refuse to vanish altogether to do so would give king ptolemy unconditional victory dont you understand i am all that remains of the delegation of one hundred who came to speak for the people of alexandria and their new queen if i allow fear to turn me invisible and mute then i might as well never have come to rome i might as well be dead with that dio gave another shudder and began to weep again i watched him fight back the tears and struggle to compose himself over the last months he had endured much misery and seen unspeakable tragedy and for all his travails he had nothing to show but bitterness and shame i was awed by his perseverance teacher i said what is it that you want from me i cant force the senate to hear your demands i cant make pompey waver in his support of king ptolemy i cant resurrect the dead or redeem those who betrayed you i waited for dio to answer but he had not yet composed himself so i went on perhaps you wish for me to ferret out the truth so that justice can be done thats why men usually come to me but you seem satisfied that you already know the truth im not sure what good it will do you thats the odd thing about truth how much one craves it yet how useless it often is if youre thinking of bringing charges of murder against king ptolemy im not sure that a roman court has jurisdiction over a friendly foreign monarch i am sure that nothing could be done without the senate and we know that you cant rely on them if youre thinking of bringing a charge against pompey then i would advise you to think again pompey has enemies to be sure but not one of them would be willing to attack him openly in a court of law no matter how compelling the evidence pompey is much too strong i wrinkled my brow perhaps its this publius asicius against whom you want to bring charges for attempting to poison you if he did put lucceiuss slaves up to it then you might have a case provided that lucceius is not the creature of pompey that you suspect him to be and is willing to let his slaves testify against asicius such a trial might be useful this publius asicius cant be too important if ive never heard of him and that means he might be vulnerable a trial against him could draw attention to your cause and elicit sympathy even so no gordianus dio said its not a trial i seek do you think i expect justice from a roman court i come to you seeking merely to save my own life so that i can continue with my mission i bit my lip teacher i cant offer you accommodations under my roof i cant guarantee your safety for one thing while i place great trust in my household slaves this house would hardly be secure against assassins as determined as your enemies appear to be and then theres the danger to my own family i have a wife teacher and a young daughter no gordianus i dont ask to spend a single night under the roof of your splendid house what i need is your help in deciding whom i can trust and whom i cannot they say you have ways of finding the truth they say you have a sense for it as other men have a sense of smell or taste you say that truth is often useless but it might save me now can i trust my new host titus coponius i met him in alexandria he is wealthy educated a student of philosophybut can i entrust my life to him will he betray me is he another of pompeys tools you must know how to find out such things perhaps i said cautiously but the task is more complicated than you may realize if only you had come to me wanting to recover a stolen ring or trying to find out whether a rich merchant did or did not murder his wife or seeking to trace the origin of a threatening letter such mysteries are simple and relatively safe but to ask the kinds ofquestions you would have me ask of those who would know the answers would almost certainly attract the attention of powerful men you mean pompey said dio yes perhaps even pompey himself i nervously tapped at my chin i would hate for you to think me a coward teacher afraid to move for fear of offending powerful men in years gone by ive dared to beard a few lions when the cause demanded it sulla the dictator for one when i looked for the truth behind the murder of sextus roscius marcus crassus when he sought to slay a whole household of slaves even cicero when he grew reckless with power in the year of his consulship fortunately so far ive never crossed paths with pompey i dont wish to do so now as a man grows older and presumably wiser he grows more cautious you wont help me then the despair in his voice made me feel a prickle of shame teacher i cant even if i were eager to do so it would still be impossible at least for a while because im about to go on a long trip i leave at dawn my wife has been busy all day packing my things i paused surprised at how hollow my words sounded what i said was true and my trip had been planned for a long time why did i feel as if i were making excuses then you cannot help me said dio staring at the floor if the trip were less important i began and shrugged but its to see my son meto hes been serving under caesar in gaul i havent seen him for months now hes at caesars winter quarters in illyria hardly close but considerably closer than gaul and he may be there for only a short while i cant miss the chance to see him i see said dio in other circumstances i would recommend that you pay a call on my elder son eco hes twice as clever as i ever wasbut hes coming with me to visit meto well both be gone until at the least the end of the month perhaps longer the uncertainties of traveling in the winter you understand again the words sounded hollow in my ears i shifted uneasily in my chair and the room suddenly seemed hot of course after the tripthat is when i come back to rome dio fixed me with a gaze that pulled at the hair on the back of my neck i had seen such a glassy stare only in the eyes of dead men and for a moment i was so unnerved that i couldnt speak i cleared my throat when i come back to rome ill be sure to send a messenger to you at the house of titus coponius dio lowered his eyes and sighed come gallus its time to go weve wasted our time here hardly wasted if that smell is what i think it is said trygonion cheerfully as if oblivious to what had just passed between dio and myself a moment later a serving girl passed in the hallway carrying a tray of food followed by two others who carried little folding tables we retired to the adjoining dining room where we each reclined upon a couch the folding tables were placed before us bethesda appeared with diana following after her but they did not join us the two of them made a point of carrying in the first course and serving it themselves ladling the first portions of the lentils with sausage onto the plates of my guests then onto mine and then watching while we each took a bite under their scrutiny the philosopher the gallus and i nodded and made noises of approval satisfied bethesda and diana retired leaving the service to the slave girls miserable and desperate as he might be dio was also a very hungry man he swallowed great spoonfuls of food and called to the serving girl for more beside him trygonion ate with even greater relish and an appalling lack of manners using his thumb to push food onto his spoon and popping his fingers into his mouth barred from the ecstasies of sex the galli are said to be notorious gluttons chapter five midwinter night descended on rome cold clear and still once my guests had eaten they quickly departed telling his tale had exhausted dio stuffing his yawning belly had made him sleepy he was ready for an early bed smarting from a twinge of guilt i almost relented from my earlier refusal to put him up and was ready to offer him a bed if only for the night but dio with a few curt words made it quite clear that he was set on making his way back to the house of titus coponius if he was sharp with me how could i blame him he had come to seek the help of an old acquaintance and was leaving emptyhanded desperate men even philosophersdo not accept rejection graciously i insisted that dio take belbo along to see him safely home this seemed the least i could do trygonion hid his long hair in his hat and adjusted his toga dio covered his head with the mantle again they became impostors at roman manhood and womanhood under cover of darkness they departed as they had come having dispatched my guests i was faced with the chore of finishing my packing for the trip to illyria to see meto bethesda had done much but certain preparations can be made only by the traveler with the short winter days allowing less daylight for travel i planned an early start and so had hoped to be abed early but the preparations kept me up until midnight it was just as well once i finally did crawl into bed i couldnt sleep thinking about dio and his plight i reached out to touch bethesdas shoulder but she turned away from me peeved about something as i pondered the strange visit it occurred to me that there were some things i had neglected to find out someone had recommended that dio come to see me who and what was he doing in the company of the little gallus the two of them seemed like oil and water and yet dio obviously trusted trygonion enough to go out with him in disguise ah well i thought drowsily these questions could wait until i returned from illyria and saw dio again but as soon as this thought crossed my mind i remembered the look i had seen in the philosophers eyesthe look of a man already dead i gave a start and was suddenly wide awake i turned on my side and reached for bethesda she exhaled noisily and pulled away i called her name softly but she pretended to be asleep what had i done wrong at what had she taken offense a bit of moonlight strayed onto the bed illuminating her hair she had rinsed it with henna that morning to give it luster and to cover the gray the smell was familiar comforting erotic she could have helped me to fall asleep i thought but she seemed no more willing to comfort me than i had been willing to help dio i stared into the tangle of her hair an impenetrable forest pathless and dark i tossed and turned and at last rolled out of the bed and onto my feet i was already wearing a long tunic to keep warm i stepped into my shoes and reached for a woolen cloak out in the atrium beneath the shadowed gaze of minerva i looked up at the firmament of bright twinkling stars the air was cold and clear i studied the constellations and to tire my mind i tried to remember all their names both latin and greek which i had learned when i was young in alexandria the great bear which homer called the wagon and others call the seven ploughing oxen the little bear which some call the dogs tail the goat which some say has the tail of a fish still i couldnt sleep i needed to walk a few circuits around the fountain in the atrium was hardly enough to drain my restlessness i walked to the front door and unbolted it i stepped over the threshold and onto the smoothly paved street at night the palatine is probably the safest neighborhood in rome when i was a boy it was as mixed as any other neighborhood in the city with rich and poor patricians and plebeians all crowded together then romes empire began its great expansion and some families became not merely wealthy but phenomenally so and it was the palatine with its proximity to the forum and its elevation above the less wholesome airs of the tiber and the cramped valleys which became their neighborhood of choice over the years tall tenements and cramped family dwellings were torn down block by block and in their places were built great houses separated here and there by strips of green and little gardens there are still humble dwellings among the mansions on the palatine and occupants who are far from wealthy im proof of that but by and large it has become an enclave of the rich and the powerful i live on the southern side just up the hill from the house of the vestals down in the forum in a circle of no great circumference around my house hardly further than an arrows flighti count among my neighbors crassus romes wealthiest man and my old patron cicero who the previous september had made a triumphant return from political exile and was busy rebuilding the house which an angry mob had destroyed two years before such men own bodyguardsplenty of them and not merely brutes but welltrained gladiatorsand such men demand order at least in their immediate vicinity the roving drunken gangs of troublemakers who terrorize the subura at night know better than to bring their rowdiness to the palatine rapists and petty thieves practice their crimes in other places on more vulnerable prey and so after dark the streets of the palatine are quiet and mostly deserted a man can take a brisk stroll up the street on a chilly winters night beneath a waxing moon alone with his thoughts and not fear for his life even so when i heard the sound of drunken voices approaching i felt it prudent to conceal myself until they passed i stepped back against a wall beneath the deep shadow cast by the branch of a yew tree i was just across the street from a venerable old threestory tenement at the end of my block the place was exceptionally well built and well maintained the property of the clodii an ancient and distinguished patrician family it had withstood the changes on the palatine and was still divided between shops on the ground floor and apartments above the whole of the middle floor was rented to marcus caelius the young man who had embroiled me a few years before in ciceros battle of wits with catilina it was his voice together with another that i now heard approaching from the eastern end of the street i stayed hidden in the shadows i had nothing to fear from caelius but i was in no mood for company especially drunken company as he and his friend drew closer careening up the street i saw their shadows first cast before them by the moonlight like spidery elongated wraiths they walked with their arms around each others shoulders twisting this way and that laughing and conversing in shouts and whispers it wasnt the first time id chanced to see marcus caelius coming home in such a state not much more than thirty years old and uncommonly goodlookingremarkably handsome actuallycaelius was of that particular class of young romans whom dio had spoken of that afternoon when he described publius asicius the man he suspected of trying to poison him charming quickwitted young men with good backgrounds but uncertain prospects notorious for their complete lack of scruples witty and well educated with a taste for hard drinking and scandalous poetry affable ingratiating and never under any circumstances to be trusted caelius and his friend were probably returning from a latenight party at some fashionable house nearby the only surprise was that they hadnt brought a young woman or two with them unless of course they were satisfied to make do with each other for the night they stopped in the street before the entrance to caeliuss private stairway caelius banged on the door and while they waited for a slave to come open it i overheard some of their drunken conversation when i heard caelius say the name asicius i gave a start probably i thought i merely imagined it putting it together from a sigh and a hiss i had just been thinking about dios description of publius asicius and so had the name in my mind but then i heard it again asicius caelius said you ass you very nearly flubbed it this time as well two disasters in a row me cried the other man i couldnt see him well for the darkness but like caelius he appeared to be tall and broadshouldered his words were slurred some shouted some muttered so that i could catch only fragments of what he said im not the one who you neglected to tell me that wed have to and then to find already and the look on his oh go on off to hades with you caelius along with that pitiful egyptian the door rattled and opened caelius and his friend moved to enter simultaneously and bumped into each other something clattered on the pavement moonlight flashed on steel caelius turned back stooped down and picked up the dagger that had been dropped that was when he looked up and saw me in the shadows across the street he squinted drunkenly and turned his face sidelong trying to decide whether i was a man or merely a shadow i held my breath he stepped slowly toward me holding the dagger in his hand where in hades are you off to now moaned asicius come on caelius its cold out here you said youd warm me up shut up caelius whispered hoarsely he was halfway across the street staring straight at me caelius whatis someone there shut up asicius the night was so still i thought they might be able to hear the pounding of my heart caeliuss dagger glinted in the moonlight he stepped closer and tripped on a paving stone i flinched its only me neighbor i said through gritted teeth onlyyou gordianus caelius grinned and lowered his dagger i sighed with relief who is he demanded asicius swaggering up behind caelius and reaching inside his tunic trouble oh probably not said caelius in the moonlight with a smile on his lips he looked like apollo done in white marble youre not looking for trouble tonight are you neighbor out for a walk i said i leave on a trip tomorrow i cant sleep cold for a walk isnt it said asicius not too cold for you to be out i said asicius growled but caelius slapped him on the shoulder and laughed go home and get some sleep gordianus only people up to no good are out at this time of night come on asicius time to warm you up he put his arm around his companions shoulder and drew him back to the doorway they disappeared inside and the door slammed shut in the stillness of the night through the closed door i heard their muffled voices and the clump of their heavy footsteps on the stairway these sounds quickly faded and the empty street seemed almost preternaturally quiet the cold suddenly penetrated my cloak making me shiver i walked back to my house taking quick careful steps everything was bland oysterwhite and fathomless black shadow cold moonlight had turned the world to stone i slipped back into bed i might have stayed awake for a long time staring into the darkness above but bethesda rolled toward me and snuggled against me and i fell asleep almost at once as planned my son eco came calling before daybreak belbo brought horses from the stable and the three of us set out through the quiet gray streets of the waking city we took the flaminian way and passed through the fontinal gate leaving the dangers and deceits of the city behind us at least for a while chapter six the journey was without incident except for a brief but wavetossed crossing from fanum fortunae at the terminus of the flaminian way across to the illyrian shore in winter there are only a handful of boatmen who will ferry passengers across the adriatic sea and on this trip we discovered why for we very narrowly escaped a sudden squall that easily could have sent boat belbo horses eco and myself to the bottom of the sea before we left fanum fortunae i had insisted on visiting the famous grounds consecrated to the goddess fortune and leaving a few coins at her temple better spent tipping the boatman eco had muttered under his breath but after surviving the wet windy crossing it was eco who suggested we give thanks at the nearest temple of fortune pounding rain turned the wooden roof into a drum inside the rustic little temple incense swirled coins jangled and the goddess smiled while the trembling in my knees and the queasiness in my stomach gradually subsided with our feet back on solid ground even the arduous rainsoaked journey up the rugged coastline and over the windswept hills to caesars winter quarters seemed like a holiday after he became a soldier in the legions of gaius julius caesar in gaul i didnt see my son meto for months at a time though we conversed often by letter this was fortuitous in a way that i could never have foreseen metos letters came to me by military messengers this is a common way to send all sorts of correspondence since only very wealthy men can afford to have slaves merely for the purpose of carrying letters while military messengers range far and wide throughout the empire and are more reliable than merchants or pleasure travelers letters leaving caesars camp as it turned out were not entirely private the messengers who carried them usually read them to make sure that they contained no compromising information one of caesars most trusted messengers impressed by metos style and observations passed a copy along to one of caesars most trusted secretaries who thought it worthwhile to pass it along to caesar himself who then moved meto out of the tent where he had been ordered to polish newly minted armor and into the commanders staff between conquering gaul and vying for control of rome it seems that the great man finds time in his busy schedule to keep a minutely detailed journal while other politicians leave their memoirs as monuments to posterity caesar intends to distribute his so meto suspects as a tool in his election campaigns the people of rome will read of caesars extraordinary skills of leadership and his triumphs in spreading roman civilization and then rush to support him at the polls provided of course that things continue to go as caesar wishes in gaul caesar has slaves to take his dictation of coursemeto says the commander often dictates while on horseback riding from camp to camp so as not to waste timeand he has slaves to assist in the collation and compilation of his notes but as my own experience has often borne out the rich and powerful will make use of other mens talents wherever they find them caesar happens to like metos prose stylenever mind that meto was born a slave received only sporadic tutoring in mathematics and latin after i adopted him and has no experience at practicing rhetoric ironic too is the fact that meto who chose to be a soldier against my wishes now finds himself a tentbound literary adjutant instead of a sunburned windbitten legionary it would be hard i imagine for one of his humble origins to rise much higher with so many patricians and sons of the rich vying for honor and glory in the upper ranks which is not to say that he no longer faces danger caesar himself takes extraordinary risksthis is said to be one of the keys to the hold he has over his men that he faces the enemy alongside themand no matter what his daytoday duties meto has seen plenty of battle his role as one of caesars secretaries simply means that during quiet times instead of building catapults or digging trenches or making roads meto labors over his commanders rough drafts just as well meto was never very good at working with his hands or his back but when the crisis comes and the enemy must be faced meto puts down his stylus and takes up his sword meto had plenty of hairraising tales to thrill his older brother and set his brooding fathers teeth on edge ambushes at dawn midnight raids battles against barbarian tribes with unpronounceable namesi listened to the details and wished i could cover my ears as images ran riot through my head of meto in handtohand combat against some hulking hairy gaul or dodging a rain of arrows or leaping off a catapult consumed by fire meanwhile i watched him wideeyed at once amazed appalled proud and melancholy at how thoroughly the boy had vanished and the man taken his place though he was only twentytwo i counted a few gray hairs among the shock of unruly black curls on his head and his jaw was covered with stubble his speech especially in the excitement of recounting a battle was salted with crude soldiers slangcould this really be the boy whose prose caesar found so admirable relaxing in his quarters it was metos custom to wear the same garment day after day a dark blue muchwashed woolen tunic i raised an eyebrow at his slovenliness but said nothing even when i noticed the numerous murky spots large and small which stained the fabric in various places then i realized that the stains were clustered where his armor joined and around the edges of his leather coat the spots were bloodstains made where the blood of other men had soaked through his battle gear meto told us of mountains he had crossed and rivers he had forded of gallic villages with their peculiar sights and smells of caesars genius at outwitting the tribes and putting down their rebellions much of the commanders behavior sounded like gratuitous cruelty and base treachery to me but i knew better than to say so he confirmed that the gauls were uncommonly big many of them veritable giants they think of us as a midget race and make fun of us to our faces he said but they dont laugh for long he was eager for news of rome eco and i shared with him all the gossip we could remember including the latest maneuvers regarding the egyptian situation pompey and your beloved commander seemed to have matched scores in the latest round eco noted extorting equal hoards of silver from king ptolemy in return for bribing the senate to smile on his claim to the egyptian throne its crassus whos been left out and what does crassus need from egypt said meto who had his own reasons to dislike the millionaire quite apart from his loyalty to caesar hes rich enough crassus will never be rich enough for crassus i said if he wants to keep his hand in the contest said meto absently reaching for his short sword and fiddling with the handle crassus will need to wrangle another military command from the senate and score some victories to impress the people silver buys votes but only glory buys greatness i wondered if these words came from meto himself or from caesar whose finances become more precarious even while the list of his conquests grows longer but pompey has pacified the east and now caesar is pacifying gaul said eco whats left for crassus hell simply have to look further afield said meto well egypt is as far as i care to cast my thoughts i said and proceeded to relate what i had learned from dio on the night before i left rome from his proximity to caesar and his staff meto already knew a little about the murders of the alexandrian envoys but had not realized the scale of the scandal he seemed genuinely appalled and i found myself wondering how someone who had become so inured to the carnage of battle could be alarmed any longer by mere murder the thought made me uneasy as i suddenly felt the growing distance between meto and myself then as i continued to describe the peculiar circumstances of dios visit and my guests absurd disguisesthe philosopher as a woman the gallus as a man meto burst out laughing his laughter encouraged me to pile on more details which made him laugh all the harder suddenly the stubbly jaw and the bloodstains faded from my sight the harrowing tales and the crude soldiers slang were forgotten i saw the face of the laughing little boy i had adopted years ago and found what i had come searching for as it turned out eco and i were gone from rome for almost a month and did not return until after the ides of februarius first a snowstorm detained us then i fell ill with a cough in my chest then just as i was well enough to travel belbo fell ill with the same complaint while some men might scoff at postponing a trip to coddle a slave it made no sense to me to go traveling over dangerous back roads with a sick bodyguard besides i welcomed the excuse to spend more time with meto on the way back we happened to cross the adriatic using the same intrepid boatman and in the same boat as before i had no trouble getting eco to pause for a few moments in the temple of fortune before we set sail happily for our crossing the sky was clear and the waters were calm back in rome bethesda seemed to be in considerably better spirits than when i had left indeed her attentions to me on the night of my return could have stopped the heart of a weaker man once there had been a time when a months separation was enough to build our appetites for each other to a ravenous pitch i had thought those days were long gone but on that night bethesda managed to make me feel more like a youth of twentyfour than a bearded grandfather of fiftyfour despite the aches and pains of the previous days long hours on horseback i arose the next morning in excellent spirits as we ate our breakfast of egyptian flat bread and millet porridge with raisins bethesda caught me up on the latest gossip i sipped at a cup of heated honeyed wine and listened with only half an ear as she explained that the miserly senator across the way was finally putting a new roof on his house and that a group of ethiopian prostitutes appeared to have taken up residence at the home of a rich widower who keeps an apartment up the street when she turned to affairs down in the forum i paid closer attention bethesda had a soft spot for our handsome young neighbor marcus caelius the one whom i had run into on the night before my departure according to bethesda caelius had just finished prosecuting a case which had set the city abuzz i went down to watch she said really th e trial or the prosecutor both of course and why not she became defensive i know quite a lot about trials and the law having lived with you so long yes and marcus caelius is exceptionally goodlooking when he gets himself all wound up with an exciting orationeyes flashing veins bulging on his forehead and neck bethesda seemed about to respond but thought better of it and stared at me straightfaced a prosecution i finally said against whom someone called bestia lucius calpurnius bestia she nodded you must be mistaken i said with a mouth full of millet i think not her expression became aloof but caelius supported old bestia for the praetorship last fall theyre political allies not any longer this was entirely credible given caeliuss reputation for fickleness both in love and politics even when he was publicly allied with a candidate or cause one could never be quite sure of his real intentions on what charge did he prosecute bestia electoral bribery ha in the fall he campaigns for bestia and in the spring he tries the man for illegal campaigning roman politics i shook my head who defended your old friend cicero oh really this added a new wrinkle to the matter marcus caelius had made his entry into public life as ciceros pupil and protege then during the turmoil of catilinas revolt he parted ways with his mentoror perhaps he only pretended to do so in order to spy for cicero throughout that tumultuous episode caeliuss real allegiance remained a mystery at least to me afterward caelius left rome for a year of government service in africa on his return he seemed to have left the camp of his old mentor for good going up against cicero in court and actually getting the better of the master orator later when the senate exiled cicero and his enemies went on a rampage and destroyed ciceros beautiful house on the palatine it was my neighbor marcus caelius who came knocking at my door with the newscomplaining that the windows of his apartment afforded no view and asking if he could watch the flames from my balcony the way the lurid glow danced on his handsome face it was impossible to tell whether caelius was appalled or amused or perhaps a little of both after much political wrangling the senate had recalled cicero from exile and he was back in rome his house on the palatine was being rebuilt and now according to bethesda he had again matched wits in a court of law with his onetime pupil marcus caelius well dont keep me in suspense i said how did the case come out cicero won bethesda said bestia was acquitted but caelius says the jury was bribed and vows that hes going to prosecute bestia again i laughed tenacious isnt he having once defeated cicero in court i imagine he simply cant stand being bested by his old teacher this time or did a single speech not suffice for caelius to adequately slander bestia oh for that purpose i think the speech did very well full of venom dripping with it in his summation caelius brought up the death last year of bestias wife and the death of his previous wife before that he practically accused bestia of poisoning them murdering ones wives cant have much to do with electoral brib ery perhaps not but the way caelius brought it up it seemed entirely appropriate character assassination i said is the cornerstone of roman jurisprudence the prosecutor uses any means possible to destroy the accuseds reputation to make it seem more likely that hes committed whatever crime hes accused of its so much easier than producing actual evidence then the defender does the same thing in reverse accusing the accusers of various abominations to destroy their credibility strange to think that once upon a time i actually had a certain amount of respect and even admiration for advocates yes well ive heard the rumors that bestia did his wives in both died relatively young with no preceding illness and without a mark on them so naturally people say he poisoned them though even poison usually leaves some evidence there wouldnt have been much evidence if it was done the way that marcus caelius implied said bethesda and how was that she sat back and cocked her head remember that this was said in a court of law before a mixed audience of men and women alike not in a tavern or at one of his orgies marcus caelius is a very brazen young man she did not sound wholly disapproving and a brazen orator well out with it what did he say according to caelius the quickest of all poisons is aconitum i nodded many years of investigating the sordid means of murder have given me some familiarity with poisons aconitum also called panthersdeath harvested from the scorpionroot plant yes its victims succumb very quickly but when swallowed in sufficient amount to cause death there are usually noticeable reactions in the victim and plentiful evidence of foul play ah but according to caelius the poison was not swallowed i dont follow you according to caelius if aconitum touches a womans genitals she will die within a day i raised an eyebrow even with all my experience of poison this bit of information was new to me and i was not sure i believed it what caelius says is possibly truethough im inclined to wonder how anyone could ever have discovered such a curious thing but then i suppose theres not much that marcus caelius doesnt know about female genitalia ha bethesdas eyes sparkled even cicero didnt come up with that one i turned up my palms to show modesty so caelius accused bestia of having poisoned his wives by i left the sentence unfinished there seemed no delicate way to complete it he did not accuse bestia outright having stated the properties of aconitum and having worked himself up to a feverish pitch caelius pointed his finger at bestia and shouted judges i do not point the finger of guilti point at the guilty finger i choked on a mouthful of porridge outrageous just when i was beginning to think that roman orators had degraded their craft to the lowest level of indecency and bad taste along comes a new generation to push the limit even further oh minerva i added under my breath glancing out the window at the statue in the garden preserve me from a day in court i point at the guilty finger ha bethesda sipped from her cup of honeyed wine anyway bestia was acquitted finger and all i suppose cicero made a stirring speech for his defense she shrugged i dont recall ciceros speech would probably have made a greater impression on her i thought had the man delivering it been as young and goodlooking as marcus caelius fortune smiled on lucius calpurnius bestia then though not on his wives said bethesda dryly there was a flash of something like anger in her eyes but then a smile crept across her lips speaking of young caelius reminds me of another bit of gossip from the forum she said also involving caelius no involving his landlord i see and what fresh outrage has publius clodius perpetrated now clodius owned the apartment building down the street the one in which caelius had his lodgings in his midthirties and a patrician of impeccable lineage clodius had made himself much feared in recent years as a rabblerouser and exploiter of populist resentments it was clodius as tribune who had masterminded the roman takeover of cyprus in order to finance his scheme to pass out free grain to the people of rome once friendly to cicero he had almost singlehandedly engineered ciceros exile and was now his archenemy his political tactics were crude relentless and often violent just as men like caelius were pushing the boundaries of oratory in the courts men like clodius were pushing the boundaries of political intimidation not surprisingly the relationship of the two men went beyond that of landlord and tenant they had become frequent political allies and they shared a personal bond as well it was well known that caelius was the lover or at least one of the lovers of the rabblerousers widowed older sister clodia well i didnt witness the incident myself but i heard about it at the fish market said bethesda practically purring it seems that pompey was down in the forum arriving with his retinue at some trial or other that was about to begin could this have been the trial of pompeys confederate milo for breach of the peace bethesda shrugged with clodius acting as prosecutor i added yes that was it because clodius was there with a large retinue of his own made up of some very rough types apparently to describe clodiuss notorious gang of troublemakers as rough was to understate the case these were strongarmers of the lowest order some hired some obligated to clodius for other reasons some voluntarily in his service to sate their appetites for violence for a man like clodius to be prosecuting anyone for breach of the peace seemed ironic but in this case the charge was probably justified the accused milo had his own rival gang of ruffians ready to rampage through the streets supporting whatever political cause their master happened to favor at the moment where great men like pompey caesar and crassus contested one another in exalted spheres of financial and military prowess vying for mastery of the world clodius and milo struggled with one another for immediate control of the streets of rome the greater powers allied themselves with these lesser powers for their own purposes and vice versa at the moment milo was pompeys enforcer in rome so pompey was obligated to speak in milos defense clodius whether acting for caesar or crassus or entirely on his own appeared to be badgering milo chiefly to get at pompey clodius seemed determined to undermine pompeys attempts to take control ofthe notorious egyptian situation this chain of thoughts caused me to remember my visit from dio the previous month and i suddenly felt uneasy by the way i said do you remember the odd pair who visited me on the day before i left for illyria i was wondering if you had heard from them or if you knew bethesda gave me her medusa look her anecdote was not to be interrupted there was a great crowd gathered for milos trial too many to fit into the open square where it was being held so the mob spilled out into the nearby streets when pompey appeared there was much cheering from the crowd you know how the people adore pompey the conqueror of the east exactly but then clodius appeared atop some high place and began shouting to the mob below which was apparently packed with his supporters most people were too far away to hear what he was shouting but whenever he would pause the mob below him would cry out with one great voice pompey even those too far away to hear clodius or even see him could hear the name of pompey being shouted in unison it was like a slow chant pompey a pause pompey a pause pompey well apparently pompey heard his name being called for they say he pricked up his ears and broke out in a broad grin then changed his course and began making his way toward the shouting thinking he was being lauded by the crowd a typical politician i remarked beating a path toward his adoring supporters like a calf heading for the teat except that this milk was sour as he drew closer the smile vanished from pompeys face first he saw clodius pacing back and forth atop the ledge addressing the mob below and clutching himself with laughter whenever they responded with the cry of pompey when pompey drew close enough to hear what clodius was shouting he turned the color of a hot flame and what set pompeys cheeks ablaze clodius was posing a series of questions like riddles over and over and the answer was always the samepompey and what were these questions like his friend and tenant marcus caelius clodius is a very brazen man please wife no false modesty ive heard you blast dishonest vendors in the market with curses that would make even a man like clodius blush with shame you exaggerate husband only slightly well she leaned forward the chant went something like this whats the name of the general whos generally obscene pompey who peeks up his soldiers skirts when theyre marching on parade pompey who makes like a monkey when he scratches his skull pompey this last was a reference to the great commanders habit when deep in thought of scratching the back of his head with his forefinger and was innocuous enough though with a bit of pantomime i had no doubt that clodius could make it quite scathing the other riddles were typical invective of the sort that might have been directed at any politician or general all in all such doggerel was pretty tame stuff and hardly in a league with caeliuss quip about bestias guilty finger but then pompey was not as accustomed as other politicians to the freeforall of the forum he was used to being obeyed without question not to being insulted in public by a roman mob generals make thinskinned politicians but in the end said bethesda leaning forward and lowering her voice it was clodius who got the worst of it how did that come about some of milos men heard the shouting and came running soon there were enough of them to drown out clodius and his gang their chants were positively shocking oh probably not all that shocking i said idly shaping the last of my breakfast porridge into little peaks and valleys feigning indifference bethesda shrugged youre right they werent really shocking at all since one has heard all those rumors before though i imagine hearing them chanted by a mob in the forum must have made even clodius squirm what rumors i said giving in about clodius and his older sister or half sister i should say clodius and clodia oh yes ive heard whispers and a few nasty jokes never having met either of the doubtless charming siblings face to face i wouldnt presume to secondguess the secrets of their bedchamber or bedchambers bethesda gave a delicate snort why romans should make such a fuss over relations between a brother and sister makes no sense to me anyway in egypt such unions began with the gods and have a long and sacred tradition no such tradition exists in rome i can assure you i said what exactly did the mob chant well it started with something about clodius selling himself to older men when he was a boy yes ive heard that story when their fathers early death left them in financial straits the clodii boys rented out little brother publius as a catamite and with considerable success it could all be a spiteful lie of course of course but the chant went something like this clodius played the girl while he was still a boy then clodia made the man into her private toy and then more of the same only more and more explicit the greek vice coupled with the egyptian vice i observed and easterners complain that we romans arent versatile in matters of sex how did clodius react he tried to keep up his chant against pompey but when milos men began to drown him out he disappeared pretty quickly and not with a smile on his face the chanting finally broke into a scuffle between milos and clodiuss gangs nothing too serious i hope not serious enough to disrupt the trial probably only a few heads split open and how did the trial turn out was milo acquitted or found guilty of disturbing the peace bethesda looked at me blankly then shrugged i dont recall im not sure i ever heard probably because no one cares a whit what they all remember and what theyll keep talking about is the scandal of clodiuss reputed incest with his sister being shouted aloud in the forum whats the difference in their agesfive years well the widow clodia does have a reputation for liking younger men like our neighbor marcus caelius i wonder what he thinks of having his lovers alleged incest made into a ditty by the mob actually caelius and clodia are no longer lovers and caelius isnt on such good terms with clodius anymore said bethesda how could you possibly know that i shook my head in wonder you havent been slinking off to some of these wild palatine hill parties mixing with the sophisticated young set in my absence have you no she leaned back on her couch with a smile and luxuriously stretched her arms above her head the gesture was unabashedly sensual evoking memories of the nights pleasures as if to demonstrate that despite my teasing she would indeed fit in quite well at a palatine hill debauch were she not so acutely aware and protective of her hardwon role as a respectable roman matron or has young caelius been confessing the secrets of his love life whenever the two of you happen to meet in the street i said not that either but we have ways of sharing what we know we we women said bethesda with a shrug she was always vague about her network of informants even to me i had spent a lifetime ferreting out secrets but bethesda could sometimes make me feel like an amateur what caused the parting of the ways i asked surely sophisticated lovers like clodia and caelius dont abandon each other over trifles like infidelity or a bit of incest no they say it was bethesda abruptly frowned and creased her brow she was teasing me again i thought trying to add suspense to the telling well i finally said politics or something like that she said hastily a falling out between clodius and caelius and then trouble between caelius and clodia youre well on the way to making a poem like the mob in the forum clodius and caelius and caelius and clodia you need only insert a few obscene verbs what sort of falling out over what she shrugged you know i dont follow politics she said suddenly fascinated by her fingernails unless theres a good story involved come wife you know more than youre telling must i remind you that its your duty indeed your obligation under the law to tell your husband everything you know i command you to speak i spoke playfully making a joke of it but bethesda was not amused all right then she said i think it was something to do with what you call the egyptian situation some fallingout between clodius and caelius how should i know anything about the private dealings of men like that and who should be surprised if an aging whore like clodia suddenly loses her charms for a handsome young man like caelius i had long ago learned to weather bethesdas moods as one must weather sudden squalls at sea but i had never quite learned to comprehend them something had set her on edge but what i tried to recollect the phrase or topic that had offended her but the sudden chill in the room numbed my mind i decided to change the subject who cares about such people anyway i picked up my empty cup twisted my wrist to set the dregs aswirl and stared into the vortex i was just wondering a moment ago about those odd visitors i had on the day before my trip bethesda looked at me blankly it was only a month ago you must rememberthe little gallus and the old alexandrian philosopher dio he came seeking help but i wasnt able to help him at least not then did he come calling again while i was gone i waited for an answer but when i looked up from my cup i saw that bethesda was looking elsewhere its a simple enough question i said mildly did the old philosopher come asking for me while i was gone no she said thats odd i thought that he would he was so distraught i worried about him while i was away perhaps he didnt need my help after all have you heard any news of him through your vast network of spies and informants yes she said and what news hes dead said bethesda murdered i believe in the house where he was staying thats all i know the swirling dregs in my wine cup slowed to a stop the porridge in my stomach turned to stone and in my mouth i tasted ashes chapter seven it was not until several days after my return to rome that i found time to write a letter to meto i recounted to him the events which had transpired in my absence cicero defeating caelius in the trial of bestia despite the accusation of the guilty finger the perfect anecdote for meto to share with his tentmates pompeys embarrassment on his way to milos trial the obscene chant about clodius and clodia since i had made such a story of trygonions and dios visit when i saw meto in illyria i felt i should let him know what had become of the philosopher merely a matter of keeping him informed i told myself as i began setting down the words but as i wrote i began to realize that telling the tale was in fact my chief reason for writing the letter dios murder had left me with a nagging sense of guilt and writing down the gory facts for metos perusal painful though it was somehow eased my conscience as if describing an event could mitigate its awfulness when it comes to correspondence i am not meto my prose will never capture great caesars admiration nonetheless i will copy down a bit of what i wrote to meto on that last day of februarius also son you will probably remember the tale i told you about my visit from dio the philosopher i once knew in alexandria and the little gallus named trygonion you laughed when i described to you their absurd disguisesdio dressed like a woman and the eunuch in a toga trying to pass himself off as a roman the sequel i fear is quite the opposite of funny what dio dreaded came to pass only hours after he left me that very night as i was making ready for my journey to see you dio was being viciously murdered in the house of his host titus coponius i learned the bare fact that dio had been murdered from bethesda on the morning after my return to rome she claimed to know no details at all bethesda took a disliking to dio the instant she laid eyes on him and you know how she isfrom that moment on he might as well not have existed even her appetite for gossip seems unstirred by his murder i had to discover the details for myself posing discreet questions in the proper quarters this was not difficult though it took some time it seems that there had been a previous failed attempt to poison dio he mentioned this to me himself on the night of his visit apparently some slaves of his previous host lucius lucceius were suborned doubtless by agents of king ptolemy to poison dios food but succeeded instead in killing his sole remaining slave who had taken on the role of food taster dio fled from lucceiuss house to that of coponius it was from the house of coponius that dio came to call on me and to ask for my help if only i had offered to let him spend the night in my house but then his assassins might have done their bloody work here under my roof i think of bethesda and particularly of diana and i shudder at the thought poison having failed dios enemies resorted to less subtle means after leaving my house dio returned to coponiuss as quickly as he coulddarkness had fallen and dio feared the streets even disguised as he was and with belbo along for protection as for trygonion belbo says that he went along as far as coponiuss door and then went his own way perhaps returning to the house of the galli which is also here on the palatine close by the temple of cybele no one seems to know much about this gallus and no one can explain to me his relationship to dio what follows is secondhand information some of it thirdhandwhich makes it gossip reallybut i think its reliable back at coponiuss house dio shut himself alone in his room refusing to take any dinner he had already eaten at my house and was very fearful of being poisoned the household of coponius retires early and soon after dark everyone was abed except the slave who had been posted inside the front door to keep watch through the night at some point before midnight according to the watchman there was a noise from the back of the house where dio was quartered the watchman went to investigate dios door was locked the slave called his name and rapped on the door finally the slave pounded so loudly that coponius himself in the bedroom adjoining was awakened and came to ask what the matter was at length the door was broken down and dio was discovered on his sleeping couch lying on his back with his eyes and mouth wide open his chest pierced by gaping wounds he had been stabbed to death in his bed a window in the room opened onto a small courtyard the shutters of this window were open and the latch had been forced from outside the killer or killers apparently crept over a high wall skulked across the terrace broke into dios room through the window murdered him then skulked away the killer or killers escaped unseen it was a wretched end to a distinguished life that dio foresaw his destruction and spent his final days in a city far from home dreading every shadow casts an even gloomier pall over his fate that he came to me asking for my help on the very day of his murder fills me with agitation could i have prevented the deed almost certainly not i tell myself for the men who wished to see dio dead have resources far beyond anything i could forestall yet it seems a cruel jest of the gods to have brought him back into my life after so many years and then to have snatched him away so violently i have seen much carnage and suffering in my life yet it never becomes easier to bear it only becomes harder for me to fathom now every member of the embassy which arrived last fall from alexandria has been murdered or has fled back to egypt or has otherwise vanished from sight the few still in rome i am told have either pledged their allegiance to king ptolemy or been bribed to keep silent no doubt some or all of them were the kings spies from the beginning the people of rome should be ashamed that such an atrocity could occur not just in italy but in the very heart of the city itself to be sure there are those who say that dios murder is such an outrage that the senate will be shamed into taking some action to punish his slayers if not king ptolemy then at least his henchmen the senate may even move to repudiate the king and recognize queen berenice which was the object of dios mission while he lived the senate would not even allow him to officially address them but in death dio may yet achieve what he desired an egypt with a new independent ruler can justice follow upon a tragedy such as dios murder considering the state of romes courts and the persons whose interests are at stake i strongly doubt it but i refuse to brood overmuch concerning this matter had i accepted dios commission to expose his enemies i might now feel some obligation to pursue the matter of bringing his killers to justice fortunately my rejection of his commission was explicit i told him that i could not help him and gave him a good reason my conscience is clear the task of finding the blade which drew dios lifeblood and punishing the hand that wielded it does not fall to me whatever happens next it will not involve me and for that i am glad rereading that letter now i see that my statements regarding the circumstances of dios death are marred by a number of errors some of them quite significant but no statement was more in error than the final one which i read now with a shudder of amazement how could i have been so blithely smugly unforeseeing what a perilous world we move through like men blindfolded the past and future are equally obscure and broad daylight can hide as many dangers as the landscape of the night part two noxia chapter eight almost a month passed before i had occasion to write to meto again to my beloved son meto serving under the command of gaius julius caesar in gaul from his loving father in rome may fortune be with you i write this letter on the twentyninth dayof martius an uncommonly warm day for so early in the springwe have thrown open all the windows and the afternoon sunshine is hot on my shoulders i wish you were here beside me alas you are not nor are you safely at ease in illyria where i last saw you i learned in the forum of your sudden move to gaul not long after my visit they say that caesar was called to put down a revolt by some tribe with an unpronounceable namei wont even try to spell it i presume that you have gone along with him take care meto given your movements i have no way of knowing if my letter of a month ago has reached you or will reach you after this one or will ever reach you at all but since one of caesars message bearers a young soldier who has carried my letters to you before is about to leave for gaul and says he will take along a letter from me if i can finish it within the hour i am writing very quickly and will simply give you what news i can even at the risk of conveying events that make little sense for lack of context dont show this letter to your commander please i fear that a man who dictates his memoirs on horseback would hardly accept being rushed as an excuse for fashioning such awkward sentences hopefully you did receive my last letter and so you know of the murder of dio i scoffed at those who said dios murder was too big a thing to go without consequence and that the scandal would result in someone being punished but it seems that i was wrong and they were right up to a point the scandal has been enormous dio was even better known and more highly regarded than i had realizedor did murder make a martyr of him and render him larger and more beloved in death than he was in life for a man who is now spoken of in such tones of awe he was certainly treated very shabbily in the final months of his life shuffling from one reluctant perhaps treacherous host to another expending his resources until his purse was empty the senators who now speak of dio as a second aristotle and weep at the mention of his name are the same men who refused to allow dio to speak in their chambers not long ago ive suddenly remembered that old conundrum which dio posed to me as a young man in alexandria is it better to be beloved in life and despised after death or despised in life and revered after death so the debate in the senate over the egyptian situation grinds on freshly fueled by this shameful outrage meanwhile a charge of murder was recently brought against one publius asicius i must say that i was not surprised to see asicius accused of dios murder dio himself suspected this young man of being involved in the failed poisoning attempt at the house of lucius lucceius and told me as much when he visited me on the very day that dios food taster died of poison asicius had paid a visit to lucceius by itself this is a merely circumstantial connection but then after dio left my house and probably not long after he was stabbed in his bed i happened to encounter asicius and our neighbor mc in the street and while i overheard them say nothing directly incriminating the circumstances at least in retrospect struck me as highly suspicious so when i heard that the charge had been brought against asicius i felt greatly relieved thinking that if he was guilty then perhaps the whole ugly truth would be given a chance to come outand without having to become involved myself i imagine you sometimes feel the same relief in your work for caesar when an odious task is unexpectedly accomplished without any effort on your part as if some friendly god had decided to do you a favor but the gods can be fickle with their favors who do you think stepped forward to defend asicius yes the best defense advocate in rome our old friend marcus cicero when i heard that news my hope abruptly dwindled many things may happen in a trial where cicero is one of the advocates but the emergence of the truth is seldom one of them if justice triumphs it happens in spite of ciceros smoke and mirrors and will have nothing to do with whether or not the truth was spoken they say that cicero and asicius were both away from rome down the coast when asicius was arraignedcicero in neapolis asicius across the bay at his familys villa in baiae to discuss the case asicius went to fetch cicero and took him back to baiae in his magnificent litter well not his exactly but a litter lent to asicius bycan you believe it king ptolemy the complicity is absolutely damning you would think that a man accused of murdering king ptolemys enemy would hide his connections with the king rather than flaunt them but like most men of his generation asicius cant seem to resist any opportunity to show off the litter was an enormous eightman affair elaborately decorated egyptian litters make the most elegant roman conveyances look plain and attended by no fewer than a hundred armed bodyguards also lent to asicius by king ptolemy if the king supplied the bodyguards for asiciuss physical defense who can help but conclude that it was also the king who hired cicero for asiciuss legal defense can you see it in your mindcicero and asicius discussing the upcoming murder trial while they proceed along the shore borne aloft in a litter lolling about in egyptian luxury with a hundred swordsmen in their train i missed the trial a relapse of the cough which plagued me in illyria kept me from venturing down to the forum bethesda went to watch but you can imagine the sort of report she came back withi was informed that asicius is quite goodlooking if a bit wasted and pale bethesda has heard that he drinks to excess that asiciuss friend our handsome young neighbor mc was nowhere in sight and that cicero was as longwinded and boring as ever and oh yes that asicius was acquitted of murdering dio i now regret having missed the trial for i should like to have heard with my own ears the evidence presented but i do not regret having missed whatever devious conjurers tricks cicero used to distract disorient and ultimately persuade the judges i dont need the aggravation so for better or worse the matter has come to a conclusion poor dio shall go unavenged but his legacy may yet prevail i lifted my stylus from the parchment distracted by a knock i turned in my chair and saw belbo in the doorway the messengers come back master he says he must have your letter now if hes to take it for you i grunted show him in no need to make him wait in the hallway i returned to the letter i must close abruptly caesars message bearer has returned i have foolishly spent this precious hour recounting forum gossip and left myself no time to speak of family matters know that all is well bethesda is as always and diana becomes more like her mother every day more beautiful more mysterious eco continues to prosper though i often wish i could have taught him a less dangerous trade than his fathers and his beloved menenia has proved herself a woman of surpassing patience especially in bringing up the uncontrollable twins imagine having two fouryearolds squabbling and stubbing their toes and catching colds i must close the messenger has entered the room and stands before me glancing over his shoulder at the statue of minerva in the sunfilled atrium tapping his foot impatiently take care meto i dusted the parchment with fine sand then pursed my lips and gently blew the sand away i rolled the parchment slipped it into a leather jacket and sealed the cylinder with wax as i handed it reluctantly to the messenger thinking of things left unsaid i took a closer look at the man he was dressed in a soldiers regalia all leather straps and clinking steel and bloodred wool his jaw was stiff and his countenance stern how old are you soldier twentytwo metos age exactly no wonder the fellow looked to me like a child playing soldier i studied his face searching for some sign of the horrors he must have beheld already in his young life and saw only the bland innocence of youth framed by a soldiers helmet his stern expression abruptly softened he looked puzzled i realized he was staring beyond me at someone in the doorway as i swung about i heard belbo bluster master another guest i told him to wait in the foyer but hes followed me anyway at first i hardly saw the visitor blocked as he was by belbos bulk then he slipped into view and what he lacked in stature was more than made up for by the gaudy splendor of his garb he was covered from the neck down in a gown of vibrant red and yellow silver bracelets dangled from his wrists a silver pectoral with glass beads hung from his neck and his ears and fingers sported silver rings his cheeks were painted white on his head was a multicolored turban from which his bleached hair hung down in wavy tresses the last time i had seen him he had been dressed in a toga not in the vestments of a priest of cybele trygonion i said he smiled you remember me then i do its all right i said to belbo who continued to hover uncertainly ready to interpose himself between the gallus and myself belbo could easily have lifted the little priest over his head and could probably have snapped him in two but he kept his distance afraid to lay his hands on a holy eunuch trygonion had slipped into my study without missing a step while a man three times his size blustered for him to stay back belbo gave the gallus a disgruntled look and withdrew behind me i heard the clearing of a throat and turned to see the soldier slipping my letter into a leather pouch im off then he said nodding to me and then looking at the eunuch with a mixture of curiosity and distaste may mercury guide you i said and may the purifying blood of the great goddess spring from between her legs and wash over you added trygonion he pressed his palms together making his bracelets jingle and bowed his head the soldier wrinkled his brow and hastily moved to depart uncertain whether he had just been blessed or cursed as he moved to slip out the narrow doorway he turned sideways to avoid touching the eunuch but trygonion deliberately shifted his stance so that their shoulders brushed and i saw the soldier shudder the contrast was striking between the stern virile young roman in his military garb and the diminutive grinning foreignborn gallus in his priestly gown how odd i thought that the larger stronger one trained to kill and defend himself should be the one to shiver in fear trygonion seemed to be thinking the same thing for as the soldier stomped down the hallway the eunuch looked after him and made a trilling laugh but as he turned back to me his smile quickly faded gordianus he said softly bowing his head in greeting i am again honored to be admitted into your home it would seem i had little choice over whether to admit you or not considering how giants give way before you and soldiers flee in panic he laughed but not in the trilling way he had used to mock the soldier it was a throaty chuckle such as men exchange over a witticism in the forum the gallus seemed able to change his persona at will from feminine to masculine never seeming wholly one or the other but something which was neither ive been sent to fetch you oh yes imagine that a priest of cybele dispatched like a messenger boy he cocked an eyebrow dispatched by whom by a certain lady does she have a name of course she doesmany names though id advise you to avoid the more scandalous ones and call her by the name her father gave her unless you wish to have your face slapped that is until you get to know her better what name is that she lives here on the palatine only a few steps away he gestured toward the door with an ingratiating smile still before i go off to see her i think i should like to know her name and what business she might have with me her business involves a certain mutual acquaintance two mutual acquaintances actually one living one dead he looked coy then somber neither expression seemed quite genuine as if he had exchanged one mask for another two mutual acquaintances he repeated one a murdererthe other the murderers victim one who even now moves through the forum laughing with his friends and flinging obscenities at his enemies while the other moves through hades a shadow among shadows perhaps he will meet aristotle there and debate him face to face and the dead can decide which of them knew more about living dio i whispered yes i speak of dioand dios killer thats the business ive come about whose business the business of my lady she has made it her business who is she i said growing impatient come and see she longs to meet you he raised an eyebrow and leered like a pimp procuring for a whore tell me her name i said slowly trying to keep my temper trygonion sighed and rolled his eyes oh very well her name is clodia he paused saw the expression on my face and laughed ah i see that youve already heard of her chapter nine onour way out we passed bethesda and diana in the hallway where are you going bethesda cast a chilly glance of recognition at trygonion crossed her arms and gave me the medusa look how could such a woman ever have been anyones slave least of all mine diana stood alongside and slightly behind her mother she too drew back her shoulders and crossed her arms affecting the same imperious gaze out i said bethesdas arms remained crossed the answer did not suffice the gallus may have some work for me i added she stared at the little priest so intently that i would hardly have been surprised to see him turn to stone instead he smiled at her the two of them seemed impervious to each other trygonion was not intimidated bethesda was not charmed youd better take belbo with you was all she had to say before uncrossing her arms and proceeding down the hallway diana followed mimicking her mothers movements with uncanny precisionuntil i swung around and tickled her under her arms she let out a scream of laughter and ran forward stumbling into bethesda they both turned and looked back at me diana laughing bethesda with one eyebrow raised and the merest hint of a smile on her lips take belbo she repeated before turning her back and walking on now i understand i thought she remembers trygonion from his visit with dio she knows about dios murder and now seeing me leave with trygonion she fears for me how touching the three of usthe gallus belbo and myselfstepped out into the bright afternoon sunshine the warmth in my study had seemed mild and the air sweet like early springtime here in the street the sun had heated the paving stones and the air was hot trygonion produced a tiny yellow parasol from the folds of his robe opened it up and held it aloft perhaps i should have brought my broadbrimmed hat i said squinting up at the cloudless sky its only a short walk said the gallus straight ahead for a block or two then off to the right we walked up the street and passed the apartment building where marcus caelius lived the shutters of all the upperstory windows were closed despite the heat could he be sleeping at this time of day what a life the building was owned by the rabblerouser publius clodius now i was on the way to see his sister what a small town rome is i thought and growing smaller with each passing year i had never met either of the notorious clodii they were distant cousins of my old patron lucius claudius but our paths had never crossed that had suited me in recent years ive grown increasingly selective both of those i choose to help and of those i choose to offend from what one heard about them clodia and clodius were the sort it was best simply to avoid an obscure citizen lamenting the theft of his familys silver an old acquaintance threatened by anonymous letters a young wife unfairly accused of adultery by her vindictive motherinlawin my semiretirement these struck me as the sort of people to whom i should lend my expertise men who deal in raw power who control vast networks of secret operatives who dispatch strongarmers to crush their opponents the pompeys and king ptolemies of this worldthese struck me as men i should take extreme care to avoid offending even if it meant passing up the chance to help an old friend even though it had meant turning my back on dio of alexandria now i found myself on the way to the house of clodia supposedly to discuss some matter relating to the murder of dio following a priest of cybele carrying a bright yellow parasol through the sunny streets of the palatine the gods delight in surprising men with the unexpected and are notorious for the cruelty of their mirth clodias house was situated at the end of a little culdesac off a quiet lane like the houses belonging to most patrician families it looked old and showed an unassuming face to the street the windowless front was stained with a muted yellow wash the doorstep was paved with glazed red and black tiles twin cypress trees framed the rustic oak door the trees soared to a great height i had often noticed them from the balcony at the back of my house but had never known exactly where they were located like the house the cypresses had obviously been there for many years the slave who answered the door was a burly young man with a neatly trimmed black beard and bushy eyebrows that grew together above soulful brown eyes he opened the door only halfway and smirked when he saw trygonion he hardly looked at me or belbo shes gone out he said crossing his arms and slouching against the door frame gone out said the gallus but i only just left her to go fetch this fellow the doorkeeper shrugged what can i tell you you know how she is but she knew i was coming straight back said trygonion in a petulant voice where has she gone down to the river what to the markets the slave narrowed his eyes of course not you know she never goes to the public markets anymore afraid milos men will be there to start up the chants about her pretends she doesnt care but you know how she hates that the slave arched his right eyebrow which created a striking effect since his eyebrows were joined shes gone down to her place on the tiber said it was the only spot to be on a beautiful day like this everyone will be at the river she said looking to catch an eyeful i imaginethe swimmers a sudden twitch at the corner of his mouth turned into a smile as a hand belonging to someone hidden behind the door slipped across the gap and made its way onto the slaves backside the visible patch of wrist moved in a sinuous fashion like a wriggling snake the young doorkeeper gave a ticklish start and flexed his muscular forearms she should have taken me with her he sighed but im managing to stay busy did she leave any word for me asked trygonion exasperated she must have from just beyond the door i heard a womans laugh then a smiling face appeared pressed cheek to cheek with the burly doorkeeper dont worry she didnt forget you the woman trilled her voice had a cultured accent and her chestnut hair was extravagantly put up though a few stray tendrils had escaped the pins and combs the lines around her eyes and mouth had been skillfully softened with makeup but i could see she was no longer young barnabas is teasing you arent you barnabas wicked she playfully bit the slaves ear barnabas laughed brusquely and jerked away freeing his ear from the womans gleaming white teeth and his buttocks from her grip off with you then she said laughing and snapping her fingers go on ill tend to you later she growled deep in her throat and clicked her teeth the door slave departed its a hebrew name you know she said turning back to us barnabas i mean clodia says it means consolation she should know the woman laughed and i caught the smell of wine on her breath what did clodia say about me demanded the gallus about you trygonion hmm well we all know where your name comes from dont we she looked at him knowingly never mind snapped the gallus what did she say before she left the womans expression soured undoing the illusion of her makeup oh all right then she said she simply couldnt stay indoors for another instant and shes been dying to get down to her place on the river for days so she told chrysis to call for her litter bearers and pack up a few things and off they went in a cloud of dust she asked me to come along but i told her i was too too despondent and in great need of consolation ha she barked out a laugh showing perfect white teeth so since i was staying clodia asked me to please give you a message if you should happen to come around to tell you that you and your she looked at belbo and me blearily as if noticing us for the first time your friends or whatever should trot down to the river and meet her there is that clear enough yes thank you said trygonion curtly he turned around and hurriedly strode away taking the longest steps his short legs would allow cut off their balls and see what pests they turn into the woman muttered between clenched teeth she shrugged and slammed the door horrible woman trygonion said as belbo and i caught up with him slow down i complained who is she just a neighbor nobody a cousin or something i dont have money for a litter do you i suppose we can walk which we did as we made our way down the western slope of the palatine through the cattle markets across the bridge and up the west bank of the tiber at several points i considered telling trygonion that i had changed my mind and was turning back what was i doing after all coming at the summons of a woman i had happily avoided until now to discuss a matter from which i had deliberately distanced myself blame it on cybele i thought as i followed her priest his parasol held resolutely aloft it is a sign of wealth and good taste to own a green patch on the banks of the tiber such estates are something of a cross between a park and a garden the owners call such grounds horti there is usually a structure of some sortsometimes no more than a rustic retreat with quarters for the groundskeeper and a few guests sometimes a whole complex of buildings the grounds themselves are often a mix of wilderness and cultivation depending on the size of the property the owners proclivities and the gardeners skill patches of tall grass and woodland may be interspersed with rose gardens fishponds fountains and stonepaved walkways adorned with statuary clodias horti were unusually close in a hundred years ago the property must have been well out in the countryside but the city had greatly expanded since then it was an enviable location for a piece of riverfront property and must have been in her family for generations the impression of great age was reinforced by the grounds themselves which on such a warm windless day had the feeling of a place where time stopped long ago the immediate approach was a long narrow lane bordered by sprawling berry bushes which met overhead shading the way this tunnellike path opened onto a broad field of grass kept closely mown by a pair of goats which bleated at our approach facing the meadow and perpendicular to the river which was almost entirely obscured by an intervening stand of dense trees was a long narrow house with a redtiled roof and a portico running along the whole front the open meadow was as private as any walled garden in the city for the view on all sides was shielded by tall cypress trees and majestic yews she wont be in the house but i suppose we can take a look all the same said trygonion we crossed the meadow and stepped under the shade of the portico trygonion rapped on the nearest door then pushed it open and stepped over the threshold beckoning to belbo and me each room of the long house opened onto the next and every room had its own door onto the long portico so that one could walk from end to end of the house either along the shaded outdoor walkway or through each room in succession i could tell at once that the house was empty it had the feeling of a place left unoccupied all winter which had not yet been brought back to life the air was still and cool inside the walls and the sparse furnishings exhaled a slightly musty odor and every surface had a thin coating of dust we followed trygonion slowly from room to room as he called clodias name in some of the rooms dropcloths covered every object in other rooms the cloths had been pulled away apparently quite recently for they still lay carelessly crumpled on the floor having acquired a furnished house on the palatine i know a few things about furniture the pieces i saw in clodias house on the tiber were of the sort which fetch astonishing prices at auction nowadays especially among our burgeoning empires new rich who have no such treasures in their obscure familiessleeping couches saved from the flames of carthage their plush cushions so faded that the exotic patterns can barely be made out gilded cabinets and trunks with massive iron hinges of a sort no longer made ancient folding chairs that the scipios or the gracchi brothers might have sat on there were paintings as well in every room and not theatrical wall paintings such as are fashionable among the wealthy nowadays but portraits and historical scenes painted in encaustic on wood and mounted in elaborate frames these were darkened by age their smooth surfaces covered by a skein of very fine cracks collectors set great store by these qualities which time alone creates and which cannot be mimicked by human artists there were also tiny sculptures mounted here and there on pedestals none of them taller than a mans forearm in keeping with the small scale of the rooms and all of rustic subjects to match the rustic mood of the placelittle statues of pan and silenus of a slave boy pulling a thorn from his foot of a wood nymph kneeling on a rock we came to the end of the house and stepped back onto the covered portico trygonion peered toward the woods on the opposite side of the meadow where i could see nothing no she wouldnt be over at the kitchens or the slave quarters or the stable he said shes down by the water of course we set out across the meadow again toward the grove of trees along the river in their shade we came upon a statue of venus not a small decorative object like those in the house but a magnificent towering bronze upon a marble pedestal the goddess looked out on the water with an expression of almost smug contentment on her face as if the river flowed merely to give music to her ears and the city on its further bank had been erected for no other purpose than to amuse her extraordinary i whispered beside me belbo stared up at the statue dumbly a look of religious awe on his face do you think so said trygonion you should see the one at her house in the city he turned and walked on humming a hymn to cybele his mood seemed to lighten with each step that brought him closer to the river and to the red and white striped tent pitched on the bank we stepped out of the trees and into the sunlight a mild breeze stirred the lush grass the tent stood out in dazzling relief against the bright green grass the darker green of the river beyond and the glaring azure sky above its fine silk panels shivered in the delicate breeze the red stripes wavered like slithering snakes against a field of white then by a trick of the eye the illusion was reversed and the stripes became white snakes against a field of red from somewhere i heard the sound of splashing but the tent and the high trees on either side blocked my view of the river wait here said trygonion he stepped inside a little later he stuck his head out the flap come in gordianus but leave your bodyguard outside as i moved toward the flap it was pulled aside by an unseen slave within i stepped into the tent the first thing i noticed was the scent a perfume i had never smelled beforeelusive subtle and intriguing the instant i first smelled it i knew i would never forget it the red and white silk softened the bright sunlight filling the tent with a warm glow the panels facing the river had been rolled up letting in the view and framing it like a picture sunlight danced on the green water and cast lozenges of light into the tent where they flitted and danced across my hands and face i heard the sound of splashing again and now i saw its source a group of young men and boys fifteen or more who frolicked in the water just beyond the tent some of them wore brightcolored scraps of cloth about their loins but most were naked beads of water clung to their sleek flesh in the sunlight they glimmered as if chased with jewels when they moved into the shade beneath trees they became dappled like spotted fauns their splashing caused the lozenges of light to dance wildly inside the tent i walked toward the center of the tent where trygonion awaited me with a beaming smile on his face he stood beside a high couch strewn with red and white striped pillows holding the hand of the woman who reclined upon it the woman was turned so that i could not see her face before i reached the couch a figure suddenly appeared before me she looked hardly older than a child but wore her auburn hair coiled atop her head and was dressed in a long green gown mistress she called keeping her eyes on mine mistress your guest is here to see you show him to me chrysis the voice was sultry and unhurried deeper than trygonions but unmistakably feminine yes mistress the slave girl took my hand and led me before the couch the smell of perfume grew stronger no no chrysis her mistress said laughing gently dont put him directly in front of me hes blocking the view chrysis tugged playfully at my hand and pulled me to one side thats better chrysis now run along you too trygonionlet go of my hand little gallus go find something for chrysis to do up at the house or go look for pretty stones along the riverbank but dont let one of those river satyrs catch either one of you or who knows what might happen chrysis and trygonion departed leaving me alone with the woman on the high couch chapter ten the young men you see in the river wearing loincloths are mine my slaves that ismy litter bearers and bodyguards i let them wear loincloths here at the horti after all i can see them naked anytime i wish also it makes it easier for me to pick out the others any young roman worth being seen naked knows that hes allowed to come swimming along my stretch of the tiber anytime he wishesso long as he does it in the nude they come down from the road along a little pathway hidden beyond those trees and leave their tunics hanging on branches at the height of summer on a hot afternoon there are sometimes more than a hundred of them out there diving splashing each other sunning themselves on the rocks naked by my decree look at the shoulders on that one i found myself staring at a woman of no few yearsknowing that she was about five years older than her brother publius clodius i calculated that she was probably forty give or take a year it was hard to say whether she looked her age or not however old she looked it suited her clodias skin was certainly finer than that of most women of forty the color of white roses very creamy and smooth perhaps i thought the filtered light of the tent flattered her her hair was black and lustrous arranged by some hidden magic of pins and combs into an intricate maze of curls atop her head the way that her hair was pulled back from her forehead gave emphasis to the striking angles of her cheekbones and the proud line of her nose which was almost but not quite too large her lips were a sumptuous red which surely could not have been natural her eyes seemed to glitter with flashes of blue and yellow but mostly of green the color of emeralds sparkling as the sunlight sparkled on the green tiber i had heard of her eyes clodias eyes were famous look at the gooseflesh on them she laughed its a wonder they can stand to go in the water at all the river must still be frigid so early in the year no matter how warm the sunshine look how it shrivels their manhoods a pity for that can be half the fun of watching but notice not one of them is shivering they dont want me to see them shiver the dear brave foolish boys she laughed again a low throaty chuckle clodia reclined on her divan with her back against a pile ofcushions and her legs folded to one side beneath her a long stola of shimmering yellow silk belted below her breasts and again at her waist covered her from her neck down only her arms were naked even so no one could have called the costume modest the fabric was so sheer as to be transparent so that it was hard to tell in the glittering light from the sunspangled river how much of the sheen of her contours came from the shiny silk and how much from the sleek flesh beneath i had never seen a dress like it this must have shown on my face for clodia laughed again and not at the young men in the river do you like it she looked steadily into my eyes as she smoothed her palm over her hip and down her thigh to the bend of her knee the silk seemed to ripple like water before the advancing edge of her hand it comes all the way from cos something new from a famous silkmaker there i dont think any other woman in rome has a dress like it or perhaps theyre like me not quite brave enough to wear such a garment in public she smiled demurely and reached up to the silver necklace at her throat she spread her fingers and i could clearly see thanks to the transparency of the silk that while she rolled one of the lapis baubles between her forefinger and thumb with her little finger she delicately stroked one of her large pale nipples until it began to grow excited i cleared my throat and glanced over my shoulder the young men in the water were now throwing a leather ball back and forth among themselves making a game of it but every now and then they shot glances toward the tent no wonder they had come to the river on the first warm day of the year i thought they came to look at her no less than she came to look at them i cleared my throat again is your throat dry did you walk all the way from the palatine she sounded genuinely curious as if walking for any distance outdoors was a feat she had watched her litter bearers perform but which she had never attempted on her own yes i walked poor dear then you must be thirsty here look before she left chrysis put out cups for us the clay pitcher holds fresh water the wine in the silver decanter is falernian i never drink anything else the vessels were set on a little table beside her there was no chair however it appeared that visitors were meant to stand my mouth was in fact quite dry and not entirely from the heat of the day clodias cup was already full of wine so i reached for the pitcher of water and poured myself a cup drinking it slowly before i poured myself another no wine she sounded disappointed i think not its bad for a man my age to drink wine after exerting himself in the heat of the day if not bad for my bowels i thought then bad for my judgment in such company what would the transparent silk dress begin to look like after a cup or two of strong falernian as you wish she shrugged the silk pooled above her shoulders then rippled like a sheet of water over her breasts i finished the second cup of water and put it down there was a reason you sent the gallus for me yes there was she turned her gaze from me and fixed it on the young men in the river i watched her eyes flit back and forth following the leather ball her face remained impassive trygonion said it had something to do with dio she nodded perhaps i should close the tent flaps i said then what would the young men in the river think the idea of scandal seemed to amuse her as did my growing consternation if we need a chaperon call back your handmaiden do we need a chaperon the look in her eyes was unnerving you obviously dont know chrysis she would hardly qualify for the role trygonion then at that she laughed aloud and opened her mouth to speak then thought better of it forgive me she said when i have business to conduct with a goodlooking man i like to indulge in a little teasing first its a fault of mine my friends have learned to overlook it i hope that youll overlook the fault as well gordianus now that ive confessed it i nodded very well yes i wanted to consult you regarding the untimely death of our mutual friend dio of alexandria ourmutual friend yes mine as well as yours dont look so surprised gordianus there are probably a great many things about dio that you didnt know for that matter there are probably a great many things about me that dont know despite all you may have heard ill try to be brief and to the point it was i who suggested to dio that he should go to your house to seek your help on the night he was murdered you yes but you dont know me even so i know of you just as you undoubtedly know of me your reputation goes back a long way finder i was a girl of seventeen still living at home when cicero made such a splash defending that man accused of parricide i remember my father talking about the case for long afterward i didnt know of the role you played until many years later of course when i learned the details from cicero himselfhow cicero loved to rehash that old case again and again until his triumph over catilina finally gave him something even bigger to crow about cicero used to speak of you often to my late husband on a few occasions he even recommended that quintus seek out your services but quintus was always stubborn about using his own men for snooping and such i shall be honest with you cicero didnt always speak highly of you that is to say from time to time when your name was brought up he sometimes used words that should not be repeated aloud by a respectable roman matron such as myself but weve all had our fallingsout with cicero have we not the important thing is that even when he was infuriated with you cicero always made a point of praising your honesty and integrity indeed when quintus was governor up in cisalpine gaul cicero and his wife terentia came for a visit and one night after dinner we all played a game of questions and answers when quintus asked cicero what man he would trust to tell the truth no matter what do you know whom he named yes gordianus it was you so you see when dio asked us to whom he might turn for help the name of gordianus the finder came to my mind at once i didnt know at the time that you and dio already knew each other trygonion told me about that after their visit to you i suppose im flattered i said you know then that i met dio in alexandria years ago trygonion explained it to me but how is it that you knew dio because of his dealings with my brother publius of course what dealings they met shortly after dio arrived in rome the two of them had much to talk about i should think that dio and publius clodius would have had a hard time finding common ground considering that it was your brother who engineered the roman takeover of egyptian cyprus water under the bridge as the etruscans say far more important to dio was my brothers opposition to pompey publius offered dio a muchneeded ally in the senate dio offered publius a means to cheat pompey of his ambitions in egypt and your place in all this theres something about sharpwitted older men that i find simply irresistible she gave me another of her unnerving looks and what did dio see in you i asked bluntly perhaps it was my wellknown love of poetry clodia shrugged elegantly causing the sheer silk to catch and drag across her nipples if you and your brother were such great friends and supporters of dio why didnt he stay at your house where hed be safe instead of moving from one dubious host to another staying barely ahead of his killer dio couldnt stay at my house for the same reason that you may not lower the flaps of this tent gordianus a man and a woman together you understand dios position with the senate was precarious enough without having it further eroded by sexual innuendos nor could he have stayed with publius imagine the rumors that would have set off about the egyptian troublemaker hatching plots with the famous rabblerouser notoriety exacts a price sometimes our friends must stay at arms length for their own good very well dio was your friend or ally or whatever and you sent him to me for help i had to refuse him a few hours later he was dead you and your brother didnt do a very good job of protecting him did you her lips tightened and her eyes flashed nor did you she said icily who had known him far longer than i had and whose obligations must have run far deeper i winced just so but even if i had agreed to dios request i wouldve been too late to save him by the time i woke up the next morningno even before i fell asleep that nighthe was already dead but what if you had said yes to dio what if you had agreed to begin looking after his safety the next morning helping him decide whom to trust and whom to fear wouldnt you have felt some obligation after his death to try to bring his murderer to justice perhaps and do you feel no such obligation now simply out of respect for an old friendship why do you hesitate to answer doesnt everyone know who was behind dios murder who king ptolemy of course was it king ptolemy who slipped poison into dios soup in the house of lucceius was it ptolemy himself who stole into dios room and stabbed him to death no of course not it was someone acting on the kings behalf exactly and do you feel no obligation to see that this person is punished if only to give solace to dios shade asicius has already been tried for the crime and acquitted the swine her eyes flashed nemesis will have to deal with him in her own fashion but theres another man even more culpable than asicius who has yet to be brought to justice you could help gordianus though there was no chance that the men in the river could overhear still i lowered my voice if you mean pompey pompey do you think i would send you against pompey that would be like sending a onearmed gladiator into the arena to take on an elephant her laughter was like sand in my face no gordianus what i want from you is very simple and well within your capabilities how many times have you investigated the circumstances of a murder how many times have you helped an advocate find evidence that would prove a man guilty or innocent of such a crime thats all i want from you im not asking you to topple a king from his throne or pull down a colossus only help me bring down the wrath of the law on the man who killed dio by his own hand help me punish the coldblooded killer who plunged a dagger into dios breast i expelled a heavy breath and turned to stare at the sunlight on the river why do you hesitate gordianus ill pay you for your labors of course and generously but i expected you to leap at this opportunity out of your respect for dio is his shade not whispering in your ear even now pleading for vengeance he asked for your help once before while he was still alive these days in a case such as thisin a matter of murderi usually defer to my son eco hes younger stronger quicker those things often matter when the stakes are so high sharp ears and eyes can mean the difference between life and death an old fellow like myself but your son never knew dio did he even so i think its eco you want well never having seen him its hard for me to say whether i would want him or not does he look like a younger version of you she looked me up and down as if i were a slave on the auction block i bit my lip for having mentioned eco imagining him in my place alone with such a creature what was i thinking recommending him to her both of my sons are adopted i said they look nothing like me they must be ugly then she said affecting a frown of disappointment well then youre the man i want gordianus and theres no way around it will you help me or not i hesitated for dios sake i sighed seeing no way out you want me to find out who murdered dio no no she shook her head didnt i make myself clear we already know that what i need from you is your help in collecting evidence to convict the man you know who murdered dio of course you know him too im sure until a few days ago he lived just up the street from you his name is marcus caelius i stared at her blankly how do you know that she leaned forward absently running her hands over her thighs the movement pressed her breasts together and caused the sheer cloth which outlined her nipples to shimmer until recently marcus caelius and i were on rather intimate terms he and my brother were also close you might say that caelius was almost like a brother to both of us the way she said it the implication was vaguely obscene go on not long before the poison attempt was made on dio in the house of lucius lucceius caelius came to me asking to borrow a considerable sum of money so he told me he needed the money to pay for some games being held in his home town interamnia apparently caelius has an honorary post on the local council there in return theres an obligation to help pay for local festivals thats the way caelius explained it to me anyway it wasnt the first time he asked to borrow money from me did you always oblige him usually you might say i had developed a habit of indulging marcus caelius he always repaid me but seldom with money then how with favors political favors clodia laughed hardly lets just say that i had an itch and caelius knew how to scratch it but im digressing as i said the sum of money he asked to borrow was rather largeconsiderably larger than hed ever requested before enough to pay for an awful lot of scratching i said her eyes flashed why yes perhaps thats what i was thinking when i foolishly agreed to give caelius the loan afterward i became apprehensive and made some inquiries imagine my displeasure when i discovered that the games at interamnia are held in the autumn not the spring caeliuss pretense for the loan was a complete fiction he would hardly be the first young man to lie to a beautiful woman to get her money clodia smiled at this and i realized that i had called her beautiful without even thinking i had meant to say an older woman surely the flattery was all the more sincere for being spontaneous and i think she sensed this her smile faded i believe marcus caelius used the money to obtain poison and then to bribe one or more of lucceiuss slaves to try to kill dio with it you said it was a large sum of money poison isnt cheap the stuff has to be reliable and so does the person selling it nor is it cheap to bribe the slaves of a rich master to commit such a crime clodia spoke with authority as if she had personal knowledge of such matters the connection occurred to me only later after dio was dead little thingsthe tone of caeliuss voice and the look on his face whenever the subject of dio arose cryptic comments he would make my own intuition these are hardly evidence evidence is what i want from you gordianus whatever the truth of the matter it wasnt the poison attempt that killed dio what about the stabbing early on the evening of the murder caelius was at my house which isnt far from that of titus coponius where dio was killed caelius was carrying a knife concealed inside his tunic if it was concealed how i assure you nothing on marcus caeliuss person was hidden from me that night she said with a brittle smile he was carrying a dagger he was also nervous and fretful in a state such as i had never seen him in before and drinking more than was good for him i asked what was wrong he said there was an unpleasant task ahead of him and that he would be relieved when it was done i pressed him to tell me what it was but he refused you men with your little secrets i said this unpleasant task which you dread so muchi hope its not the task i asked you here to perform of course not he said and proceeded to demonstrate as much but our lovemaking that night was a disappointment to say the least caelius was about as effectual as one of our shriveled friends in the river today later when his friend asicius came by to collect him caelius was eager to leave well then i thought let the boys go off and play with each other a little later that nightonly moments after the two of them left my doorstep i imaginedio was stabbed to death i paused for a long moment before speaking puzzled not by the details of clodias story but by her whole manner of speaking i had never heard a woman talk of her sexual relations in such frank terms and with such acid in her voice you realize that everything youve told me connecting caelius with dios murder is merely circumstantial then here is another circumstance the next night when caelius came calling on me he brought me a little gifta silver necklace with lapis and carnelian baublesand boasted that he could now repay every sesterce of the money he had borrowed from me and did he repay you she laughed of course not but from the way he talked i had no doubt that he had come into some money he had performed his task you see and been handsomely paid off is this merely your assumption clodia wasnt listening she stared at the roof of the tent remembering our lovemaking that night was quite the reverse of the previous evening caelius was a veritable minotaurhorns rampant eyes aflame his flanks glossy with sweat i opened my mouth to speak but before i could interrupt her it was done for me by the approaching sound of a mans laughter deep and throaty accompanied by splashing footsteps clodia snapped out of her reverie and sat forward on her couch on her face was a look of pure joy i turned to see a man taking high steps through the shallows along the riverbank striding toward the tent like the other men in the river he was naked the light of the lowering sun glittered on the water behind him casting him in shimmering silhouette beads of water on his shoulders and limbs sparkled like points of white flame outlining the dark mass of his body as he emerged from the river he raised his hands and pressed the water from his hair showing the sleek muscularity of his shoulders and arms on dry land his stride became a swagger and though his features were still shadowed in silhouette i could see the flash of a broad smile on his face darling the word emerged from clodias lips like a breath made audible as uncalculated as a moan or a sigh there was no pretense or teasing in her voice no slyness or innuendo she sprang from the couch to meet the man as he stepped into the tent it was hard to say which of them looked more naked the sinewy longlimbed man wearing nothing but beads of water or clodia in her gown of transparent yellow silk they embraced and kissed each other on the mouth after a moment clodia drew back and took his hands in hers where her gown had become wet from being pressed against his body the silk was even more transparent and was molded to her like a second skin she turned her head saw me gaping and laughed the man did likewise as if he were her mirror image but darling she said squeezing his hands and giggling like a girl why didnt you simply come in through the tent flap what on earth were you doing out in the water with the others and when did you join them how could i not have noticed i only just arrived he said with a laugh deeper than clodias but uncannily similar i thought it would be fun to slip in among your admirers and see if i could attract your notice which i didnt apparently but i was distracted darling by something very important she nodded toward me and affected a sober expression the teasing tone had returned to her voice she was performing again but for whom its about dio darling and the trial this is gordianus the man i told you about hes going to help us punish marcus caelius the man turned his beaming smile on me i recognized him now of course i had seen him at a distance in the forum on many occasions haranguing his mob of followers or keeping company with the great powers of the senate but never naked and wet with his hair slicked back how very much like his sister publius clodius looked especially when one saw the two of them together side by side chapter eleven i remember something you used to tell me papa when i was starting out on my own never accept a commission without obtaining some sort of retainer no matter how small eco cocked his head and gave me a penetrating look what is your point i said well when you left clodias horti this afternoon was your purse heavier than when you arrived this was his way of asking if i had accepted clodias commission to investigate the murder of dio how typical of eco to get directly to the heart of the matter despite the summerlike warmth of the day darkness had fallen early it was still the month of martius after all by the time i left clodias horti shortly after her brothers arrival the sun was already sinking turning the tiber into a sheet of flaming gold it was twilight by the time belbo and i reached home trudging back across the bridge through the shutdown cattle markets and back up the palatine night fell with a slight chill in the air after a hurried meal with bethesda and diana despite the tiredness of my legs i again set out with belbo across the city to take counsel with my elder son we sat in the study of the house on the esquiline hill which had once been my house and my fathers before that now it belonged to eco and his brood his wife menenia was elsewhere probably trying to put to bed the squabbling twins whose highpitched screams of laughter occasionally rent the cool evening air i had just described to eco my interview with clodia up to the arrival of her brother and my departure shortly thereafter when i left the ladys horti i said my purse was substantially heavier so you did accept her commission i nodded then you do believe that marcus caelius murdered dio i didnt say that but youll be looking for evidence to convict him if such evidence exists clodias reasons for suspecting him seem to me tenuous at best said eco but then youve begun investigations with less to go on and still managed to dig up the truth yes but to be honest im a little uneasy about the whole affair i should think so what do you mean well papa everyone knows that caelius and clodia were lovers and caelius and clodius are political allies and drinking partners or used to be for that matter there may have been something more than friendship between the two of them or the three of them i should say you mean the three of them in one bed eco shrugged dont look surprised a woman like clodiawell you said yourself that there wasnt a piece of furniture in the tent except for her couch so papa you assumed that you were meant to stand from what ive heard the woman is more hospitable than that if there was no chair only a single couch perhaps that meant that you were invited to recline eco well from the dress you say she was wearing i should have been less descriptive you should have taken me along with you then i could have seen for myself youre well into your thirties now son you should be able to think of something besides sex menenia never complains he grinned i tried to make a grunt of disapproval which came out sounding more like a hum of curiosity eco had chosen a blackhaired beauty not unlike bethesda for his wife in how many other ways was she like bethesda i had wondered about this from time to time in the perfectly natural way that a man of my years ponders the younger generation and their goingson eco and menenia naked clodius and his sister in her transparent gown at just that moment one of the twins let out a scream from elsewhere in the house i was jolted from my reverie rudely reminded that physical pleasure can have consequences we stray from the subject i said i told you i felt uneasy about accepting this commission from clodia and you said i should think so well it all seems rather unsavory dont you think perhaps even suspicious i mean theres an odd smell to it look papa all you really learned about caelius from your interview with clodia is that he borrowed some money from an older richer womanunder false pretenses to be sureand failed to repay her oh and that he happens to carry a knife on his person which is technically illegal inside the city walls but done by most people with any common sense these days until very recently these two were lovers and now shes after evidence to convict him of murder what are we to make ofthat caelius was her brothers confidant and now the two clodii accuse him of being a hired assassin for king ptolemy or for pompey which is the same thing why clodius is caeliuss landlordcaelius lives in that apartment just up the street from you i shook my head not anymore clodius kicked him out when a few days ago i didnt know about it until today when clodius told me himselfstanding there naked in the tent dripping wet nonchalantly discussing his real estate with me funny the gallus and i walked by the place on our way to clodias house and when i saw that all the shutters were closed on such a warm day i thought caelius must be inside sleeping off a hangover instead it turns out that the apartment is empty caelius has gone back to live at his fathers house on the quirinal hillwhere hell undoubtedly stay until his trial is finished then theyre definitely bringing charges against him oh yes charges have already been filed but not by clodius then by whom can you guess eco shook his head marcus caelius has too many enemies for me to hazard a guess the charges were filed by the seventeenyearold son of lucius calpurnius bestia eco laughed and mimed with his outstretched arm judges i do not point the finger of guilti point at the guilty finger so you know that story of course papa everyone knows about caelius accusing bestia of poisoning his wives i only regret that you and i were gone visiting meto when that trial took place i heard about it secondhand from menenia it was bethesda who told me about it well it looks as if bestia may soon exact his revenge on caelius has the date for the trial been set yes the charges were actually filed five days ago given the customary ten days allowed for the two sides to prepare their arguments that puts the beginning of the trial only five days from now so soon you dont have much time isnt that always the way they come to us thinking we can pull evidence out of thin air eco cocked his head but wait youre saying the trial will start two days after the nones of aprilis if it goes on for more than a day it would overlap with the opening of the great mother festival i nodded the trial will go on despite the holiday lesser courts are suspended during the festival but not the court for political terrorism political terrorism then its not a simple murder trial hardly there are four charges against caelius the first three accuse him of organizing the attacks on the alexandrian embassythe midnight raids in neapolis the stoning in puteoli and the fire at the estate of palla ill take no part in investigating those matters my only concern is the fourth charge which relates directly to dio it accuses caelius of attempting to poison dio at the house of lucceius what about the actual murder the stabbing at coponiuss house technically thats also included but publius asicius has already been acquitted and the prosecution is wary of trying to prove the same case against caelius instead they want to concentrate on the earlier poisoning attempt of course ill find out what i can about the stabbing at coponiuss house as a corroborative detail and to satisfy your own curiosity of course eco pressed his fingertips together a politically charged trial held during a holiday when rome will be packed with visitors with ciceros estranged protege as the accused and a scandalous woman in the backgroundthis could turn into a spectacle papa i groaned all the more reason for my misgivings all i need now is for some of pompeys or king ptolemys strongarmers to come banging at my door warning me to back away from the investigation eco raised an eyebrow do you think thats likely to happen i hope not but i have a bad feeling about the whole affair as you said theres an odd smell to it i dont like it then why not back away you dont owe clodia any favorsor do you are you telling me everything that happened in her tent today he affected an insinuating smile dont be absurd i owe the woman nothing but the retainer i left with but i do feel an obligation he nodded to dio you mean yes i refused him to his face when he asked me for help then i talked myself out of going to the trial of asicius you were sick papa yes but was i that sick and then when asicius was acquitted i told myself that was the end of it but how could it be the end with no one convicted of the crime how could dio be at rest still i managed to shun the obligation i felt to shove such thoughts to the back of my minduntil yesterday when the gallus arrived to bring me face to face with my own responsibility it was clodia who summoned me but it wasnt only her her brother clodius as well no i mean to say that those two are only the agents of something larger it begins with dio but where it ends only time will tell some greater power seems determined to pull me into this matter nemesis i was thinking of another goddess cybele it was one ofher priests who accompanied dio to my house and the same priest who came for me yesterday do you think its only a coincidence that the trial will be held during the great mother festivalthe celebration consecrated to cybele you know it was one of clodias ancestresses who saved the statue of cybele from being lost in the tiber when it was brought from the east long ago do you sense the link papa you grow more religious as you grow older said eco quietly perhaps more fearful of the gods anyway if not more respectful leave them out of it then say that this is merely between myself and the shade of dio my sense of obligation runs deeper than my misgivings eco nodded gravely as usual he understood me completely what do you want from me papa im not sure yet perhaps nothing perhaps only to listen to my doubts and nod if i say something that remotely makes sense he took my hand in his tell me if you need more than that papa promise me i promise eco he released me and sat back from elsewhere in the house i heard one of the twins shrieking surely it was time for them to be in bed i thought through the gaps in the shutters i could see that the world outside was dark what does bethesda think said eco i smiled what makes you think i told her anything you must have told her something when you ate dinner with her tonight yes a somewhat expurgated version of my visit to clodias horti ha bethesda would have appreciated the detail of the naked bathers i think eco laughed perhaps but i left them out of it just as i left out the description of the dress which seems to have intrigued you so much i think it intrigued you first papa and clodiuss emergence from the river as naked as a fish from the sea omittedthough i did leave in the siblings embrace and their kiss and the kiss well i had to give bethesda some grist for gossip and what does she think of the accusation against marcus cae lius bethesda stated quite flatly that it was absurd really impossible she said marcus caelius could never have committed the crime the woman is defaming him i asked her upon what she based her opinion but the medusa look was the only answer i got bethesda has always had a weakness for our dashing young neighbor or exneighbor i should now say shell miss having him living just up the street we shall all miss the occasional spectacle of watching caelius stumble out his front door in the middle of the day with tousled hair and bloodshot eyes or seeing him carouse through the street with a prostitute from the subura or hearing his drunk friends recite obscene poetry from his window at night papa stop eco choked with laughter its no joking matter i suppose i said suddenly grim the young mans whole future is at stake if hes convicted the best that marcus caelius can hope for will be a chance to flee into exile his family will be shamed his career ended all his prospects ruined it hardly seems punishment enough if hes guilty if hes guilty i said which its up to me to find out and if you find that hes not guilty ill report that to clodia and will that make any difference to her said eco shrewdly you know as well as i do eco that roman trials are only incidentally about guilt and innocence you mean that clodia may be more interested in destroying caelius than in punishing dios killer that thought has crossed my mind a woman scorned unless it was she who scorned him papa i suppose thats one of the things ill need to find out if you believe the rumors caelius wouldnt be the first man shes destroyed said eco though i suppose exile and humiliation are more merciful than poison you refer to the gossip that she murdered her husband three years ago he nodded they say that quintus metellus celer was healthy one day and dead the next they say that his marriage to clodia was always stormyand moreover that celer and her brother clodius had become fierce enemies the rift was ostensibly over politicsbut what man could abide having a brotherinlaw for a rival in his bed but which brotherinlaw was the usurperclodius or celer he shrugged i suppose that was up to clodia to decide celer was the loser he lost his life and now caelius perhaps any man who comes between this brother and sister is risking more than he realizes i shook my head you repeat these scandalous charges as if you knew them to be true eco only because i think you should consider very carefully what sort of people youre dealing with youve made up your mind to go through with this then to try to find the truth about dios murder yes under clodias auspices it was she who hired me circumstance led her to mecircumstance or cybele but the political danger of associating yourself in any way with clodius ive made up my mind he stroked his chin thoughtfully then i think at the very least we should review what we know about these clodii before you go off pursuing their interests or pocketing any more of their silver very well what do we know about them and let us be careful to separate fact from slander eco nodded he spoke deliberately carefully framing his thoughts they are patricians they come from a very old very distinguished family they have many renowned ancestors many of whom served as consuls whose public works are scattered all over italyroads aqueducts temples basilicas gates porticoes arches their relatives are intermarried with families of equal stature in such a tangle that even a silkmaker could never unravel all the threads the clodii are at the heart of romes ruling class as fractured and at odds with itself as that class may be yes the respectability of their ancestry and their connections is beyond question i agreed though one always has to wonder how the rich and powerful became so in the first place eco shook his finger at me now papa youve already bent your own rulemixing facts with innuendo facts only i conceded or at least anything not a fact must be clearly identified as hearsay i amended realizing that it might otherwise be impossible to talk about clodia and clodius at all well then eco continued to begin with theres the spelling of their name the patrician form is claudius and their father was appius claudius but clodius and all three of his sisters changed their spelling of the family name to the more common form some years ago with an o not the poshsounding au that must have been when clodius decided to cast his lot as a populist politician and a rabblerouser i suppose it helps to give him the common touch when hes consorting with his hired strongarmers and brick throwers or canvassing for votes among those who live off the grain dole he established yes but what advantage does it give to clodia i wondered from your description of the goingson at her horti this afternoon id imagine she craves the common touch as well gossip i confess eco hurriedly added as i raised a finger another fact then i said theyre not fullblooded siblings i thought they were no clodia is the eldest of the lot and she had a different mother from the rest her mother died giving birth to her i believe soon after appius claudius married his second wife and sired three boys and two more girls the youngest of the boys being publius claudius now clodius clodius must be about your age eco thirtyfive or so and clodia is about five years older than him theyre only half siblings then eco said so any copulation conjectural or otherwisewould be only half incest i suppose not that such a distinction would matter to anyone this side of egypt i said actuallymore gossipone hears that clodius has been the lover of all three of his sisters the two fullblooded younger ones as well as his big sister clodia just as one hears that clodius was groomed as a catamite by his older brothers when he was a boy to sell his sexual favors to wealthy rakes but i thought clodius and his family were wealthy to begin with fabulously wealthy by our standards eco but not by those of their peers during the civil wars when clodia and clodius were children their father appius was on the side of sulla when sullas fortunes ebbed appius had to flee rome for several years his children had to fend for themselves in a city full of enemies clodia the oldest was barely into her teens it cant have been easy for those children those were hard years for everyone this was something i hardly needed to tell eco it was in those years of chaotic civil strife that his own father had died and his mother had been reduced to such poverty that she eventually abandoned him to fend for himself in the streets until i took him into my home and adopted him when sulla eventually triumphed and became dictator appius claudius returned and for a short while thrived he was elected consul in the year that sulla retired then he took his reward a provincial governorshipof macedonia i thinkwhere he could bleed the locals for taxes collect tribute from their chieftains and thus provide his sons back home with silver to start their political careers and his daughters with dowries so it goes for a roman with a successful political career but not in the case of appius claudius he died in macedonia the taxes and tributes were collected by his successor and the only thing the children of appius claudius got back from macedonia were the ashes of their father they must have gone through a bad patch after that they were never so poor that they dropped from sight but one can imagine them scrimping and cutting corners to keep up appearances the kind of petty humiliations that privileged patricians find so galling and without a father in the house the children must have made their own rules did young clodius and his sisters carry on like rutting sheep without a shepherd to separate them i dont know but growing up in a turbulent often hostile city with their father absent for years at a time and then losing him while they were still quite young must have brought the siblings close togetherperhaps uncommonly or even unnaturally close and while i seriously doubt that young clodius was ever a prostitute in the strictly commercial sensethat kind of talk reeks of slandergiven the circumstances its not hard to imagine him using whatever attributes he possessed to curry favor with those who could help him and his brothers get ahead its also not hard to imagine that there were those who found him desirable even now clodius still has the look of a boysleeklimbed slenderhipped broadchested smooth skin a face like his sisters yes i was forgetting that youve just seen him naked said eco raising his eyebrows i ignored his teasing the third name attached to their branch of the claudian line is pulcher you knowbeautiful clodiuss full name is publius clodius pulcher and his sister is clodia pulcher i dont know how far back the name goes or which of their ancestors was vain enough to add it but it certainly fits the current generation pulcher indeed and yes i speak advisedly having just seen both of them naked or near enoughfact not gossip you know i can well imagine that there are those having seen the two of them together who rather like to picture clodia and clodius making love whether its true or not papa your eyes are glazing over they most certainly are not but never mind all that everyone knows that the clodii are goodlooking and everyone suspects that they both have far too much sex for anyones good what else do we know about them i think the first time that i ever heard of clodius was when he acted as a prosecutor in the trials of the vestal virgins ah yes when he accused catilina of seducing the vestal fabia but when both catilina and the vestal were acquitted things got so hot for clodius in rome that he had to flee down to baiae until the furor cooled down he burned his fingers on that one i dont suppose he was even twenty at the time i could never make out what his object was except to stir up trouble perhaps he wasnt quite sure himself just testing his powers the next thing i remember about him happened a few years later said eco something about stirring up that mutiny among the troops ah yes when he went off to serve in the east as a lieutenant under his brotherinlaw lucullus clodius styled himself as the soldiers champion they were already dissatisfied with the way lucullus was driving them from campaign to campaign with no end in sight and no sure prospect of a reward while pompeys troops were already receiving farms and settlements for fewer years of service clodius made a famous speech to the troops saying they deserved more from their general than the chance to lay down their lives protecting his personal caravan of camels laden with gold if we must never have an end to fighting shouldnt we reserve whats left of our bodies and souls for a commander who will reckon his chief glory to be the wealth of his soldiers papa what a head youve always had for remembering speeches even those youve heard only secondhand such a memory is as much a curse as a blessing eco anyway you can see that clodius was a rabblerouser even then making himself the advocate of the masses against their rulers setting himself up in opposition to the status quo no wonder he switched to the plebeian form of his name and then more scandal said eco the affair of the good god dess yes was it only six years ago ironic that the man who started out by prosecuting a vestal virgin and her alleged lover should have gotten himself into such a sacrilegious scandal the hearsaygossip not factwas that clodius was carrying on with caesars wife pompeia but caesar had caught on and set his mother to watch pompeia like a hawk so that it became impossible for the lovers to meet never one to let his appetites be denied clodius concocted a scheme to reach pompeia he decided to sneak into the womens festival of the good goddess fauna which was being held that year in caesars house no men allowed of course how could clodius get in by dressing up as a woman imagine him all fancied up as a singing girl in a saffron robe with purple hose and slippersi wonder if his sisters helped dress him up perhaps it wasnt his first time in a stola said eco i suppose he couldnt resist the idea of taking pompeia in caesars own bed with caesars own mother and scores of other women chanting and lighting incense in the next room i wonder if clodius planned to keep his stola on while he did it papa i object youre letting your lurid imagination seduce you into accepting hearsay and then compounding the slander granted eco i shall try to get back to the facts the story goes that clodius almost pulled it off in the haze of the incense and the confusion of the chanting and dancingwho knows what sort of rituals these women engage in behind closed doorsclodius managed to make his way into the house and to find one of pompeias slave girls who was expecting him she went to fetch her mistress but when she failed to return clodius became impatient and started wandering through the house on his own staying out of the light as much as he could observing the proceedings wouldnt you love to know what he saw wouldnt every man eco but it was clodiuss bad fortune to be spotted by another serving girl who saw his hesitant manner and innocently asked him who he was looking for he told her he was looking for pompeias serving girl but he was unable to disguise his deep voice the girl let out a shriek clodius managed to hide in a storage room but the women lit torches and searched the house until they rooted him out and drove him into the street well said eco wryly if nothing else clodius disproved the old superstition we all learned as boys that any man who witnesses the secret ceremonies of the good goddess will be instantly struck blind clodius could still see granted but he might have wished to be struck deaf so as not to hear the clamor he set off the women went home and told their husbands and you know how men are with gossip by the next morning the scandal was the talk of every tavern and street comer in rome the pious were outraged the impious were amused and i have no doubt that some from both camps were more than a little envious the matter was much talked about for a season and then put aside for months until some of clodiuss enemies decided to bring him to trial for sacrilege at the trial clodius claimed that he was innocent and that the women were mistaken because during the festival of the good goddess he had been fifty miles from rome clodius and cicero were still on friendly terms back then and when the prosecution called cicero to testify clodius expected him to back up his alibi instead cicero dutifully affirmed that he had seen clodius in rome on the day in question clodius was infuriated that was the beginning of the bad blood between them but clodius was acquitted nonetheless said eco yes by a slim majority of the fiftyodd jurors some say there was outright bribery by both sides others say that the jurors simply voted along political lines at any rate clodius was vindicated and emerged stronger than ever he became bolder about using the street gangs he had been organizing to swell his retinue and intimidate his enemies as for caesar the cuckolded husband his only response was to divorce pompeia even though he publicly insisted that nothing untoward had occurred between her and clodius when the paradox was pointed out to himwhy divorce pompeia if she had been faithfulhe said i have no doubt whatsoever about her fidelity but caesars wife cannot be tainted even by suspicion well caesar cant have been too offended by clodius the two of them have turned out to be close allies as demonstrated by the way caesar helped clodius get his tribunate exactly clodius wanted to be elected tribune but was barred from doing so since its a strictly plebeian office offlimits to patricians what was clodiuss solution with caesar pushing the paperwork he managed to get himself adopted by a plebeian almost young enough to be his son and so got himself officially enrolled as a plebeianwhich outraged his fellow patricians and delighted the mob who elected him tribune at last clodius was a commoner in fact as well as in name i see a pattern said eco if a man cant witness the rites of the good goddess clodius will make himself a woman if a patrician cant run for tribune then clodius who has the most patrician pedigree in rome will make himself a plebeian not a man to let himself be stymied by technicalities i agreed during his year as tribune he managed to get a lot doneintroducing a grain dole to please the mob arranging for the roman takeover of egyptian cyprus to pay for the dole and passing a law to send cicero into exile eco nodded but now cicero is back in rome and clodiuss ally caesar is off conquering gaul the big political issue of the moment is the egyptian crisis which brings us up to dios illfated mission if we believe clodia clodius made himself a friend of poor dio before he was killedand now they want you to find evidence against clodias lover marcus caelius to convict him of the murder an admirable summing up i said i think weve managed to sort out a few truths from the slanders and come up with a few conclusions about clodiuss character though im not sure where it all leaves us i havent changed my mind in the past ive worked for men whose means and morals were at least as questionable as his i see no point in refusing a commission from clodius if it leads me to the truth of dios murder what about clodia then what about her all right lets take a look at clodia the same rules truth only except for gossip identified as gossipthough i think the rule will be even harder to observe with clodia than with clodius i think weve probably heard more about her and know less but ill begin she was the first child of appius claudius raised by a stepmother among younger half siblingsdid this circumstance make her stronger more responsible more independent mere speculation we do know that she married young before her father died and left the family in financial straits so she managed to bring a good dowry to her marriage with a cousin quintus metellus celerwhich may help to explain her independence when it came to butting heads with her husband over family squabbles and political differences in any dispute even with celer she appears always to have sided with her siblings the clodii against the world said eco it sounds admirably roman when you put it like that could all those rumors of incest merely reflect the jealousy of less beautiful less beloved outsiders why not give clodia the benefit of the doubt and put down the rumors of her adulteries and incest to malicious tongues youre the one who spent the afternoon at her horti papa watching her ogle naked men yes well its true that she doesnt do much to stamp out the lies about her if they are lies and theres no doubt that her marriage to celer was stormy there are plenty of witnesses to that including cicero who used to be their frequent houseguest back when he was on friendly terms with the clodii but it should count for something that despite their troubles clodia and celer did stay married for twenty years until celer mysteriously died three years ago yes well weve already talked about the rumor that she poisoned him its worth noting that no one ever brought charges against her as someone in celers family might well have done had there been any evidence any time anybody notable in rome dies of anything but an accident theres someone wholl say it was poison just as there are those who will always whisper that any exceptionally beautiful womanor man for that matteris a whore while weve both heard plenty of rumors when it comes down to it we dont really know very much at all about clodia do we eco leaned back and pressed his fingers together i think papa that you are letting the transparent yellow gown cloud your better judgment nonsense it covers your eyes like a veil eco im serious papa you told me to be honest with you so i will be i think that clodia is probably a very dangerous woman and i dont like it that youre working for her if you must do so for dios sake then i hope youll see as little of her as possible ive already seen quite a bit of her i mean what i say papa there was no levity in his voice i dont like it nor do i but some paths a man must walk taking whatever ways are opened to him by the gods well said eco with an edge in his voice i suppose a religious argument can put an end to any discussion and if it didnt then what happened next did for at that moment two tiny human missiles came hurtling through the room like fireballs hurled from a catapult one chased the other at such a speed that i couldnt tell which was the pursuer and which the pursued i often found it hard to tell the twins apart even when they were standing still at the age of four there was not much to distinguish them gordiana whom meto had called titania from birth because she was so big was perhaps slightly larger than her brother titus but the two of them were dressed for bed in identical longsleeved tunics that went down to their ankles and they had the same long golden locksa legacy from their mothers side of the family which was perhaps why menenia had so far refused to clip a single curl never slowing down the two of them tore across the study and disappeared into the next room a moment later their mother followed after them she seemed quite calm and was even smiling are you men finally finished with your serious discussion she asked menenia comes from a very old plebeian family as respectable as it is obscure some of her ancestors managed to obtain the consulship hundreds of years ago that will always count for something but it hardly puts food on the table still eco was lucky to make the match considering his adopted fathers far less distinguished ancestry and menenia herself is above reproach in every way the model of a roman matron she even knows how to handle her motherinlaw with effortless tact i only wish that i could do as well at staying on bethesdas good side yes wife said eco i believe were done with discussing life and death and justice and the gods and other such trivial matters good then perhaps you both have a moment to spare for your offspring the only reason the twins have been flying about in such a frenzy is because they refuse to go to bed without a last chance to say goodnight to their grandfather well then make them wait no longer i said laughing and before i had a chance to brace myself out of nowhere two fairhaired fireballs came hurtling straight toward my lap the hour had grown late bethesda would be expecting me home i said a quick farewell to eco and menenia and finally extricated myself from the surprisingly strong grips of titus and titaniano easy task for each took hold of one of my hands and refused to let go when i yelled for belbo to come help me i was hardly joking belbo and i made our way down the esquiline hill beneath the light of the waxing moon back through the subura where the streets were busy even at this hour and across the forum where the temples were quiet and the broad moonlit squares almost deserted above our heads the cold sky was full of stars as we passed the house of the vestals i shivered and pulled my cloak more tightly about my throat thinking it was the night air seeping into my bones just beyond the house of the vestals near the steps of the temple of castor we turned sharply to the north onto the broad footpath called the ramp the best shortcut from the forum up the steep face of the palatine hill to the residential district the ramp is well traveled but even in daylight it can seem secluded and secretive hemmed in at its lower portion by the stony base of the palatine and the high rear walls of the house of the vestals and shielded along both sides of its upper course by closeset rows of cypress trees at night the ramp is a place of deep shadows even when the moon is full the perfect place for a murder bethesda had once exclaimed before turning around in midcourse and refusing ever to take the path again i felt another sudden chill and knew that it had nothing to do with the night air we were being followed on the path and not by chance but stealthily for when i signaled belbo to stop i heard behind us the faint sound of footsteps that stopped a moment later i turned and peered down the mostly straight path but could make out no movement among the dense shadows one man or two i whispered to belbo he wrinkled his brow one i think master i agree the footsteps stop all at once without any shuffling or whispering do you suppose the two of us have anything to fear from one man belbo belbo peered at me thoughtfully a bit of moonlight illuminated his furrowed brow not unless he has a friend waiting at the top of the path master that would make it even odds and what if he has more than one friend up there do you want to turn around master i peered into the darkness below then into the shadows ahead no were almost home belbo shrugged some men have to go all the way to gaul to die others can do it on their own doorstep just keep your hand on the dagger inside your tunic and ill do the same keep to a steady pace as we neared the top of the path i realized what a perfect place of ambush it would provide once upon a time i could take the steep path without missing a breath but not any longer a winded man makes an easy target even belbo was breathing harder i listened for the steps behind us or for any sound from ahead but i heard only the beating of my heart and the rush of air in my nostrils as we neared the top of the ramp the cypress trees thinned on either side and the way opened up dispersing the shadows with moonlight and allowing glimpses of the houses up ahead i could even see a bit of the roof of my own house which made me feel at once reassured and uneasy reassured to be so close to safety uneasy because the gods sometimes resort to the most appalling ironies in discharging the fates of mortals we were almost clear of the path but there were still plenty of shadows where any number of assassins could be concealed i steeled myself and peered into the pockets of darkness at last we stepped from the ramp onto the paved street only a few doors from my house the way was clear on either side the street was deserted and quiet from an upper story nearby i heard the quiet singing of a woman crooning a lullaby all was tranquil perhaps we should play ambushers i whispered to belbo after i caught my breath for now i could hear the sound of our followers footsteps approaching if someone is after us i should like to have a look at him we drew back into the shadows and waited the footsteps grew nearer until at any moment the man would catch up with us and emerge into the moonlight beside me belbo gasped i stiffened wondering what was the matter then belbo sneezed it was only a partial sneeze for he did his best to stifle it but in the stillness it might as well have been a thunderclap the footsteps stopped i peered into the darkness and was able to discern the mans vague outline a silhouette among mottled shadows from his posture he seemed to be peering back at me trying to make out where the sneeze had come from an instant later he vanished and i heard footsteps running down the ramp belbo gave a jerk shall we go after him master no hes younger than usprobably a lot faster how do you know did you hear him breathing hard no exactly neither did i and he was close enough that we would have heard had he been winded he has strong lungs belbo hung his head chagrined master im sorry i sneezed some things even the gods cant stop perhaps it was for the best do you really think he was following us i dont know but he gave us a scare didnt he and we gave him a scare so perhaps were even and thats the end of it i said but i felt uneasy we walked hurriedly up the street to my house belbo rapped on the door while we waited for the slave to open it i pulled him aside belbo whether we were followed or notdont mention this to your mistress no need asking for trouble do you understand of course master he said gravely i thought for a moment and dont tell diana either that goes without saying master belbo smiled then his jaw suddenly began to quiver and his face contorted i gripped his shoulder alarmed belbo threw back his head and sneezed again chapter twelve the next morning i rose early ate a frugal breakfast of honey and bread offered my beard to belbo for a trim i trust no one else to use anything sharp near my neck donned my toga since i intended to pay some formal visits and stepped out of the house the fresh dewy air was bracing the lingering chill of the night was tempered by the mornings warm sunshine i filled my lungs with a deep breath and headed up the street with belbo beside me the palatine seemed to me particularly lovely that morning of late whenever i left the immediate vicinity of my house i had been struck by how dirty and grubby so much of rome had begun to seem especially the subura with its brothels and taverns and foulsmelling little side streets and the forum with its togaclad hordes of politicians and financiers going about their frenzied business how much more pleasant the palatine was with its shaded wellpaved streets its quaint little shops orderly apartments and handsome houses one could breathe in such a neighborhood and walk even in the busiest part of the day without knocking elbows with a hundred rude shoving strangers i had gotten used to living in a rich mans neighborhood i realized and the adjustment had not been difficult at all what would my father say who had lived all his life in the subura probably i thought he would be proud of his sons material success however unconventionally i had acquired it he would also probably remind me that i should keep my wits about me and never be deceived by appearances the rare and beautiful things that wealth and power can buy are often only decorations to conceal the way that such wealth and power were attained yes a man can breathe freely on the airy spacious palatineand a man can also stop breathing something more awful than knocking elbows with strangers had happened to dio the quality of a mans bedsheets counts for nothing if his sleep is forever the way to the house of lucius lucceius took us past the apartment building from which marcus caelius had recently been evicted as we passed i paused to take a look not only was the upper story deserted but a sign had been painted in handsome black letters on the corner of the building for sale by owner publius clodius pulcher beneath this was a drawing of some sort i stepped across the street for a closer look and saw that it was a crudely rendered graffito showing a man and woman entangled in sexual intercourse at first glance it struck me that their positions were absurdly acrobatic on closer examination i decided that they were physically impossible running from the womans gaping mouth was a scrawled caption with almost all the words misspelled theres nothing like a brothers love the artist was too poor a draftsman to have captured any recognizable features but i had no doubt whom the copulating figures were meant to represent the graffito had probably been left by one of milos rabble i thought though clodius and his sister had plenty of other enemies considering the misspellings the vandalism could hardly be attributed to marcus caelius or could it caelius was wickedly clever enough to deliberately disguise his handiwork as that of a lesser intellect belbo and i moved on after numerous twistings and turnings down smaller side streets we reached the house of lucius lucceius as befitted the domicile of a wealthy and respected senior senator it presented an irreproachable facade the only ornamentation was the massive wooden door which looked very old and was carved with elaborate swirls and bound with massive iron clasps that had the savage look of the finest carthaginian handiwork it was not unlikely that the door had been brought back from the sack of carthage itself i have seen many such trophies in the homes of those whose families conquered romes rivals belbo unawed by its history or design and seeing only a door knocked upon it it was quickly answered by the door slave with whom belbo exchanged the requisite formalities a moment later i was admitted into the foyer and then into a sparsely furnished study the walls were decorated with carthaginian war trophiesspears swords pieces of armor and even a pair of elephant tusks the whitehaired master of the house sat before a table littered with scrolls styluses wax writing tablets and bits of parchment i can allow you only a moment he said without looking up i know who you are of course and i can guess what youre doing here theres the chair sit down at last he put down the scroll over which he had been poring and squinted at me yes i remember your face first time i saw it was when cicero pointed you out to me in the forum must have been fifteen years ago during the trials of the vestal virgins damned catilina corrupting a vestal and getting away with it it was i who prosecuted him for murder you know the year before he staged his little uprising didnt win that case did i probably would have been better for everyone concerned if i had catilina includedhe could be off somewhere enjoying his exile right now buggering all the pretty boys in massilia or wherever by hercules you look fit id have thought youd gotten as old as me by now with that lucius lucceius smiled broadly and pushed himself from the table he was a remarkably ugly man with great bristling eyebrows and an unkempt mane of white hair he leaned back and rubbed his eyes need a break anyway working on my history of the carthaginian wars greatgreatgreatgrandfather helped scipio africanus put an end to hannibal left the family a pile of scrolls nobodys read in years fascinating stuff when ive finished writing it ill browbeat all the friends and family into buying copies they wont bother to read it but the work keeps me busy gordianus gordianus he mused staring at me and wrinkling his brow thought you were retired not even living in rome anymore seems somebody told me youd left it all for a farm in sicily etruria actually but that was a while ago ive been back in rome for several years now still retired yes and no i take on simple cases now and then just to keep myself busy rather like you writing your history i imagine from the flash in his squinting eyes i saw that lucceius took his role as historian more seriously than his selfdeprecation indicated so he said curtly cicero has sent you around to collect my statement afraid its not ready i stared at him blankly well so much else to do he said that is why youre here isnt it this business about young marcus caelius being brought to trial by those rascals claiming he tried to do in dio yes i said slowly that is why im here surprised mewell surprised everybody i imaginewhen i heard that cicero was going to handle the boys defense thought those two had fallen out for good but there you have it things get dicey and the naughty schoolboy goes running back to his tutor rather touching really yes it is i said quietly was it really possible that cicero had taken on caeliuss defense the news was startling but made perfect sense cicero had successfully defended asicius probably to please pompey pompey would be pleased to see caelius acquitted as well and cicero was the man to do it as for the feud between caelius and cicero the same pragmatism that can make friends into enemies in the blink of an eye can do the reverse as well so your statement for cicero isnt ready yet i said no come back tomorrow actually surprised he sent you to fetch it instead of that secretary of his the one who picks over all the tiny details tiro thats the one clever slave yes well i suspect tiro will be the one who comes to collect your statement eventually but as long as im here perhaps i could ask you a few questions go on about dio he waved his hand it will all be in the statement still perhaps it could save us all some timeyou me tiro ciceroif you could give me an idea of what exactly will be in the statement just what i told cicero dio was my houseguest for a while and then moved on as simple as that all this nonsense about poisoning nasty rumors spread like olive oil and leave a stain like red wine but there was a death in this house wasnt there dios slave his taster worthless slave died of natural causes and thats the end of it then why did dio move on to the house of titus coponius because dio was frightened by his own shadow saw a stick on the ground swore it was a snake lucceius snorted dio was as safe here as a virgin in the house of the galli thats the beginning and end of it and yet dio believed that someone in this house tried to poison him dio had no damned sense look what happened to him at coponiuss house then tell me where he was safer i see your point you were good friends then you and dio of course what do you think id ask an enemy to sleep under my roof hed sit here during the day where youre sitting now and wed talk about aristotle or alexandria or carthage in the days of hannibal gave me some good ideas for my history lucceius looked aside and bit his lip wasnt a bad fellow sorry to see him go of course he did have some nasty habits he smiled grimly picking the fruit before its ripe and all that what do you mean never mind no point gossiping about the dead picking the fruit liked them young one of those nothing wrong in that except a man should keep his hands off what belongs to his host ill say no more from his face i could see that he meant it you said that dios slave died of natural causes what killed him how should i know but a death in the house the death of a slave and another mans slave at that surely someone noted the symptoms what do you think i summon a fancy greek physician every time a slave has a stomach ache slaves take ill every day and sometimes they die then you cant be sure that it wasnt poison dio thought so dio thought lots of things had quite an imaginationmade a better philosopher than historian still if someone in the household could tell me exactly how the slave died what he complained of before the end i was stopped by the look on lucceiuss face he stared at me for a long moment his bushy eyebrows gathered above his squinting eyes who sent you here id rather not say wasnt cicero was it i come as a friend of dios meaning that i wasnt get out my only interest is discovering the truth about dios death if you were truly his friend get out well go on up out lucius lucceius picked up a stylus and waved it like a dagger glowering at me as i stood and walked to the door i left him bent over his scrolls muttering angrily to himself the slave who had shown me in was waiting in the hallway to show me out but before we reached the foyer a formidably large woman stepped into the hallway and blocked our path go on cleon she said to the slave ill show the visitor out myself from the tone of her voice she was clearly the mistress of the house and from the slaves obsequious manner as he backed away i gathered she was not the sort of roman matron who allowed her slaves much latitude lucceiuss wife was as ugly as her husband though she looked nothing like him instead of bristling eyebrows she had only two lines painted above her eyes her hair might have been as white as his had it not been dyed red with henna she wore a voluminous green stola and a necklace of green glass with matching earrings so youre gordianus the finder she said abruptly appraising me with a caustic gaze i heard the slave announce you to my husband what else did you hear i said she appreciated my bluntness everything you and i should talk i looked over my shoulder dont worry she said no one eavesdrops on me in this house they know better come this way i followed her into another wing of the house i might as well have entered another world where lucceiuss study had been an austere museum of war trophies and musty documents his wifes quarters were flamboyantly decorated with intricately embroidered hangings and precious objects of metal and glass one long wall was painted to show a spring garden in bloom all pale greens and soft pinks and yellows you deceived my husband she said wryly he thought i came from cicero i didnt contradict him so you merely let him believe what he wanted to believe yes thats the best way to handle lucius he wasnt intentionally lying to you you know hes convinced himself that nothing untoward took place in this house lucius has a hard time dealing with the truth like most men most of the time she said under her breath she walked about the room picking things up and putting them down please go on i said appearances matter more than facts to lucius to have had a houseguest poisoned under his roof or even a houseguests slave is thinkable to him so it simply never happened you see lucius will never ever admit otherwise but such a thing did happen she stepped to a small table covered with a number of identical clay figurines they were about the size of a childs fist and brightly painted she picked one of them up and idly turned it over in her hand who sent you here asking questions as i told your husband a friend of dios she snorted never mind i can guess who sent you can you clodia am i right dont bother to answer i can read your face as easily as i can read luciuss how could you possibly guess who hired me she shrugged and twirled the little clay figurine between her forefinger and thumb it was a votive statue of attis the eunuch consort of the great mother cybele standing with his hands on his plump belly and wearing his red phrygian cap with its rounded forwardsloping peak we have ways of sharing what we know we we women i felt a prickling sensation in my spine a sense of having had the same conversation beforewith bethesda when she told me that clodia and caelius were no longer lovers and i asked her how she could possibly know such a thing we have ways of sharing what we know for an instant i had a glimmer of insight as if a door had been opened just enough to let me catch a glimpse of an unfamiliar room then she started to talk again and the door was shut theres no doubt that dios slave was poisoned you should have seen the poor wretch if lucius had kept his eyes open instead of looking away when the man was dying he might have a harder time making that glib pronouncement about natural causes but then lucius has always been squeamish he can write his little accounts of women being spitted on stakes and children being chopped into pieces at the fall of carthage but he cant stomach watching a slave throw up was that one of the symptoms yes the man turned as white as marble and went into convulsions but if the slave was poisoned by tasting food intended for dio how did the poison get into the food it was put there by some of the kitchen slaves of course i think i know which ones yes juba and laco those two fellows were always up to something too smart for their own good had fantasies of buying their freedom some day juba must have sneaked out of the house that afternoon because i caught him sneaking back in and when i questioned him he tried to get out of it by playing stupid and spouting a lot of doubletalk the way slaves do he said hed gone to the market to fetch something i dont remember what and even held up a little bag to show me what nerve it was probably the poison later i caught him whispering to laco in the kitchen and i wondered what they were up to theyre the ones who prepared the dish that killed dios slave dio told me your husband had a visitor that day publius asicius hes the one who was later accused of stabbing dio at coponiuss house though they couldnt prove it at the trial yes he came by to visit lucius at just about the time juba must have been sneaking out but i dont think asicius delivered the poison if thats what you think he didnt go near the kitchen slaves but he could have been here as a distraction to keep your husband busy while juba sneaked out of the house to get the poison from someone else what an imagination you have she said wryly where is juba now would you let me speak to him i would if i could but hes gone juba and laco are both gone gone where after his taster died dio was quite upset he screamed and ranted and demanded that lucius determine which of the slaves had tried to poison him i pointed out the suspicious behavior of juba and laco but lucius wouldnt hear of any suggestion that there was poison involved even so a few days later he decided that juba and lacotrained kitchen slaveswould be of more use doing manual labor in a mine lucius owns an interest in a silver mine up in picenum so off the slaves went out of reach out of mind she held up the clay figurine of attis and stroked it with her forefinger but this is the most curious fact when lucius made his pronouncement about sending juba and laco to picenum they suddenly offered to buy their freedom somehow from the few coppers lucius gave them every year to celebrate the saturnalia the two ofthem had managed to save up their own worth in silver was that possible absolutely not lucius accused them of pilfering from the household coffers could they have done that do you think im the sort of woman whose slaves could steal from her she gave me a look calculated to make a slave soil himself but that was the explanation lucius decided on and nothing will ever sway him from it he took the silver away from them sent them off to an early death in the mines and that was the end of it where do you think the slaves obtained the silver dont be coy she said someone bribed them to poison dio of course probably they received only partial payment since they didnt finish the job if i were the master of this house id have tortured them until the truth came out but the slaves belong to lucius the slaves know the truth the slaves know something but theyre far away from rome now and they cant be compelled to testify anyway without their masters consent which lucius will never give who gave them the silver i muttered how can anyone find out i suppose thats your job she said bluntly she walked back to the little table and replaced the clay figurine of attis i drew alongside her and studied the tiny statues why so many all alike i asked because of the great mother festival of course these are images of attis her consort for giftgiving i never heard of such a custom we exchange them among ourselves we it has nothing to do with you i reached to pick up one of the figurines but she seized my wrist with a startlingly strong grip it has nothing to do with you i said after a moment she released me then clapped her hands a girl came running now you had better go the slave will show you out chapter thirteen the easiest route to the house of titus coponius where dio had died took me back the way i had come passing the former residence of marcus caelius again i noticed that the for sale announcement was untouched but the obscene graffito beneath it had already been daubed over with paint clodiuss henchmen could be accused of many things but not idleness titus coponius saw me at once and soon i was seated in his study with a cup of wine in my hand if the study of lucius lucceius was a hoary homage to the conquest of carthage the study of titus coponius was a tribute to the enduring triumph of greek culture blackonred drinking cups too ancient and precious for use were displayed on shelves small statues of the great heroes and busts of the great thinkers were displayed on pedestals against the walls a pigeonhole scroll case was full of cylindrical leather slipcases and on the little colored tags hanging from each cylinder i glimpsed the names of the old greek playwrights and historians the room itself was impeccably appointed with highbacked greek chairs and a greek carpet with a geometrical design all harmoniously in proportion to the space they occupied coponius was a tall man with a long rectangular face and a handsome nose even seated he had an imposing air his hair was clipped short and was very curly black on top but gray on the sides his clothing and manner were as elegant as the room in which we sat i suppose youve come about dio he began what makes you think so come now gordianus i know you by reputation i also know that bestias son has brought charges against marcus caelius for trying to poison dio among other things it hardly takes a philosopher to figure out your reason for coming to the house where dio died what i dont know is who sent youbestias boy for the prosecution or caelius for his defense neither actually now thats a puzzle not to everyone apparently i said thinking of lucceiuss wife does it matter who sent me so long as i seek the truth most men have some ulterior motive even in seeking for truth revenge vindication power justice for dio coponius put down his wine cup and folded his long elegant hands in his lap some day when we both have a great deal more time we should discuss that word justice and see if we can come up with a mutually acceptable definition for the short term i assume you mean you seek the truth in order to identify dios killer a straightforward enough ambitionbut i dont think i can help you why not i cant tell you what i dont know perhaps you know more than you realize a conundrum gordianus life is full of them coponius contemplated me with a catlike gaze as i understand it the charges against caelius involve attacks on the egyptian entourage on its way to rome and an alleged attempt to poison dio at lucceiuss house what happened in this house isnt even cited in the formal list of charges technically it is but the prosecution intends to concentrate on the attempted poisoning and use the actual murder of dio as a corroborative detail then you do come from the prosecution coponius gave me a brittle smile dont misunderstand i dont mind you coming around asking questions i went through all this before when asicius was prosecuted i shared all i know with both sides and in the end i helped neither the simple fact is that the killers left nothing behind to give themselves away asicius was prosecuted on hearsay not evidence yes everyone knows that he was somehow involved just as everyone knows that king ptolemy must be at the back of it but the proof was never put forward and you wont find it in this house still i should like to know what happened here coponius took a sip of wine and turned his catlike gaze on me again i knew dio in alexandria he finally said a few years ago my brother and i spent some time there gaius always the practical one was interested in studying the financial workings of the grain markets i found myself drawn instead to the steps of the library at the temple of serapis where philosophers discussed the very things were talking abouttruth justice conundrums that was how i met dio that was how i met him as well i said coponius raised an eyebrow you knew dio in alexandria briefly and long ago i was quite young my instruction from dio was strictly informal coponius understood at once ah you were one of those young men too poor to afford an education who linger on the steps hoping to catch the eye of one of the philosophers mendicants for wisdom dio called such young men something like that there is no shame attached to such begging the more one must struggle for wisdom the more honor attaches to its attainment my relationship with dio was more formal than yours i imagine by the time i met him he had been elevated to the highest ranks of the academy and seldom appeared on the steps of the library it was only by chance that i happened to meet him there i invited him to dine on several occasions with gaius and myself at the house we had rented in the imperial district dio knew all the greek thinkers by heart he could discourse for hours on the laws of perception and rational thought gaius would yawn and go to bed early but i would stay up until dawn listening your brother doesnt care for philosophy coponius smiled not particularly but gaius and dio managed to find common interests i was the one left out when the two of them went looking for adventure in the rhakotis district he raised a suggestive eyebrow dio never struck me as particularly adventurous then you didnt know him as i did and certainly not as gaius did what do you mean dio was considerably older than my brother and me but he still had appetites rather strong appetites actually he enjoyed showing gaius what he called the secrets of alexandria picking the fruit before its ripe i said to myself what something that someone else said about dio ripeness is a matter of taste with dio it was more a question of bruising the fruit i would say i dont understand coponius fixed me again with his feline gaze there are those who would say that dios particular appetites were a flaw in his character a sign of some imbalance in his humors i myself have never been a slave to the flesh my life is of the mind and this seems to me ideal given my temperament im often tempted to pass judgment on other mens weaknesses but for friends i forgo such judgments we must remember that while dios blood was greek his spirit was egyptian these people are more worldly than we are earthier in many ways cruder and more primitive they make greater allowance for things we might consider out of bounds on the one hand dio was a paragon of logic and reason but on the other he could release himself into a state of ecstasy beyond reason if his pleasure sometimes depended on acts which you or i might consider to be cruel or excessive i dont understand coponius shrugged what does it matter the man is dead his teachings are his legacy along with his efforts on behalf of his countrymen few men can claim as fine a monument he stood and began to slowly pace running the palm of his hand over the tops of the busts that lined the wall but you came to talk about dios death not his life what is it you want to know gordianus i already know the bare facts of the murderwhat everyone knows as you say but water from the mouth of the spring is freshest i want to hear whatever you or anyone else in the household can tell me about the exact circumstances of that night let me think back he paused before a bust of alexander i was here in my study when dio came in that evening i had just finished eating my supper alone and had come here to do some reading i heard a couple of the slave girls tittering out in the hallway i called them in and asked them what they were laughing at they said that my houseguest had come in dressed as a woman hadnt he worn the same costume before apparently so slipping in and out of the house without my seeing him accompanied by that little gallus who was always visiting him dio behaved very secretively in this house he kept to his room with his door locked he wouldnt even join me for meals when he asked to stay with me i had hoped that the two of us would share some civilized conversation as we had in alexandria that we would dine together and discuss philosophy or politics i was rather disappointed at his aloofness and a little irritated he was a very frightened man yes i realized that which is why i stayed out of his way if he wished to hide in his room all day or slip in and out of the house without telling me i decided to say nothing i wish now that i had somehow taken steps to intervene though im not sure what i could have done dio was a hunted man you must have known he was in terrible danger of course thats why i kept a watchman posted inside the door every night even so i never imagined that anyone would actually break into this house and commit such an atrocity it seemed unthinkable would you show me where this unthinkable thing occurred coponius led me down a long hallway to the back of the house the watchman was posted in the foyer at the front of the house when the assassins broke into dios room he didnt hear it i myself was sleeping in the room next door and heard nothing did dio cry out no one heard him if he did would you have heard him i was sleeping as i said but i should think a scream would have awakened me the walls arent that thick on other nights i was able to hearwell never mind you were about to say something this is the room coponius pushed opened a door and gestured for me to enter it was a small room sparsely furnished with a sleeping couch a chair and a couple of small tables a carpet covered the floor metal hooks were mounted in the walls for hanging clothing and lamps how did the assassins get in i said through that window by the couch the shutters were drawn and latched im sure dio would have seen to that if only to shut out the cold the latch has been repaired but you can still see where the wood was splintered when the shutters were forced open was the old latch made of bronze like this one this is the very same latch hammered straight by a smith and reattached in a different place this seems to be a rather strong latch i should think that forcing it from the outside would have made some noise i suppose a considerable noise it couldnt have been that loud perhaps not a loud enough noise to awaken you in the next room or even to be heard by your watchman at the front door but surely loud enough for dio to hear if he was lying on this couch you might think so yes but as i told you no one heard dio cry out i suppose he was a very sound sleeper or perhaps the breaking of the latch didnt make as much noise as you seem to think we could argue the point forever i said or shall we make an empirical test do you mean if youll let me coponius shrugged go on i unlatched the window and stepped through it into the courtyard beyond which was surrounded by a high wall inside the room coponius latched the shutters i pushed on them testing their strength and realized it would take a considerable effort to force them open i looked around and spotted a loose stone clutching it in my fist i struck a hard blow against the shutters with a sound of splintering wood the shutters flew open and the metal latch went flying across the room and landed on the carpet i climbed through the window tell me was the broken latch found across the room like that lying on the floor why yes im sure of it i remember because when i came into this room i stepped on the latch and cut my bare foot then we can assume that the shutters were forced open with at least as much force on that night and must have made as much noise i would say that was noisy enough to wake anyone in this room yes coponius agreed fretfully tapping his forefinger against his lips and yet dio didnt cry out perhaps he was awakened from a deep sleep unable to comprehend or perhaps he comprehended only too well and was paralyzed with fright perhaps was his throat cut no all the wounds were in his chest how many wounds im not sure exactly quite a few there must have been a great deal of blood some blood yes a struggling man stabbed repeatedly in the chestthe room must have been covered with blood coponius wrinkled his brow when we came in the room it was very dark of course the slaves held lamps shadows swung all about i remember seeing bloodi dont know how much does it matter probably not you dont still have the sleeping tunic dio was wearing or the cushions he was sleeping on of course not they were burned i looked around the room imagining dio on the couch silent terrified being stabbed repeatedly in the chest somehow the image did not make sense your watchman finally did hear something and came to investigate yes would you let me speak to him of course coponius summoned the slave a sturdy young greek named philo who looked keen enough i asked him exactly what he had heard on the night that dio died a noise coming from this room what kind of noise a banging kind of noise not a scream or a moan no splintering wood cracked hinges no more like something being knocked onto the floor when we came in coponius interjected everything was in disarray the tables were upended the chair on its side the scrolls dio kept by his bedside were scattered about when you heard the banging noise i said to philo how quickly did you come right away i heard more noises while i was running down the hallway how did you know where the noises were coming from as i got closer i could tell that they were coming from inside this room so you tried to open the door the slave hesitated not right away because you were frightened no no i would have been it takes nerve to open a door with strange sounds coming from the other side especially in the middle of the night i wasnt scared excited in a way my heart beating fast but not scared then why didnt you try to open the door philo i called out dios name instead did he answer no there was another banging noise then you tried the door not right away what were you waiting for for them to finish philo said exasperated to finish killing dio of course not for dio to finish his business if thats what he was up to the slave made a face and looked away the master knows what i mean i looked at coponius who looked back at me blandly and pursed his lips philo means that such noises could have meant something besides danger danger to dio anyway said philo under his breath thats enough philo said coponius sharply get back to whatever you were doing the slave left us i turned to coponius these noises he sighed shortly after dio came to stay here hehow shall i say thishe appropriated one of my slaves for his own use i nodded the last slave he owned had died tasting his food thats not what i mean coponius shook his head he was a troubled man in great distress if ever a man needed something to take his mind off his problems it was dio there was a young serving girl who caught his eye he decided to make use of her for his pleasure he used her almost every night with your permission i was never asked actually it was presumptuous of dio to simply take what he wanted to be sure but under the circumstances i decided i would be a selfish host if i withheld the use of a slave from a guest especially since i had no plans to use the girl myself at least not in that way i see then philo thought he might simply be hearing the sounds of dio using the girl exactly all the bumping and thumpingsurely you heard it too eventually it woke me at first i made the same assumption that philo made at it again i thought i shut my eyes and tried to get back to sleep did dio always make so much noise not always what on earth would he do to the girl i hardly see how thats any of your business gordianus ive been indiscreet in telling you as much as i have may dios shade forgive me i begin to grow tired of this interview but eventually philo realized that something was terribly wrong i said pressing on yes when the bumps and knocks stopped things got a bit too quiet he called out dios name louder and louderi could hear him calling so dio should have been able to i could also hear him rattling dios door which was locked of course i got up then and told philo to fetch some others they brought torches and together managed to break down the door inside we found the shutters open the room a mess and dio dead on his couch and the slave girl she wasnt in the room at all as it turned out she was in the slaves sleeping quarters i walked to the window and peered out how did the assassins get onto the terrace in the first place it seems to be surrounded by a high wall they must have scaled it they couldnt have come in the front because of philo and the side walls were set flush against the houses on either side the wall enclosing the little courtyard out back runs along a little alley theres a gate in the wall but it was securely locked they had to have climbed over from the alley i nodded its a high walltoo high for a man to climb without help i should think do you want to test that as well coponius raised an eyebrow no i think we can assume that there were at least two assassins to help each other over the wall did your neighbors see anything none of my neighbors can see into the courtyard behind the house the alley is practically unused i doubt that anyone could have seen anything unless they happened to be standing on a rooftop which would have been unlikely on a chilly januarius night besides if anyone had seen something id have been told im on good terms with my neighbors they were all quite upset by the murder i walked about the room idly tapping my forefinger against the metal hooks set into the walls so the slave girl wasnt with dio when the murder occurred as i told you she was asleep in the slave quarters could i talk to her coponius shook his head not possible why not i sold her to a slave dealer here in the city was there something wrong with her coponius hesitated after the use dio made of her she was no longer suitable to serve in my house you dont mean she was crippled of course not oh a few strap marks and bruises perhaps but nothing that wouldnt fade with time possibly a scar or two but nothing that would show unless she was naked nevertheless she was damaged property it simply wouldnt do to keep her in the household much better to pass her on im sure some other master will find her suitableperhaps even find her value enhanced by the instruction dio gave her he shrugged i never intended for the girl to become a pleasure slave but it must have been the will of the fates or of dio my mouth was dry the subject is distasteful to me said coponius indeed this whole conversation has begun to tire me i should think that youve already found out more than you need to know more than i intended to anyway then perhaps you should be going here ill summon a slave to show you out he clapped his hands the slave who came running was philo coponius didnt notice having dismissed me his mood abruptly darkened he didnt even bid me farewell as he walked to the window and gazed out at the sunny courtyard idly fingering the newly broken latch with one hand in the foyer i put my hand on philos shoulder and drew him aside the slave girl we were talking aboutwhats her name zotica but shes not here anymore i know your master sold her to a dealer you wouldnt know which dealer would you the slave hesitated scrutinizing me he peered up the hallway and bit his lip the master sold her to a man down on the street of the scythemakers he finally said i dont know his name i nodded let me make sure i understand when you broke into his room and found him dead dio was alone zotica wasnt with him thats right what about earlier that night he looked at me and then peered up the hallway again oh all right why not tell you shes gone now anyway the poor child yes zotica was with dio earlier that night he came in wearing that ridiculous outfit dressed up in a stola if you can believe it and in a foul mood even fouler than usual he snapped his fingers at zotica and told her to come tend to him in his room to help him take off his makeup quipped one of the other serving girls no just to help him take off said one of the others they were always mean to zotica because she was the youngest and the prettiest but i think they were also glad that dio had settled on using her instead of them so dio went to his room and took the girl with him yes but later he must have sent her away why do you say that the rest of the household had gone to bed i was standing watch at the front door i heard something in the hallway and went to have a look it was zotica walking up the hall away from dios room she was naked clutching her gown and hiding her face in her hands sobbing clutching her gown why wasnt she wearing it why do you think i figured the old man had ripped it off of her and torn it too badly to wear i asked her what was wrong but she just shook her head and ran toward the slave quarters i figured hed finished with her early and been even rougher than usual how long was this before the noise you heard later when the assassins came oh quite a while before but when you heard those noises and went to investigate you told me you thought they might have been the sounds of dio and zotica he shrugged i thought she might have slipped back into his room but she hadnt when we were breaking down the door to dios room zotica was off in the slave quarters with the other girls theres no question about that she woke some of the slaves with her weeping when she came in then kept them awake with her sobbing even when they threatened to beat her theres no doubt that she was with the other slaves when dio was stabbed still i should dearly like to have a talk with her tell me when you broke into the room what exactly did you see philo was thoughtful chair and tables overturned window shutters open dio on the couch dead how did you know he was dead the look on his face philo turned pale remembering such a lookhis eyes and mouth wide open with a look of pure horror as if hed seen the face of cerberus himself pure horrorand yet you never heard him cry out never but to have such a look on his face he must have known he was under attack he must have felt the blows why did he not scream i dont know i only know i never heard him did you see the wounds very clearly i helped undress him later when the men from the necropolis came to take him away how many times was he stabbed six or seven times i think maybe more all in the chest close together how close he held up his palms side by side two hands could have covered the wounds but surely he thrashed about a frightened man startled from sleep horrified hes stabbed the first timesurely he cries out surely he thrashes and twists to avoid the next blow perhaps his arms were held down and his mouth was covered how many men would that take the room was a mess perhaps there was a whole gang of them milling around in there perhaps i suppose there was blood everywhere on the walls and carpet philo wrinkled his brow not really and the sleeping tunic he worethat must have been soaked with blood around the wounds yes but not philo i thought you were showing gordianus to the door coponius appeared at the far end of the hall he crossed his arms yes master there was something i forgot to ask him i said just a small detail farewell gordianus i took a deep breath farewell titus coponius belbo was waiting for me outside the front door sitting in a patch of warm sunshine together we took a silent walk through the streets of the palatine breathing in the smells of midday cooking listening to the noises that echoed up from the forum i walked merely to walk with no particular goal i needed to think i was beginning to discover a side to dio that i had never guessed at this disturbed me i had also begun to piece together the sequence of his final days and hours the gory drama of his death seemed forthright enough it only remained to determine who had broken into his room that fateful night yet i could not put aside a nagging feeling that something was very very wrong chapter fourteen the girl is important im not sure how but i cant help thinking so what girl said eco the slave girl zotica the one dio was important said eco but how if shed been in the room when the killers broke in shed be a witness though i doubt they would have left her alive unless of course she was in on their plan in which case theyd have had no need to break in the shuttersshed have let them in but then theyd have broken the shutters and killed her anyway to keep her from talking but all this takes away from what we know which is that the girl was not in the room when dio was killed still i had finally tired of walking and thinking and had gone home for something to eat to find that eco and his family had dropped by while the women and children visited in the garden at the heart of the house eco and i sat in the little atrium just off the foyer basking in a narrow shaft of warm sunlight i told him all i had learned that morning from my visits to lucceius and coponius its too bad that ciceros entered the picture said eco he shook his head imagine cicero taking on marcus caeliuss defense after the bad blood between them theres a lot at stake i said the charges are seriousserious enough to send even a brash fellow like caelius running back to his old teacher im sure cicero made him promise to be a good boy from now on and always support the status quo it must have been quite a coup for cicero bringing the errant sheep back into the fold and provided cicero gets him off the hook caelius will get a chance to betray his old mentor all over again observed eco i laughed exactly i suppose the two of them deserve each other still too bad its cicero for the defense even if you do find compelling evidence against caelius cicero will probably make it go up in a puff of smoke while he takes the judges down some completely irrelevant path to caeliuss acquittal yes i was thinking the same thing myself having worked for cicero we know just how thoroughly unscrupulous and damnably persuasive he can be its not much fun being on the opposing side eco closed his eyes and leaned back against a pillar letting the sun warm his face but the really bad news is about the slaves in lucceiuss kitchen being sent off to work the mines in picenum if lucceiuss wife is right those two are at the very heart of the matter if they were bribed to administer poison they must have some idea of who paid them or should at least be able to yield up a clue theyre the link in the chain the ones you need to go to next but there they are away up in picenum and no matter what they know it doesnt sound like lucceius would ever let them testify yes its frustrating but i suppose someone could trek up to picenum and try to get at them even if they cant testify they might lead us to someone who could eco half opened one eye and peered at me sidelong i have no pressing business for the next few days and its always nice to get out of rome just say the word papa i smiled and nodded perhaps i suppose it is the next logical step still i keep thinking about the girl the girl the slave girl zotica i should have a talk with her she might know something im sure she knows a great deal papa but do you really want to hear it what do you mean eco peered at me shrewdly narrowing his eyes in the bright sunshine tell me papa do you want to talk to this zotica to find what she knows about the murder which is probably nothingor do you wish to talk to her to satisfy your own prurient curiosity about the things that dio did to her eco if she told you that her treatment from dio was not nearly as cruel as youve been led to think youd be relieved wouldnt you i sighed yes and what if the opposite happened what if the things that dio did to her were quite as appalling as you fear and even worse i know how you felt about dio papathe way he died the fact that he came to you for help but i also know how strongly you feel about those who abuse slaves in such a fashion coponius may have been slandering dio i said it hardly sounds like it from the way you tell it coponius talked about dios bedroom habits only reluctantly and he was more embarrassed than judgmental as if he was telling you that dio was flatulent or snored and what about the slave philo he told the same story slaves like to gossip as much as their masters i shook my head i dont like having my memories of dio tainted by hearsay ah but from the girls lips it wouldnt be hearsay so you think i want to find this girl for no other reason than to put my mind at rest about dio isnt that it papa his sympathetic gaze made me feel suddenly unsure of myself partly yes but thats not the only reason i insisted theres something else something i cant quite put my finger on another intuition from the goddess cybele guiding you on im serious i cant help but feel that this zotica knows something or did something or had something done to her said eco under his breath eco you said i could call on you if i needed help this is what i want you to do find this slave dealer on the street of the scythemakers find out what became of zotica are you sure papa it seems to me that my time would be better spent trying to contact lucceiuss kitchen slaves and if im to do that i should get started it will take me a day to get to picenum another day to get back plus the time spent there since the trial is only four days away no find out about the girl first you can get started this afternoon its too late to leave for picenum today anyway eco shook his head at my stubbornness very well papa ill go and see if i can track down this zotica for you if her story is awful enough i suppose it may save me the bother of needing to go up to picenum what do you mean by that well eco began but he was interrupted if dio was such a bad man why are you bothering to find the person who killed him anyway diana i turned and saw my daughter standing in the doorway cant i come and be with you papa she walked to me and took my hand her long straight hair glittered blueblack in the sunlight the only thing mother and menenia talk about is the twins and all the twins want to do is pull my hair and scream in my ears theyre such little monsters id much rather be with you and eco diana why did you say that because the twins are monsters titania is a harpy and titus is a cyclops no why did you say what you said about dio no one said he was a bad man diana looked at me blankly i think said eco that someone has been eavesdropping and for quite a while no i havent its a very bad habit diana especially when your brother and i are discussing business but i told you i wasnt eavesdropping she stepped back and crossed her arms and gave me her version of the medusa look diana besides papa isnt eavesdropping what you and eco do for a living i dont see why you should pick on me for doing it even if i was which i wasnt its a matter of showing respect to papa said eco no one in this house seems to have any respect for me said diana whenever the monsters come over i might as well be made of stone she turned and left the room my my said eco is that what its like to have a thirteenyearold daughter in the house just wait i sighed perhaps youve been ignoring diana i probably have shes becoming difficult it was the same with meto remember it started later with meto and that was different that i understood whether i liked it or not but with diana i dont understand not at all shes the only one of you whos actually of my own flesh and blood but sometimes i think bethesda created her all by herself shes more like you than you realize papa yes im sure youre right i tried to remember what we had been talking about but found myself musing instead on the scent of jasmine that lingered in the warm air diana had recently begun to use the same fragrant oil that bethesda used to scent her hair just as she had begun to occasionally use her mothers jewelry and scarves i closed my eyes i breathed in the fragrance it might have come from either of them diana was becoming so much like her mother i was interrupted by the sound of a cleared throat i opened my eyes blinking at the bright sunshine what is it belbo a caller master the little gallus again he says that you must come with him at once come with him i turned my face back to the sun and closed my eyes again my legs ached from too much walking the sunshine was making me sleepy yes you must piped a familiar voice i opened my eyes to see trygonion slipping past belbo into the atrium his silver bracelets jangled and glittered in the sunlight and his red and yellow robes were dazzling eco raised his eyebrows belbo stamped his foot in frustration clodia needs you said trygonion at once its a matter of life and death life and death i said skeptically and poison said trygonion exasperated the monster is planning to poison her who caelius clodia trygonion what are you talking about you must come at once theres a litter waiting outside i wearily got to my feet do you want me to come with you papa said eco no id rather you got started finding zotica take belbo with you papa no need to take along that hulking brute said trygonion youll be in the litter its well guarded shall i tell bethesda youll be back for dinner said eco raising an eyebrow bait me all you like eco im not letting you come along i said his laughter followed me out of the atrium the litter in front of my house was far more impressive than i would have expected even clodia to send for a mere hireling the box was draped with red and white striped silk like clodias tent on the tiber the poles were of polished oak borne aloft by a team of barechested slaves with oxlike shoulders dressed in white loincloths and thicksoled sandals every one of them was blondscythians perhaps or captured gauls from caesars conquests i had seen them before among the young men cavorting in the river at clodias horti a small retinue of bodyguards stood behind probably recruited from clodiuss gang i didnt like the looks of them which meant they had the right look for a bodyguard trygonion snapped his fingers with wellpracticed efficiency the bearers lowered the box a slave put down a block of wood so that we could step inside i gestured for trygonion to enter but he shook his head i have business elsewhere go ahead climb in i stepped onto the block and parted the curtains a melange of exotic scents issued from within jasmine was among them along with frankincense and sandalwood and more elusive scentsclodias smell the inner draperies were of some heavy opaque fabric making the interior of the box seem very dark after the bright sunlight of the street i was already inside settling back against the cushions and being lifted aloft before i realized that i was not alone thank you for coming a hand touched my arm i sensed her presence smelled her scent felt the warmth of her body clodia she stirred beside me her leg brushed against mine she laughed softly and i smelled her breath warm and moist against my face and vaguely smelling of cloves you sound surprised to see me gordianus i thought the litter was empty as my eyes adjusted to the dimness i saw that there was yet another occupant across from us settled against the cushions at the front of the box was the auburnhaired handmaiden chrysis she smiled and nodded a woman learns early never to step into a litter without knowing whos inside said clodia i should think men could profit from the same rule though the danger may be different the ride was impeccably smooth i parted the nearest curtain and saw that our pace was very quick from behind us i could hear the sound of the bodyguards trotting to keep up we dont seem to be headed toward your house clodia no what i have to tell you is best discussed away from curious ears she saw me glance at her handmaiden dont worry about chrysis no one is more loyal than she clodia extended her leg and touched her bare foot against the slaves she leaned forward as did chrysis when their faces met clodia gave the girl a kiss upon the forehead and gently stroked her cheek clodia leaned back i felt her warmth next to me again its too dark she murmured chrysis beloved open the inner curtains the slave girl moved nimbly about the compartment pulling back the heavy inner curtains and tying them to hooks at each corner the box remained private concealed by the translucent red and white striped curtains which wavered in the breeze the sounds of the street rose and fell as we swiftly passed by from time to time the chief of the litter bearers whistled to signal a turn or a stop or a change in pace but the box never pitched or swayed a lethargic sense of luxury crept over me the feeling of being borne effortlessly aloft in a private world from which the squalor of the street was excluded the sudden unexpected nearness of clodias body was intoxicating she was so close that i could see her only in sidelong glances never all at once like an object held too close before the eyes she dominated my senses even while she eluded them in the filtered glow of sunlight through silk curtains the flesh of her arms and face appeared as smooth as wax but radiant with an inner warmth her stola was as transparent as the one she had worn before but was of a different shade a creamy white the exact color of her flesh as we passed through dappled patches of sunlight and shadow the illusion that she was naked was sometimes uncanny until she moved whereupon the dress moved with a life of its own as if the shimmering fabric provoked by her touch sought to caress all the hidden places of her body the box was suspended so as to stay level when the poles were tilted but i could tell when we began the sharp descent down the western slope of the palatine toward the forum boarium the noises from outside grew louder as we passed through the great cattle market the congested streets forced the bearers to come to numerous stops and the smells of roasted flesh and live beasts for sale intruded on clodias perfume the spell within the box slackened i felt as if i were waking from a dream where are we going i said to a place where we can talk privately to your horti on the tiber youll see tell me what you discovered today as we passed through the cattle market and then through a gate in the old city wall and into the forum holitorium the great vegetable market i told her what i had learned at the houses of lucceius and coponius my account was more businesslike and circumspect than the one i had given eco she was not paying me after all to look into dios sexual habits you see why it would be difficult to pursue the charge against caelius for killing dio she said the crime couldnt be proved against asicius and probably cant be proved against caelius though everyone knows the two of them were accomplices the attempted poisoning is the key but youre right lucceius will never allow his slaves to testify hed have them put to death first rather than lose face at a public trial what a hypocrite a true host would want to see a crime against his guest avenged rather than pretend it never happened she stirred beside me and it seemed to me that her body had grown warmer i wonder if we could somehow trick lucceius into selling the two slaves to me possibly i said not likely then i could compel them to testify the court would insist that their testimony be extracted by torture of course which would take it out of my control am i here to discuss strategy trygonion acted if there was some terrible crisis at hand something about poisoni parted the nearest curtain a bit to catch a glimpse of the marketplace vendors were selling plucked chickens and bundles of early asparagus clodia put a finger to her lips almost there a few moments later the litter stopped i thought we had merely come to another congested spot until i felt the box being lowered and chrysis sprang up to open the outer curtains she produced a hooded cape which she deftly draped over her mistress as clodia stepped out of the box i stayed where i was uncertain whether i should follow we appeared to be at the southwestern foot of the capitoline hill on the fringes of the vegetable markets still very much in the heart of the city what sort of privacy could such a spot offer chrysis sat back against the cushions she smiled and raised an eyebrow well go on dont be shy you wont be the first man to pass through those gates with her i stepped from the litter covered by her cape clodia was waiting and at my appearance she turned and walked quickly to a high brick wall which appeared to enclose a corner of land against the craggy base of the capitoline there was a wooden door in the wall for which she produced a key the hinges creaked as she pushed the door open i followed her inside and she closed the door behind us all around us were sepulchers of weathered marble adorned with plaques and inscriptions carved tablets and statues cypress and yew trees reared up from the jumble of marble the brick wall shut off the teeming city behind us the sheer base of the capitoline loomed before us with blue sky above theres no more secluded spot anywhere in the city said clodia what is this place the ancient burial ground of the claudii it was granted to us back in the days of romulus when our ancestors moved to rome from the sabine lands we were enrolled among the patricians and given this parcel just outside the old city boundaries to be our family burial ground over the centuries its become filled with shrines and sepulchers clodius and i used to play here as children imagining it was a little city all to itself we hid from each other in the sepulchers and walked down the pathways in makebelieve processions the sepulchers were great palaces and temples and fortresses and the pathways were broad avenues and secret passages i could always scare him pretending to raise the lemures of our ancestors clodia laughed five years is such a difference between children she pushed the cape from her shoulders and carelessly laid it atop a stone bench the westering sunlight reflected off the stony face of the capitoline cast a faintly orange glow over everything including clodia and her shimmering stola trying not to stare i found myself pondering the wall of a nearby tomb on which a carved tablet depicted the stained and weathered faces of a husband and wife long dead then when i was older i would come here to be alone clodia said she walked among the monuments running her hands over the pitted stone those were the bad years when my father was always away either exiled by his enemies or off fighting for sulla my stepmother and i didnt get along looking back now i know that she was sick with worry but then i couldnt stand to be in the house with her so i would come here do you have children gordianus two sons and a daughter i have a daughter quintus always wanted sons there was an edge of bitterness in her voice how old is your girl thirteen shell be fourteen in august my metella is just the same just beginning that difficult age when most parents are glad to shuttle a girl off into marriage so that she can become someone elses problem weve made no plans yet for diana shes lucky to be home and lucky to have a father there girls need that you know everyone always talks about boys and their fathers its only the male children anyone cares about but a girl needs a father as well to dote on her to teach her to protect her she was lost in thought for a long moment then seemed to wake to her surroundings she smiled and of course when i got a little older still i brought boys here my stepmother allowed my brothers to do whatever they wished but she was strict with her daughters and with me or tried to be though it brought her nothing but grief oh there was many a secret tryst in this place beneath these trees on that very bench of course all that ended when my father betrothed me to cousin quintus she said glumly and now that youre a widow do you still bring suitors here clodia laughed what an absurd idea why do you ask something chrysis said as i was leaving the litter naughty chrysis she was teasing you im sure oh i suppose the gossips say such things about meclodia meets her lovers at midnight in the claudian graveyard she drags the young men into the sepulchers and deflowers them while her ancestors gasp in shame but these days i really much prefer a couch and pillows dont you she stood sideways and turned her face to look at me straight on the reflected sunlight seemed to turn her stola to a thin mist that clung to her naked flesh and could have been dispelled with a puff of breath i looked away and found myself nose to nose with a stately basrelief of a horses head the ancient symbol of death death as departure death as something more powerful than man you were going to explain this talk of poison she sat on the bench using her cape for a cushion marcus caelius is plotting to murder me before the trial she allowed this statement to reverberate for a moment then went on he knows that i have evidence he knows that im planning to testify against him he wants me dead and if he had his way id be joining the shades of my ancestors before sundown tomorrow fortunately the slaves whom caelius thought he could seduce have remained loyal to me and have informed me of his plot what plot this very morning caelius obtained the poison he plans to use he bought a slave to test it on the wretched man died in horrible agony while caelius watched it took only moments caelius wanted a quickacting poison you see and had to make sure it would do the job how do you know this because i have spies in caeliuss house of course just as he thinks he has spies in mine she stood up and began to pace this was his plot to have a friend of his meet some of my slaves tomorrow afternoon at the senian baths and hand over the poison to them whereupon they would bring the poison home and chrysis would put it into my food his agent approached the slaves yesterday including chrysis the slaves pretended to agree but instead they came to me and told me everything what made caelius think he could suborn your slaves marcus caelius used to be a welcome guest in my home he got to know some of the slaves including chrysis rather wellwell enough i suppose that he thought he could sway them with promises of silver and freedom if they would help him murder their mistress he underestimated their loyalty to me i stared at her trying to decide whether i should believe her and found myself studying the shape of her body instead i shook my head so the plot has been uncovered youve nipped it in the bud why all this secrecy why tell me about it at all because marcus caelius doesnt know that his plot has been spoiled he thinks my slaves have agreed to follow his orders he still plans to go through with it tomorrow afternoon his agent will arrive at the senian baths carrying the little box of poison my slaves will be there to receive it from him along with witnesses we shall seize the poison expose the agent produce the evidence in court and add another count of attempted murder to the charges against marcus caelius and you want me to be there i said she drew close to me yes to help seize the poison to witness everything that happens are you so sure you can trust your slaves clodia of course perhaps theyre not telling you everything we all have to trust our slaves in the end dont we then why have you brought me here away from your house away from your bodyguards and litter bearers where even chrysis cant hear she lowered her eyes you see through me yes i cant be certain no one can ever be certain of anything in this world yes im a little frightenedeven of my slaves but for some reason i trust you gordianus i imagine youve been told that before with her head bowed and her eyes lowered i noticed the remarkable line of her eyebrows like the wings of a bird in flight then she turned her face up and all i could see were her deep luminous green eyes clodia you asked me to find evidence that marcus caelius tried to kill dio whether youre pursuing this matter for the sake of justice or for political gain or simply to hurt caelius i dont know nor do i really care i agreed to take part for one reason to do what i can to put dios shade at rest this warfare between yourself and caeliusbroken love affair festering hatred whateveris of no concern to me she stepped even closer and looked steadily into my eyes i felt the heat of her body as i had felt it in the litter her eyes seemed impossibly huge love and hatred have nothing to do with it dont you see gordianus its all tied to dios murder thats why caelius wants to kill me not because i loved him once and dont anymore but because im trying to prove what he did to dio thats why i want you to go to the senian baths tomorrow to help foil his plot against me and expose it for all of rome to see this is all a part of the case against caelius which is the only way to bring dios killer to justice i stepped back from her the senian baths i said ruefully i suppose i could do with a hot plunge at what time a smile barely registered on her lips ill send a litter to take you there tomorrow afternoon chrysis will go along to give you more details on the way she picked up her cape and handed it to me then turned so that i could drape it over her shoulders she leaned back barely pressing her body against mine oh and tonight ill send over the silver you may be needing silver for what to buy those two kitchen slaves of lucceiuss of course the ones who took part in the plot against dio that is if youre able to track them down youll need ready silver if youre to buy them from under the nose of lucceiuss foreman at that mine up north or bribe him into letting you have them how much silver do you think that would take well let me know before we part and ill send it to you tonight ill send back a receipt with the same courier i said she pulled the cape about her neck and smiled no need for that im sure youll return any silver thats still unspent after the trial you see gordianus i really do trust you would you mind if we took a little side trip said clodia when we were back in the box and aloft as long as im back in time for my dinner i said thinking of bethesda it will take only a few moments i have an urge to go up on the capitoline just to take in the view the air is so clear today and the sun will be setting in the west she nodded to chrysis who stuck her head out of the curtains and gave instructions to the chief of the litter bearers we passed back through the vegetable and cattle markets crossed the valley between the palatine and capitoline hills and entered the forum the day was waning but a glimpse outside showed me that the squares were still thronged with men in togas going about their business i appreciated the privacy of a closed litterhow else could a man cross the busiest spot in rome side by side with a scandalous woman without anyone seeing him clodias entourage did not go unnoticed however at one point we crossed paths with some of milos gang who must have recognized the distinctive red and white striped curtains of the box bring out the whore one of them shouted are you in there with her clodius wet the bed again and gone running to your big sister shell kiss it and make it all better or bigger there was a sudden jolt as the litter came to a halt from outside we heard more obscene taunts then the sounds of a skirmish the moment had a peculiar nightmarish quality inside the box we were hidden but also blind to the outside world so that the obscenities seemed to come from disembodied voices and the scuffling noises were all the more alarming their causes unseen i heard the slither of steel pulled from scabbards then more shouts beside me clodias body seemed to radiate heat i glanced at her face which remained expressionless i thought i saw her ears turn red but it might have been a trick of the light within the box the litter began to move again then abruptly stopped turn it over someone shouted make a bonfire of the bitch staring straight ahead clodia reached for my hand and squeezed it i gritted my teeth and sucked in a breath from outside came the sounds of clashing steel along with yells and grunts finally the litter began moving again and rapidly picked up speed leaving a chorus of obscene taunts behind us clodia stared straight ahead gradually she relaxed her grip and let go of my hand she let out a barely audible sigh then gave a start when a gruff voice called her name from outside the chief of the bodyguard she said to me regaining her composure she pulled back the curtain a strawhaired gladiator with a crooked nose trotted alongside the litter sorry about that he said nothing to worry about they got the worst of it milos men wont try a stunt like that again anytime soon clodia nodded the man grinned showing rotten teeth and clodia let the curtain drop we turned sharply to the left and then to the right again going up the long steep ramp that ascends to the summit of the capitoline we passed by the chief monuments the auguraculum and the great temple of jupiter and headed past the tarpeian rock to the less builtup southern end of the hill the litter came to a stop clodia donned her cape and we stepped from the box the spot was deserted and silent except for the sound of wind in my ears the sky above us swirled with the orange and purple clouds of a spectacular sunset the tiber was a sheet of gold and the whole western horizon was aflame you see said clodia wrapping herself in her cape i knew it would be marvelous i stood beside her staring at the sunset she pointed at something directly below us if you look straight down over the edge of the cliff you can see just a bit of the brick wall that closes off the claudian burial ground where we were you see there and just beyond that the temple of bellona built on the same parcel of land by one of my ancestors the appius claudius who was victorious against the etruscans two hundred years ago instead of holding a triumphal parade he built a temple at his own expense and dedicated it to the war goddess bellona and gave it to the people of rome to be his monument sulla was especially fond of bellona you know he gave her credit for his victories i remember him once telling father thank your ancestor for me the next time you talk to him for building bellona such a fine place to live here in rome she smiled and turned her back on the sunset walking slowly until she came to the opposite side of the hill across from us the palatine loomed with its great jumble of rooftops a little more to the south the view opened up in the valley between the palatine and the aventine hills lay the vast expanse of the circus maximus with its long racetrack clodia pointed to the regions beyond over there the appian way begins and runs south all the way to campania and beyond and there crossing the appian way joining the wall for a stretch is the appian aqueduct which has been bringing water into the city for almost three hundred years these works are the legacy of my family and those men in the forum dare to call me such names she stared at the view for a while blinking as if the wind had blown dust in her eyes then looked over her shoulder a stones throw away was the southernmost of the temples that crowd the capitoline i need to go inside just for a moment she said she strode toward the temple steps and left me behind wondering whether i had just seen a patricians pious desire to burn a bit of incense for her ancestors or a womans need to hide a sudden burst of tears the litter bearers rested the bodyguards threw dice chrysis remained within the canopied box i shuffled about the paved square in front of the temple staring at the flagstones suddenly i realized which temple it was the temple of public faith and remembered the inscription that had been added some time ago to the marble parapet in front of the building the inscription wasnt hard to find in the fading light i read the chiseled letters with a feeling of odd detachment ptolemaios theos philopator philadelphos neosdionysos friend and ally of the roman people when all else was said and done king ptolemy was the reason behind everything dios journey to rome and his gruesome death the egyptian machinations of pompey and clodius and the rest of the roman senate the impending trial of marcus caelius but as the philosophers point out the single trunk of a tree so clear to see at its base becomes increasingly obscure the farther one proceeds into the branches i didnt have to look up to know that clodia had finished her business in the temple and was silently descending the steps toward me i smelled her perfume chapter fifteen i stepped from clodias litter onto the street in front of my house just as the last of the days light was retreating from the rooftops into the ether the red and white striped litter departed the stamping feet of clodias bodyguards left a haze of dust in their wake which made the empty twilit street even murkier i rapped on my door but belbo was slow in opening it some apprehensiona tap on the shoulder from fortune as they saycaused me to glance over my shoulder across the street i saw the figure of a man he wore a toga and from his pose he appeared to be standing still and watching me i turned and rapped on the door again i tried the latch just in case the door might have been left unbarred it had not i looked over my shoulder again the figure had moved closer into the middle of the street in the dimness and dust i could make out nothing but a silhouette where was belbo when i needed him no need to take along the hulking brute trygonion had told me when i left the house youll be in the litter its well guarded now i found myself alone on my own doorstep without a bodyguard without a weapon i rapped on the door again then turned to face the man if i was to be stabbed id prefer to look him in the eye rather than have my back turned of course the man was probably just some passing stranger i told myself even as i went through the catalogue in my mind of all those who might want to put a stop to any further investigation into the murder of dio king ptolemy pompey marcus caelius clodiuss enemy milo whose gang had just threatened clodia in the forummen notorious for using whatever means were necessary to snuff out their opposition the figure drew nearer taking halting steps it was the way he walked that frightened me if he knew me why didnt he simply walk up to me or call my name if he was merely passing by crossing the street on his way to some destination why did he approach in such a hesitant fashion i suddenly remembered the stalker who had followed us up the ramp on the previous night the figure who had abruptly turned and fled back into the darkness citizen i said finding my voice do i know you a puff of wind caused the dust that hung in the air to swirl and disperse somewhere far above the earth a bit of cloud caught a dying ray of light and cast a faint glow into the gloomy street and i caught a glimpse of the strangers face surely not an assassin i thought not with a face like that still my heart began to pound in my chest the door rattled from inside i heard the sound of the bar being lifted the door swung open and i quickly stepped back colliding with something and turning to see belbo smiling down at me sheepishly sorry to take so long master the mistress insisted that i come help her never mind belbo do you know that man what man master the figure had vanished as quickly and surely as the dust in the air swirled and vanished at the least puff of wind i peered up and down the street who was it master i dont know belbo perhaps nobody nobody a stranger i mean a man who just happened to be passing by no one at all even so later that night i found myself remembering the young mans facea dark gaunt face with a scraggly beard and piercing eyes it was a face marked by some terrible catastrophe with the kind of look one sees on men of a fallen city numb with despair except for eyes suffused with a hopeless longing too poignant to bear the memory of it made me shiver it was not a face i would care to see again i was in time for dinner bethesda received my compliments on her ragout of lamb with lentils with a barely perceptible nod and commented that diana had done most of the cooking a courier from clodia arrived some time later bearing the silver she had promised she must have counted out the coins herself they smelled faintly of her perfume as we prepared for bed bethesda asked me how my work was going suspecting that diana had reported everything she had overheard me discussing with eco i gave as perfunctory an answer as i could without telling an untruth and what did that woman want with you this afternoon she said unbelting her stola she wanted to hear what i had to report i said nothing about the alleged new poison plot or clodias scheme to send me to the senian baths that woman has sent you down the wrong path you know the wrong path going after marcus caelius but bethesda everybody knows that caelius is involved bethesda let the stola fall and stepped out of it standing nude for a moment you tease me by pretending that i would believe a thing simply because its gossip why because im a woman youre the one paying heed to gossip she reached for her sleeping gown and pulled it on i tried to imagine her in a gown made of transparent silk from cos bethesda saw the look on my face and softened a bit you have no reason to suspect caelius only that womans word for it it would be a terrible thing for a young man to be punished for a crime he did not commit and if he did commit the crime she shook her head and began to pull out the various pins and clasps that held her hair up she sat down in front of her mirror at the little table that held her boxes of cosmetics and unguents and began to brush her hair she seemed a little surprised but made no protest when i took the brush and began to do it for her nor did she protest when i put down the brush and ran my hands over her shoulders then bent down to press my lips to her throat we made love that night with a heat that staved off the chill in the room i tried very hard not to think of clodia i might have succeeded had it not been for her perfume it had permeated my clothing and my skin it had gotten onto my hands from touching her silver and thus onto bethesda the smell was faint elusive insidious as soon as i would forget about it lost in the tangle of bethesdas hair there it would be again filling my head and conjuring up images beyond my control the next morning eco came by with news of the slave girl zotica the previous afternoon while i had traversed the city in clodias litter he had made his way to the street of the scythemakers and located the slave dealer zotica is no longer in rome he said the dealer claims he tried to place her in a rich mans household figuring he could fetch the highest price by returning her to the type of place she came from but apparently the marks on her body were a little more apparent than coponius let on nobody wanted her for a serving girl or a handmaiden the man ended up selling her to another dealer who specializes in pleasure slaves so she ended up in a brothel maybe but not in rome the second dealer hemmed and hawed and held out his hand for some coins and finally remembered that he had her sent with a consignment of slaves down to an establishment in puteoli ill repay you for the bribe eco meanwhile what do you think it would cost to buy such a slave girl i produced the little bag of silver that clodia had lent me considerably less than that said eco where did it come from i explained clodia is a sharp woman he said more and more i long to meet her if only my father didnt keep getting in the way clodia could eat us both for breakfast suck out the marrow and turn our knucklebones into dice without batting an eye that might be a memorable experience i advise you to stick with menenia and also to stick to the subject then ill say it again clodia is a sharp woman its a clever idea trying to buy those slaves from under lucceiuss nose of course a fellow could get killed trying to do something like that you neednt worry about it papa i was joking of course ill go up to picenum to see if i can find these slaves and find out what they know and if its at all possible ill bring them back with me for the trial no you wont papa youre not thinking of doing it yourself no then its up to me i dread the saddle sores but menenia has a treatment for that which ill look forward to no eco you wont be going up to picenum but you can get just as saddlesore riding down to puteoli and back puteoli papa surely you dont want me to go chasing after zotica instead of finding the kitchen slaves who may hold the key to everything theres no way that i can do both picenum is north puteoli is south and the trial starts in three days ill barely have time to get to either of those places and back its one or the other yes well then its zotica papa eco you must do as i ask papa youre letting sentiment cloud your judgment sentiment has nothing to do with it he shook his head papa i know how your mind works you think for some reason that its up to you to redeem this slave girl very well but therell be plenty of time for that after the trial is over right now its those two slaves up in picenum that we need thats a dubious enough prospect given all the complications that could arise but at least it makes sense at least it wouldnt be a waste of my time so you think youll be wasting your time if you go down to puteoli to find zotica and find out what she knows yes a terrible waste of time considering how little we have what could this zotica possibly know about dios death find her for me eco i placed the bag of silver in his hands here ill prove to you that sentiment has nothing to do with it if the girl knows nothing if she has nothing to tell us about who killed dio then dont bother to buy her leave her where she is but if she does have something to say buy her and bring her back with you he bit his lips and tossed the bag from hand to hand not fair papa you know that ill buy her no matter what to please you as you think best eco only id suggest that you get started the days are still short and youre missing the best hours for riding in the afternoon a litter came for me just as clodia had said it was a considerably less conspicuous affair than her grand litter with its red and white canopy this litter had plain woolen curtains and was just big enough for two people to sit face to face belbo joined the handful of bodyguards while i climbed into the box and sat opposite chrysis who stared back at me with an enigmatic smile on her face idly coiling her auburn hair around a forefinger i found myself thinking that she could not possibly be as young and naive as she looked the litter rose in the air and began to move so i said exactly what is it that clodia wishes me to do at the baths today chrysis stopped playing with her hair and ran the forefinger over her lips as if erasing her smile leaving an even more enigmatic expression on her face the gesture reminded me of her mistress its very simple almost nothing really youre to wait in the changing room one of clodias men will find you how will i know him hell know you now caeliuss agent the man whos bringing the poison is named publius licinius do you know him i dont think so no matter clodias man will point out licinius to you when he arrives and then what caeliuss scheme calls for licinius to pass the poison to one of clodias slaves but as soon as licinius hands over the box of poison some of clodias friends are going to seize him and make a public scene theyll open the box to show everyone whats inside then theyll twist liciniuss arm until he confesses what he was up to and who sent him why should he confess some of clodias friends are very good at twisting arms i mean that literally chrysis laughed at her own wit what am i to do im a finder not an armtwister youre there to witness what takes place why clodia says you have a reputation for being a good observer we took a winding path down the eastern face of the palatine and were soon in the square in front of the senian baths jostling for space with all the other litters ill wait here said chrysis bring me news as soon as anything happens and dont do anything naughty with the other boys what do you mean please we know the sort of things you men like to do with each other in the baths she raised an eyebrow recalling another of clodias gestures are all the slaves in your mistresss household as insolent as you only her favorites when chrysis giggled she looked even more like a child i walked up the steps signaling for belbo to follow i paid the attendant in the foyer who handed belbo a towel we walked down a hallway and into the long narrow changing room with its elaborately coffered ceiling and rows of wooden benches patrons came and went in various stages of undress a number of fully dressed slaves stood idly about alone or in small groups waiting while their masters took their plunges whenever the heavy wooden door to the bathing rooms opened from beyond came echoes of conversation and laughter and the sound of lapping water the distinctive odor of the baths washed over mea mixture of sweat and steam accented by the tang of wood smoke from the furnaces with a musty hint of mildew i loitered for a bit waiting for someone to approach me then began to feel conspicuous in my street clothes i took off my tunic and handed it to belbo who found an empty niche for it among the cubbyholes that lined the walls i lifted my arms and belbo wrapped the towel around my waist i slipped off my shoes and let out a little sigh as my bare feet touched the floor which was heated to just the right temperature by the hotwater pipes underneath i know that sigh said a voice beside me like a poem the sound a man makes the moment his bare toes settle onto a heated floor i turned my head and barely nodded thinking the man was simply another patron then i saw his face the look of despair was gone replaced by a sardonic smile it was a handsome face despite its gauntness and the scraggly beard but there was a keenness about his brown eyes that made them hard to look into you were outside my house last night i said i suppose i was that explained it thenhe was clodias man the one i was to meet still why had he followed me up the ramp and then run away why had he lingered outside my house the night before and then vanished without introducing himself the senian baths are still the best in rome he said toweling his damp hair he was naked and still wet from the hot plunge with wisps of steam rising from his flesh his limbs were slender and his chest narrow there was no fat on him at all i could have counted his ribs and tapped a drumbeat on his hip bones they keep the cold water cold and the hot water piping hot its close by the forum so theres always someone interesting to talk to but its not too far from the subura so theres usually a bit of trash about to liven things up like that lecherous serpent vibennius vibennius he nodded toward the opposite side of the room see those three fellows over there vibennius is that rakishlooking fellow with the fleshy rope hanging down to his knees leaning against the wall with his arms crossed and nothing to hide busy fingers hes called for more than one reason look at that smarmy expression on his faceyou can tell hes up to something rotten thats his son the young fellow with the remarkably hairy buttocks leaning over at the bench taking off his shoes have you ever seen such a woolly bottom really it makes me queasy to look at it like a beard growing at the wrong end appropriate i suppose since he uses the hole down there like a mouth from the way hes flexing and wriggling his buttocks youd think he was chewing on something tough thats obviously what that third fellow has on his mind the bald sap sitting there on the bench staring at juniors hairy rear end with that slackjawed expression i dont see the point of the towel on his lap do you its not hiding whats on his mind like a soldier at attention in a tent do you suppose the sap is waiting for a kiss from juniors bearded lips i looked at the stranger beside me trying to make out his expressiondisdain amusement envy whatever his preoccupations seemed far removed from our immediate reason for being at the baths and i was about to say so when he gripped my arm and nodded intently see there juniors finished undressing he bends over to pick up his shoes well really he might as well make himself into a hairpin now he unbends picks up his clothes turns to the wall do you suppose he really has to stand on tiptoes like that to reach the cubbyhole or is he just showing off his shapely thighs the bald sap certainly appreciates the showoh eros hes actually groping himself look at that smirk on papa vibenniuss face now junior regally strides toward the door to the tubs arching his shoulders thrusting out his backside walking just a bit on tiptoecould an egyptian catamite do it better sure enough the sap takes the bait hes on his feet heading after those hairy buttocks like a hound trailing a rabbit hes at the door hes through the door and now look at busy fingers while we watched vibennius looked discreetly right and left uncrossed his arms turned around and began rooting about in one of the cubbyholes oh really this is too much the man beside me threw down his towel and strode across the room i followed with belbo trailing behind the man walked up behind vibennius and tapped him on the shoulder vibennius gave a start and swung around with a guilty look on his face still up to your old tricks busy fingers robbing randy bathgoers while your boy leads them on a chase what the man was dumbfounded for a moment then flashed an uncertain smile catullus what in hades are you doing here i thought you were off playing imperial governor somewhere somewhere yes and sort of a year in bithynia under gaius memmius was quite enough i thought he was going to make me rich but memmius just took me along to read my poems to him couldnt blame him for craving a touch of culture bithynias a hellhole couldnt wait to get out of the place came back early as soon as the weather allowed its so good to be back in a truly civilized place like rome where a fellows likely to get robbed while lusting after a pair of hairy buttocks what are you talking about vibennius giggled nervously and looked about shiftyeyed vibennius you disgust me for cybeles sake leave the poor saps things alone what did you expect to find that would be worth taking his smelly loincloth catullus you jest i was just looking to make sure that my son put his shoes away oh but that explains it i must have gotten mixed up ive been looking in the wrong niche i wondered why everything looked so unfamiliar catullus laughed scornfully and shook his head vibennius i should report you to the management but theyd probably cut off your busy little fingers and throw them in the furnace and then wed all have to suffer the stench why dont you go see what your boy is up to then the two of you can pull your other bathhouse trick what do you mean you know the one where junior finds a dark corner and grabs his ankles to lure the unsuspecting sap and as soon as hes got him in a death grip with that bearded mouth you sneak up behind and start goosing the fellow with your busy fingers loosening him up for whats to come catullus you slander me on the contrary vibennius your massages are quite famous vibennius crossed his arms and looked smug from your foul mood id say you could use a good massage catullus get any closer to me with that ugly thing vibennius and ill tie it in a knot and what if the rope isnt slack enough for tying vibennius smirked catullus stepped toward him i retreated toward belbo expecting blows instead catullus grinned oh vibennius it is good to be back vibennius opened his arms you wicked goat how weve all missed your sharp tongue he said embracing catullus and slapping his back i blinked not sure what to make of this display then gave a start when a hand touched my shoulder gordianus said a voice behind me i turned and saw the vaguely familiar face of a burly young man with a neatly trimmed beard and soulful brown eyes it was the way his eyebrows grew together into a single line that jarred my memoryhe was the slave who had answered clodias door he stood before me fully dressed and slightly out of breath barnabas i said hebrew for consolation thats right he nodded and lowered his voice chrysis said you were already here publius licinius is on his way now with the box i frowned youre the one im supposed to meet yes then who i turned toward catullus and caught just a glimpse of his enigmatic grin before barnabas pulled me back and hissed in my ear licinius just walked in come with me he took me by the arm and led me across the room with belbo lumbering behind in the green tunic barnabas whispered the young man did look familiar though i had never met him i had seen him in the forum and walking through the streets of the palatine in the company of marcus caelius he was nervously glancing from side to side and fiddling with something in his hand we part now whispered barnabas just stand aside and watch make sure you keep your eyes on the pyxis by this he meant the tiny box licinius carried in his hand one of those elaborately decorated containers with a hinged lid and a latch so favored by ladies for keeping their powders and unguentsand by poisoners for keeping their poisons the pyxis licinius carried appeared to be made of bronze with raised knobs and inlays of ivory he turned it over and over in his palm licinius spotted barnabas and sighed with relief he stepped forward to meet the slave but barnabas signaled with a nod that they should withdraw to a corner of the room as barnabas turned his eyes very briefly met mine making sure i would follow i glanced over my shoulder wondering where catullus and vibennius had got to but i couldnt find them in the throng of clothed and naked flesh the dressing room suddenly seemed to have gotten considerably more crowded barnabas arrived at the corner and turned licinius reached him and began to extend his hand obviously eager to pass along the pyxis then the mad scramble and the shouting began since i had arrived in the changing room i had been studying the crowd trying to spot clodias armtwisters i had marked down several likely candidates judging by their brawniness and sure enough these were among the men who suddenly rushed licinius but there were more of them than i would have expected at least ten among them to my surprise was the busyfingered vibennius they moved to apprehend licinius the moment the pyxis changed hands but their timing was premature someone shouted an instant too early or someone bolted toward the box before he should have or perhaps licinius was simply so nervous that he froze in midtransaction and panicked before the box reached barnabass hand whatever the exact sequence of events the pyxis was never handed over it remained in liciniuss possession as he wheeled about in alarm and began to dodge and dart around the room slipping through the grasp of his wouldbe captors i caught a glimpse of his face and thought i had never seen a man who looked so much like a rabbit and a frightened rabbit at that but the pyxis remained tightly grasped in his whiteknuckled grip the brawny armtwisters would have made persuasive captors but what they had in muscle they lacked in agility arms closed on empty air as the rabbit scurried by heads banged together as licinius slipped through their pincers it was like a comic scene performed by mimes but more elaborately choreographed than anything id ever seen on a stage the rabbit made for the main exit but the way was blocked hand over the pyxis someone shouted yes the pyxis hand it over poison poison the bystanders witnessing this spectacle wore various expressions of confusion outrage and mirth some seemed to think it was merely a game while a few scrambled for safety under the wooden benches in the throng i spotted the sharptongued catullus who watched with wideeyed surprise licinius unable to get out through the blocked entrance wheeled about and headed for the unguarded door into the bathing rooms just as he reached it the door was opened by an old man draped in a towel licinius knocked him to the floor with a great whoop clodias armtwisters followed leaping over the old man like hounds over a log damnation muttered barnabas as he rushed by me grabbing my arm we followed in the rabbits wake past a giant tub full of shouting and laughing bathers one of the armtwisters had fallen on the wet floor and kept slipping as he tried to get up we angled past him and ran through another door into the innermost room where the air was thick with steam from the hot pool confusion reigned as a tumult of splashing and a chorus of shouts echoed through the dimly lit room block the door hell try to slip back out poison dont let him throw the pyxis into the pool did someone say poison in the pool poison let me out there was a great deal of running and slipping and colliding as the armtwisters tried to find licinius some of them stepped into the pipinghot pool with hisses of discomfort and poked about he must be here said barnabas the doors blocked and theres no other way out of course there is i said pointing to a dark corner the door to the furnace room barnabas groaned and ran to pull the door open sweltering air poured out from the dark passage beyond barnabas took a few hesitant steps tripped against something and let out a gasp hades a corpse there was something in the darkness at his feet but not a corpse unless corpses have two heads and writhe about get lost moaned one of the heads go find your own wheezed the other barnabas gave a start what its woollybottom and the bald sap i said this meant nothing to barnabas but he caught on quickly enough did someone else pass this way yes gasped one of the voices the idiot stepped on my hand hell have passed through the furnace room and be out in the alley by now so if you dontmind barnabas groaned the writhing figures on the floor thrashed gasped and bleated in ecstasy i pulled barnabas back into the bathing room and shut the door behind us now the farce had everything including a climax part three nox chapter sixteen chrysis fretted all the way back to clodias house she insisted i that i come along to explain what had happened i think she was afraid to break the bad news to her mistress alone the litter bearers turned down the little culdesac with the bodyguards and belbo following behind and deposited us in front of the house belbo and i waited on the red and black tiled doorstep looking up at the towering cypress trees on either side while chrysis rapped on the door and then clutched my hand to draw me inside belbo followed what do you mean shes not here i heard her say to the slave who opened the door shes gone off said the old man i dont know where for what for how long he shrugged nobody tells me anything but surely she didnt decide to go down to the senian baths herself mumbled chrysis nipping at a fingernail no she would have seen me unless we passed each other on the way oh attis chrysis made a little yelp of frustration wait here she called to me as she disappeared down a hallway or in the garden she added waving vaguely toward the center of the house while belbo stayed in the foyer i walked through the atrium beyond down a wide hallway through a colonnaded archway and finally down a short flight of steps into the open air and sunlight the garden was square surrounded by a covered portico there was a low platform at the opposite end which appeared to be a stage for behind it was a wall painted with a jumbled cityscape like a theatrical backdrop in front of the platform there was a small lawn with room for several rows of chairs at each of the four corners of the garden were cypress trees taller than the roof in the center of the garden was a small fountain with a statue of a naked adonis bronze fish beneath his feet emptied water into the pool from their gaping mouths i walked closer to have a look at the mosaics that lined the bottom beneath the splashing water the images of dolphins and octopi quivered against a shimmering field of blue the adonis was captured in the act of kneelingknees bent upraised palms extended his face turned upward with a radiant expression it was obvious to whom he was showing obeisance for on the stairway which i had just descended atop a high pedestal looking out over the whole garden was an enormous bronze statue of venus even more magnificent and more opulently detailed than the one which decorated clodias horti on the tiber the goddess was naked above the waist the folds of cloth gathered about her hips seemed frozen in the act of fluttering to the ground the curves of her body were sumptuous and the painted bronze gave the illusion of pliant flesh but the size of the statue was out of scale disconcertingly large more intimidating than beautiful her hands were captured in gestures of eloquent tenderness more motherly than erotic but this was at odds with her face which was strangely impassive severe in its beauty her unblinking lapis lazuli eyes stared down at me as i stood before the fountain studying the venus from adoniss point of view i began to notice the echoing sounds of chanting and music from somewhere nearby rising and falling and obscured by the splashing of the fountain but now growing abruptly louder and faster i heard the piping of flutes the rattling of tambourines and the jangling of bells along with a strange ululation that was nothing like normal singing i thought i heard words but the splashing fountain kept me from making them out the music grew louder the tempo accelerated i stared at the face of venus the longer i looked into her lapis lazuli eyes the more it seemed as if the statue might actually move or speak she blinkedor i blinkedand i felt a sudden tremor of apprehension i was not alone but it was not the goddess who had joined me the voice behind me was decidedly masculine theyre at it again i turned around to see a man on the low stage dressed in a toga he had been naked the last time i saw him every year its the same clodius shrugged and made a face if i were clodia id complain but i suppose my dear sister is too fascinated by the galli to want to stop their fun and it is only once a year whats only once a year the great mother festival of course the temple of cybele is just over there clodius said pointing behind him the house of the galli is right beside it for days before the festival they practice practice practice it all sounds hopelessly wild and discordant to a roman ear doesnt it and the singinghardly better than screaming but then id scream too if theyd cut my balls off he hopped off the stage onto the lawn and sauntered toward me you know its absurd but ive forgotten your name gordianus oh yes clodias new man the one to get the goods on marcus caelius been busy busy enough clodias not here at the moment some errand or other the door slave should have told you hes getting old he did say something actually but chrysis suggested i wait here i see oh thats right today was to be the little drama down at the senian baths how did it go thats why i came to tell clodia he stared at me with green eyes uncannily like those of his sister and what happened when i hesitated he scowled which made his face impossible to read was he feigning boyish petulance or showing genuine anger the scowl did nothing to spoil his good looks it merely rearranged them oh i see he said youre here to report to clodia not to me she said you were the loyal type rare enough in rome these days but my sister and i have no secrets from each other no secrets at all and i should hope you have nothing to hide from me gordianus ive certainly hidden nothing from you he gave me a knowing look when i said nothing he laughed thats a joke about what i was wearing the day we met he shook his head she also said that you have no sense of humor you seem to have discussed me at length my sister likes to get my opinion of the men shes dealing with she could use some advice clodia hasnt always exercised the best judgment choosing whom to trust as in the case of marcus caelius which brings us back to the senian baths how did it go here well sit on the bench in the shade and if were lucky chrysis will come walking by and ill send her for some wine as we sat i noticed that another man had stepped onto the stage a giant whose face glinted like a broken shard of ebony in the sunlight he leaned against the painted wall with his arms crossed watching us from a distance he was incredibly ugly with a bullish neck and enormous arms beside him belbo would have looked like a child he curled his upper lip in a snarl that made my blood turn cold clodius saw my reaction and glanced over his shoulder thats the ethiop clodia gave him to me last year goes everywhere i go keeps an eye on me the loyal type like you a couple of months ago one of milos men came up to me in the forum and waved a knife at me he never saw the ethiop comingdont let his size fool you hes fast as lightning the ethiop grabbed the fellow from behind and broke both of his arms just like that clodius snapped his fingers twice no ones threatened me in the forum ever since but dont worry hes completely harmless to my friends oh that noise if those galli arent mad already theyll surely drive each other crazy by nightfall can you imagine being in the same room with them what sort of goddess would want to go into a temple with such a racket going on now about the baths i told clodius about the farce i had witnessed he listened in silence making expressions of disgust and amusement so licinius got clean away he finally said yes and the pyxis with him im afraid so he sneered i wish id been there id have grabbed licinius by the balls and squeezed until he croaked out everything he knew then id have stuffed the poison down his throat pyxis and all hung the corpse up by the heels and dragged it into the trial that wayan exhibit for the prosecution you want evidence cicero heres our evidence up on the stage the ethiop heard the anger in his masters voice and looked at me as if mulling over which arm to break i shifted uneasily on the bench i suppose your sister will be quite displeased clodiuss demeanor changed in the blink of an eye he laughed dont count on it she adores a bit of drama you know loves comedy even more well just look at what shes done to this garden made it into her private theater so she can bring in mimes from egypt to amuse her friends and host recitals for whatever poet has caught her eye lately no once clodia has thrown a priceless vase or two across the room and given a few slaves a good beating i think shell see the humor in it well look whos hereand just when my throat was getting dry chrysis appeared at the top of the steps beneath the venus when she saw us she began to turn back but clodius clapped his hands and waved her over chrysis darling bring us some honeyed wineim in the mood for something sweet and perhaps some dates and some of those little seed cakes that clodias cook always keeps in the kitchen will that suit you gordianus i nodded will that be all said chrysis lowering her eyes clodius growled dont tease me little one i dont intend to tease you said chrysis keeping her head bowed harpy go on and fetch the wine before i grab you and ravish you right here in front of the guest or better yet ill put the ethiop to the job and gordianus and i will watch while the two of you make a baby up on the stage chrysis turned pale and quickly departed so young clodius murmured gazing after her that auburn hair that pale flesh deliciousi should like to pour honeyed wine all over her and lick it up but clodia forbids it wont let me touch the girl i suppose she thinks it would spoil her or maybe chrysis is in love with another of the slaves clodia is sentimental that way anyway i keep my hands to myself my sister and i always respect one anothers property i noticed that the chanting of the galli had stopped for a moment suddenly it started up again with shrill piping and a clashing of cymbals clodius made a face well i suppose we can somehow work around the loss of the pyxis he said gazing abstractedly at the statue of adonis this crazy attempt to poison clodia is just further corroboration of the charge that caelius tried to do the same to dio at lucceiuss house he used clodias money to buy the poison and bribe lucceiuss slaves she came to suspect him and now hes trying to stop her from telling what she knows by poisoning her a reckless desperate manthats the picture well paint for the judges clodia says youve tracked down some slaves that lucceius has hidden away in a mine somewhere perhaps didnt she give you some silver in case youre able to find these slaves and buy them that was mentioned i said uneasily it may not yield anything worthwhile it had better we need stronger evidence its our job you see clodias and mine to get the goods on caelius concerning the poison attempt on dio others are concentrating on the crimes caelius perpetrated against the egyptians on their way up to rome lets hope theyve come up with something stronger witnesses thats what we need credible witnesseswe could walk through the forum right now and find ten men whod swear to caeliuss guilt but theyd be about as reputable as a drunken general bad witnesses merely water down a good oration the strongest thing in our favor is the thought thats on every ones mind if marcus caelius didnt murder dio who did ive been pondering that myself we dont want the judges to ponder too much they might come up with someone else clodius smirked you dont believe caelius is guilty of course i do he said sharply you really dont have a sense of humor do you how is it that youre both involved in this affair you and your sister we each have reasons to want to see marcus caelius get what he deserves as do you i caelius murdered your old teacher isnt that why youre here your reason is personal like clodias mine is political each has his own incentive what do the judges care i nodded what i mean is do you and your sister do everything together the double meaning struck me as soon as i spoke which was too late to call back the words i believe that our wine and seed cakes have arrived said clodius chrysis descended the steps bearing a tray followed by another slave who carried a folding table while they set the food and drink before us the chanting from the house of the galli stopped for a moment then resumed at a different pitch and tempo the priests were singing a new song if indeed the keening noises constituted a song clodius sipped from his cup and looked thoughtful i never drink honeyed wine without thinking of the bad old days the bad old days clodia had used a similar phrase after papa died the lean years we were expecting him to come home from macedonia with wagons full of gold and instead he left us saddled with debts well that sort of crisis can happen even in the best families a good thing in the end it sharpened our wits you do what you must you prove to yourself that you can get by on your own and youre never afraid of the world again it made us closer we learned we could depend on each other clodia was the oldest and the keenest like a mother to the rest of us you already had a mother clodia was closer than a mother at least to me she was he gazed into his cup but i was talking about the honeyed wine we were poor you know but the dinner parties never stopped that was our investment in the future those dinner parties my sisters needed husbands my older brothers needed to launch their careers and so the dinner parties every night for the guests honeyed wine but not for us into our cups the slaves would secretly pour the cheapest wine we drank it with a smile the guests were fooled and never knew that we couldnt afford honeyed wine for everyone that was excellent training for a career in the forum learning to put on a pleasant face even when something disagreeable is going down your throat he put the cup to his lips and drank i did the same the wine is excellent i said but if your sister isnt here theres really no reason for me to stay he shrugged she may come back at any moment where is she probably gone to her horti or off to visit someone she took metella with her her daughter it seemed hard to imagine clodia as a mother or to imagine what her daughter would be like my dear niece willful like her mother but also beautiful like her mother and she adores her uncle like her mother does he took a bit of seed cake perhaps not quite that much damnation theyve started singing again i think im getting used to it i said theres one phrase they keep repeating thats rather pretty there thats it the music floated above our heads clodius laughed and shook his head watch out or the next thing you know youll have a strange urge to run off to phrygia to have your balls lopped off he poured himself another cup and insisted on pouring another for me the wine spread through me with a delicious warmth as long as im here there is something i should ask you i said go on a few days ago i was out after dark and noticed someone following me i think i spotted the same man outside my house last night and today he spoke to me at the baths id decided he was one of clodias men but then found i was mistaken would you know anything about it about a man following you no you seem to be rather protective of your sister i thought perhaps that id have you followed to investigate my sisters hireling dont be ridiculous i offer clodia advice when she asks for it but she deals with whomever she chooses i have no control over her associates friends or lovers what did this fellow look like young not quite thirty id say medium height slender dark a scraggly beard but hes just back from a trip maybe he was at the baths to have it shaved goodlooking in a hungry sort of way his eyestheres something sad about them almost tragic but today at the baths he seemed anything but sad sharptongued clodius looked at me curiously did he tell you his name no but i overheard someone call him catullus said clodius how did you know theres only one gaius valerius catullus so hes back already his friend at the baths said something about him returning early from a government post out east i knew hed hate it catullus loves rome too much those country boys always do once theyve gotten a taste of the big city he wasnt born in rome hardly from some backwater up north verona i think clodia met him the year quintus was governor of cisalpine gaul and they were stuck up there then there is a connection between clodia and this man catullus there used to be that was finished before catullus left rome last spring finished on clodias side anyway you think he was following you yes any idea why clodius shook his head hes a strange one hard to make out no interest in politics thinks hes a poet clodia thought so too half of his poems were about her women love that sort of crap especially from fools like catullus the sort who bleeds from love a walking hemorrhage and bitter about it too i remember him reciting from this very stage one summer night standing where the ethiop is standing now with the beautiful young poets and their starryeyed admirers gathered around crickets chirping moon above hed lull them with words like honey then stir the pot and show them the worms at the bottom selfrighteous foulmouthed longsuffering he even made one about me a poem clodiuss jaw tightened not much better than the doggerel milos gang comes up with and considerably nastier so hes back clodia will hear from him soon enough i imagine if you catch him following you again my advice is to give him a good blow to the jaw hes no fighter his tongue is his weapon good for making insults and poems and not for much else according to myaccording to those who have reason to know look this little bit of food has only made me hungrier and the suns getting low im not leaving until i see clodia stay and have a proper dinner with me i hesitated i told you she may show up at any moment shell want to know exactly what happened at the baths from your lips if i try to tell her ill either get angry and choke or else laugh in all the wrong places slaves came to clear away the wine and cakes i asked one of them to fetch belbo from the foyer he came lumbering down the steps peering up at the monstrous statue of venus with a proper expression of awe then he spotted the ethiop across the way the two of them flexed their shoulders dilated their nostrils and exchanged suspicious glances yes master take a message to bethesda i told him tell her ill be dining elsewhere tonight here master yes here at clodias house i winced realizing how it would sound to bethesda if she only knew that i was dining alone with another man to the sound of singing eunuchs with a giant ethiop playing chaperon and then shall i come back master before i could answer clodius raised his hand no need gordianus ill see that you get home safely he gave me a cool look challenging me to show distrust i shrugged and nodded no need to come back afterward belbo i said ill find my way home belbo cast a final suspicious glance at the ethiop then turned craning his neck to take in the full frightful splendor of the venus as he walked up the steps twilight fell with a mad crescendo of tambourines and shrill piping the chanting of the galli abruptly ceased a serene silence followed well said clodius i suppose even eunuchs have to eat its a warm night now that the rackets over shall we stay in the garden to eat couches were brought along with lamps the dinner was simple but exquisite clodias pleasures apparently included those to be had from owning a fine cook it was a meal to be eaten slowly and savored accompanied by leisurely conversation the galli said clodius sipping noisily at his fish soup what do you know about the cult of cybele gordianus not a lot i sometimes see the galli in the streets on the days of the year when theyre allowed to go begging in public ive heard the invocations to cybele at the great mother festival and of course ive met your sisters friend trygonion but ive never heard anything like the music i heard here this afternoon the cult has been in rome a long time yet most people dont know much about it its an interesting story how cybele first came to rome the wine and food had put me at ease i was almost able to forget the glowering presence of the ethiop who stood crossarmed on the stage and watched us eat tell me it happened back in the days when hannibal was rampaging through italy and no one could drive him out the college of fifteen priests consulted the sibylline books and found an oracle if an invader should take root in italy the only way to expel him would be to bring the great mother goddess to rome from her shrine in phrygia at that time king attalus ruled phrygia and happened to be our ally still the goddess herself had to be consulted when her phrygian priests put the question to her she shook the earth and told them let me go rome is a worthy place for any deity so king attalus agreed to make a gift of the statue of cybele along with the great black rock which fell from the sky at the dawn of time and first inspired men to worship her how do you know all this i said gordianus you impious man dont you know that im a member of the college of priests im privileged to look at the sibylline books i sit on the committee that regulates the galli and the worship of the great mother which is fitting since theres a family connection going all the way back to cybeles arrival in rome you mean the tale of claudia quinta i said you know the story only vaguely and never as told by one of the great womans descendants clodius smiled the ship bearing the skystone and the statue of cybele arrived at the mouth of the tiber and sailed inland to rome attended by great crowds along the riverbank but when the ship pulled alongside the dock to unload its divine cargo it sprang a leak and began to founder the dignitaries on the dock were thrown into a panic just imagine a group of politicians out for a day of impressing the masses suddenly find themselves in the midst of a catastrophic omenthe mother goddess sent to save rome from hannibal is about to sink into the tiber more honeyed wine not for me a bit more surely he gestured to one of the slaves to fill my cup anyway it was my ancestress claudia quinta who saved the day only the purest virgins and most upstanding wives were allowed to welcome the great mother to rome and there had apparently been some grumbling about letting claudia quinta take part in the ceremony something about her loose morals and the bad company she keptdoes this sound like someone we know but that day she was vindicated she stepped forward and seized the mooring rope and miraculously the ship began to rise again thus cybele showed her divine approval of claudia quinta the pious say this proved her purity of course when you actually picture the scenea woman reaching out and grasping a slick rope the big boat bobbing up like a swollen wineskinwell claudia quinta must have had an amazingly skillful touch the mudspattered skystone and the statue were unloaded from the ship and cleaned upthe ritual bathing of the statue is still a part of the annual festival the temple of cybele was built here on the palatine and dedicated with great ceremony with claudia quinta as the guest of honor just as the oracle had promised hannibal was driven from italy and today generations later we have to put up with the singing of the galli here in clodias garden what must they have thought our staid dour ancestors when they got their first look at the phrygian priests who arrived with cybele with their outlandish costumes and jewelry their long bleached hair and high lisping voices or when they saw how the priests worshiped cybele with whirling dances and wild frenzies and secret ceremonies in the middle of the night or when they learned that the consort of the great mother was a beautiful castrated youth called attis not the kind of consort to give a female much pleasure i should think perhaps cybele prefers a woman with a skilled hand like claudia quinta i prefer venus myself theres no ambiguity about what venus wants from adonis is there he gazed up at the towering statue when they got a taste of what the great mothers cult was really like our stern stiffjawed ancestors must have felt rather queasy but then rome has a way of gobbling up anything that lands on her plate and shitting it out as something acceptably romanart customs habits even gods and goddesses that is romes genius to conquer the world and adapt it to her convenience the cult of cybele was simply cleaned up for popular consumption the great mother festival is just like every other festival with plays and chariot races and animal shows in the circus maximus none of those inscrutable rites that cybeles followers practice in the eastecstatic riots by worshipers in the streets allnight vigils of men and women together in the temple the chosen faithful crawling through tunnels that drip blood we romans dont care much for that sort of thing whatever the religious pretext and no mention ever of attis wed rather not think about the castrated lover so the official celebration of cybele became another chance for state priests and politicians to put on plays and circuses for the people of course what the galli and their inner circle of worshipers do behind closed doors is another matter oh i dont believe it with a shiver of tambourines the music had recommenced they must have finished their dinner and now theyre at it again said clodius glumly do you suppose they eat like normal men trygonion showed a hearty appetite the night he ate at my house when was that when he came with dio asking for my help the night of the murder ah yes when he talked the poor old man into playing dressup with him clodia told me about it dio going out in a stolaits too painful for me to imagine thats trygonion longing to be something hes not and pulling others into his fantasy world the gallus seems to have a curious relationship with your sister clodius smirked another example of clodias questionable judgment like catullus like marcus caelius youre not saying that she and trygonion dont be stupid but in some ways hes no different from the men whove come and gone in this house with their balls intact they all let clodia treat them like slavesfor a while anyway we havent seen much of trygonion lately hes busy preparing for the festival with the other galli that might be him we hear now blowing on his flute he frowned you dont suppose clodia could be over at the house of galli concocting some sort of entertainment for her party her party clodia always throws a party on the eve of the great mother festival its the first social event of the spring three nights from now but thats the opening day of the trial purely by coincidence one more reason to celebrate if all goes well this garden will be full of people and up on the stagewell every year clodia has to outdo herself maybe this year trygonion will play his instrument for us he laughed crudely i wont be able to come i got myself elected aedile this year so im in charge of overseeing the official events of the festivaltoo busy for pleasure ill probably have to miss the trial as well too bad i should like to watch caelius squirm i love a good trial his green eyes glittered in the lamplight he looked uncannily like his sister i even enjoyed my own trial you remember that dont you gordianus i wasnt there i said cautiously but i think that everyone remembers the good goddess affair he drank deeply of the honeyed wine from that ordeal i learned three things first never trust cicero to back you up stab you in the back more likely second when bribing a jury account for a comfortable margin of victory youll sleep better the night before i did and third think twice before putting on womens clothing for whatever reason it did me no good at all it did dio no good either i said clodius made a dry little laugh perhaps you have a sense of humor after all the older i get the more easily i fall asleep without meaning to at the end of our meal clodius got up saying he had to relieve himself i relaxed and closed my eyes listening to the chanting of the galli the pleasing phrase i had heard before recurred and i followed it along until it seemed that i was floating on the strange music rising above clodias garden levitating face to face with the monstrous venus then flying even higher rome was a toy city beneath me moonlit her temples made of little blocks the music rose and fell and i was carried along like a bubble on a wave like a feather in a mist until someone whispered in my ear if marcus caelius didnt murder dio who did i woke with a start the voice had been so clear so close that i was puzzled to find myself alone the lamps had died the sky above was spangled with stars the garden was dark and quiet except for the soft splashing of the fountain someone had put a blanket over me the blanket smelled of clodias perfume too much honeyed wine i thought too much rich food yet i felt clearheaded and refreshed how long had i slept i pushed away the blanket the night was too warm for it i stood stretched my arms and looked around still not quite certain i was alone but there was no one in the garden except for the suppliant adonis and the towering venus huge and black in silhouette her eyes glittered dully in the starlight again i had the unnerving feeling that the statue was about to come to life i shivered and was suddenly eager to leave the garden at the top of the steps paused to quietly call outclodius clodia chrysis but no one answered the house was absolutely still i might have been in an empty temple shut up for the night i walked through the hallway and the atrium into the foyer surely there would be a slave at the door perhaps the same old man who had let us in that afternoon but the slave at the door was barnabas fast asleep he sat on the floor leaning against the wall his head tilted back so that by the faint starlight which seeped in from the atrium i could see his face with its joined eyebrows there was something gathered about him on the floor a puzzling shape which i slowly realized was the body of chrysis asleep with her head nestled on his lap in the utter stillness i could hear their quiet breathing clodius had promised to see me safely home which i took to mean an escort it was only reasonable that i should wake chrysis or barnabas and tell them what i needed but their repose was so perfect that i feared to move not wanting to disturb them a hand touched my shoulder i turned and stared into the darkness the ethiop was so dark that for a moment i couldnt see him at all my master said i was to take care of you if you woke up he said with an accent i could barely understand clodius is still here the giant nodded and clodia she came while you slept perhaps i should see her before i leave theyve gone to bed are they asleep what difference does that make by the faint light i couldnt tell whether the giant was grinning down at me or gritting his teeth the garlic on his breath was overpowering gladiators and strongarmers eat it raw to give themselves strength he unbolted the door and swung it open letting it bang against the sleeping figures on the floor with a smirk of disdain chrysis let out a sleepy whimper barnabas grunted poor excuse for a door slave the ethiop sneered shes too soft on her slaves well go on ill be right behind you no i said ill go alone the man made me uneasy the ethiop crossed his arms and looked at me grimly the master gave me specific orders ill see myself home i said it was suddenly a battle of wills at last the ethiop made a face of disgust and shrugged his brawny shoulders suit yourself he said and closed the door on me it was such a short way to my house and the night was so silent and so deep surely there was nothing to fear chapter seventeen rome slept the great houses and apartment buildings of the palatine were dark the streets were silent except for the sound of my own footsteps what was the hour dusk and dawn seemed equally distant like opposite shores impossible to make out from the middle of a vast black sea i felt utterly alone the last man awake in rome then i heard footsteps behind me i stopped the footsteps stopped a heartbeat later i took a few steps the footsteps behind me resumed gordianus i whispered to myself youve finally done it taken the final risk of a lifetime full of foolish risks youve fallen into the lazy habit of relying on fortunes favor always assuming that the goddess will make allowances for your foolishness and shield you at the last moment because the singular drama of your life for some reason intrigues her and she wishes it to continue now fortunes interest has waned shes turned her attention elsewhere for as long as it takes to blink an eye and you will be snuffed out removed from the worlds story for good a part of me believed this and steeled for the worst but another part of me knew that it was impossible for me to die just yet and merely gave lip service to the possibility to let fortune know that i wasnt taking her for granted and to gently remind her she had better do something and quickly the footsteps behind me speeded up i fought the urge to run and instead turned around i refused to end up as one of those corpses found with knife wounds in the back the street was narrow the shadows deep the figure moved toward me with a slightly unsteady gait the man was alone and unless i was mistaken had been drinking too much wine its the poet catullus after all i thought the man whom clodius told me not to fear unless of course it was marcus caelius drunk and coming after me with a knife or some nameless henchman of king ptolemy or a garliceating gladiator sent by pompey or someone else with a reason to kill me thinking i knew something i didnt he stopped several paces away i still couldnt make out his face but it obviously wasnt the ethiop the man wasnt big enough he appeared to be of medium height with a slender build when he spoke i recognized catulluss voice so shes gotten tired of picking apples off the tree the moment theyre ripe now shes poking around in the mulch heap he sounded only slightly drunk sarcastic but not particularly threatening im afraid i dont follow you i said arent you awfully old to be warming a spot in her bed whose bed i dont know what youre talking about he came a few steps closer we should find a patch of light so i can watch your face while you lie to me you know whose bed maybe but youre mistaken am i the damned gallus carries messages back and forth between you takes you to her horti you go riding around in her litter with the curtains closed and stay at her house until the middle of the night you must be her new lover dont be absurd he backed off a bit and began to circle around me i suddenly realized that he might be more frightened of me than i was of him he was the one who had turned to flee on the ramp at least shes finished with caelius though i cant see why shed throw him over for the likes of you you insult me i said shall i go on insisting on the truththat im not clodias loverand let the slur against my manhood stand or shall i tell a lie to refute the insult say that clodia is my lover and tells me nightly that im twice the man caelius is and four times the man that you are gaius valerius catullus i thought i might have pushed him too far but my instinct was true he came to a stop and barked out a laugh you must be a nitpicking orator like caelius one of those wordmurdering truthtwisting advocates from the forum why havent i heard of you before old man because im not an orator im a finder catullus well you found out my name whats yours gordianus he nodded i saw him more clearly now he still had the scraggly beard on his jaw despite his trip to the baths the tragic look had returned to his eyes even when he smiled are you thirsty gordianus not particularly i am come with me where its time we talked about her i didnt say why i said where where else at this time of night take a winding pathway to the foot of the palatine to a spot just behind the temple of castor and pollux turn left proceed down the narrow alley stinking of urine and black as pitch at night that runs behind the buildings on the north side of the forum as the slope of the palatine curves away on the lefthand side letting the alley open a bit you will come to a cluttered area of little workshops and warehouses south of the forum east of the cattle markets and the river look for the little pillar which name the shops and businesses as you draw near to the ninth signpost you will see the pool of light cast by the lamp hung outside welcoming those who cannot or will not sleep and who cannot or will not stop drinking whoring and gambling this is the place which catullus called the salacious tavern actually the place has no name or none to be read on the signpost outside atop the little pillar instead of an inscription is an upright marble phallus the lamp which casts such a lurid glow is carved in similarly suggestive shape perhaps inspired by these fine examples o craftsmanship less skilled artists have drawn crude graffiti on the wall outside graphically depicting various uses to which such phalli might b put catullus rapped on the door a little trap opened a bloodshot eye peered at us the door swung open they know me here said catullus and i know them the win is wretched the whores are liceridden and the patrons are the lowest of the low i should know ive come here every night since i go back we stepped into a long narrow room partitioned here and there b folding screens the room was packed with patrons who stood in groups or sat on chairs and benches around little tables the lamps were fueled by an inferior oil that created as much smoke as light filling the room with an amber haze that made my eyes water i heard laughter and cursing and the clatter of dice followed by hoots of triumph and groans of despair the crowd was made up almost entirely of men the few women were obviously there to ply their trade one of them suddenly emerged from the haze and wrapped herself around catullus like a clinging vine i blinked my watery eyes and the vine resolved into a supple redhead with a heartshaped face gaius she purred one of the girls told me you were back and with a beard here let me kiss it catullus stiffened and drew back with a pained expression not tonight ipsithilla why not its been a whole year since ive made a meal of you im famished catullus managed to smile not tonight she drew back lowering her eyes still pining for your lesbia he winced and took my arm leading me to a bench that had just been vacated a slave brought us wine catullus was right the quality was wretched especially after the honeyed wine that clodius had given me but catullus drank without hesitation next to us clustered around a little table a group of roughlooking young men were playing with dice of the oldfashioned kind made from the rectangular anklebones of a sheep with numbersi iii iv vi painted on each of the four long sides each man in turn would scoop the four dice up in a cup rattle them cry out the name of a deity or his mistress and cast them on the table a referee figured out the combination and shouted the name of the throw which would be followed by cries of gloating or derision when i was young the laws against gambling were more strictly enforced i said except of course during the saturnalia its always saturnalia inside the salacious tavern quipped catullus hercules shouted one ofthe gamblers the box rattled the bones clattered a taurus throw declared the refereethree ones and a six the next gambler cried a womans name and tossed the dice dogs cried the referee four ones nothing lower the player groaned at such bad fortune and cursed the mistress whose name he had called out for luck catullus stared blearily at the crowd the haze was so thick i could hardly make out faces let alone recognize anyone you wanted to talk i said ive lost my tongue for it i want more wine then ill talk was it you who followed me up the ramp two nights ago yes who sent you no one then why follow me i was following you before that perhaps youre not as sharp as you think i was outside her house when you came calling that afternoon with trygonion id just gotten back into town youd just arrived and you went straight to clodias house he put a finger to his lips in this place call her lesbia why its my secret name for her in the poems in places like this why lesbia lesbos was the island of sappho who understood love better than any poet before or since and homer called the women of lesbos the most beautiful women in the world wasnt homer blind he gave me a sour look agamemnon speaks the line very well lesbia when you went to lesbias house that day didnt they tell you shed gone out no i didnt knock on the door i was waiting watching i wasnt ready to see her again not face to face waiting and watching from where its a deadend street there are doorways deep enough to hide in then you came along with your bodyguard and the little gallus i was close enough to overhear the word horti so when you headed off i followed what did the two of you get up to alone inside her tent i dont think thats any of your business more to the point what did the three of you do after lesbius showed up naked and dripping from the river lesbius you know whom i mean you saw him come into the tent i hid among the trees and bushes on the riverbank he grinned bleakly you must think im an utter fool did you follow me when i left all the way to your house then over to that other house in the subura then back you never knew until the ramp did you you set a trap for me at the top you and your bodyguard so i made like a rabbit if youre like most of the lowlifes she takes for lovers i figured you might be pretty dangerous i told you im not her lover just her hireling as clodius calls me lesbius he insisted the cheap wine was beginning to take effect anyway you could be her lover and her hireling both shes far above the likes of you but shes been known to bend over for love the venus throw shouted the referee setting off an uproar next to us someone slammed his fist on the table making the dice jump and shouted an accusation of cheating the others closed ranks to calm him down the venus throw said catullus when all four dice come up different not the highest total just the luckiest why do you suppose that is because venus craves variety like lesbia except when she craves her own flesh lesbius is pulcherpulcher meaning beautiful and he must be because lesbia loves him far better than catullus and all his clan whom lesbius would sell down the river to pay three upright men willing to let him blow them a kiss i smiled and nodded clodius said you made better poems than milos men and nastier lesbius insisted catullus demeans me with such praise you seem to be talkative after all but as thirsty as ever where is that serving slave he banged his cup against the bench but the noise was lost in the hubbub i suppose youll see her again eventually i said he stared bleakly into the amber haze i already have i mean face to face to speak to her i spoke to her today i spent the afternoon with her what this morning i finally knocked on her door the old slave told me shed gone out early taking her daughter to visit some cousin so i wandered around and ended up at the senian baths it was only coincidence that i happened to see you there and that ridiculous chase after caeliuss friend what was it all about ill tell you later go on about lesbia i finally left the baths and headed back to her house on the way i recognized her litter outside the house of one of the metelli she was just leaving with her daughter the two of them were stepping out the door before i could turn she saw me it was hard to read her face it always has been a face unlike any other except one do you suppose that lesbia and lesbius can read each other at a glance like looking in a mirror the rest of us study their faces for hours and still cant be sure whats behind them something about her eyeslike a poem in a foreign tongue but more perfect than any poem more painful she invited me into her litter to go where i said home im expecting a man to bring me some news she said i suppose she meant you i dont want to go there if therell be someone else i told her she paused for a long time looking at me finally she said metella can stay here with her cousins a while longer you and i will go to the horti that was a mistake of course on a warm day like this with all the naked toads jumping about in the water and leering at her while lesbia leered back at them did she flirt with them merely to hurt me or do i flatter myself at least chrysis wasnt there to fetch the comeliest toad into her tent which is their usual game she invited me to her upcoming party she was very polite you must have some new poems you can read for us something inspired by your travels as if i was an acquaintance she could call on to entertain her admirers but do you know what he smiled grimly it so happens that i do have a new poem and i will be reading it at her party something to fit the theme of the great mother festival i suppose youll be there me i havent been invited strange isnt it considering that im her new lover and all dont needle me finder ive been pricked enough for one day at sundown she decided it was time to leave the horti just when id made up my mind to say what i needed to say to her she had to pick up metella she said and she was expecting her brother tonight youre welcome to come along she saidas if i could stomach being with both of them at once i told her id walk back into town by myself but you ended up outside her door again like a moth to a flame except that this flame freezes instead of burns the serving slave suddenly appeared and at catulluss insistence poured fresh wine into our cups i sampled it and was tempted to spit it out but catullus drank without complaint so what exactly happened at the baths today he said at the horti when i told lesbia id been at the senian baths she was suddenly all ears pressing me for everything id seen of that ridiculous chase she knew what it was about didnt she but she was as tightlipped as you no wonder clodia hadnt bothered to wake me when she came in i thought from catullus and then from barnabas she had probably heard more than enough details about the botched capture of licinius and the pyxis or had she been too eager to be with her brother to bother with the hirelings report you know about charges pending against marcus caelius i said its all ive heard about since i got back to rome they say hes up to his neck in it this time your lesbia and lesbius have a hand in the prosecution not officially but theyre eager to gather evidence against him on a particular charge of attempted murder so ive heard is that what shes hired you for yes then its come to that between her and caelius ive loved them both the glittering venus of roman society the petulant adonis who could be surprised when the two of them decided to love each other and turn the country bumpkin from verona out of their beds those two together without me that was more than i could stand the wine was beginning to slur his speech it was better when her husband was still alive good old quintus metellus celer the stodgy goat she was faithful to me then but after celer died she became her own woman and everyone elses woman as well even that was better than having her choose a favorite and shut me out altogether but then she picked caelius and i became just another of her multitude of usedup lovers this tavern is full of the wretches i could point out a dozen men whove had her i thought a year away would dull the pain but the wound still bleeds and i still crave the knife that cut me she doesnt love caelius anymore i said he rejected her as far as i can tell shes bitter shes determined to see him destroyed obsessed with it if thats any comfort to you comfort to know that another man truly got inside her made her care enough to feel pain when he turned away made her ache enough to want to destroy him me she dismissed with a flick of her wristno more scraps for the dog caelius deserts her and she goes crazy wheres the comfort in that the desire for destruction is mutual at least according to lesbia thats what the incident at the baths was about caeliuss friend licinius was there to deliver poison to some ofher slaves because caelius thought he could bribe them to murder their mistress murder clodia catullus was startled enough or drunk enough to forget the pseudonym no caelius would never do that i dont believe it she claims he tested the poison on a slave first and watched the man die before his eyes i can believe that caelius could kill a slave without a twinge of guilt but i cant believe that he would use the same poison on her not even out of desperation the charges against him are serious hell be ruined for life if hes found guilty humiliated forgotten exiled from rome exiled from romei know that loneliness catullus stared into his cup to save himself dont you believe that caelius would destroy your lesbia destroy lesbia no not her never perhaps he never loved her quite as you did none of them ever loved her as i did catullus stared bleakly into the crowd then stiffened hades he whispered look who just came in i squinted through the haze at three newcomers who stood near the entrance searching the room for a place to sit marcus caelius himself i said accompanied if im not mistaken by his friends asicius and licinius caelius saw catullus his face registered simple surprise followed by a lightning flash of emotion then a mask fell into place which lifted for only an instant to show his confusion when he saw me he hesitated then gestured for his companions to follow as he approached us catullus he said flashing a sardonic grin how long have you been back a few days and you havent come to call on me my feelings are hurt actually i did drop by your place said catullus your old place the neighbors said clodius had kicked you out and put the building up for sale they said id find you back at your fathers hovel on the quirinal hill you should drop by caeliuss smile never wavered the quirinal is a little out of my usual orbit besides i shouldnt think that your fathers house would be a suitable place for entertaining guests in your accustomed style i dont know what you mean the wine the singing the whores the inventive sleeping arrangements i cant see your papa approving all thats behind me now said caelius at least until after your trial then you may have to leave everything behind whether you want to or not the mask almost cracked i mean to say that ive seen fit to put aside some of the more boisterous habits of my youth and to sever some of my more questionable associations perhaps you were right not to come calling on me after all catullus one does have to hold to certain standards when inviting a guest into the house of ones father it was thoughtful of you to spare me the embarrassment of shutting the door in your face there was a long pause during which catullus swirled the dregs in his cup and watched them spin pursing his lips thoughtfully i think he finally said in a hard low voice that made me hold my breath that for you to insult me in that way marcus caelius caelius stiffened as did his friends for you to have insulted me in that fashion catullus went on by which i mean building an argument out of complicated sentences by logical stepswell what i think about that marcus caelius is that you havent drunk enough wine tonight caeliuss face went blank then he laughed not nearly enough and for you to do such a sloppy job of insulting me gaius catullus i think you must have already had far too much to drink i cant argue with that said catullus grinning and swallowing the dregs no matter said caelius the nights still young plenty of time for me to get stinking drunk and for you to sober up i take it that you know my friend here gratidianus said catullus gordianus i corrected him yes marcus caelius and i are acquainted we used to be neighbors and a few times our paths have crossed in the courts added caelius though never quite as they are crossing now i shrugged im not sure i but isnt it true gordianus that a certain lady has hired you and not for the purpose that she usually hires men you arent worthy of kissing her middle finger said catullus no longer friendly you certainly arent worthy of insulting her licinius who had been peering at me suddenly spoke up wait now i remember where ive seen this man before he was there today at the baths when i shut up licinius growled caelius it isnt true is it caelius catullus leaned forward earnestly his mood having shifted in the blink ofan eye it isnt true what gratidianus tells meyou wouldnt actually do her harm would you not to her not for any reason and certainly not by shut up catullus i said clenching my teeth say recognize him too asicius stepped closer peering at me hes the one who was hiding in the shadows across the street from your old apartment on the palatine caelius on the night that we took care of the old shut up asicius cried caelius loudly enough to startle the gamblers next to us one of them scratched his throw sending the dice flying onto the floora bad omen which caused some of the players to vacate the table at once whereupon those who remained began to shout accusations of bad faith at the quitters catullus stood a little unsteadily are you looking for a place to sit caelius here take my seat the salacious tavern just became a little too salacious for even my tastes are you coming gratidianus gordianus i said under my breath getting to my feet asicius and licinius shoved past me and sat on the bench as i stepped by him caelius seized my arm and put his mouth to my ear youre mistaken you know i didnt kill dio i swear thats only one of the charges against you marcus caelius he gripped my arm painfully hard and kept his voice low but youre only concerned with dio arent you you want to put his spirit to rest because you knew him in alexandria back in the old days his handsome face was no longer nonchalant a reckless desperate man clodius had called him i looked into his eyes and saw fear how do you know these things marcus caelius how do you know about dio and me and about clodia hiring me never mind what matters is that youre mistaken it wasnt me i didnt kill the old egyptian i swear to you by the shades of my ancestors and your friend asicius he didnt kill dio either who did i dont know but it wasnt me and the night of the murderwhere had you been with asicius before i saw you what were the two of you up to tell me that and swear by your ancestors thats more than i can tell you but still not enough caelius squeezed my arm gordianus gratidianus said catullus seizing my other arm caelius released me and i found myself being pulled toward the entrance my head reeling from the stench of oil smoke and cheap wine behind me i heard a stranger cry out by venus i wager everything and put my trust in the goddess of love then a clatter of dice and then the same voice exultant amid groans of defeat the venus throw the venus throw it conquers all out in the street i breathed the fresh air and looked up at a clear sky spangled with stars why such a rush to get me out of that place i couldnt leave you behind to tell them everything id just told you about her i wouldnt have done that and please stop calling me gratidianus my name i know what you call yourself but for me youll always have another name the one i give you just as she has another name in case i should write a poem about you i cant imagine what sort of poem that would be no gratidianus thinks hes clever and he must be because lesbia loves him far better than catullus and all his clan stop catullus youre too drunk to know what youre saying a man is never too drunk to make a poem just too drunk to make sense i think id better find my way home i looked up the alley beyond the lurid glow cast by the phallic lamp above the door the way was swallowed up by an unreassuring darkness ill walk you home offered catullus a drunken poet for a bodyguard what would happen if caelius and his friends decided to come after us quickly then do you know another route where no one would think to follow i know every path leading to and from the salacious tavern follow me he led me on a circuitous route slipping between warehouses set so close that i had to walk sideways to get through picking a way around trash heaps where rats scurried and squeaked and finally ascending a steep footpath up the western slope of the palatine it seemed a good route for avoiding assassins but rather treacherous for a man who had been drinking as much as catullus i expected him to fall and break his neck at any moment taking me with him but he attacked the climb with only an occasional misstep the climb seemed to sober him his lungs were certainly strong enough while i labored for breath he had plenty left over to give vent to his thoughts if only we could all become eunuchs he declared what man wouldnt be happier i suppose we could become eunuchs if we wanted ha the act is harder than you might think i know ive seen it with my own eyes while i was in bithynia i took a journey to the ruins of old troy to find the place where my brothers buried so far from home on the way back a stranger asked me if id like to see the initiation rites of the galli he wanted money of course took me to a temple on the slopes of mount ida the priests wanted money too i felt quite the gawking tourist dropping coins into all those eager hands just another crass thrillseeking roman looking for a taste of the real east they took me to a room so smoky with incense i could hardly see and so loud with flutes and tambourines i thought id go deaf the rite was under way the galli chanted and whirled in a weird dance like fingers of the goddess keeping time the young initiate had worked himself into a frenzy naked covered with sweat undulating with the music someone put a shard of broken pottery into his handsamian pottery the guide whispered in my ear the only kind sure to avoid a putrid wound while i watched the fellow turned himself into a gallus before my eyes all by himselfno one helped him it was quite a thing to see afterward when the blood was running down his legs and he couldnt stand any longer the others swarmed around him swaying chanting shrieking the guide sniggered and poked me in the ribs and made a show of covering his balls i ran out of the place in a panic catullus fell silent for a while we reached the top of the path and entered the maze of dark silent streets imagine the freedom catullus whispered to leave the appetites of the flesh behind the galli have appetites i said they eat like men yes but a man eats and is done with it the craving im talking about feeds on itself the more its fed the hungrier it grows a roman controls his appetites not vice versa then perhaps we arent romans any longer show me a man in rome whos larger than his appetites i thought about this while we made our way through the winding deepshadowed streets but even castration cant guarantee an end to passion catullus resumed look at trygonion what about him dont you know where his name comes from the famous epitaph by philodemus should i recognize that name barbarian philodemus of gadera probably the greatest living poet of the greek tongue oh that philodemus an epitaph you say written years and years ago for a dead gallus called trygonion can you follow the greek ill translate in my head very well here lies that tender creature of ladylike limbs trygonion prince of the sexnumb emasculates beloved of the great mother cybele he alone of the galli was seduced by a woman holy earth give to this headstone a pillow of budding white violets that old poem is how our trygonion got his name i dont remember what he was called before something phrygian and unpronounceable one time teasing him about his weakness for lesbia i called him our little trygonion the gallus who fell for a woman the name stuck to trygonion the way trygonion sticks to lesbia i think of him whenever i consider castrating myself it might do no good you see a useless gesture sometimes passion is stronger than flesh love can last beyond death and in some rare instances a mans weakness for beauty can even outlive his testicles trygonion is that devoted to lesbia he suffers as i suffer but with one great difference which is trygonion suffers without hope and you while a man still has his balls he has hope catullus laughed his peculiar barking laugh even slaves have hope as long as they have their balls but a gallus in love with a beautiful woman so much in love that he would do anything for her any at all without question so much in love that he might be blinded by jealousy driven mad by it he could be dangerous unpredictable not nearly as dangerous as lesbia catullus was suddenly giddy trotting ahead of me and circling back leaping up to swing at lamps hung from upperstory windows along the street damned bitch the medea of the palatine medea was a witch as i recall and rather wicked only because she was sick at heart wounded by cruel love as the playwright says a witch yes and woundedonly its me shes bewitched and caelius who wounded her medea of the palatine clytemnestraforaquadrans a quadrans as cheap as that why not the price of admission to the senian baths but clytemnestra murdered her husband agamemnon deserved it he whirled like a frenzied gallus medea of the palatine clytemnestraforaquadrans he chanted who calls her such things i do said catullus he abruptly stopped his whirling and staggered ahead of me gasping for breath i just made them up out of my head what do you think ill need some fresh invectives if im to get her attention again youre a strange suitor catullus i love a strange woman do you want to know a secret about her something that no else in all the world knows not even lesbius i wouldnt know myself if i hadnt spied on her one night do you know that giant monstrosity of a venus in her garden i happened to notice it yes the pedestal appears to be solid but its not theres a block that slides out opening a secret compartment its where she keeps her trophies trophies mementos keepsakes one night in bed with her happily dozing after hours of making love i felt a tickling at my groin i opened one eye to see her clipping away a bit of my pubic hair she stole out of the room with it i followed her to the garden from the shadows i watched her open the pedestal and put what she had taken from me inside later i went back and figured out how to open the compartment and i saw what she kept there poems i had sent her letters from her other lovers bits of jewelry clippings of hair childish gifts her brother must have given her when they were little her love trophies he suddenly staggered against a wall and clutched his face i wanted to destroy it all he whispered hoarsely i wanted to scoop up all her treasures and throw them on the brazier and watch them burst into flame but i couldnt i felt the eyes of the goddess on me i stepped back from the pedestal and looked up at her face i left her mementos alone if i destroyed them i knew she would never forgive me who would never forgive youvenus or lesbia he looked at me with tragic eyes is there any difference chapter eighteen the wrath ofachilles would pale beside the wrath ofbethesda her anger runs cold not hot it freezes rather than scalds it is invisible secretive insidious it makes itself felt not by blustering action but by cold calculated inaction by words unspoken glances unreturned pleas for mercy unheeded i think bethesda shows her anger in this passive way because she was born a slave and remained a slave for much of her life until i manumitted and married her to bear our daughter in freedom her way is the way of slaves and the hero of homers iliad she sulks and broods and bides her time it was bad enough that i had sent belbo home alone from clodias house leaving myself without a bodyguard to cross the palatine by night bad enough too that i eventually came home smelling of cheap wine and the rancid smoke of tavern lamps but to have spent the night with that woman this was ridiculous of course and i said so especially as i hadnt even seen clodia all night how then did i explain the lingering smell of perfume on me a smarter man or even myself less worn out and sleepy would have thought twice before explaining that the perfume came from a blanket that the lady in question must have put over him when he unwittingly dozed off in her garden that was that i spent what little remained of the night trying to find a comfortable position on a cramped dining couch in my study im used to sleeping with a warm body next to me im also used to sleeping until at least daybreak especially after having stayed up half the night this was not to be it wasnt that bethesda woke me she simply made it impossible for me to go on sleeping was it really necessary to send the scrub maid to clean my study before dawn once i was awake bethesda didnt refuse to feed me but the millet porridge was lumpy and cold and there was no conversation to warm it up after breakfast i shooed the scrub maid from my study and shut the door it was a good morning i decided to write a letter to my beloved son meto serving under the command ofgaius julius caesar in gaul from his loving father in rome may fortune be with you i write this letter only three days after my last martius is gone and the kalends of aprilis is upon us much has happened in the meantime all revolving about the murder of dio our neighbor marcus caelius now our former neighbor clodius evicted him has been accused of the murder of dio and related crimes having to do with the harassment of the egyptian envoys as well as a previous attempt by poison on dios life i have been hired by friends of the prosecution to help find evidence against caelius my only interest is to determine who killed dio so that i can put this nagging affair to rest for my own peace of mind if not for justices sake i will attempt to explain the details later perhaps after the trial which begins the day after tomorrow what is foremost in my mind now what i would long to discuss if you were here with me is something else what is this madness which poets call love what power compels a man to thrust himself against the lacerating indifference of a woman who no longer loves him what drives a woman to seek the absolute destruction of a man who rejects her what cruel appetite makes a man of rational intellect crave the debasement of his helpless partners in sex how does a eunuch supposedly impervious to love become enamored of a beautiful woman is it natural for a brother and sister to share a bed as we are told the gods and goddesses of egypt sometimes do why do the worshipers of the great mother emasculate themselves in religious ecstasy why would a woman steal a lock of her lovers pubic hair to cherish as a keepsake you must wonder if im mad to pose such questions but in fact they may have as much to do with the murder of dio and the upcoming trial of caelius as do the intrigues of egyptian politics and i find myself baffled i fear i have become too old for this kind of work which requires a mind in empathy with the world around it i like to think i am wiser than i used to be but what use is wisdom in making sense of a world that follows the dictates of mad passion i feel like a sober man on a ship of drunkards we say it is the hand of venus that compels these strange behaviors as if that put the matter to rest when in fact we say the hand of venus precisely because we do not understand these passions and cannot explain them only suffer them when we must and watch perplexed the suffering of others there was a rapping at the door i steeled myself for a chill wind and called come in but it was not bethesda who entered it was diana she closed the door behind her and sat in the chair across from my writing table there was a shadow on her face something was troubling her mother is angry at you she said is she i hadnt noticed what are you doing writing a letter to meto didnt you write to him just a few days ago yes what does the letter say this and that is it about your work in a way yes its about my work youre writing to meto because youve sent eco on a trip and you need someone to talk to isnt that it youre very perceptive diana she lifted her hand and pushed back a strand of hair that had fallen over her cheek what remarkably lustrous hair she had like her mothers before the strands of gray began to dull it it fell past her shoulders almost to her breasts framing her face and throat in the soft morning light her skin shone like dusky rose petals why dont you share your troubles with me papa mother does she tells me everything i suppose thats the way of the world mothers and daughters fathers and sons she looked at me steadily i tried to look back at her but found myself looking away the boys are older than you diana theyve shared my work my travels i smiled half the time when i begin a sentence eco finishes it and meto meto is different youre old enough to remember some of what happened while we were on the farmcatilina the trouble between meto and me metos decision to become a soldier that was a great test of the bond between us hes his own man now and i dont always understand him even so i can always tell him what i think but eco and meto arent even your flesh you adopted them i carry your blood papa yes diana i know why then are you so mysterious i thought and why is there such a gulf between us and why do i keep these thoughts to myself instead of speaking them aloud can i read the letter papa this took me aback i looked down at the parchment scrutinizing the words im not sure youd understand diana then you could explain im not sure id want to if you were older perhaps im not a child anymore papa i shook my head mother says im a woman now i cleared my throat yes well then i suppose you have every right to read your mothers personal letters thats cruel papa you know that mother cant read or write which is hardly her fault if she had been raised as a roman girl instead of an egyptian slave i thought was that what was disturbing diana her mothers origins the fact that she was the child of a woman born in slavery diana and i had never really talked about this but i assumed that bethesda had discussed it with her in some way they certainly spent enough time talking to each other in private did diana bear some resentment against me for having bought her mother in an alexandrian slave market but i was also the man who had freed bethesda it all seemed terribly complicated suddenly even most roman women dont learn to read diana the woman youre working for can read i imagine im sure she can and you made sure i was taught to read yes i did but what good is the skill if you forbid me to use it she looked at the letter in front of me it was uncanny the way she used her mothers stratagems to get what she wantedcircular logic stubborn persistence the uncovering of guilts i hadnt known i felt they say the gods can put on the guise of someone we know and move among us without anyone guessing for a brief strange moment a veil seemed to drop and i sensed that it was bethesda herself in the room with me disguised to confound me who was this creature diana after all and where had she come from i handed her the letter and watched her read it she read slowly moving her lips slightly she had not been taught as well as meto i expected her to ask the identity of the people i referred to or perhaps for a clearer explanation of the passions i described but when she put down the letter she said why do you want so badly to find the person who killed dio papa what is it i say in the letter for my own peace of mind but why should your mind be unsettled diana if someone who was close to you had been hurt wouldnt you want to avenge that person to redress the wrong done to them if you could she thought about this but dio wasnt close to you thats presumptuous of you diana you hardly knew him in a way thats true but in another way she picked up the letter is he the one you mean when you speak of the man of rational intellect yes as a matter of fact wasnt he a cruel man then i dont really know but in the letter you say yes i know what i say i cringed at the idea of hearing her read it aloud how do you know such a thing about him she peered at me intently i sighed from certain things i was told by the men who played host to him dio apparently took liberties with some of their slave girls he may have been rather abusive but i dont really know people dont like to talk about that sort of thing he wasnt that way when you knew him in alexandria if he was i knew nothing about it i saw a very different side of him she looked at me thoughtfully for a long moment it was not a look she had learned from bethesda it was a keen pensive look very deep and entirely her ownor perhaps she had picked it up from me i thought flattering myself how foolish and remote it suddenly seemed that strange disoriented moment when i had imagined she was her mother in disguise she stood and nodded gravely thank you for letting me read the letter papa thank you for talking to me then she left the room i picked up the letter and read it through again i winced at the catalogue i had made of other peoples passions and especially at what i had said of dio what cruel appetite makes a man of rational intellect crave the debasement of his helpless partners in sex what had i been thinking to put such thoughts in a letter i would wait until after the trial to write to meto when i had something of substance to relate i called on one of the slaves to light a taper from the fire in the kitchen and bring it to me when she returned i took the taper from her put the parchment into the empty brazier and burned it to ashes i spent the day snooping if caelius had indeed plotted to poison both dio and clodia where had he obtained the poison poisonings have become lamentably common in rome and in recent years i have become more familiar with deadly potions and powders than i would have dreamed possible from time to time considerable quantities of various kinds of poison pass through my own hands and i have a strongbox especially for storing them clients having seized a quantity of poison as evidence prefer to safeguard the stuff with me rather than in their own homes especially if they suspect a family member or a slave of wanting to do them in for a price anyone can obtain poison in rome but the reliable discreet sourcesthe sort to which i imagined caelius would goare relatively few over the years my work has acquainted me with most of them to one degree or another interviewing these creatures was a job i would rather have left to eco but since eco was away i set out to do it myself with a purse full of coins for bribes and belbo for protection it was a miserable task rather like hunting for snakes under rocks since i happened to know which stones the snakes preferred i simply went from one to the next lifting them up and bracing myself for a succession of unpleasant encounters the search took me to a number of disreputable shops on the outskirts of the forum over to the old rundown baths near the circus flaminius to the waterfront shipyards and warehouses of the navalia and finally following the advice of an informant back to the place that catullus had called the salacious tavern by the light of day it had an air more decrepit than salacious the gamblers were gone and the whores looked ten years older the only patrons were a few unshaven drunkards who looked incapable of getting up from their benches some whom i recognized from the previous night had apparently never left i had been told to seek out a man who called himself salax the tavern is named after him my source had joked he was easy enough to spot since in place of a real nose he wore a leather one whatever you do dont ask him how he lost his nose i had been warned he admitted readily enough to knowing marcus caeliusa frequent visitor to the tavernbut about poisons he declared himself completely ignorant and became no more knowledgeable even when i rattled my coin purse instead he pointed toward the idle whores and suggested another way to lighten my purse i had looked under all the rocks i knew the snakes had all bared their fangs and hissed but for better or worse not one of them had produced any poison it was possible even likely that caelius had obtained poison not on his own but from the same source which had hired or compelled him to harass the alexandrian envoysdirectly from king ptolemy or perhaps from the kings friend pompey in that case i could expect no luck at all in tracking the poison the network of spies and lackeys who worked for pompey and the king would reveal nothing to an outsider if caelius killed dio at the bidding of dios enemies why had he done so because he was in debt to pompey that seemed distinctly possible if so i might be able to find someone who at least knew of the debt i returned to the forum and sought out a different set of sources more conversant with politics than poison it was easy enough to find men willing to talk but impossible to find hard facts it was as clodius had said plenty of people professed to know the truth caelius tried to poison dio and failed then caelius and asicius together stabbed dio but no one seemed to have any real evidence i found men who had attended the trial of asicius and talked with them at length the common knowledge was that asicius was guilty and everyone knew it but among the judges the weakminded had been dazzled by ciceros defense and the weakwilled bribed by king ptolemys goldtogether a safe majority yet when i questioned these men about the trial itself about the speeches and the witnesses who had given evidence it seemed to me that the prosecution had been able to come up with little more than i hadhearsay and innuendo perhaps the judges had simply acquitted asicius for lack of proof it was a frustrating day the sun was beginning to set as belbo and i trudged up the ramp i suddenly realized that i had seen nothing of catullus all day perhaps i had finally convinced him that i was not his rival in love the absurdity of the notion made me smile but my smile stiffened when we reached the top of the ramp and i saw what was in front of my house belbo i must be seeing things i hope so what do you mean master do you see a group of idle bodyguards lounging outside my front door yes master and do their faces look familiar they do master an ugly lot and is that not a litter in their midst set against the wall while the bearers relax in the street it is master and does the litter not have red and white striped curtains drawn back so that we can see that the box is empty that is so master do you know what this means belbo he quailed at the realization i think so master cybele spare my manhood clodia is in my houseand so is bethesda one of clodias bodyguards had the temerity to challenge me outside my own front door fortunately the mans captain recognized me he berated his underling and then actually had the manners to apologize to me not all of clodiuss gangsters were completely uncivilized but every one of them looked capable of killing a man without blinking seeing them gathered outside my house set my teeth on edge once inside i drew aside a slave girl who was passing through the foyer is your mistress here yes master in the garden shhh keep your voice down do i have a visitor there is a visitor master yes tell me that your mistress is napping in the garden and that my visitor is quietly secluded in my study the slave looked at me perplexed no master the mistress is entertaining the visitor in the little garden at the back of the house oh dear has the visitor been here long quite some time master long enough to have finished the first ewer of wine and sent for another have you heard shouting no master harsh words she frowned please master i never eavesdrop but youd notice if your mistress had say strangled the other woman or vice versa the girl looked at me strangely then managed an uneasy laugh oh youre making a joke arent you master am i shall i go tell the mistress that youre home no just go on about your business as if id never come in i quietly made my way to the back of the house it was possible from a little passageway off my bedroom to look through a screen of ivy into the small private garden where bethesda and clodia were sitting they were not alone chrysis sat on a pillow at her mistresss feet diana was seated next to her mother holding her hand their voices were low hardly more than a murmur their tone was somber they seemed to be deep in serious discussion that was the last thing i had expected what on earth could these women have in common i reached out with my forefinger and pushed aside an ivy leaf to get a better look at clodia even in an unassuming stola of soft gray wool she was stunningly beautiful at least shed had the sense to put on decent clothing before she came calling at my house i looked at bethesda expecting to see jealousy on her face instead her expression was pensive and melancholy mirroring that of the other women clodias voice was so low that i had to strain to hear with me it was an uncle not bloodkin but one of my stepmothers brothers like you i kept it a secret i was fifteen a bit older than your diana my father had just betrothed me to my cousin quintus but with father away from rome the wedding had to wait that was quite all right by me i wasnt eager for marriage like some girls but of course if i had been married then perhaps she took a breath and went on uncle marcus had always looked at me in a certain way you know what i mean the other women nodded sympathetically perhaps it was the betrothal that set him off thinking that once quintus took me he would never have the chance again one day at the family horti he caught me alone she took a deep breath afterward one wonders how the gods could allow such a thing to happen you never told your stepmother said bethesda i hated her then i hated her even more after what uncle marcus did he was her brother after all i didnt trust her i thought she might take his side what about your own brothers said diana i should have told them i did tell publius but not until many years later after uncle marcus was dead but your sisterssurely you told them said bethesda my half sisters were closer to their mother than to me i couldnt trust them not to tell her no the only person i told was an old slave woman who had been with my father since long before i was born and i told her only when i began to realize that uncle marcus had planted a baby in me she showed me what to do but she warned me that if i aborted the child i might never be able to have sons a roman superstition bethesda clucked her tongue still it proved to be true that was another reason i never told my husband about what uncle marcus did to me and what followed quintus would have blamed me for giving him a daughter instead of a son he would probably have blamed me for tempting uncle marcus its the way men think quintus knew he wasnt the first but he never knew about uncle marcus he died never knowing i listened disturbed and then astonished by what clodia did next she leaned forward and took bethesdas hand the one diana was not already holding and pressed it between her palms but you said that it was the same with you bethesdathat you kept it a secret bethesda lowered her eyes who could i have told a free roman girl might have recourse to law or familybut an egyptian slave girl in alexandria the man had done the thing often to my mother while she lived she told me that the masters abuse would kill her in the end and it finally did after she died he turned to me i was much younger than you were clodia not even old enough to bear a child he did the thing to me only once or tried to i suppose he thought i would be docile like my mother but after the things she had told me i knew what to expect and i decided i would die before i let him have his way with me he tied my wrists with a rope the way he had tied her so many times he liked to hang her on a hook on the wall i had seen her like that seen what he did to her and when he tried to do the same things to me a kind of madness came into me the madness the gods put into men and women to give them strength beyond their bodies i was more limber than he realized i wriggled free it turned into a battle i bit him as hard as i could he threw me against the wall so hard i thought id been crushed like a beetle i couldnt breathe my heart stopped beating he could have had his way with me then he could have killed me he was a powerful respected man no one would have thought the less of him for the death of a slave no one questioned the death of my mother no one would have questioned my death oh mother diana drew closer to her clodia bit her lip chrysis bowed her head bethesdas eyes glittered but her cheeks remained dry i lay on the floor stunned i couldnt move not even a finger i waited for the sky to fall but do you know what he did he turned as white as a cloud mumbled a curse and left the room i think the shade of my mother must have spoken in his ear shaming him instead of having me killed he simply got rid of me he sent me to the slave market i was not a very satisfactory slave apparently she managed a brittle smile men would buy me and return me before the day was done i was sent back to be resold so many times that the man at the slave market made a joke of it i was still young i suppose i was beautifulalmost as beautiful as you diana but word spread among the buyers that i was poison and no one would bid on me finally of course the right man came for me i think it must have been a whim of the goddess the romans call venus that sent him to the slave market that day with barely enough coins in his purse i was the cheapest slave on the block and still he could barely afford me the other women laughed at that even as they wiped their eyes and your husband knows nothing of what happened to you before you met of what the man did to you and your mother said clodia nothing i never told him and i think i never will i told my daughter because i thought she should know what befell her grandmother and now i have told you i was appalled bewildered dumbfoundednot only at what bethesda had said and the fact that she had kept such a secret from me but at the unaccountable intimacy between the women in my garden what strange alchemy had transpired to make them so unguarded with one another where were the normal barriers of slavery and status that should have separated them the world seemed to tremble beneath my feet just as my fingers trembled as i closed my spyhole in the ivy and silently fled to my study chapter nineteen at length i sent a slave girl to inform bethesda that i had returned and was in my study clodia appeared soon after along with chrysis they were both smiling as if they had just shared a good laugh the visit with bethesda and diana had apparently ended on a happy note which confused me all the morehow could they speak of such dreadful things and then part laughing i dropped by to see if you had anything to report and you werent here said clodia feigning petulance i trust youve been busy on my behalf out scraping up something useful about caeliusperhaps some fresh news about those slaves he bribed to poison dio nothing as useful as that im afraid have you been here long a while i hope you werent bored not at all your wife made me feel very welcome did she yes good that was the gist of the interview and clodia and chrysis soon departed darkness fell dinner was served i was uneasy unable to look at bethesda or at diana in quite the usual way i asked bethesda what she had thought of our visitor an interesting woman was all she said i take it she put your mind to rest concerning my whereabouts last night yes bethesda did not elaborate well good alls back to normal then i was never aware of any disruption to our routine said bethesda i bit into a crust of bread this saved me from biting my tongue it was a quiet meal as the last course of savory onions with wine was served bethesda cleared her throat our visitor invited us to a party a party the day after tomorrow clodia says she has a party every year to mark the beginning of the great mother festival and she invited you bethesda bristled at my skepticism she invited both of us i dont think the sort of parties clodia throws are likely to be i shall be hard pressed to find a suitable stola for the occasion she peered thoughtfully into the middle distance contemplating her wardrobe i sighed for bethesda a personal invitation from a patrician like clodia must have seemed almost too good to be true an opportunity not to be missed an acceptance into palatine society i was surprised myself though i was beginning to learn not to be surprised by anything clodia did later that night in bed bethesda pressed herself against me and asked me to hold her as i took her in my arms i longed to tell her that i knew her secret that i understood her silence that it made no difference but the words did not come instead i used my hands and lips and tongue to show her what i felt afterward contented she fell into a deep sleep but i remained awake long into the night staring into the darkness above wondering how a man can ever think he knows the whole truth of anything the next morning i sent a messenger to ecos house to see if he had returned the messenger came back with the news i expected eco was not yet back he would come to me as soon as he arrived i thought no matter what the hour if he didnt arrive soon anything he discovered would be of no use the trial would begin the next morning i decided to spend the day in my study rather than to go down to the forum again to search for evidence concerning caelius and poison i had spoken in enough ears word of what i was seeking would continue to spread without me perhaps a limb that was barren yesterday would bear fruit today if so it would be wise to stay where any messenger could be sure to find me and of course eco might arrive at any moment i began another letter to meto and ended by burning it as i had the last the thing on my mind was not something i could share with him in a letter bethesda and diana spent the day sewing in the garden they seemed to be in good spirits talking to one another in low voices and laughing i watched in silence content merely to observe like a guardian keeping watch on the living it was not an informer but trygonion who finally came knocking at my door that afternoon so frantically that belbo made no effort at all to restrain the little gallus from rushing into my study come he cried trembling and gasping for breath come at once what now trygonion i sighed hes done it hes actually done it despite all her precautions oh cybele damn his eyes he clutched his face and stamped his feet trygonion whats happened hes poisoned her shes dying oh please come at once it was no wonder that trygonion was out of breath he had run all the way from clodias house and expected me to run all the way back with him we arrived in the little deadend street like gasping runners after a marathon the door to clodias house was not even shut but stood open as trygonion had left it hurry he grabbed my hand and pulled me after him he was surprisingly strong for one who looked so delicate i tried to keep up but he was faster and ended up dragging me through the foyer and the atrium across the central garden under the portico and down a long hallway outside a doorway hung with a heavy curtain a group of slaves were gathered murmuring among themselves they parted for trygonion who pulled me past the curtain into the room beyond outside was bright sunshine but inside the room it might have been midnight the windows like the door were covered with heavy curtains the only illumination came from a few lamps which burned very low as my eyes adjusted to the darkness i saw clodia reclining on a sleeping couch with ornately carved ivory legs and plush pillows she was covered with a woolen blanket her face and hands looked pale and waxen in the dim light trygonion she whispered mistress he cried addressing her as if he were her slave he ran to her side and took her hand i came back as quickly as i could is gordianus with you yes save your breath please why do you think i have so little left she laughed weakly the gallus contorted his face trygonion thinks im going to die she said turning her glittering eyes to me what happened clodia i think it must have been something i ate she made an arch expression then winced have you summoned a physician my brother owns a very skilled healer who happens to know a great deal about poisons publius has reason to be concerned about poison as you can imagine the physician came while trygonion was gone hes outside the door now i imagine i couldnt stand having him in the room with me what did he say asked trygonion frantically he said i think it must have been something you ate she smiled wanly he wanted to know how much of the powder i swallowed and when early this morning i told him but i felt no ill effects until almost midday he says im very lucky to have eaten so little of it as it is what powder i said didnt trygonion explain no time we ran all the way the gallus said the powder that i came across in the kitchen she said imagine that how many mornings have i ventured into the kitchen before my breakfast is ready never but today for some reason i was awake early and hungry and when i called for chrysis she didnt come so i went to the kitchen myself you should have seen how chrysis jumped when i stepped into the room she stood by a little table and on the table was a bowl of honeyed millet is that for me i said chrysis said nothing i walked to the bowl and saw the little box beside it and the crumbly yellow powder inside the box some sort of spice i said i suspected nothing you see a crumbly yellow powder yes not like any spice i know of i touched my finger to my tongue dabbed it in the powder and touched my tongue again i did it without thinking the powder didnt taste at all bad really only a bit earthy then i saw the look on chrysiss face all at once i knew i heard a strange whimpering behind me i turned my head the whimpering seemed to come from the opposite corner of the room from near the floor i thought it might be a dog then my eyes caught a slight movement higher up i peered into the deepshadowed gloom confused then suddenly perceived the shape of a body suspended upside down from the roof it was a nude woman hanging from a rope tied around her ankles twisting very slightly she whimpered again silence shouted clodia she sat upright then fell back against her pillows trygonion fretted over her until she slapped his fawning hands away i sent for trygonion at once he came running from the house of the galli he was the one who thought of sending for publiuss physician i waited and waited for the man to come it turned out he was down at the herb market and no one knew where he had gone at first i wasnt worried i felt fine then at midday the discomfort began and the physician still hadnt arrived i took to my bed and trygonion kept fretting over me until i thought to send him for you gordianus why me you must know more than most men about poisons i thought you might be able to tell me something about the yellow powder fetch it trygonion he tore himself from her side and went to a little table crowded with tiny boxes and bottles a burnished mirror was hung on the wall above the table reflecting the somber light of the lamps and affording a startling glimpse of chrysis hanging from the ceiling across the room trygonion returned with a little pyxis i stepped to the nearest lamp and studied the contents is it too dark to see said clodia i cant have the lamps any brighter the light hurts my eyes i can see well enough i may be wrong but i suspect this is a substance called gorgons hair it comes from the root of a plant that grows wild on the shores of mauretania it used to be quite rare in rome but one sees it more and more nowadays its very potent acts fairly quickly and has almost no flavor so that it can be mixed with almost any kind of food clodia closed her eyes and nodded you see trygonion i told you that gordianus would know the physician said the same thing did he explain the effects he hardly needed to ive discovered them for myself dizziness nausea a sensation of coldness a painful sensitivity to light she nodded keeping her eyes shut how much did you swallow only that single small taste once i saw the look on chrysiss face i knew what id done again i heard the whimpering from the corner of the room silence cried clodia if you swallowed no more than that then ill survive yes thats what the physician said it would be a stupid physician who told a powerful dangerous woman that she was going to die if there was even the slightest possibility that she might survive the powerful do not appreciate being given bad news especially if it turns out to be false better for the physician to assure his masters sister that she would live if she didnt she would be in no position to vent her disappointment on him but the physician was probably right i knew something of gorgons hair and its effects and such a small dose seemed unlikely to kill her if the physician said youll be better then im sure dont you have your own opinion her voice was sharp you recognized the poison you must know how it works i know many poisons by sight but its others who use them not me of course youre not going to die trygonion insisted clodia allowed him to fuss with her blanket and caress her hands i thought youd forestalled the poison plot against you i said so did i but that farce at the senian baths must have been only a diversion staged by caelius he wanted me to think i had got the better of him when all the time his viper was already at my breast the slave i trusted more than any other over in the corner chrysis whimpered and twisted in space my eyes had grown used to the darkness and i was able to see her more clearly her smooth naked flesh was scored with mottled stripes the little spy weeps because i had her beaten said clodia in a low voice her punishment has only begun she confessed to you not yet but caelius must have spies in my house just as i have spies in his who better than chrysis and i caught her in the act of poisoning my food if i hadnt happened to step into the kitchen at that moment why do you think this poison came from caelius clodia gave me such a withering look that i sucked in my breath had catullus ever known that look then she shuddered and winced and shut her eyes who else she demanded in a weak voice we know he already had the poison what i didnt know was the slave he would use to get the stuff into my house chrysis not barnabas you think this is the same poison that he tested on his own slave of course its not she bit her lips and shifted beneath the blanket what do you mean the poison caelius administered to his slave acted very quickly you told me so yourself and i assume that your spies gave you an accurate report the slave died in agony you said while caelius watched it took only moments you said this cant be the same poison the mauretanians say that gorgons hair is like a coiled snake in the belly once ingested it bides its time before striking the victim feels no ill effects for a while then the symptoms come on suddenly you told me that you tasted the powder in the morning but felt no effects until midday that hardly sounds like caeliuss quickacting poison so he decided to use a different poison perhaps if youd let me id like to take whats left of this poison with me if i remember correctly i happen to have a bit of gorgons hair at my house locked in a box where i keep such things my son eco had been given the stuff months ago by a man whose wife was trying to poison him eco passed it on for safekeeping to me he wont have poison in his house because of the twins id almost forgotten about it i should like to compare this powder with the bit i have at home clodia hesitated be sure to return it she whispered closing her eyes its evidence against caelius the interview seemed to be over clodia turned uncomfortably on the bed chrysis twisted from the ropes then trygonion bent close to clodias ear and said in a low voice the other box she frowned mistress the other box he said again the grimace she made came from something other than physical discomfort yes show him let him see for himself trygonion took the box of poison from me he went to the little cosmetics table and came back holding a different pyxis in the palm of his hand with his nose wrinkled and his arm extended as if to keep the thing as far from himself as possible i recognized it at once its the same pyxis licinius was carrying at the senian baths i said are you sure whispered clodia bronze with raised knobs and inlays of ivory exactly the same the brute the monster said trygonion thrusting the box at me go on look inside it arrived this morning said clodia left by a messenger on the front doorstep what was he thinking to torture me with this obscene joke while i lay dying is he laughing even now she sucked in a shuddering breath and began to sob i took the tiny box from trygonion and opened the lid within was a pearly opalescent liquid perhaps a kind of lotion or cream i thought i touched my finger to it and gave such a start that i dropped the box spilling its contents on the floor trygonion stared at the globules of congealed semen with fascinated revulsion damn him clodia thrashed on the bed trygonion rushed to her i backed away and bumped into the cosmetics table i turned and stared blindly at the unguents and philters among them i noticed a little clay figurine of attis cybeles eunuch consort exactly like the ones i had seen in the room of lucius lucceiuss wife the dim lamplight caught his red cap and lit up his serenely smiling face clodia continued to moan and curse trygonion hovered over her the dropped pyxis lay on the floor its spattered contents glistening in the lamplight i backed away again one of the lamps began to gutter and the room grew darker i bumped into something solid but yielding the rope made a cracking noise above and behind me a low whimpering rose from below with a start i turned and realized i had collided with the suspended body of chrysis seen upside down in the flickering light her staring eyes and nostrils were so grotesque that her face became inhuman unreadable her lips moved i bent my head straining to hear but her whisper was drowned by clodias sobbing cry behind me punish her punish her again beyond the heavy curtain that blocked the door i heard a murmur and a rustling among the slaves gathered in the hall i stared at chrysiss soundlessly moving lips hardly knowing what i was seeing then finally came to my senses i stepped toward the door and pushed my way past the curtain the slaves in the hallway scattered and regrouped like brooding hens as i made my way down the hall a figure approached and passed me taking long quick steps toward clodias room it was the slave barnabas clutching a leather whip between his fists he stared straight ahead his jaw tightly clenched his face was drained of all emotion except for his eyes in which i glimpsed a strange mixture of determination and dread at home i found bethesda going through her wardrobe trying to find something suitable to wear for clodias party what do you think the blue stola or the green one and for a necklacethe carnelian beads or the lapis lazuli ones you gave me last year im afraid its rather unlikely that therell be a party after all but why not clodia is ill to explain what had just transpired at clodias house was beyond my energy perhaps shell feel better in the morning said bethesda frowning perhaps well see whether she shows up at the trial tomorrow morning yes the trial she wont miss that shell have to feel better and then shell have the party after all shes put so much planning into it into the trial into the party silly i nodded no word from eco none i suddenly realized that i had forgotten the box of gorgons hair which i had intended to borrow from clodia to compare with the poison stored in my own strongbox i had no desire to go back for it for the moment i forgot about it chapter twenty bethesdawas prescient in the morning when we went down to the forum to watch the trial clodia was already there in the great square in front of the rostra seated behind the prosecutors in the midst of a great many of her retainers she was pale and her eyes were listless but the crisis had apparently passed she looked in our direction and smiled wanlynot at me i realized but at bethesda who nodded and smiled in return for me clodia had no smile only a raised eyebrow as if to ask if i had any last bit of information to give her i pursed my lips and shook my head eco had still not returned and none of my nets had snagged a fish it was the day before the beginning of the great mother festival for six days rome would celebrate with games and competitions religious processions and plays private parties and public ceremonies after the festival members of the senate would briefly reconvene before taking their traditional aprilis holiday at their country estates rome would shut down like a great gristmill grinding to a halt on the eve of all this the mood in the forum was a combination of rush and relaxation hectic hurry to take care of final business together with the delicious anticipation of the coming days of indolence and pleasure this giddy mood was heightened even more by the raucous atmosphere which always attends a major trial especially a trial as rich with the promise of scandal as this one with no other courts in session every advocate in rome was in attendance and with so much recent debate over the egyptian situation and dios death most of the senate had come to watch those wise enough to plan ahead had sent slaves to the forum at dawn to put down folding chairs and hold places for them i had sent belbo to do just that for bethesda and myself i scanned the cluttered rows and spotted him waving to us from an excellent place near the front just behind the benches where the seventyodd judges would sit we made our way to our seats before belbo withdrew to the great crowd of gawkers and idlers that continued to gather at the periphery i told him to keep an eye out for eco who might still show up at the last moment before us beyond the judges benches was the open square from which the advocates would deliver their speeches to the left sat the prosecutors with their assistants and witnesses this was where clodia sat barnabas sat next to her and nearby i recognized busy fingers vibennius and several others who had taken part in the fruitless chase at the senian baths directly opposite the prosecutors to our right were the benches of the defendant accompanied by his advocates family supporters and character witnesses the parents of marcus caelius were dressed all in black as if in mourning his mothers eyes were puffy and red and her cheeks were wet with tears his father had white stubble on his jaw and unkempt hair giving him the look of a man half crazy with worry the parents of every accused man show up in court looking just the same if caelius had children they would have been standing in rags weeping such traditional means of evoking pity in the judges began so long ago that no advocate would consider allowing his clients family to show up looking less than wretched seated beside caelius were his two advocates cicero was looking leaner and sharper than when i had seen him last a year of bitter exile had trimmed his belly taken in his jowls and polished his eyes to a fine glitter gone was the fat complacency that had settled on him after his year as consul and his triumph over catilina in its place was a look at once haunted and eagerhaunted because he had learned that rome could turn viciously against him eager because he had successfully lashed back at his enemies and was again in the ascendant the eagerness in his eyes recalled the headstrong young advocate i had first met many years ago but the hard set of his jaw and the bitter line of his lips belonged to a much older man as an advocate cicero had been ambitious unscrupulous and brilliant from the very beginninga dangerous man to take on in a court of law now he looked more formidable than ever as for marcus crassus the richest man in rome seemed to have stopped aging in recent years he was a few years older than i but looked closer to forty than sixty some joked that crassus had made a deal with the gods to let him grow richer with passing time instead of older if so even that deal was not sweet enough to satisfy him he looked as stern and discontented as ever crassus was a man who could never succeed enough for his own satisfaction this restlessness drove him from triumph to triumph in the arenas of finance and politics setting a pace that his less gifted colleagues could not hope to match and bitterly resented beside these two old foxes marcus caelius looked strikingly young and fresh almost boyish a good nights sleep or some other tonic had erased the slack dissolution i had seen on his face at the salacious tavern caelius had always been a mime of sorts able to put on roles and shrug them off to suit the moment and for this occasion he mimed the brighteyed innocence of youth with uncanny precision his cleverness had gotten him into trouble before in recent years he had strayed from his mentors crassus and cicero perhaps even betrayed them in the pursuit of his own fortunes they might reasonably have turned their backs on him now but all differences had apparently been reconciled they were three foxes sitting in a row i turned my eyes from the defense to the prosecution leading them was young lucius sempronius atratinus if caelius looked fresh beside his weathered advocates atratinus looked positively childlike he was only seventeen barely a man in the eyes of the law but youthful passion can count for much with roman judges who have sat through too many speeches to be much impressed by false indignation or tired blustering no matter how experienced the advocate young atratinuss interest in prosecuting caelius was the extension of a family feud it was atratinuss father bestia against whom caelius made his notorious pun about the finger of guilt atratinuss pursuit ofcaeliuss destruction was a virtuous act in the eyes of a roman court where loyalty to fathers counts for so much flanking atratinus were his fellow prosecutors i knew little about them lucius herennius balbus was a friend of bestias and more familiar to me by sight than by ear i had never heard him argue a case but the sight of his wellfed body scurrying back and forth in the forum like a giant egg wearing a toga eco had once said was impressed on my memory publius clodius was the third prosecutornot clodias brother but one of his freedmen who accordingly bore the same name thus the clodii were represented among the prosecutors in an indirect way as they no doubt preferred by name but not by blood gnaeus domitius the presiding magistrate mounted his tribunal the judges were sworn in the trial commenced with the reading of the formal charges there were five charges in all the first four dealt with incidents of violence against foreign dignitaries whose persons were sacrosanct violence against them was technically violence against their protector the roman state and so qualified for prosecution under the law against political terror the charges were grave that marcus caelius masterminded attacks at neapolis to intimidate the newly arrived alexandrian delegation that he instigated a riot against the delegation at puteoli that he perpetrated arson against the delegation during their stay at the property of palla on their way to rome that he attempted to poison the head of the delegation dio and subsequently took part in dios murder to these was added another new allegation that caelius had attempted to poison clodia there were reactions of surprise among many in the crowd including bethesda what are they talking about she whispered i shrugged and tried to look ignorant you told me she was ill not poisoned i put a finger to my lips and nodded toward the defendants bench where crassus had risen to make a statement it should be noted by our presiding magistrate gnaeus domitius and by the judges that this final charge is a new one appended by the prosecution only yesterday in fact the defense has hardly been given the customary amount of time to prepare an argument in response to so serious an accusation thus we would be within our rights to protest the inclusion of this charge indeed to insist that it be thrown out and argued in a separate trial or if it is to be included to demand a postponement of this trial further given that this is a court convened solely to try cases of political violence it hardly seems suitable to include a charge of attempted poisoning against a private citizen however as the prosecution seems to believe that this charge is in fact related to the others and as my esteemed friend and colleague marcus cicero assures me that he is fully prepared to defend our client against it we make no objection to its inclusion in this trial crassus nodded gravely to the presiding magistrate and the judges and sat on ciceros face i saw the quiver of a smirk barely repressed it was a look i knew well the great orator was feeling smug about something could it be that he was secretly pleased to have the charge of the attempted poisoning of clodia included among the rest what conjurers trick was he planning this time formalities concluded the trial could begin the three prosecutors would speak first then caelius and his advocates would respond after the orations witnesses for both sides would deliver their statements given the number of speakers and the numerous charges to be discussed the trial would surely last for more than one day a roman trial is only ostensibly about establishing guilt or innocence at rome all trials are to some extent political and a trial for political violence is overtly so roman judges are not merely citizens seeking the truth about a specific act they are a committee of the state and their purpose is to make a political as well as a moral judgment a trial typically deals with the whole life of the accusedhis reputation family connections political affiliations sexual practices virtues vices judgment is rendered not merely on whether the accused did or did not commit a specific crime but on the entire character of the accused and for the good of the body politic as a whole cicero himself put it plainly at a trial held the year before his own exile when rendering their verdict judges must consider the good of the community and the needs of the state moreover everyone knows that judges are more influenced by the orations of the advocates than by the testimony of the witnesses who follow arguments count for more than witnesses as cicero has often said the deductions a good orator draws from the internal evidence of a case asserting because of this it stands to reason that are more persuasive than the bald statements of any given witness no matter that the witness testifies under oath or in the case of slaves under torture atratinus rose to deliver the first speech his clear young voice carried exceedingly well and his oratorical delivery if not polished to a dazzling shine had the ring of sincerity atratinus dwelled exclusively on caeliuss characterhis wellknown dissipation his extravagance the disreputable haunts he was known to frequent atratinuss righteous indignation would have sounded forced and false coming from many older advocates but atratinus was young and unsullied enough to be credible when he frowned on caeliuss excesses caelius was untrustworthy said atratinus no wise man would turn his back on caelius or else caelius was likely to slander and mock him as he had slandered and mocked his own mentors behind their backs chose who were at this very moment closest to him his notorious lack of respect for these men was sadly evident to everyone else in the court except themselves apparently now that he had finally gotten himself into more trouble than he could handle the crass opportunist was only too happy to make use of the elders he had betrayed not only his mentors but his own father whom he had abandoned to go live by himself in a palatine apartment where he could indulge all his vices away from paternal and make fun of the humble house on the quirinal hill from which he had fled and to which he had now unwillingly returned in his distress there were more sincere ways to show respect to ones father atratinus insisted pausing with a meaningful smile so that no one would miss the example he himself presented nor would it be wise for any woman to turn her back on caelius he said for the fellow was capable of far worse than mockery and slander as we would see when the charge of the attempted poisoning of clodia was dealt with by another speaker atratinus played on these themes of dissipation and disreputable conduct turning them over and over as a man turns a jewel in his hand to see the various ways it catches the light by turns he sought to outrage the judges to appeal to sentiment to make them laugh politically he said caelius had flirted with the cause of the depraved revolutionary catilina sexually he had assaulted the wives of roman citizens witnesses would be called to verify these charges witnesses would also be called to attest to caeliuss violent nature there was the case of a senator named fufius whom caelius had beaten up at the pontifical elections in front of a crowd of horrified onlookers and if these indications of caeliuss character were not damning enough consider the way he swaggered and strutted and spat out his speeches when playing the prosecutor at other mens trials or debating in the senate and the appalling color of the stripe on his senatorial toga where everyone elses was traditionally somber almost black his was a garishly bright bold purple at the reminder of this impropriety i saw quite a few judges nod their gray heads worst of allbecause it was this vice which most seriously threatened to destroy the republicwas caeliuss extravagance with money in this caelius represented the very worst aspect of his generation which was set so firmly apart from wiser more senior men such as the judges as well as from less experienced but more virtuous young men of atratinuss age who looked on the spendthrift habits of men like caelius with dread and dismay what would become of the republic if such men were not stopped they squandered fortunes on licentious behavior and spent huge sums on electoral bribery corrupting everyone and everything they touched then finding themselves bankrupt as they inevitably must and stripped by their own debauchery of all moral sense such men resorted without hesitation to the most fiendish crimes to replenish their coffers to get his hands on egyptian gold caelius had covered his hands with egyptian blood in so doing he had cast a bloody stain on the dignity and honor of the roman state if ever there was a case which proved the sad necessity for courts such as this one this is that case if ever there was a man who full deserved the condemnation of this court marcus caelius is that man so atratinus concluded i turned to bethesda and asked what she thought rather too young for my taste she said but a pleasant voice the freedman publius clodius spoke next his speech dealt with the first three charges against caelius where atratinus had shown a kind of prim distaste at having to pollute himself with cataloguing caeliuss crimes clodius attacked with the relish of a man wielding a redhot poker he did not hesitate to make crude jabs and thrusts but he also pulled back from time to time confident in his weapons power to inflict damage even from a distance paroxysms of disgust were punctuated with abrupt full stops during which standing stockstill and emotionless clodius would deliver some of his most acid comments eliciting gasps and laughter from the crowd it was a technically dazzling speech the virtues or vices of caeliuss character might ultimately be matters of opinion he conceded especially in a time when so many romans had become sadly confused about such things but the outrages committed against the alexandrian envoys were simple matters of fact a hundred of the most respected men in egypt had come to rome to petition the senate as ambassadors they carried the protection of the gods and the state yet they had been met with unremitting violence intimidation fire and ultimately murder word of this scandal had spread from the pillars of hercules to the borders of parthia undermining romes prestige with her subjects and allies and inflaming her already precarious relations with the volatile kingdom of egypt the places and dates of these attacks were well documented the prosecution would produce witnesses who would swear that in each instance at neapolis at puteoli and at pallas estatemarcus caelius had been seen in the vicinity shortly before the attack in the company of known assassins further as other witnesses would attest caelius had been heard shamelessly bragging in public about his part in the massacres what sort of man was so imprudent as to boast of engineering such atrocities clearlya man with the depraved character of marcus caelius clodius proceeded to give a vivid account of each attack piling on gory details painting tableaus of pity and terror invoking the shades of the unavenged dead why he asked had marcus caelius perpetrated such violence the reason was obvious for financial gain a man like marcus caelius from a humble but respectable family could hardly engage in the high living he was famous for without incurring massive debts witnesses would be called to document his reckless spending habits if caelius wished to dispute these witnesses and if he had nothing to hide let him open his private account books for the court was he willing to do that if not why not because clodius alleged those account books would reveal the payments caelius had received to mount his campaign of terror against the alexandrian envoys to finance his own disgusting pleasures caelius had sold out the good name of the whole roman people clodiuss indignation came to an appropriately thunderous climax that had the crowd stamping their feet with appreciation he returned to the bench mopping sweat from his forehead like a boxer i turned to bethesda and raised an eyebrow well everybody knows that freedmen try harder she said but all that blustering and waving of arms only makes me nervous i noticed you fidgeting afraid for your precious marcus caelius oratory is all very well when there are no facts to go on she said i looked at her amazed as i always am when she unexpectedly quotes some old roman proverb its natural of course that she should pick up such things from me and from going to trials but theres something jarring about hearing them repeated with an egyptian accent and so far she said theyve said nothing about the death of dio nor about any attempt to poison clodia i suspect that will come next lucius herennius balbus mounted the rostra to conclude for the prosecution if atratinus had played outraged youth herennius was the stern admonishing uncle castigating caeliuss character from an older wiser but no less scandalized perspective he began and ended his speech by reciting the litany of caeliuss vices in between he dealt with the death of dio and the bare escape of a certain roman lady who had the misfortune to know more about caeliuss crimes than was healthy for her that lady he said would testify about a loan which she had made to caelius ostensibly to put on games in his hometown for the sake of his political careerwhen in fact no such games had taken place the money she lent him had been used to bribe slaves in the house of lucius lucceius in an attempt to murder dio by poison and thus put an end once and for all to the decimated alexandrian delegation by destroying its leader that particular plot had failed but dio alerted to the danger had fled to another house and it was there that he eventually met his end by whose hand everyone in the court must know the assassin publius asicius never mind that asicius had been acquitted at his own trial it was common knowledge that the prosecution and defense had conspired together to throw the case in asiciuss favor caelius and asicius partners in so many other vices had been partners in this outrage as wellwitnesses would be called who would place the two very close to the house where dio was staying on the night of his murder like a tree with many branches the alexandrian delegation had been ruthlessly hacked away limb by limb until only the trunk remained caelius had not been satisfied until that too was destroyed here herennius delivered an encomium to dio reciting his many honors and achievements naming the men who had bravely given him shelter in his days of despair mourning the loss of so brilliant a philosopher lamenting the shame that had been visited upon rome by his murder what of the final charge against caelius that of ruthlessly seeking the death by poison of a great roman lady the descendant of one of the citys oldest and proudest families the widow of one of her most distinguished citizens the lady was present and would strength permitting testify herself to the outrage plotted against her at one point caelius had aligned himself with the ladys brother just one more of his fickle nevertobetrusted alliancesand this brought him into the ladys acquaintance sad day for her young and goodlooking caelius was a quite charmer to be sureproof of that was the fact that hed talked two men hed stabbed in the back into representing him today using all his skills he had charmed the lady out of a rather large loan later she had cause to regret her trust in the scoundrel not only because the loan was never repaidtypical predictable but because with mounting horror she realized the use to which caelius had put the money his egyptian coffers had run dry but his mission was not yet finished so he used her gold to bribe another mans slaves to poison dio the realization shocked the lady to her senses disgusted with caeliuss indecency and his murderous bent outraged that she had been duped into financing his crimes she decided to do something about it she agreed to appear as a witness at this trial a brave act to make herself the enemy of a murdererand almost fatal as it turned out to silence her caelius decided to poison her those of us who have attended all too many trials for murder know the sad pattern said herennius lowering his voice to a confidential tone let a man once descend to using poison on another human being and sooner or later he will try the same thing again poisoning becomes a habit a secret vice like certain other things men do in the dark until he is stopped by the law or by the gods a poisoner will repeat his vile crime over and over again thus having fallen into this vice with his attempt on dioif indeed it was his first poisoningcaelius not surprisingly resorted to poison to rid himself of the troublesome lady he tested the stuff first on one of his own slaves not on one of his old trusted slaves to be sure caelius had purchased a slave specifically to test his poison as one might buy a cheap garment intending to use it as a rag and then throw it away if he cared to deny the fact let caelius produce that slave in court alive and well then caelius approached some of the ladys slaves like a typical poisoner repeating the same mode of operation and tried to bribe them to administer the poison but the loyal slaves betrayed the plot to their mistress and she cleverly sought to trap caeliuss agent in the act of handing over the deadly stuff herennius proceeded to give a completely straightfaced account of the disaster at the senian baths which provoked some snickering among the spectators the story had made the rounds to verify the incident he said the slaves whom caelius had thought to suborn would testify so that they would not have to suffer the indignities of torture and to reward them for their loyalty these slaves had been manumitted and would testify as freedmen herennius sighed with exasperation caeliuss attempt to poison dio failed so did his first attempt on the lady but still caelius did not give up only hours ago the lady came very close to death thanks to caeliuss relentless insidious efforts to do her in look at her now at her pale face and languid eyes at her helpless trembling one need only see her to know that something truly terrible has transpired what awful thing was done to her you ask but no i shall refrain from relating the sordid details of this latest almost successful attempt to murder her since the gods have seen fit to spare her from caeliuss murderous plots let her tell the story let the tale of her hairbreadth escape emerge from her own shocking testimony i only pray to the gods that she will continue to recover and be strong enough to testify regarding this latest outrage the judges would also hear the written confession of the wretched slave girl caelius had seduced into betraying her mistress her testimony was even now being extracted under torture as the law required there would also be a third surprise witness to corroborate herennius cast a chilly smile at the bench opposite that mans testimony should be of special interest to the defense i imagine the esteemed marcus cicero himself has declared this witness to be the most honest man in rome wait until you hear what that fellow has to tell us about the attempts to poison this lady cicero i wonder what youll have to say then about the depraved murderer sitting beside you this struck me as a clever but dangerous ploy on the part of herennius to leave a damaging revelation to his witnesses so that it could emerge as a surprise at the very end of the trial rather than to include it in his oration where he could shape and deliver the accusation himself the advantage was the sympathy to be stirred by a poison survivor telling her own story the defense would be hardpressed to anticipate and neutralize ahead of time any surprises that might emerge from such testimony who i wondered was this alleged most honest man in rome i looked at cicero to catch his reaction and found him oddly enough staring straight at me chapter twenty one i dont believe for a moment that he poisoned her said bethesda any more than i believe that he killed the egyptian after three long orations the court had adjourned early so that the defense advocates could present their responses in succession on the following day bethesda and i immediately headed home where she proceeded to get ready for clodias party even though nightfall was still hours away but clodia insists that he did shes mistaken bethesda frowned at the burnished mirror she held in her hand this necklace will never do hand me the silver one it cant be both ways i said one of them is lying what a pity that you have to choose between clodia and caelius what a choice for anyone to have to make right now i am trying to choose a necklace she said the silver one please i searched her dresser for a silver necklace and found myself lost amid the clay jars of unguents and little glass vials of perfume my eye caught a flash of bright red whats this what i picked up the little clay figure of attis identical to the ones i had seen in the room of lucceiuss wife and on clodias dresser the smiling eunuch stood with his hands on his fat belly with a bright red phrygian cap on his head bethesda glimpsed its reflection and put down her mirror you shouldnt touch that where did it come from it came while we were at the trial today i asked where it came from not when its a gift who sent it who do you think bethesda took the statue from me she put it back on the dresser then scooped up a long silver necklace and reached for her mirror youre hopeless go away and tell diana to come help me dress we arrived at clodias door at the last moment of twilight when the hard edges of the world begin to soften and grow hazy like the mind of a man ready for sleep but while the world might be drowsy the partygoers at clodias house were wide awake the brightly lit dining room off her garden was alive with music and conversation slaves were jus beginning to show the guests to their places at the dining couches when we arrived it was an odd mixture of impeccably dressed patricians and scruffylooking young poets of radical politicians and aging courtesans of exoticlooking foreigners and even a few galli the air was heavy with the worldweary sophistication that passes for style in rome these days bethesda clutched my arm on her face was a look so unlike her that it took me a moment to figure out what it was panic what are we doing here she whispered attending what appears to be a very fashionable party with very fashionable people why i think it was you who insisted that we come i said dryly i must have been out of my mind take me home at once but we havent eaten yet the smells wafting from the kitchen made my mouth water we havent even said hello to our hostess that is exactly why we should go this instant it will be as if we never came bethesda this is absurd look at me i stepped back and did just that yes i see a beautiful woman immaculately dressed and made up she looks like no one else here exactly anyone can tell i dont belong why not im not even roman of course you are youre my wife were not rich no one could tell from the jewelry youre wearing my accent it gives you an air of mystery im the oldest woman here youre the most beautiful woman here hes absolutely right you know i turned to see catullus at my elbow holding a cup of wine and wearing a slack grin gratidianus i didnt expect to see you here clodia invited us said bethesda a little too insistently she invited me too do you believe it said catullus against her better judgment im sure or against her brothers judgment anyway but hes not herebusy with tomorrows festivitiesand i am so to hades with him let nothing spoil my triumphant return to palatine society what a bunch of leeches lechers and losers catullus surveyed the crowd his grin dripping with acid what a bizarre menagerie clodias put together the worst poets and the crookedest politicians in rome bankrupt nobles and obscenely wealthy exslaves beautiful boys and homely prostitutes did i say homely ugly enough to turn a man to stoneno obscene pun intended and here before me the most honest man in rome accompanied by he paused and his expression sobered a bit just as you put it gordianus the most beautiful woman here my wife i said and this bethesda is gaius valerius catullus just back from a year of government service in bithynia bethesda nodded knowingly the poet she said he raised an eyebrow am i that famous or have you been talking about me behind my back gordianus not me i said trying to make something of the cryptic smile on bethesdas face and wondering what else clodia confided to her about catullus at their first and only meeting at least bethesda seemed to be getting her bearings for which i was glad a serving slave arrived to show us to our places couches were gathered in ushaped groups around serving tables the seating was two to a couch allowing plenty of room to sit up or recline as it turned out catullus was put at the couch next to ours at my right for the moment there was no one else to share his couch had clodia placed us together on purpose or simply because we were the last guests to be invited our group of couches was situated in a corner of the room the farthest away from the hostesss that suited me it would allow bethesda to feel less conspicuous but catullus was not pleased banished back to bithynia i heard him grumble a senator named fufius was shown to the couch at bethesdas left he was the man whom atratinus had accused caelius of assaulting during an election and would be testifying as a prosecution witness fufius was accompanied by a very young courtesan bethesda raised an eyebrow and i could read her mind the girl was hardly older than diana but bethesda seemed somewhat mollified when the senator gave her an appraising look and an appreciative smile clodia had not yet appeared and her couch was unoccupied catullus scanned the faces of those who still stood and milled about who will take the place of honor beside our hostess tonight let me see husband quintus is down in hades brother publius is off making lastmoment arrangements for tomorrows festival and lover caeliusah hes on trial for murder isnt he poison wasnt it well i suppose we wouldnt want a poisoner at our dinner party no matter how superior his stud service still someone will have to share the couch with our queen not one of her other brothers i think publius would go crazy with jealousy perhaps that ranting freedman who spoke at the trial today he has publiuss name if not his looks and weve seen that he can fill in for his exmaster in public speaking anyway but its rather hard to imagine the likes of him lying with his head on her lap while she dabbles sauteed sparrow brains into his mouth isnt it ah there she is our lesbia almighty venus where on earth did she get that dress you can see right through it murmured bethesda i happen to know that the fabric comes from cos i said showing off something new from a famous silkmaker there i thought you werent her lover growled catullus was he teasing me again or truly angry suddenly he let out a barking laugh so loud that several heads turned to look oh no not egnatius he whispered i thought she was done with him clodia took her place at her couch joining her was a tall muscular young man with a full black beard and a dazzling smile i recognized his face from the salacious tavern very handsome said bethesda if a stud horse could stand upright and grin hed look like egnatius and women would call him handsome i suppose catullus curled his upper lip the foulmouthed spaniard with the sparkling smile but then dont spaniards always have the whitest teeth you know how they get such white teeth dont you bethesda inclined her head inquiringly if egnatius is the lord of the feast all i can say is check your wine cup before you take a swig what do you mean asked bethesda catullus cleared his throat and began egnatius is forever smiling to show off that dazzling grin go to a trial he started to laugh and covered his mouth until he could stop the senator and his courtesan leaned closer to listen no wait let me start over ill change it up a bit especially for tonight let me think he clapped his hands yes egnatius is forever smiling to show off that dazzling grin in court tomorrow cicero will have everyone weeping pitiful poisoner er prisoner except for egnatius wholl grin and when caelius is run out of town his mother mourning only son good as deadfor her sake egnatius will grin its a sickness that grin everywhere everywhen social grace social disease id call it look egnatius listen up had you been born roman or sabine or tiburtine obese etruscan or umbrian slob or a swarthy lanuvian with teeth just as perfect or a transpadane from my own dear sweet verona or any man who cleans his teeth in the regular way still id curse that grin its inane it offends ah but you come from spainand spaniards every morning as we know scrub their teeth white and rub their gums rosy with the stuff that squirts out of their bladders yellow cleanser so flash that perfect grinit only goes to show how much youve been guzzling from your own chamberpot id rather my own teeth should rot the old senator clapped his courtesan giggled bethesda grudged a crooked smile and whispered in my ear are all his poems so vulgar all the bits ive heard surely his love poems are different she sighed looking puzzled clodias attraction to marcus caelius made perfect sense to her but catulluss appeal eluded her at that moment catulluss couch partner arrived i should have known who it would be his presence added the final measure of perverse imbalance to our little dining group have i just arrived at the end of one of your poems quipped trygonion sliding onto the couch what fortunate timing catullus scowled and snorted but only to hide a deeper reaction his jaw stiffened and quivered he blinked uncontrollably not only had clodia banished him back to bithynia she had seated him side by side with her emasculated pet no one but me seemed to notice that catullus was barely managing to fight back tears when everyone was seated clodia welcomed her guests with a very brief speech and the promise that she would strive to greet everyone more personally as the evening progressed this evoked a low suggestive whistle from a young man with a scraggly beard and a very bad haircut at a table nearby his companions made a playful show of slapping him down for his presumptuousness i saw catullus wince the evening commenced with the arrival ofthe first course a gooseliver paste fit for the gods of olympus an exquisite falernian wine washed away all cares soon bethesda was charming senator fufius with stories of her native alexandria while his neglected young courtesan played with her food and pouted the senator seemed genuinely fascinated by everything bethesda had to say ive never been to egypt myself he wheezed but of course with all this debate and controversy of late one has to wonder what all the fuss is about even trygonion and catullus began to converse in fits and starts if only because neither of them could keep his mouth shut for long they traded barbs and competed at casting aspersions on various people in the room they kept silent about those within earshotthe chief advantage of sitting next to them i decided at length the dinner ended or at least the first dinner of the evening there would be more food and wine later the time for entertainment had arrived the guests moved to the garden where folding chairs and couches had been placed in front of the little stage i was happy to take my leave of catullus and trygonion but the senator stayed close to bethesda with his courtesan following behind slaves continued to move among the guests offering tidbits and delicacies to those with bottomless stomachs and making sure that no cup stayed empty for long the entertainment began with a mime show one of those performances with a single unmasked actor speaking all the roles the performer was new to rome just arrived in town announced clodia after spreading laughter from cyprus to sicily but the little playlets he performed were the old standards raunchy skits about a slave talking back to his master and a matchmaker trying to convince a husband he needs a second wife and a doctor accidentally treating the wrong patient with a series of hilariously painful cures the actor suggested costume changes in an instant with the barest theatrical devicesa scarf transformed him into a bashful young maiden a hideously exaggerated bracelet made him a rich lady a childs wooden playsword turned him into a swaggering general the crowd tittered at every obscenity groaned at the terrible puns and roared with laughter at the climax of each skit the actor was quite extraordinary clodia knew how to choose an entertainer in the gaps between skits bethesda informed the old senator that mimes had originated in the streets and squares of alexandria where wandering actors would set down their boxes of props and put on impromptu shows for whatever coins the crowd might toss their way that was still the only real way to see a mime bethesda insisted though she supposed that the man clodia had found was clever enough for a roman audience the actor concluded his final skit to great applause clodia stepped onto the stage and now something very special she said an old friend has returned from his wanderings in the east like odysseus said someone i looked around and saw that it was the young man with the bad haircut if catullus is odysseus does that mean clodia is penelope said one of his friends i hope not said another you know what odysseus did to penelopes suitorshe crashed a party and killed them all as i was saying said clodia raising her voice above the laughter an old friend is back wiser one presumes certainly older if only by a year and with new poems to share with us i mean our dear friend from verona gaius valerius catullus whose words have touched us all and wounded a few of us yelled someone while he was in the east catullus tells me he took a journey to look at the ruins of ancient troy he climbed pinecovered mount ida where jupiter sat to watch the greeks and trojans do battle on the plain below he saw the place where his beloved brother is buried and performed a funeral rite and while he was there he saw something that few men have ever seen he was invited to witness the secret rites at the temple of cybele including the ceremony by which a man becomes a gallus in the service of the great mother i expected to hear more lewd comments at this point but instead a hush fell over the crowd this experience catullus tells me moved him to compose a poem in honor of attis the consort of cybele the lover who gave up his sex in her worship the inspiration of all the galli since on the eve of the great mother festival what could be more appropriate than the first public recitation of this poem she left the platform catullus took her place his lids looked heavy his eyes bleary and he seemed to barely avoid falling as he stepped onto the stage i held my breath wondering how he could possibly perform before an audience he was too drunk too bitter too unsure of himself too weak he seemed to be thinking the same thing for a long time he stood completely still his shoulders slumped staring first at his feet then at something above the heads of the audience was he bemused by the giant venus behind us or simply gazing into space but when he finally opened his mouth to speak the voice that emerged was unlike anything i had ever heard before it was light and airy yet strangely powerful like a glittering net thrown over the audience like a whisper in a dream i have heard countless orators in the forum listened to many actors on the stage their voices are their tools skilled at shaping utterances suitable to the occasion words emerge at their decree like slaves suited to a particular task but with catullus everything seemed reversed the words were in control the poem ruled the poet and used not just his voice but his whole body for its delivery shaping his face gesturing with his hands causing his feet to pace the stage all to the poems purpose the poem would have existed with or without the poet his presence was merely a convenience since he happened to have a tongue which the poem could use to deliver itself to the ears of clodias guests on that warm spring night in her garden on the palatine attis sailed his swift vessel through the deep waves and set his eager feet upon the phrygian shore he entered the sunless forest where his mind became as dark as the dense woods around him moved by madness he picked up a sharp stone he sliced off his manhood he rose up transfigured a woman the blood dripping from between her legs giving life to the dank pungent earth attis snatched up a drum and beat it making music to the great mother and her mysteries singing rapturous falsetto to the servants of cybele come galli all together to the groves on the mountain sea salt stings the woundturn away from the sea turn away from venus rid yourselves of manhood leave that loathsome sort of love behind you embrace the ecstasies of unsexed passion it was a long strange poem at times it became a chant and the poet a dancer moved to sway and stamp his feet by the poem that possessed him the audience watched and listened spellbound it was the story of attis and the madness of attis which moved him on a dark night in a dense forest far from home to castrate himself and consecrate his existence to the great mother cybele still bleeding from his wound he summoned the followers of the goddess and led them in a wild ecstatic procession up the slopes of mount ida to her temple they sang shrill chants beat on drums clanged cymbals whirled about in frenzied delirious dances with attis leading them until at last they fell exhausted into a deep dreamless sleep when attis woke his madness had passed he saw what he had done he was horrified he ran to the seashore and gazed at the horizon sorry that he had ever left his homeland as a boy he had been a champion of the games a decorated athlete a wrestler with his beard he became a man of the city known respected called upon what was he now a shipwrecked soul unable ever to return to his home neither man nor woman a fragment of his former self sterile miserable terribly alone his fanatic devotion had cut him off from all that mattered to him had cost him everything even his humanity up on mount ida cybele heard his wretched lament she looked down to see attis weeping on the beach did cybele take mercy on attis or was she only being practical when she sent her lion down to the beach not just to fetch attis back but to rend attiss mind and make him mad once and for all attis in his sanity was too miserable for a life of worshiping cybele but in his unsexed state what other life was he fit for so the roaring lion went crashing down the mountainside and drove attis back into the forest back into the madness and raving ecstasy back into a life of loyal unsexed slavery to the great mother catullus shivered as if the poem were slowly releasing him from its grip his voice began to fade until the final lines were barely audible goddess great mother cybele guardian of ida madden other mennot me give others your raving dream avert your furies from my house draw others into your scheme catullus was transformed mounting the stage he had looked like a man stupefied by wine and selfpity all soft and uncertain now his face was haggard and his eyes glowed like a man emerging from a terrible ordeal winnowed to his essential core he stumbled a bit leaving the stage not like a drunken man but like a man drained of all energy the garden was silent around me i saw raised eyebrows uncertain frowns thoughtful nods grimaces of distaste sitting close by the stage clodia stared unblinking at the spot catullus had vacated her face was blank did she consider the poem a tribute to her or the opposite an insult or could she not see herself in a young mans poem about inescapable obsession the obliteration of dignity and freedom by overwhelming passion and the unequal disastrous union of a mere mortal with an aloof uncaring goddess behind me i heard a stifled sob like the sound of a woman weeping so soft that except for the utter quiet i would never have noticed i turned my head away from the other guests on the steps leading down into the garden a figure sat by the pedestal of the monstrous venus concealed in its shadow he hugged his ankles as if to keep from shivering and hid his face against his knees but by his dress i knew it was trygonion chapter twenty two after catulluss performance the party never regained quite the same air of levity despite the relentless parade of entertainments that followed this included several other poets better known than catullus who had been placed at the beginning of the evening as a sort of warmup for those who followed but no other poet who recited that evening left any lasting impression at least not on my ears there were also dancers and jugglers and a concluding set of excruciatingly crude but very funny skits by the mime during a break in all this entertainment our hostess found her way to our comer she greeted bethesda with outstretched arms and a kiss did you receive the gift yes thank you it arrived at the house while we were down at the forum bethesda gave me a sidelong glance clodia nodded good now youre one of us yes i saw you both at the trial what do you think gordianus how did it go for us today i suppose bethesda said it best oratory is all very well when there are no facts to go on clodia gave me a quizzical smile was it bethesda who said that i thought it my ancestor appius claudius the one who well never mind may i talk to you privately senator amuse this lady for a moment while i take her husband away on business she led me out of the garden into a private chamber the walls were painted a rich red decorated with rustic scenes of satyrs and nymphs youre looking much better today i said am i i thought i looked rather horrible when i saw myself in the mirror this morning i considered calling off the party but it would have been the first time i ever missed giving a party on the eve of the great mother festival even when quintus and i were up in cisalpine gaul did you have chrysis tortured today she looked at me blankly for a moment even by the lamplight reflected off the red walls her face looked pale actually i took you aside to talk about more important matters but since you ask gordianusyes chrysis was tortured today not by me of course by officials of the court surely you know that a slave cant give a statement in a trial without being tortured otherwise she might simply say whatever her mistress told her to say so the logic goes the bitch was about to poison me i caught her in the act did she confess yes did she implicate caelius of course you can hear her statement read tomorrow just before my own testimony the statement which she gave under torture you seem to have an unwholesome fixation on torture tonight gordianus i should think youd had enough of torture listening to that awful poem of catulluss really when he told me that he had an ideal poem for the great mother festival she gave a little shudder then brightened but i wont have to use torture to get you to testify tomorrow i hope me of course who else could herennius have meant when he said the man cicero called the most honest man in rome would be testifying against caelius you need only tell what you witnessed with your own eyes at the senian baths and here in my house yesterday when you saw what was done to me what if i decline to testify she seemed surprised no one can compel you but i thought you wanted to see caelius punished i wanted to discover dios killer its the same thing gordianus everyone else in rome has figured that out so why havent you oh yes i know youre a man who demands proof well then you should have come up with those slaves oflucceiuss the ones involved in the poison plot you were going to track them down and buy them for me you said did anything ever come of that no too bad they would have made superb witnesses i gave you silver to buy them didnt i ill return the silver the trials not over yet theres no hurry ill have to wait until my son eco gets back to rome forget about the silver gordianus theres no need to return it do you understand im not sure consider it part of your fee now of course youll testify tomorrow you must must i if you care about justice at all if you want to put dios shade to rest if only it was clear to me exactly how dio died she sighed exasperated asicius and caelius broke into coponiuss house and stabbed the poor wretch i ignored her counting days in my head theres still a chance that eco might arrive tonight or tomorrow good if he does and if he brings word of those slaves then perhaps we can add their testimony but i told you forget about the silver we were speaking at such crosspurposes that i hardly heard her there was something else i said something id forgotten when i left your house yesterday i intended to take with me that bit of gorgons hair to compare it to some of the same poison in my strongbox at home i forgot it somehow i shuddered remembering the ugliness of chrysiss degradation and my flight from clodias bedchamber could i take the gorgons hair home with me tonight clodia hesitated im afraid not herennius has it he said he might want to produce it as evidence tomorrow when i give my testimony though i dont suppose showing the judges a lump of poison is likely to be as shocking as showing them a bloody dagger or whatever is it important no i suppose not i only wanted to make sure that i knew what the stuff was for my own satisfaction if it would help convince you to testify then i wish i still had it i suppose i could somehow arrange to get the stuff back from herennius though its rather late in the morning therell hardly be time i shook my head dont bother no good she laughed weakly i dont think i could stand to deal with one more troublesome detail tonight i really am awfully tired clodiuss physician says that i shouldnt expect to feel completely well for quite some time to tell you the truth i feel quite awful i couldnt eat a bite of anything that was put in front of me tonight ill simply have to trust that the cook was up to his usual standard now gordianus assure me that you will testify tomorrow dont make me go to bed fretting about it as i said you need only tell the court what youve seen with your own eyes i looked at her for a long moment at her huge green eyes made all the more lustrous by illness at the smooth white flesh of her throat curving down to her breasts and the sleek lines of her body wrapped in the transparent silk i breathed in her perfume what if caelius had succeeded in poisoning her she would be dead now already beginning to rot the idea was appalling intolerable the glittering eyes shut forever the perfect body eaten by worms the perfume overpowered by the stench of putrefaction yes ill testify i dont see why not she smiled and kissed me full on the mouth and pressed her body against me as if she had read my thoughts and wanted to show me that she was still very much alive and warm to the touch from the garden i heard the sound of a poet declaiming punctuated by laughter and applause clodia broke the kiss and stepped back id better take you back to bethesda before she comes looking for you egyptian women are uncommonly jealous im told the party had no formal ending or at least none that i stayed for after the mimes encore another meal commenced with the guests seated in new combinations eventually those who had eaten and conversed and laughed and drunk enough began to wend their ways to the front door bethesda and i were among the first to leave catullus and trygonion seemed to have disappeared you look very thoughtful said bethesda on the way home and you look rather smug did you enjoy yourself that much enjoyment was not really the point she said suddenly haughty what did clodia mean by what she said to you when she asked if you had gotten the little statue of attis you said yes and then she said good now youre one of us did she say that bethesda im in no mood to be teased she only meant that i had been accepted by the other women here on the palatine the women who matter anyway thanks to clodia is that all she meant what do you mean is that all think of it of where i come from who i am i dreaded it when we moved from the farm back to rome into such a house such a neighborhood i never let you see how i felt of course but it was just as i feared they treated me very badly at first treated you badly ignored me shut me out but after tonight things will change the others will treat me differently as if i were one of them this struck me as highly unlikely but i shrugged why not almost anything seems to be possible in rome these days for some reason bethesda took offense at this comment and didnt say another word to me all the way home diana had stayed up for us she demanded that her mother tell her everything about the party while they settled in dianas room talking of what the women had worn and how they had dressed their hair i escaped to our bedroom i stripped off my toga and put on a shabby tunic i kept a lamp burning so that bethesda could find her way around the room i lay down on the sleeping couch and shut my eyes against the flickering light but i couldnt sleep i had drunk too much eaten too much heard too much poetry from down the hall i could hear dianas and bethesdas muffled laughter the sound reminded me of the sound of distant laughter in the garden when clodia had kissed me i had asked her for something hadnt i the poison that was it the gorgons hair so that i could compare it to the same stuff that eco had given me to safeguard again i had come home without it of course i didnt really need clodias sample to make the comparison i remembered clearly enough what the stuff had looked like i had held it up to the lamplight while chrysis twisted in the corner and sobbed i shifted on the sleeping couch determined to fall asleep but the laughter from dianas room kept me up and my thoughts kept twisting endlessly in space like chrysis suspended upside down from the ceiling finally i got up and reached for the lamp there was a little storage room down the hallway from our bedroom cluttered with rolled rugs and folded chairs and wooden boxes after a brief search i found the strongbox amid the jumble i tried to remember where i had hidden the key and then realized i didnt need it the little lock on the strongbox had been broken i took the box into the bedroom and set down the lamp so that it would light the inside there wasnt much inside the boxa bloodencrusted dagger that had been important at another trial a few letters and some other mementos that i didnt want anyone else to touch among them was the little pyxis of poison that eco had asked me to keep for him not wanting to have it in his own house with the twins i picked up the pyxis by the rim of the lid which came open i gave a jerk thinking i had clumsily spilled the contents then realized there were no contents to be spilled the pyxis was empty only a few traces of poison remained compacted against the inside corners of the box identical to the crumbly yellow powder that clodia had shown me what did it mean i set the pyxis aside and looked in the strongbox again thinking the poison must have spilled inside i saw no yellow powder but i did see something else a small object easily overlooked an earring it was a simple design a little silver crook with a green glass bead for ornament i recognized it at once it was one of bethesdas old earrings the crook of the earring was bent i looked again at the broken lock of the strongbox the metal facing was scored with tiny scratches the aperture was small the crook of the earring would have been ideal for poking inside what had happened was obvious the earring had been used to force the lock i sat and stared dumbly at the earring the strongbox and the empty pyxis at first puzzled then stunned then furious diana and her mother gave a start when i pushed aside the curtain and stepped into the room i held the empty pyxis in my outstretched hand can you explain this i said trying to keep my voice steady they both looked at me as if they hardly knew me would i have known myself in a mirror at that moment neither of them spoke i asked if you could explain this i said they stared at me dumbly very well it needs no explaining i held up the earring you must have been in a considerable hurry bethesda to have left this behind that was careless very careless didnt you realize id find eventually she stared blankly at the earring please bethesda dont pretend that you dont recognize it even i recognized it and you claim i neve notice jewelry its one of a pair that youve had for years i sighed suddenly more sad than angry did gaining her favor mean so much to you did you not know how she would use the poisonnot just to fool the court but to make a fool of me i snapped the pyxis shut and threw the earring on the floor diana gave a start and drew against her mother frightened for a moment i felt ashamed but then my anger returned i paced the floor shes made a fool of you as well cant you see that inviting you to her party giving you that abominable statue making you think you could belong to her circle sharing shameful secrets with you whispering behind my back in the garden she made up whatever you wanted to hear i imagine shes had a lot of practice at that its what she does with her lovers so why not with you did you really think she wanted to be your friend a woman who talks about her ancestors as if they were gods stooping to share gossip with a woman who was born a slave i stopped my pacing trying to quiet my rage but i only grew angrier i clutched the pyxis so hard that the corners cut the palm of my hand wife you have taken part in deceiving me do you deny it bethesda made no answer you have deliberately deceived me do you deny it mother said diana clutching at bethesdas arm bethesda covered the girls face and pulled diana against her breast to quiet her do you deny it i shouted bethesda looked steadily into my eyes shrewd and unflappable to the last no husband i do not deny it you took part in deceiving me yes we stared at each other for a long moment bethesda never blinked i threw the pyxis on the floor and left the room in a rage my shouting had roused belbo who rushed after me as i raced out the door and up the nightdark street the polite manner of knocking on a door is with the foot but that night i used my fist to bang on clodias door the banging reverberated in the still night air loud enough to wake neighbors i thought but the slaves took a long time to answer did the noise frighten them or did they simply think me rude at last a slotted peephole slid open and two eyes peered out even in the darkness i recognized them by the single brow above them i want to see your mistress barnabas its late you can see her tomorrow at the trial no i must see her tonight the eyes studied me dispassionately i realized how i must look wearing my sleeping tunic my hair mussed the peephole closed i paced back and forth on the narrow doorstep while belbo stood in the street behind me yawning and blinking at last the door opened i slipped inside but barnabas closed the door in belbos face he led me through the foyer down the steps and across the garden by the light of a few lowburning lamps i was able to see that the garden was not entirely deserted coupled figures moved and whispered in the shadows suddenly like a fawn in the forest a naked girl went running across our path taking great bounding strides it was the girl who had dined with senator fufius she turned her head and gave a startled laugh as she passed then vanished a moment later fufius naked and drunk went chasing after her barnabas led me into the redpaneled room off the garden he set a lamp on a small table and left i had plenty of time to study the nymphs and satyrs on the walls before clodia appeared in the doorway her hair was unpinned and hung down past her shoulders she wore a transparent white robe belted only at the waist so that it was open between her breasts the naked patch of flesh shimmered in the red light reflected off the walls she smiled wearily if you wanted to stay gordianus why did you leave ah yes to take bethesda home but now youre back did someone at the party catch your eye she moved sinuously toward me her eyes heavylidded a faint smile on her lips you had a slave tortured today for no reason the lids became heavier the smile stiffened that again please gordianus surely a man of your age has accustomed himself to the ways of the world some things a man never gets used to lies deceptions conspiracy what are you talking about and bribery of course thats what the silver was for wasnt it not for purchasing slaves to testify but an outright bribe nothing more or lessso that when the time came i would do whatever you wanted the man whose honesty was boasted of by cicero himselfthats why you wanted me in the first place thinking id come in handy somehow or other ah yes well throw the fellow in ciceros face on the last day of the trial let cicero spin out his oration then have this fellow who cicero says is honesty personified take the stand and make cicero look like an idiot did you think you could buy me with silver or have you never met a man whom silver or that smile of yours couldnt purchase really gordianus its awfully late in the evening and late in the trial for me to be upsetting your scheme the supposed delivery of the poison at the senian bathswere you behind that as well dont be absurd perhaps it was a part of your scheme perhaps it wasnt but whatever your intention something went wrong the evidence against caelius that you hoped to capture or manufacture never came together you realized that the mere allegation that caelius wanted to poison you was too thin to impress the judges so you came up with this further scheme how did you know there would be poison in my house or did bethesda just happen to volunteer the knowledge and you instantly saw how to make use of it i dont know what youre talking about i told you gordianus its late did you merely fake the symptoms your brothers physician could have told you how to do that once you showed him what kind of poison youd come up with or did you actually swallow a bit of the stuff letting him advise you on the dosenot enough to kill you certainly but just enough to make you sick to make your performance perfect to be sure that you fooled me and everyone else yes i think that would be more like you to exercise your dramatic flair to the limit to court a bit of danger to play for the highest possible stakes but to hand that poor slave girl over to the torturers for the sake of authenticitythat was really going too far clodia even for you of course you could be sure that shed tell them the story exactly as you wanted since theyll only hand her back to you once theyre finished and if she hasnt done her job properly you can make things even worse for her this absurdity of torturing slaves to get at the truth youve gone completely mad gordianus youre raving then why do i suddenly feel so perfectly lucid for the first time since i met you really its just as they say you cast a spell i thought id be immune but only a fool could think that and thats what youve played me for but now my eyes are open and i have to wonder just how deeply youve dug yourself into this campaign of destruction against marcus caelius if the poison charges are a fake then what about the murder charges what about diothat poor wretch as you call him might you have had some hand in murdering himfor no better reason than to incriminate marcus caelius ridiculous when dio died caelius and i were still then perhaps caelius did take part in the murder but whos to say that your brother isnt ultimately behind it all if he and caelius were still allies then just as you and caelius were still lovers and this money you loaned to caelius that you claim he used in his poison plot against dioperhaps you knew all along what the money was for perhaps the plot was your idea to begin with and caelius just another of your puppets my eyes are open clodia yet everything becomes more and more obscure to me in light of my growing confusion i think i should decline to testify at the trial tomorrow dont you not for the prosecution anyway perhaps i might testify for the defenseyes let cicero call the most honest man in rome to talk about how clodia set him up to make marcus caelius look like a wouldbe poisoner you wouldnt dare wouldnt i then i suggest that you drop everything to do with this fake poisoning tear up the deposition that chrysis gave under torture dont whisper a word about the gorgons hair poisoning when you testify do you understand because if you do ill give testimony myself and refute everything you say how will your case against caelius look then with your own scheme exposed so much for the shocking revelations that herennius promised as a climax to the trial clodias eyes flashed her lips trembled fury flared on her face and then dimmed as she struggled to contain it once again i was struck by her wan and haggard lookwas she really mad enough to have poisoned herself deliberately was she so totally relentlessly consumed with destroying caelius what was such a love like to end in such hatred and degradation and most puzzling of all at least to me at that moment her body ravaged by selfinduced poisoning her duplicity exposed her scheme to use me in tattershow could clodia still look so breathtakingly beautiful to my eyes so beautiful that i couldnt stand to look at her but had to turn my back and look elsewhere at the rutting nymphs and satyrs who cavorted with mindless guiltless sterile passion on the walls outrageous she finally muttered what you say is utterly outrageous where do i begin its absurd its mad has caelius somehow gotten to you or cicero why have you turned against me gordianus i told you in the beginning my only interest was to find dios killer i wont be used as a tool to help satisfy your spite against an exlover i suppose youre accustomed to using men and having them enjoy it but i have no appetite for that sort of thing clodia yes i could tell that from the beginning her voice was low and weary though my back was turned i sensed her approach i felt her warm breath against the back of my neck thats why i never tried to use that sort of persuasion with you youd only have seen through it resented it youre an unusual man gordianus im not used to such strength such integrityyes just as cicero said lucky bethesda so i never considered seducing you gordianus i rejected the thought knowing it would only offend you even though i was tempted more than once i took a deep breath and turned to face her the expression on her face was dejected poignant utterly convincing clodia you are a remarkable woman you never give up do you i expected a flash of anger or the hint of a smirk but her expression only became more perplexed more pained remarkable i whispered i stepped past her suddenly anxious to leave thinking that i might yet do something i would later regret but the doorway was filled by a tall imposingly muscular young man who stood with his arms crossed wearing only a tiny loincloth catulluss lampoon was uncannily unerringly accurate even as he made a point of blocking my exit egnatius the spaniard had a grin on his face who is this worm he said should i smash his face in shut up you fool growled clodia get out of his way egnatius stepped aside as i passed i wrinkled my nose it was stale wine i smelled but i pretended otherwise is that urine on your breath the spaniards grin finally cracked chapter twenty three belbo was waiting for me outside the front door without a word i started walking down the street then realized i had no idea where to go going home to bethesda was out of the question i might have imposed on menenia but what would my daughterinlaw have thought if i came begging for a place to sleep in the middle of the night if only eco would come back suddenly belbo grunted and pulled me aside his alarm was caused by a figure who stood concealed in the shadows of a doorway poor belbo thought the man might be a thief or killer i knew better i shook my head partly in disgust partly in relief catullus dont you have any better place to be at this time of night no and neither do you apparently he stepped from the doorway to show a face that looked as haggard and pained as my final glimpse of clodias face we stared at each other in the moonlight i hope i dont look as wretched as you do said catullus i was about to say the same thing to you he managed a crooked smile what shall we do wait for the sun to come up i suppose and until then where shall we go where else the salacious tavern was doing great business on the eve of the festival we were lucky to find places to sit i dont like the look of this place master said belbo ah but some of the girls seem to like the looks of you big fellow said catullus belbo looked around uncertainly i dont suppose well run into marcus caelius and his friends again i surveyed the crowd through the amber haze of lamplight and smoke here in the middle of his trial catullus barked a laugh not likely dont you imagine hes home with papa and mama humming funeral dirges and looking through his wardrobe for something suitably shabby to wear tomorrow oh papa i know im supposed to look downtrodden but can i help it if i look stunning in everything even belbo cracked a smile wine was brought catullus drank greedily and wiped his mouth what were you doing in her house tonight wearing nothing but an old sleeping tunic catullus please no more of this nonsense about her and me then why there was some unfinished business between us in the middle of the night it couldnt wait he snorted then called to the serving slave for more to drink i swirled the untouched wine in my cup if caelius is guilty of all those crimes against the alexandrian envoys isnt that enough why would she feel compelled to manufacture new charges against him you know her better than i do would she actually poison herself in order to make others think that caelius had poisoned her youre distracting me with riddles grumbled catullus its clodia whos driven us both to distraction lesbia he insisted i stared at my wine and felt queasy if im going to drink any of this ill need to cut it with plenty of water well then well have the man fetch you some fresh water from the appian aqueduct you mean the one that her ancestor built for us i said exactly catullus smirked then we can head out on one of the roads her ancestors so thoughtfully laid down for us and pour a libation to a god in one of the temples they erected for us catullus laughed i see shes given you the grand speech about the feats of her ancestors and their incomparable largesse rome would still be a pigsty beside the tiber if it hadnt been for all those appius claudii at the dawn of history so clodialesbiaseems to think but ill wager she didnt tell you about the appius claudius who tried to rape verginia no a scandal well its not one of those edifying ancestor legends the clodii like to repeat to every stranger they meet but the storys just as true and it tells more about lesbia than all that crowing about aqueducts and roads tell me catullus paused to hold out his cup to the serving slave but provided such a wobbly target that the wine spilled all over the floor perhaps youve had enough i said perhaps youre right what i need is a bed under my back catullus burped and nodded me too where are you staying in the city i keep some rooms in a place up on the palatine just a bed and some books do you want to go there youd share your bed with me you wouldnt be the first catullus laughed bring along your slave to play watchdog he can sleep on the floor in the anteroom and start barking if he hears you cry rape catulluss place on the palatine was as sparsely furnished as he had said against one wall was a large sleeping couch against the other was a pigeonhole bookcase filled with scrolls he saw me squinting at the little tags in the dim lamplight greek poetry mostly he explained taking off his toga books and bed all a man needs anything more would only distract from the experience of reading the books or using the bed he slipped into a tunic and fell back onto the sleeping couch come on theres room enough for two though i warn you im drunk enough that i might attack you im an old man with stiff joints and a grizzled beard yes but you smell irresistible what you smell of her perfume and you stink of wine catullus better than urine i suppose what i told him briefly of my encounter with egnatius thinking it would amuse him that i had been able to use something from his poem for my own parting shot not realizing until i was well into the story that telling it was a mistake then hes with her right now he said gritting his teeth egnatius and lesbia damn them both you started telling me a story at the tavern i said thinking to distract him a story a scandal about one of her ancestors an appius claudius not the builder of the temple or the aqueduct oh yes the one who tried to rape verginia the only ancestor they dont like to talk about yet he exemplifies the current generation better than any of those virtuous paragons on their pedestals you asked me if she would do something as mad as poisoning herself just to spite a lover of course she would its in her blood her blood here ill tell you the story this was long ago in the first days of the republic after the kings had been thrown down but before the patricians and plebeians found a way to live together in peace the chronologys rather vague to meim a poet not a historianbut at some point a group of ten strongmen managed to seize control of the state the called themselves decemvirs and set off a reign of terror for the good of rome of courseto solve the current crisis in response to the growing emergency et cetera et cetera and appius claudius was one of these decemvirs yes now there was also in rome at this time a beautiful young girl named verginia the daughter of verginius she was a virgin betrothed to a rising young politician but one day appius claudius happened to see her on her way to the girls school in the forum and fell head over heel in lust for her he followed her everywhere in the streets and markets trying to lure her away from the watchful eyes of her nurse determined to seduce her but verginia was a virtuous girl and wanted nothing to do with the lecher she spurned him outright but the more she rejected him the more determined he was to have her finally he hatched a scheme to get his hands on her if only for long enough to give her a poke he waited until her father was away on military duty then gave instructions to one of his lackeys a man named marcus one morning when verginia was entering the forum with her nurse to attend the girls school marcus and some of his men seized her the people around were shocked and wanted to know what was happening marcus said that the girl was his slave and he was reclaiming her people knew perfectly well that verginia was the daughter of verginius but they also knew that marcus was appius claudiuss lackey and they were afraid of him so when he made such a show of blustering about justice and the law and his rights they allowed him to take verginia off to the tribunal to decide the matter legally of course the sole presiding judge was none other than the decemvir appius claudius his lackey marcus recited a preposterous story that verginia was not verginiuss daughter at allshe was actually the daughter of one of his own slaves and had been stolen from his house as an infant and palmed off on verginius as his own flesh and blood marcus claimed he could produce the evidence for all this later the point was that the girl was actually a slave his slave and he was reclaiming her as was his legal right up on the tribunal appius claudius pretended to consider all this as if hed just heard it for the first time when of course he was the author of the plot you can imagine him moving his lips along with marcus as the man recited the lines appius had written for him finally he declared that only a formal hearing could determine the girls status virginias friends explained that her father was away on military duty but could be back in rome the next day appius claudius agreed to hear the case then in the meantime he ruled the girl would remain in the custody of marcus verginia shrieked the crowd shouted in protest and the girls nurse fainted dead away but appius claudius pointed out that according to the law marcus couldnt be made to hand the girl over to the custody of anyone but her father and since verginius was not present she would therefore have to remain in marcuss custody until such time as her father arrived to claim her verginia would be in marcuss hands in appius claudiuss powerfor the whole night to come cant you see the fox licking his chops up on the tribunal playing with himself beneath his toga the ruling was crazy and there was plenty of muttering and indignation but nobody ventured to speak openly against it thats how cowed the people were under the rule of the decemvirs marcus started to leave the court hustling the weeping verginia along with him at this point verginias betrothed young lover the rising politician arrived on the scene and delivered an outraged speech about how appius claudius was using the law to make slaves of everyone in rome just for the purpose of satisfying his own lust he would die himself the young man vowed before he would let his betrothed spend a night away from her fathers house the girl was a virgin and it was a virgin he intended to marry he stirred the crowd to a frenzy appius claudius called for armed lictors to keep order and threatened to have the young orator arrested for starting a riot but to keep the situation from getting completely out of hand appius claudius agreed to let the girl go home with her uncle for the night and made the man post a huge bond in silver to make sure verginia would show up for her hearing at dawn the next morning the city woke in a fever of excitement verginius back from his military duty appeared in the forum leading his daughter by the hand he in mourning she in rags followed by all the women of the family making lamentations there was a trial or something resembling a trial with each of the sides presenting arguments and appius claudius presiding as sole judge evidence and common sense counted for nothing the verdict was decided before the trial began as soon as the arguments were finished appius claudius announced that verginia was the slave of marcus not the daughter of verginius marcus was free to claim his property the crowd was stupefied nobody uttered a word marcus began pushing his way through the crowd heading for verginia the women around her burst into tears verginius shook his fist at appius and cried out i meant my daughter for a bridal bed not for your brothel no man who owns a sword will put up with this sort of outrage appius claudius was prepared for this hed received alarming reports of an uprising being planned against the decemvirs he claimed and so just happened to have a troop of armed lictors on hand to keep order he called them out and told them to draw their swords and clear the way so that marcus could claim his property anyone who obstructed this act of justice would be killed on the spot as a disturber of the peace marcus strode forward through the cordon of steel and laid his hands on verginia verginius finally seemed to lose heart with tears in his eyes he called to appius claudius perhaps i have been terribly mistaken all these years yes perhaps youre right and the girl isnt really my daughter after all let me take the child and her nurse aside for just one moment so that i can talk to them both privately if i can reconcile myself to this mistake i can give her up without violence appius granted this request though in retrospect one has to wonder why perhaps he wanted to savor the actual moment of acquiring the girl of seeing her fall into marcuss clutches and didnt mind an excuse for stretching out the ordeal just a bit longer verginius took his daughter to a little street off the forum he ran into a butchers shop grabbed a knife and ran back to verginia before anyone could stop him he stabbed her in the heart she died in his arms convulsing and spitting blood while he stroked her hair and whispered to her over and over it was the only way to set you free my child the only way he staggered back into the forum carrying her body the crowd parted for him stunned into silence so that verginiuss cries echoed through the forum this blood is on your hands appius claudius the curse of my virgin daughters blood is on your head catullus fell silent i stared into the darkness above us quite a story i finally said what happened next verginius and the young man who was to have been his soninlaw led an uprising the decemvirs were brought down appius claudius was arrested was he punished he killed himself in prison awaiting trial no wonder the clodii dont brag about him but i dont see how the story relates to your lesbia dont you you see theres this particular strain of madness in their blood yes the clodii have a heritage of building creating rising to glory and triumph but theres also this other aspect this unwholesome tendency to obsess this inability to see beyond a thing they desire but cannot have if they come to want a thing theyll do anything to get it anything and if their skewed judgment takes them down the wrong path dont expect them to realize the error and turn back oh no once set upon it theyll run the course even straight into disaster and all in the name of love theyll wager everything on the slim chance that when the dice are cast theyll score the venus throw are you sure youre speaking of clodia or could it be yourself youre describing catullus he was silent for a long moment i suppose i wouldnt love her as i do if we werent alike in certain ways he was quiet then for so long that i thought he must have fallen asleep until he murmured cicero speaks tomorrow what at the trial yes she should have known better than to take him on cicero is a dangerous man i know i saw what he did to catilina when he made up his mind to destroy him all it took were words clodia thinks everything comes down to bodies and sex she doesnt understand the power of words its why she thinks my poetry is weak he was quiet then said cicero was in love with her once did you know that i once heard a very vague rumor of some such thing but it sounded like nonsense to me cicero in love with anyone but himself infatuated anyway he was great friends with her husband quintus always visiting their house back when quintus was alive and the place was well respectable enough for a man like cicero to feel at home clodia was a lot more restrained back then more discreet anyway i think she rather liked having to carry on her affairs behind someone elses backthe secret meetings the danger of getting caught the wicked thrill of cuckolding her husband and of course a married woman can simply turn her back on a lover the moment she tires of him but cicero preposterous he despises people like her are there other people like clodia you know what i mean perhaps he despises her now but back then this was during the worst part of clodias marriage the last few years before quintus died when the two of them fought all the time even in front of company especially in front of company they fought about everythingclodias affairs her brothers career money politics ive always thought thats what intrigued ciceroseeing her at her most argumentative he could ignore the fact that she was beautiful but she was also clever and sharptongued a voluptuous beauty who could argue a man like quintus into the groundwell cicero developed quite a fascination for her that happens to men like him sometimes who keep their natural appetites all bottled up suddenly they find themselves madly in love with the most inappropriate person i suspect clodia was a bit intrigued by him the perverse attraction of opposites im not sure whether they ever did anything about it she told me they did but i figured she was just lying to hurt me this was years ago but it makes him all the more dangerous to her now dangerous i said not quite sure what he meant i was getting very sleepy men like cicero dont like to dwell on that sort of memory they see it as weakness they prefer to stamp it out i tried to imagine cicero as a loverprim dyspeptic cicerobut i was too sleepy to make the mental effort or too afraid it would give me bad dreams tomorrowoh no lights coming through the shutters the skys beginning to lighten already catullus groaned not tomorrow then today today the great mother festival begins and down in the forum someone will be destroyed how can you be certain he tapped his earlobe the gods whisper in a poets ear today someone will be publicly annihilated humiliated ruined forever you mean marcus caelius do i who else he stretched his body in a paroxysm of yawning things could go one way or the other even the gods will have to wait and see what do you mean i murmured then i must have fallen asleep or else catullus did because i never heard him answer part four nexus chapter twenty four after a fitful hour or two of sleep i opened my eyes morning i light was creeping in around the shuttered windows but think it was catulluss snoring that woke me i crept to the anteroom kicked belbo awake and told him to run home as fast as he could and fetch my best toga he was back before i had finished washing my face i suppose someone was minding the door i said while he helped me dress yes master was there any word of eco no master nothing at all nothing master was your mistress up yes master what did she have to say any message for me no master she didnt say a word but she looked yes belbo she looked more displeased than usual master did she come belbo well need to hurry to catch the start of the trial im sure we can find something to eat on the way therell be plenty of vendors out for the festival as we were leaving catullus appeared from the bedroom looking haggard and blearyeyed he assured me he would be down at the forum before the trial started but he looked to me as if he would have to be raised from the dead first belbo and i arrived just as the defense was beginning its arguments with no slaves sent ahead to hold a chair for me i found myself near the back of the crowd which was even larger than the day before i had to stand on tiptoes to see but i had no trouble hearing the welltrained orators voice of marcus caelius rang through the square as atratinus the youngest of the prosecutors had begun their case the day before so young caelius began his own defense as atratinus had dwelled on the defendants character so did caelius was this the morally depraved sensationseeking toohandsome young murderer that the prosecution had portrayed one would never have known it from caeliuss appearance and manner he was dressed in a toga so old and faded that even a poor man might have thrown it out it must have come from a musty chest in his fathers storage room his manner was as humble as his clothes were shabby the fiery young orator famous for his rapid delivery and biting invectives spoke on this day in a calm measured thoughtful cadence oozing with respect for the judges he declared himself innocent of all charges these horrible spurious accusations had been lodged against him by people who had once been his friends but were now his enemies and their only goal was to destroy him for their personal satisfaction a man could hardly be blamed for the treachery of false friends still caelius regretted his poor judgment in ever having associated with such people for he could see the pain and suffering it had caused his father and mother who were with him again today dressed in mourning and barely controlling their tears he regretted too the burden that the trial had placed on his loyal friends beloved mentors and trusted advocates marcus crassus and marcus cicero two truly great romans whose example he had admittedly failed to live up to but to whom he would turn again for renewed inspiration when this ordeal had passed provided the judges in their wisdom saw fit to give him that chance caelius was deferential but not servile modest but not cringing adamant about his innocence but not selfrighteous saddened by the wickedness of his enemies but not vindictive he was the model of an upstanding citizen falsely accused and confidently looking to the revered institutions of the law to give him justice i felt a tap on my shoulder and turned to see the bloodshot eyes of catullus i dont suppose ive missed much blood and gore yet he said milk and honey is more like it quipped a man nearby this fellow caelius wouldnt harm a fly there was a ripple of laughter then a round of shushing from those who wanted to hear every word of the speech milk can curdle catullus whispered in my ear and sometimes you find a bee drowned in the honey with its stinger intact what do you mean caelius fights better with a sword than with a shield wait and listen sure enough the tone of caeliuss speech began to change as if having gotten the necessary business of humbling himself out of the way it was time for him to go on the offensive the shift was so gradual the insinuations of sarcasm so subtle that it was impossible to say exactly when the speech was transformed from a meek protestation of innocence into a biting invective against his accusers he attacked the speeches that had been made against him pointing out their reliance on hearsay and circumstantial evidence their lapses of logic their obvious intent to besmirch his character the prosecutors were made to look not just vindictive but petty as well and slightly absurd not least because caelius himself managed to maintain an aura of impeccable dignity while he insulted their logic and motives and assaulted them with vicious puns stingers in the honey whispered catullus how did you know he shrugged you forgot how well i know caelius i could lay out the entire course of his speech for you for example hell be turning to her next he looked toward the bench where clodia sat and the sardonic smile on his lips faded until he looked as grim as she did sure enough caelius proceeded to make a veiled attack on clodia though not by name behind the prosecution and its sham arguments he said there was a certain person intent on doing him harm not the other way around as she had charged the judges would know whom he meantclytemnestraforaquadrans the crude joke implying that clodia was both a husbandkiller and a cheap whore elicited a wave of raucous laughter where had i heard it before i make no claim to being ignorant of the lady said caelius yes i know heror knew herquite well to my discredit alas and to my dismay but little to my profit sometimes cos in the dining room turns out to be nola in the bedroom this elicited more laughter and even some appreciative applause the pun was multiple and all the more stinging for its wicked intricacy cos suggested the island from which clodias transparent silks had come and therefore the open vulgar allure of sex nola was famous for its impregnable fortress which had resisted not just hannibal but a siege by clodias own father cos also punned with coitus sex and nola with nolo or no sex in other words what the lady lewdly promised at dinner was later frigidly withheld in the bedroom with a single turn of phrase and without saying anything explicit caelius had managed to suggest that clodia was not just a temptress but a tease likely to give poor value even for a quadrans to suggest that he had never actually slept with her and to remind the court of one of her fathers military defeats the siege of nola after a moments pause there was another smattering of applause as more listeners realized just what a gem of compression caelius had delivered catullus didnt laugh or applaud i noticed wickedly clever i said wondering if he had missed the pun thank you he muttered apparently not listening his eyes were on clodia who looked distinctly uncomfortable catullus smiled sadly caelius expanded on the metaphor just as a man could be in the vicinity of nola without breaching her walls more laughter from those finally getting the joke so one could be in the vicinity of neapolis or puteoli without being guilty of staging an attack on foreign visitors or take an innocent stroll across the palatine at night without dropping in to murder an ambassador has it come to this said caelius not guilt by association but guilt by geographical proximity shall a mans enemies follow his footsteps note any crimes which happen to take place in the immediate area and then accuse him so that he has no alibi it seems hardly credible that even the most inept of advocates could expect a panel of roman judges to take this kind of evidence seriously assumptions should be based on what is seen not unseen known not merely suspected he pulled a small object from the folds of his toga a few spectators in the front rows laughed out loud when they saw what it was for instance he went on holding up the object so that it glinted in the sunlight when one sees a simple little pyxis such as this what does one assume that it contains a medicinal unguent of some sort or a cosmetic powder or a perfume infused into wax perhapsthe sort of thing that anybody might take along to the baths or so a reasonable person might assume a person of a more morbid state of mind might guess that something else was in the boxpoison perhaps especially if that person was herself well acquainted with using poison from my distant vantage there was no way i could be sure of what the pyxis looked like it must have been only my imagination that perceived it to be made of bronze with little raised knobs and inlays of ivory that caught the sunlightidentical to the pyxis that caeliuss confederate licinius had brought to the senian baths and that had been left filled with something unspeakable on clodias doorstep as she lay poisoned in her house more laughter spread through the crowd i looked at clodia her eyes were aflame and her jaw like granite an imagination of a particularly lewd bent might imagine something even more outrageous in such an innocent little pyxisa token of spent desire perhaps deposited by a frustrated lover weary of trying to shimmy up nolas walls at this there were outright hoots of laughter somehow the story of the pyxis and its obscene contents must already have spread through the city who had repeated such a scandalous story a slave in clodias household or the man who had sent her the box it was clear from the look on clodias face that caeliuss brazen allusion to the indecent gift had taken her completely by surprise and the callous amusement of the spectators appalled her even more caelius never once looking at her put the pyxis away and smiled blandly master belbo tugged at my toga belbo im trying to listen but master hes here i turned about prepared to snap at him then felt a surge of joy not far away at the edge of the crowd eco stood on his toes peering into the sea of heads belbo you sharpeyed lookout come hell never spot us in this crowd well go to him youre not leaving are you said catullus ill be back but the best is yet to come memorize the jokes for me i said we came upon eco just as he was beginning to push his way into the throng his tunic was dirty and his brow pasted with sweat as might be expected of a man who had just finished a hard ride up from puteoli his face was haggard but when he saw us his eyes lit up and he managed a weary smile papa no dont hug me please im filthy and sore i rode all night knowing the trial must have already started its not over is it not yet another full day of speeches good perhaps theres still time then time for what to save marcus caelius if he needs saving i said thinking caelius was doing a pretty good job of defending himself if he deserves to be saved i only know that he doesnt deserve to be punished for dios murder what are you saying caelius didnt kill dio youre certain yes i found the slave girl zotica the one who was with dio the night he died if it wasnt caelius and asicius then who i brought the girl back with me eco suddenly looked very tired the girl killed dio i frowned we had considered and rejected that possibility already no but she knows who did not exactly why would eco not look me in the eye all i can say is that your intuition was right papa the girl was the key well what did you find out i think youd better talk to her yourself papa the crowd behind us laughed at something then laughed again louder i looked over my shoulder caelius is just getting to the heart of his speech then crassus will speak then cicero still i think youd better come papa quickly before the trial gets any further along cant you just tell me what the girl told you his face darkened i dont think that would be wise papa it wouldnt be fair to whom the slave girl please papa come with me the look on his face convinced me what terrible secret had so unnerved my son who had seen all the corruption and duplicity that rome had to offer he had left the girl at his house in the subura we walked there as quickly as we could threading our way through streets crowded with food vendors acrobats and merrymakers where did you find her i asked stepping out of the way of a drunken band of gladiators coming up the street they snarled at belbo as they passed in one of the hill towns of the far side of vesuvius miles from puteoli it took some looking first i had to find the brothelkeeper whod bought the allotment of slaves that included zotica do you have any idea how many establishments like that there are down on the bay one after another told me hed never seen zotica and they all wanted a bribe just to tell me that much and even then they all seemed to be lying just to spite me finally i found the man whod purchased her but shed been useless to him he said worse than uselessnobody wants a girl with scars on her he told me not even the mean ones besides that shed turned wild wild thats what he calls it i suppose a man like that tends to see slaves in conditions that most of us dont or not very often her mind isnt quite right maybe she was always a little addled i dont know i think she must have been treated well enough in coponiuss house at the beginning though the other slaves tended to pick on her then dio came along the girl was innocent naive maybe even a virgin she had no idea of the kinds of things that dio had in mind for her she couldnt understand why he wanted to punish her when shed done nothing wrong she kept quiet about it at first too afraid ofdio to resist him too ashamed to tell anyone when she finally did complain to the other slaves some of them tried to intercede for her but coponius couldnt be bothered then after dio was killed coponius couldnt get rid of the girl fast enough since then shes been traded from hand to hand abused ill treated unwanted it must have seemed like a nightmare from which she couldnt wake up its done something to her mind she can be perfectly lucid sometimes but then youll see its made her unfit to be any kind of slave when i finally found her she was living in the fields outside a farmers house hed bought her for a kitchen slave and found her useless even for that the girls a scratcher and a biter he told me scratches and bites for no reason like an egyptian cat even beating wont do any good no one around would buy her so the farmer turned her loose like people do to old or crippled slaves making them fend for themselves i didnt even have to pay for her i just had to find her and then make her come with me i thought id gained her trust but even so she tried to run away twice first outside of puteoli and then again as we got close to rome this morning you see why its taken me so long to get home and i thought you were sending me on an easy job papa if the girl told you what we needed to know maybe you should have let her go darkness shadowed his face again no papa i couldnt just repeat her story to you i had to bring her back to rome so you could hear her for yourself menenia was waiting for us at the door with folded arms and an uncharacteristically sour look on her face i thought the look must be for eco for having brusquely rushed off to find me after dropping off the slave girlyoung wives expect a bit more attention from husbands arriving home after a trip but then i realized that the look was aimed at me what had i done except quarrel with my wife and not come home last night menenia couldnt possibly know about that alreadyor could she sometimes i think that the ground beneath the city must be honeycombed with tunnels where messengers constantly run back and forth carrying secret communications between the women of rome eco had locked the girl in a small storage room off the kitchen at the sight of us she jumped up from the wooden chest where shed been sitting and cowered against the wall i imagine shes frightened of belbo said eco i nodded and sent him out of the room the girl relaxed but only a little theres nothing to be afraid of i already explained that to you didnt i said eco in a voice more exasperated than comforting under better circumstances the slave girl zotica might have been at least passably pretty she was far too young for my taste as flat and bony as a boy but one could see the delicate beginnings of a womans face in her high cheekbones and dark eyebrows but now with her unwashed hair all sweaty and tangled and dark circles beneath her eyes it was hard to imagine her as the object of anyones desire she certainly had no place in a brothel she looked more like one of those furtive abandoned children who haunt the citys streets looking for scraps of food and run in packs like wild beasts eco sighed did you eat anything zotica i told my wife to see that you were fed the girl shook her head im too tired to eat i want to sleep so do i you can sleep soon but now i want you to talk to someone the girl looked at me warily this is my father eco went on though i wondered what the word could mean to the child who had probably never known a father i want you to tell him what you told me about the man who came to stay at your masters house here in rome the very mention of dio caused her to shiver about how he died you mean not only that i want you to tell him everything the girl stared forlornly into space im so tired my stomach hurts zotica i brought you here so that you could tell my father about dio i never called him that i never even knew his name until you told me he came to your masters house and stayed there for a time until he died she said dully he abused you why did the master let him i didnt think the master knew but he did he just didnt care then i was spoiled and he had to get rid of me now no one has any use for me look at her wrists papa the rope cut them so badly that you can still see the scars its because i pulled at them the girl murmured rubbing at her wrists he tied them so tight then put me over the hook the hook i said there were metal hooks in the walls in his room hed tie my wrists and lift up my arms and trap me on the hook so my toes barely touched the floor my wrists would bleed the rope would twist up even tighter when hed turn me around he would use me from the front then the back beat and pinch and prod stuff things in my mouth to keep me quiet you should see the scars papa but id be ashamed to make her lift up her dress to show you you realize shes talking about dio eco looked at me accusingly as if i were responsible for the secret vices of a man id admired for so many years my face turned hot a hook i whispered what a hook yes papa imagine it no eco its something else yes theres more go on zotica tell him about that final night no you have to after that well leave you alone i promise you can sleep for as long as you want the girl shuddered he came in dressed she made a miserable face and shrugged like a woman i suppose he looked awful he made me come to his room he made me take off my gown use it for a rag he said wipe off this silly makeup he sat in a chair while i cleaned his face he kept stopping me fondling me sliding his hand between my legs making me bend overacting just like always the girl shook her head and hugged herself but then he pushed me away he made a face and grabbed his stomach he crawled onto his bed and made me lie next to him because he was cold he said but he felt hot to me he pressed himself against me naked and i felt like i was being burned wherever he touched me then he started shivering so much that his teeth chattered and he made me fetch him more blankets he told me to lower the lamp because the light hurt his eyes he tried to get up from the bed but he was too dizzy i asked him if i should go for help but he told me not to he was afraid more afraid than id ever seen anybody even a slave about to be whipped so afraid i almost stopped hating him he covered himself with the blankets and rocked back and forth on the bed clutching himself biting his hands i stood across the room as far away as i could hugging myself because i was naked and it was cold then he turned on his side and vomited on the floor it was awful he closed his eyes and wheezed and gasped for air then he was quiet after a while i shook him but he wouldnt wake up i just sat there on the bed looking at him for a long time afraid to move then it was over what do you mean over she looked me in the eye for the first time he died i saw him die how could you be sure his whole body suddenly shook with a terrible fit he opened his eyes and his mouth gaped open like he was going to scream but nothing came out except a horrible rattle i jumped up from the bed and stood against the wall he seemed to have turned to stone just like that with his eyes and mouth wide open after a while i walked over to him and put my ear to his chest there was no heartbeat if youd seen his eyes anyone would know they were the eyes of a dead man but the stab wounds i said the window broken open and the room a shambles let her finish papa eco nodded to the girl i didnt know what to do her jaw quivered and she wiped her eyes all i could think was that the master would blame me and punish me he would think that i killed the old man somehow so i cleaned up the vomiti used my gown the one hed already made me use for a rag to clean his face then i crept out of the room where the door slave philo saw you in the hallway i said naked and weeping clutching your gown he thought dio had finished with you early but dio was already dead did you tell your master she shivered and shook her head but why not all that night i lay awake in the slave quarters thinking about what had happened the master would think i had poisoned the old man i didnt but the master would think i did and what would he do to me i cried and cried while the other slaves hissed at me to be quiet and go to sleep but how could i sleep then there was an awful commotion from the old mans room the whole house came awake theyd broken into the room and found him now theyll come to me i thought theyll kill me right here and now my heart pounded in my chest so hard i thought id die she let out a sob then twisted her lips into a crooked smile but something amazing had happened they didnt blame me at all they thought the old man had been stabbed to death killers had broken into his room after i left him they said and cut him up with knives i didnt know what to think but the master never blamed me so i never told anybody what had happened with the old man dead i thought everything would be like it was before the smile vanished but instead everything changed the master sold me everything just got more and more awful youre safe now said eco gently the girl sagged against the wall and closed her eyes please dont make me talk anymore if only i could sleep no more talk eco agreed stay here for now one of the slaves will come to show you where you can sleep we left her weeping softly and muttering to herself her face pressed against the wall as if she could somehow melt into it i followed eco into the garden what does it mean it means that dio was poisoned papa but the stabbing he was stabbed after he was already dead you remarked yourself how little blood there seems to have been for so many wounds how the wounds were all close together in his chest and there was no sign that he put up a struggle because he was already dead but someone broke into the room that night and scattered everything about someone stabbed him why perhaps it was titus coponius himself because he didnt want it to get out that dio was poisoned under his roof and he wanted to make the death look like the work of assassins but thats not really the point is it what do you mean eco the important thing is that dio was poisoned but how where by whom we know that he would touch no food in coponiuss house and only a short time before he left my house with a full stomach as cautious as he was he wouldnt have eaten anything else that night exactly papa eco say what you mean you neednt shout papa you must be thinking the same thing i stopped pacing we stared at each other perhaps the symptoms the girl described if it was poison what do you think gorgons hair i said yes i thought the same thing some time ago i gave you some gorgons hair for safekeeping i didnt want the stuff in my house with the twins do you remember oh yes i said my mouth was dry do you still have it is it still where you put it my silence gave him the answer eco nodded slowly the last meal dio ate was at your house papa yes thats where he must have been poisoned no did someone use the gorgons hair i gave you do you still have it or not clodia i whispered she wasnt pretending to be poisoned then the gorgons hair she showed me could have come from caelius after all certainly not from bethesdanot if the gorgons hair in my house had already been used what are you whispering papa but caelius couldnt have killed dio not if he was poisoned first youre right hes innocent of that crime at least i cant hear you papa eco shook his head tired and exasperated the only thing i cant figure out is why anyone in your household would have wanted to poison dio in the first place who knew the man much less had any reason to want him dead i thought of my old egyptian mentor who secretly liked to tie up young slave girls and abuse them and particularly liked to bind their wrists and hang them on hooks i remembered the women in my garden exchanging secrets about men who had raped them when they were young i thought of bethesda when she had been a slave in alexandria and the powerful respected master who had used her mother so cruelly that he killed her and would have done the same to bethesda if she hadnt fought back and found herself carted off to the slave market instead where a poor young roman smitten by her beauty emptied his purse to pay for her never dreaming he would take her back to rome and make her his wife obliging her to serve dinner to his guests and to give the first heaping portion to an esteemed visitor such as dio of alexandria i had said to her you have deliberately deceived me do you deny it and she had answered no husband i do not deny it and i thought i understood papa speak up cybele help us i shook my head i think i know the answer chapter twenty five eco pressed me for an explanation but i only shook my head we made our way back to the forum in silence through the hot crowded streets of the subura the sky was cloudless and the sun directly overhead casting a harsh glaring light onto a world without shadows lit so brightly objects became perversely indistinct edges ran together and views of the distance had no depth the throngs of people going about their holiday business seemed faceless i stared at them not quite able to make them out old or young male or female smiling or frowning standing quietly or shoving their way through the street all seemed blurred together and equally strange the city itself was unreal dreamlike and slightly absurd this feeling only intensified as we entered the forum and rejoined the immense crowd attending the trial of marcus caelius catullus was where i had left him you missed caeliuss climax he said he did it into that little pyxis to show everyone how no im only joking but it was a good climax for all concerned one thing about caelius he always strives to satisfy whoever hes with not just himself no judges or spectators left hankering and unfulfilled at nolas walls so to speak i stared at him blankly unable to make sense of what he was saying he went on nonetheless then you missed crassuss whole speech just as well actually nobody had a climax there seems crassus was trying to get caelius off the hook for all those killings on the way up from neapolis but if you ask me crassus never did learn how to give a decent speech plodding plodding words words words and not a memorable pun among them he should stick to what he knows making piles of money and simply bribe the judges instead of boring them to death with bad rhetoric he made caelius look as guilty as caelius managed to make himself look innocent its all up to cicero now whos this my son i said absently and introduced eco well good youre both here for the real speech ciceros about to begin come lets see if we cant move up a bit we managed to move considerably closer so that i was able to see quite clearly the figure now stepping before the judges slender and frail when i first met him long ago cicero had become plump and thickjowled in the years of his prosperity the political triumph of his consulship had been followed by nearruin when his enemies managed to banish him counterlegislation passed by ciceros allies eventually welcomed him back but not before the great man passed eighteen months in exile during which time much of his property was destroyed by the mob in his months away from rome cicero had grown lean with worry or so it was said from the way his toga clung to his frame as he swaggered before the court it looked to me that he had made short work of regaining both his girth and his stature clodius had once been ciceros political ally then his nemesis even now clodius was attempting to keep cicero from rebuilding his ruined house on the palatine claiming that the property had been legally seized by the state and sanctified for religious use and so could not be recovered by cicero the two enemies waged war against one another in every arena they could findon the floor of the senate in courts of law in the reading of omens by priests and augurs between them burned the kind of hatred that can be extinguished only by death that was reason enough for cicero to hate clodia perhaps since she was her brothers staunchest supporter and a party to his schemes but what of the vague rumor which catullus had repeated about a stunted love affair between clodia and cicero back when her brother and cicero were allies perhaps he hated clodia for reasons that had nothing to do with politics or with clodius that would help to account for what he did to her that day or perhaps like a good advocate he simply did whatever was necessary to make sure marcus caelius was acquitted of the charges against him as i watched cicero deliver the final oration of the trialone of the finest of his career some would later sayi felt as if i were watching a play like a play the action seemed distant from me the dialogue out of my control i was a spectator powerless to stop or alter the course of unfolding events but a playwright strives to elucidate some truth whether mundane and comic or grand and tragic where was the truth in this strange play who was the villain and who the tragic figure it seemed to me that i was witnessing the sort of play where the action becomes increasingly tangled and absurd until there is no way out of the mess except to bring on a god or a messenger to deliver a speech that makes sense of everything but the messenger from offstage had already arrived eco bringing the slave girl up from the south now i knew the truth about dios death but no one on the stage seemed to knownot cicero nor caelius nor clodia for me to reveal what i knew to play the part of the god from the machine was impossible how could i incriminate my own wife i could only watch helpless and mute as the battle between clodia and caelius reached its climax poison deception and false accusation had already been deployed to attack and counterattack now cicero like a hoary old general was brought out to deliver the final assault words would be his weapon she doesnt understand the power of words catullus had said of clodia she was about to learn in front of all rome judges cicero began bowing his head respectfully and surveying the long rows of the jurymen looking from face to face if there should be anyone present here today unfamiliar with our law courts and their customs he must wonder at the terrible urgency of this particular case seeing that all other public business has been suspended for the holiday and this is the one and only trial being held in the midst of public festivities and games such an observer would undoubtedly conclude that the defendant must be quite a dangerous fellow a hardened renegade guilty of some crime so terrible that the whole state will collapse unless his transgressions are dealt with at once one would explain to such an observer that we have a special law which deals with criminal behavior against the state when traitorous roman citizens take up arms to obstruct the senate or to attack magistrates or to try to destroy the government itself we are obliged to proceed with trying such men regardless of holidays our observer would surely not object to such a law dedicated to the preservation of the state itself but he would want to know exactly what sort of charges were involved in the present case just imagine his reaction at being informed that no real crime or outrage was before the court at all instead a talented vigorous wellliked young fellow is being prosecuted by the son of a man against whom the defendant recently brought charges furthermore the whole prosecution has been organized and financed by a whore the crowd collectively sucked in a breath there were a few outbursts of laughter which rang all the louder in the general silence caelius had made fancy allusions to clytemnestra and convoluted puns about cos and nola he had even held up a pyxis and alluded to the story of the semenfilled box but cicero in the first moments of his speech had called clodia an outright prostitute it was an announcement and a warning nothing would be held back i tried to see clodias reaction but the crowd had shifted and my view was blocked what would our hypothetical observer think of all this cicero continued no doubt he would conclude that the chief prosecutor should be excused for bringing such a flimsy caseatratinus is very young and inexperienced and his devotion to his father is understandable our observer would further conclude that the malicious tantrums of the woman in question ought to be better controlled or at least confined to her bedroom also good judges our observer would conclude that you are being sorely overworked since everyone but you has the day off this brought a round of appreciative laughter from the front rows and a lessening of tension except from the prosecutors section where i caught a glimpse of clodia her face looked so rigid she seemed to be wearing a mask cicero continued with a defense of caeliuss character he dismissed whatever political differences might have put a distance between himself and his young protege that was all over now if caelius had made mistakes he was entitled to do so as was every young man so long as he conducted himself with integrity and honesty ah but the prosecutors have accused caelius of being in debt and thus presumably vulnerable to bad influences and a life of crime they have demanded that he hand over his account books for inspection my reply to this is simple there are no account books a young man like caelius still subject to his fathers authority doesnt keep his own account books the prosecution says that caelius has borrowed heavily but they will be unable to show any proof of this ah but he must have been living beyond his means they say because of that luxurious apartment he kept on the palatine which he rented from clodius for the amazing sum so they tell us of thirty thousand sesterces a year the figure is absurd ten thousand sesterces is more like it well you can see whats going on here when you realize that clodius recently put the building up for sale and is asking a lot more than its worth the prosecution is doing clodius a favor by inflating his rent receipts so that he can swindle some fool into paying him three times what that ratinfested eyesore is really worth the crowd laughed cicero shook his head in mock dismay but seemed barely able to keep from smiling at his own cleverness a serious trial about the assassination of foreign dignitaries had suddenly become an inquiry into malicious female revenge and shady real estate dealings was caelius on trial for murder or the clodii for their vices the crowd seemed happy to follow ciceros lead so long as he amused them you reproach marcus caelius for moving out of his fathers house into that apartment on the palatine as if it showed him to be a bad son when in fact he took the place with his fathers blessing you imply that he moved there so that he could throw wild parties when in fact he moved there because he was beginning his political career and needed a place closer to the forum but youre absolutely right when you say that it was a mistake for caelius to take that apartment on the palatine what a source of grief the place turned out to be that was when all his troubles began or more precisely when all this malicious gossip beganwhen our young jason went ajourneying and found himself in the neighborhood of that medea of the palatine medea of the palatinei had heard the phrase before just as i had heard someone call clodia clytemnestraforaquadrans before caelius did so it was catullus on the night he first took me to the salacious tavern who calls her such things i had asked him i do i just made them up out of my head what do you think ill need some fresh invectives if im to get her attention again i turned and stared at catullus who kept his gaze straight ahead i shall come back to this medea and her part in this affair in due course said cicero with a hint of menace right now i should like to spare a few words for the socalled witnesses and the various fictions which have apparently been concocted to support the prosecutions case one of these tales refers to a certain senator fufius the old fellow will supposedly testify that during the election of pontiffs caelius physically assaulted him if the senator decides to go ahead and testify i shall ask him why he did not press charges shortly after the alleged assault took place instead of waiting so long does he come forward now on his own initiative or at the behest of those behind the prosecution if its the latter as i think we all know it must be then what a sad reflection on the producers of this tawdry drama that they can coerce only one member of the senate into putting on an actors mask and speaking the lines theyve scripted nor am i impressed by the witnesses who will supposedly tell us how their virtuous wives were molested by caelius on their way home from a dinner party one night what high principles these outraged nighthawks must have to wait until now to bring these charges at the time they didnt even ask to meet informally with caelius to resolve any grievances they may have had supposedly there will be yet more witnesses with shocking revelations but i dont think we should count on hearing anything the least bit believable or expect to see anyone even remotely credible on the witness stand you know as well as i do judges the sort of riffraff that can be found loitering around the forum on any given day men with nothing better to do who are willing to come forward and testify to almost anything under oath so long as someone pays them to do so if the prosecution insists on bringing hired actors into these proceedings i have faith gentlemen that your experienced judgment and common sense will see through their testimony to the greed that underlies it was it my imagination or was cicero looking directly at me so much for the surprise witness whom herennius had promised to bring forth the man whose honesty had awed even cicero with a single preemptive remark i was dismissed as a bribed perjurer the attack was wasted of course i had already refused to appear as clodias surprise witness but that was when i had cause to think that her poisoning was a sham that she had borrowed the gorgons hair from bethesda to deceive me now it seemed that she truly had been poisoned i glanced at her face and saw how listless she still seemed had she really come so close to death for my part cicero continued i have no intention of troubling you with any witnesses the facts of the case are solid and unshakable the truth doesnt hinge on what a given witness may or may not say what value is evidence that can be distorted and manipulated or purchased outright i prefer to use the rational method rebutting error with proof answering falsehoods with facts laying everything open to the harsh scrutiny of reason youve just heard my colleague marcus crassus do exactly that he took on the charges about caeliuss role in the disturbances at neapolis and puteoli with such clear elucidation that i wish he had also dealt with the question of dios murder but really what more is there to be said about that matter we all know the ultimate perpetrator of the crime we also know that he fears no retribution and doesnt even bother to deny what hes done the mans a king after all and not subject to roman justice furthermore the fellow who was accused of being that kings agentpublius asiciushas already stood trial he was found innocent some say the trial was tainted but i say thats nonsenseand i should know as i defended asicius myself now the prosecutors are trying to make us think that caelius was another of the kings agents that he was asiciuss confederate in that terrible murder where have the prosecutors been for the last few months could it be that they never got the news that asicius was acquitted what a waste of their time and yours judges for them to try to link caelius with asicius since asicius was found innocent cicero threw up his hands in exasperation let us move on to the heart of the matter the prosecution has said a great deal about character i agree absolutely that character is the central issue here though not necessarily the character of marcus caelius yesterday judges i saw how closely you followed the arguments of my friend lucius herennius he said a great deal about financial irresponsibility unbridled lust immorality and other youthful vices herennius is usually a mildmannered fellow tolerant urbane very temperate and modern in his outlook but here in court yesterday he seemed to turn into one of those frowning moralizing upright old tutors who made us quiver with dread when we were boys he called marcus caelius to task in terms harsh enough to make even the sternest father blanch he went on and on about the evils of wild living until even i began to quail a bit was it proper he demanded to know that i should defend a man who has sometimes accepted dinner invitations who has gone for walks in fashionable gardens along the tiber who has on one or two occasions in his life splashed on scent from a bottle who has even gone wading in mixed company down at the beaches at baiae such appalling behavior is unforgivable or is it come herennius i think we all know of men who have indulged in a bit of high living in their youth who have then turned around and made themselves into perfectly respectable citizens everyone agrees that young men must be allowed a certain amount of recklessness nature has given them strong sexual appetites and as long as they indulge those appetites without wrecking someone elses home the wise thing is to let nature run its course understandably those of an older generation like myself are concerned over the troubles that can arise from the excesses of youth but it seems to me unfair herennius that you should exploit our reasonable concern to stir up suspicion and prejudice against a particular young man you recite a whole catalogue of vices to incite our moral abhorrence but your posturing distracts us from the actual person of marcus caelius he is no more guilty of such excesses than most young men he deserves our indulgence no less he should not be condemned for the failings of his entire generation let us move on to something more specific namely this business about gold and poison both of these alleged transactions revolve around the same person supposedly the gold was taken from clodia and the poison was given to her now here at least we have some genuine accusations all the other charges in this case amount to innuendos and insults better suited to a shouting match than to a sober court of law saying that caelius seduces other mens wives that he brawls and takes bribes and so on and so forththese are slanders not accusations groundless slurs of the sort uttered by prosecutors who tend to let their blustering get out of control but about these last two charges concerning the gold and the poison theres something a bit more tangible yes i sense that there must be something to these accusationsor rather someone behind them a certain individual with a very deliberate goal heres the first story caelius needed gold and got it from clodia with no witnesses about mind you proof anyone would think of considerable friendship between them the second story caelius decided to murder clodia got hold of some poison bribed collaborators fixed a time and place to convey the poison to those who would administer it evidence this time of overpowering hatred judges this entire case revolves around clodia a woman of high birthand low reputation im not here to rake up scandal and i get no enjoyment from impugning the virtue of a roman lady however since the whole case against my client originates from this woman and since its my duty to defend my client i have no choice but to deal with the accusations as forthrightly as i can still in talking about this woman i will strive to say no more than is absolutely necessary to refute the charges indeed i feel obliged to watch what i say very carefully since everyone knows of the unfortunate enmity that exists between myself and this womans husband there was a burst of laughter cicero pretended to look confused oh did i say husband i meant to say her brother of course i cant imagine why im always making that mistake he shrugged and smiled well then my apologies judges for having to drag a ladys name into these proceedings really i never imagined i should find myself in a court of law fighting with a womanespecially this woman who is said to be the friend of every man she meets he waited for the laughter to die down the crowd had shifted and i was able to see clodia again her face was stiff but even from a distance i could see the alarm in her eyes she had begun to realize the full magnitude of the mistake she had made in taking her grievances against caelius into a public arena cicero cleared his throat let me begin by asking the lady this shall i lecture her in the stern manner of our forefathers or in a milder more moderate fashion if its the former then i should call on the dead to do the lecturing one of those sternlooking fullbearded fellows who gaze down on us from old statues why not one of the ladys own ancestors appius claudius the blind would be appropriate since he wont have to suffer the pain of looking at her there was laughter then a murmur of anticipation as cicero slipped into the role of the blind ancestor narrowing his eyes holding up his arms removing all traces of the comic from his voice woman what sort of legitimate interest could you possibly have in a fellow like caelius so much younger than yourself how did you ever come to feel so close to him that you lent him gold or to feel such hatred that you came to fear poison have you no pride no sense of decorum are you totally ignorant of your family and its achievements dont you know that your father and uncle and grandfather and greatgrandfather and greatgreatgrandfather and his father all served as consuls or that you yourself were the wife while he lived of quintus metellus celer a man whose virtues surpassed those of all other men having come from so great a household and having married into another great house what was your business with this youth marcus caelius was he a cousin an inlaw a close friend of your husband no none of these things what reason did you have to insinuate yourself so intimately into his life except a wanton desire to exercise your own voracious appetite for young flesh still playing blind claudius cicero shook his head and went on if the example set by the men of your lineage fails to shame you then perhaps the women can do so what of claudia quinta who proved her purity when she saved the ship that brought to rome the great mother whose festival we celebrate today consider the renown that her virtue added to your house or the famous vestal virgin claudia who shielded her father against an angry mob with her own pure body why do you share your brothers vices instead of your ancestors virtues we famous claudii of old did we refuse the peace offered by pyrrhus and tear up his bargain only so that you could drive your daily sexual bargains did we build the first aqueduct to bring water to rome only so that you could use it to wash yourself after your incestuous copulations did we build our great road only so that you could parade up and down it in the company of other womens husbands the harshness of ciceros voice kept anyone from laughing he lowered his arms and looked straight at clodia who returned his stare with a look of pure malice i drop the role i speak to you directly now if you intend to go on with your testimony then you will also have to explain how such intrigues could have come about in the first place the prosecutors at your behest have dinned a list of suggestive phrases into our ears adulterous orgies wild beach parties allnight revels dancing at dawn unending drunken debaucheries did you think you could accuse caelius of debauchery without exposing your own debauchery to the scrutiny of the court it was madness to think so i see by your face that you would like to avoid such an unpleasant spectacle too late to stop it now for a long moment cicero and clodia stared at one another in silence while the spectators looked on then he stepped back and softened his posture he smiled sweetly but i see you dont care for the sternlecture approach well then forget those rustic old ancestors and their upright morals ill borrow a more modern voice to try to talk some sense into youwhy ill pretend to be your own beloved little brother that should be appropriate no one is more worldly thats for sure and no one has ever loved you better ever since you were children does he still have those nightmares that make him wet the bed so that he has to come sleep in yours pity hes in charge of the festivities today and cant be here beside you but i can imagine what he might say cicero put on a simpering expression and waved his arms in a spastic manner while the crowd shrieked with laughter sister sister what a mess youve gotten yourself into whats this craziness all about have you lost your mind yes i know i know it was that boy down the street who caught your attentiontall goodlooking pretty eyes it set your old tired blood racing you wanted to see more of himevery inch of him getting your hands on him would be easy enough you thought young men are always short of money and you love to flaunt our inheritance but sister sister it didnt work out the way you wanted did it some young men dont care for the company of a grasping older woman no matter how much money shes got well then get over it youve got your horti on the tiber where you go to watch the young swimmers and size them up whats the place for except to provide you with a new lover every day why keep pestering this particular young fellow who obviously doesnt want you cicero dropped the simpering role of clodius and turned his back on clodia he strode across the open space toward the defendants benches and now its your turn to receive a lecture marcus caelius he wagged his finger caelius put on the face of an attentive schoolboy all raised eyebrows and bland innocence ill need a fathers voice to deal with you young manbut what sort of father one of those old men with hearts of iron who would blame you for everything and say why on earth did you settle so close to that whore in the first place why didnt you have the sense to run away the first moment you saw her to such a gloomy old man caelius might well defend himself by saying that nothing improper ever occurred whatever gossips may say to the contrary how can a young man in a city so full of malicious rumors possibly avoid being tarnished by loose talk living so close to that woman and being seen in her company its no wonder people assumed the worst even the ladys own brother cant visit her without wriggling his tongue i mean setting tongues wagging now as regards the woman at the moment its not my object to criticize her my point is to lecture marcus caelius so for the sake of argument let us imagine a purely hypothetical woman any resemblance to clodia will be purely coincidental i assure you imagine a woman who shamelessly offers herself to every man she meets who has to mark a calendar to keep her lovers straight who opens the doors of her houses at rome and baiae to every sort of lecherous degenerate who lavishes expensive gifts on her stable of kept young studs imagine a wealthy lascivious widow carrying on like a common whore without the least regard for what anyone thinks now i ask you if a young man should happen to be a bit free in his relationship with such a woman can any man here really hold him accountable for his misconduct imagine a woman so deeply sunk in depravity that she no longer bothers to seek privacy and darkness to practice her vices quite the oppositeshe builds a stage in her garden so that she can show off her special skills before an audience lined up to enjoy them bear in mind im speaking hypothetically simply to make a pointdont laugh now with this woman this hypothetical woman everything about her is an invitation to sex the way she walks the seethrough gowns she wears the obscenely pouting way she holds her mouth her smoldering gaze the foul language she uses the easy way she embraces everyone at her parties pressing herself against them and kissing them with her open mouth shes not simply a whore but a particularly lewd and depraved old whore now really if a young man should find himself in the clutches of such a woman can anyone be genuinely outraged if he should follow the course of nature is that young man guilty of viceor of simply seeking relief the woman is a whore after allthe hypothetical woman i meanand even the sternest moralist looks the other way when a young man goes off to relieve himself with a prostitute that is the way of the world and not just in our present permissive age even our virtuous ancestors allowed for the use of prostitutes the practice has never been frowned upon or forbidden in any time or place that i know of now someone will object and say is this the sort of standard to which cicero would hold a young man especially a young man who was given into his charge to be educated in rhetoric loose morals easy virtue a nod and a wink of course not but judges honestly was there ever a man on earth so highminded and strongwilled that he could reject all temptation and devote himself exclusively to the pursuit of virtue a man without the least interest in leisure or lovemaking or simply having fun show me such a man and i will declare him superhuman such men exist in our history books fine moral examples from the days of romes rise to greatness but you will look for them in vain in the streets of the city today these days even among the greek philosophers who once set so high a moral standard in their writings unmatched by their actions unfortunately you will find little to encourage adherence to pure virtue quite the opposite in fact the epicureans tell us that a wise man does everything for pleasure the academics by twisting words claim that virtue and pleasure can be one and the same alas the oldfashioned stoics who cling to the straight and narrow path of virtue find themselves stranded all alone in their lecture halls nature herself has endless tricks to lull a mans virtue to sleep while waking up his appetite for pleasure she tempts the young down all sorts of dangerously slippery paths but to compensate she lavishes on them great stamina and exquisite sensitivity show me a young man who despises the sight of beauty who derives no pleasure from scent or touch or taste who plugs his ears to keep out sweet music i and a few others might argue that a youth of such purity has been blessed but i think most of you would say he was cursed by the gods enough then of absolute standards let youth be permitted its pleasures let immaturity be allowed to flirt with foolishness if he has a strong character a young man will not be diminished by these experiences but will eventually outgrow them and be ready to take his place as a man of affairs in the forum who can doubt that marcus caelius has already done so youve watched him match wits with me here in the forum youve seen how eloquently he defended himself here today what a superb orator let me tell you from my own experience cultivating that degree of skill requires enormous dedication and discipline marcus caelius has reached a stage in his career where he no longer has the time or inclination to follow frivolous pursuits now then we have navigated our way through the rocky shoals and treacherous reefs from here on clear sailing let us get back to those two charges against caelius the gold caelius is said to have gotten it from clodia in order to bribe the slaves of lucius lucceius to kill dio grave charges to be sure asserting that a man plotted to murder a diplomatic envoy and instigated slaves to kill their masters guest heinous crimes but i have to wonder would clodia have given this gold to caelius without asking why he wanted it surely not if he told her it was to murder dio then she was in on the plot is that why you came here today woman to make a confession to tell us how you raided your secret treasure chest denuded that statue of venus in your garden adorned with all those pretty trophies from your lovers so that you could hand over the booty to caelius for criminal use did you make venus herself an accomplice in crime i glanced at catullus for it seemed to me that from the corner of my eye i had seen his lips moving as if he was reciting ciceros speech along with him he noticed my scrutiny flashed something between a smile and a wince and turned away i looked at clodia and caught a glimpse of her pale rigid face before the crowd blocked my view cicero went on if caelius was as intimate with clodia as the prosecutors maintain then surely he shared with her the purpose to which he intended to put the gold on the other hand if the two of them were not on such intimate terms then surely she never gave him the gold at all which is it clodia did you lend a man money to commit an unspeakable crime making a criminal of yourself or is the truth that you never lent him the money at all the accusation simply will not stand up and not just because the character of marcus caelius is wholly at odds with such a loathsome skulking plot hes too smart for one thing no man with any sense would entrust a crime of such magnitude to the slaves of another man on purely practical grounds i have to ask how is caelius supposed to have made contact with these slaves of lucius lucceius did he meet with them directlyvery rashor through an intermediary may we have the name of this gobetween no because no such person exists i could go on and on with such questions how many must i ask to show how totally implausible the whole charge is and how utterly without proof to put the matter to rest let us hear from lucius lucceius himself who has provided a sworn deposition on the matter i remind you that he was not only dios good friend and dutiful host but a man who pays scrupulous attention to detail as anyone familiar with his historical writings can attest surely if lucceius had discovered that slaves belonging to him were plotting with an outsider to murder his guest if he ever had even the least suspicion of such a thing lucceius would have gotten to the bottom of it what citizen could do less with his own honor at stake listen then to what he has to tell us a clerk came forward to read the deposition cicero walked to the defendants bench where his secretary tiro handed him a cup of water i thought back to my interview with lucceius how adamantly he had refused to acknowledge the slightest possibility that something had been amiss in his house how his wife had known better how the kitchen slaves who must have known something had been sent off to the mines and would never tell anyone what they knew the clerk cleared his throat i lucius lucceius under solemn oath make this statement on the kalends of aprilis that for a period in the month of januarius dio of alexandria my esteemed friend was a guest under my roof that while he was my guest nothing occurred to endanger his safety that any rumors to the contrary particularly rumors asserting a breach of loyalty among my household slaves are completely scurrilous that dio left my house of his own choice and in good health that i myself know nothing which might shed light on the circumstances of his death cicero stepped before the judges there you have it a wild wholly unfounded accusation that emanates from a household of wanton debauchery and wickedness and a levelheaded sober response from a household of impeccable standards on one hand we have the word of a foultempered raving sexcrazed woman on the other the sworn affidavit of one of the most respectable men in rome need we hesitate about choosing whom to believe on then to the accusation that caelius plotted to poison clodia i confess i cant make heads or tails of this story why should caelius want to do such a thing to avoid paying back the alleged loan but did clodia ever ask to be repaid to keep clodia from telling what she knew about the attempt on dios life but there was no such attempt as we have just established indeed i would suggest that this nonsense about gold and a plot against dio was fabricated precisely to provide a motive for this other fabrication that caelius tried to poison clodia one fabrication is invented to provide a motive for another fabrication lie builds upon lie slander upon slander the prosecution alleges that caelius once again attempted to commit murder by bribing someone elses slavesthis time clodias slaves to do in their mistress and this after having failed to pull off the same kind of plot with lucceiuss slaves what kind of man puts his whole fate into the hands of another persons slaves not once but twice at least credit my client with having a brain and just what sort of slaves are we talking about in the case of clodias household this is an important point as caelius must have known if he ever visited her house the relationship between clodia and her slaves can scarcely be described as normal in a household like that headed by a woman who behaves like a prostitute where abnormal lusts and unheardof vices are practiced on a daily basis where slaves are invited to share an inordinate amount of intimacy with their superiors well those slaves are slaves no longer they share everything with their mistress including her secrets they become her companions in loose living in a household like that the people on the bottom are sometimes quite literally on top i caught sight of clodia who seemed to physically shrink from the gales of laughter that roared through the forum cicero held up his hand to quiet the crowd keeping slaves in that fashion has one virtue at least such corrupted pampered slaves must be almost impossible to bribe caelius must have known that if he was as intimate with clodia as weve been led to believe ifhe knew the situation surely he would have known better than to try to insinuate himself between such a woman and her slavesa tight spot for any man to wriggle into if he didnt realize the situation then how could he have been so intimate with the slaves that he would consider bribing them the allegation contradicts itself now about the alleged poisonwhere it came from how it was to be handed over and so on the prosecutors tell us that caelius had it in his house he wanted to test it so he bought a slave for just that purpose the poison was effective the slave died very quickly the poison ciceros voice was suddenly choked by a sob he clenched his fists and rolled his eyes upward oh immortal gods when a mortal commits a terrible crime why do you close your eyes to it why do you allow the villain to go unpunished he gasped and shivered as if struggling to hold back tears the rollicking speech came to an abrupt halt the crowd was jolted into uneasy silence cicero stood absolutely still like a man paralyzed by emotion and fighting to regain control forgive me he finally said in a hoarse trembling voice but the very mention of poison let me explain myself judges it was the bitterest day of life that day when i saw my friend quintus die before my eyes quintus metellus celer i mean the man whose death made that woman a widow and freed her to do as she pleased such a fine man he was dedicated to serving rome and full of the strength to do it i remember the last time i saw him here in the forum going about his business in excellent health and high spirits full of plans for the future two days later i was called to his deathbed where i found him racked with pain barely able to breathe his mind had begun to fail but at the very end he became lucid again his last thoughts were not of himself but of rome he fixed his gaze on me as i wept and in broken words he tried to warn me of the storm that hung over my head the tempest that was brewing for the whole state cicero cicero how will you hold out against them without me to hold them in check he wept then not for himself but for the future of the city he loved and for the friends who would no longer have his protection i often wonder how differently things might have turned out had he lived would his cousin clodius have succeeded with a tenth of his mad schemes if quintus metellus celer had been alive to oppose him would his wife clodia have fallen into the downward spiral of disrepute that has ultimately brought us here today and now that woman has the audacity to speak of fastacting poisons how much does she know about the subject enough apparently if she goes ahead with her testimony perhaps she will tell us exactly how much she knows about poison and how she came to know it when i think that she still lives in the house where celer died when i think of what she has since turned that house into i wonder that the walls themselves had not rebelled in disgust and come toppling down around her cicero bowed his head for a long moment seemingly overcome with emotion as for clodia one would never have known what a famous beauty she was from the way she looked at that moment the bones of her face seemed ready to break through the skin her eyes smoldered like coals her mouth was a hard straight line showing a glint of teeth between bloodless lips excuse me judges said cicero recovering himself my memories of a noble and valiant friend have greatly upset me i fear and some of you too as i can see but let us persevere with this distasteful petty business and be done with it very well the story goes that after testing the poison on a hapless slave caelius handed it over to a friend of his publius licinius you see him here today sitting proudly among caeliuss supporters not the least bit ashamed to show his face despite the slander against him licinius they say was to give the poison to some of clodias slaves at the senian baths in a little pyxis ah but the slaves had betrayed the plot to their mistress so she sent some friends to lurk on the premises and seize licinius in the act of handing over the poison so goes the story anyway i am eagerly waiting to discover the identities of the upstanding witnesses who are supposed to have seen with their own eyes the poison in liciniuss hands so far their names have not been mentioned but they must be very reputable fellows indeed in the first place they are intimates of such a lady in the second they agreed to lurk about the baths in the middle of the day a job suitable only to the most respectable of men i felt the skin prickle on the back of my neck cicero was talking about me among others even without hearing my name mentioned i felt cut by his scorn exposed and flustered what then was clodia feeling at this moment but dont take my word for the worthiness of these witnesses these midday bathhouse skulkers cicero continued their actions speak for them we are told they hid out of sight and watched everything im sure they did that type loves to watch they bolted out of hiding accidentally oh dear premature ejaculatorswhat a deplorable lack of manly selfcontrol the story goes that licinius made his entrance and was just about to hand over the incriminating pyxis but had not quite done so when these superb anonymous witnesses burst forthwhereupon licinius drew back the pyxis and took to his heels in flight cicero shook his head and made a face of disgust sometimes no matter how badly a tale is told a shred of truth shines through take this shabby little drama for instance authored by a lady with so many other tawdry tales to her credit how devoid of plot how sorely lacking for an ending how could all these fellows have let licinius slip from their grasp when they were posted and ready and he suspected nothing what was the point of capturing him as he handed over the poison anyway once it passed out of his hands he could claim he had never seen it before why not seize him the moment he entered the baths hold him down and force a confession from him with all those bystanders for witnesses instead off licinius goes with the ladys gang in hot pursuit bumbling and tripping all over each other in the end we are left with no pyxis no poison not a single shred of evidence really what we have here is the finale of a mime show not a proper play but the sort of silly farce that sputters to an unsatisfying endno climax just a bunch of clowns bumbling off the stage if they come forward to testify i look forward to seeing the cast of this little mime show this trial could use some comic relief lets have a look at these young dandies who enjoy playacting as warriors under their mistresss command scouting the familiar terrain at the senian baths laying an ambush crowding into a bathtub and pretending its the trojan horse i know the type all glib and witty at dinner parties and the more they drink the wittier they become but idling on soft couches and chattering by lamplight is one thing telling the truth beneath the hot sun in a court of hard wooden benches is something else again if they cant even find their way around the baths how will they find the witness stand i give these socalled witnesses fair warning if they decide to come forward i will turn them upside down and shake the foolishness out of them so that we can all see whats left i suggest they keep their mouths shut and find other ways to curry their ladys favor let them cling to her do tricks and compete to grovel at her feetbut let them spare the life and career of an innocent man and what of that slave to whom the poison was to be handed over who is also to appear as a witness i searched the faces of those on the prosecutors benchesa glum lot of faces at the momentand spotted clodias man barnabas looking as ifhe had swallowed something unpleasant i am told that he has just been freed by his mistress made a citizen by her handor by her brothers hand since a woman cannot legally manumit a slave on her own what was behind this act of liberation was it a reward for loyalty and services beyond the normal call of duty or was there a more practical consideration for now that hes a citizen the fellow cannot be subjected to the normal means of obtaining evidence from a testifying slave torture tends to bring out the truth no amount of rehearsal can prepare even the best comic actor to recite falsehoods to a hot poker incidentally we should hardly be surprised that all this bother about a pyxis has given rise to an extremely indecent story concerning another pyxis and its contents you know the story i mean judges everyones talking about it everyone seems to think its true why not since it fits so well with the ladys indecent reputation and everyone finds the story hilarious despite the obscenity of it the gift could hardly be called inappropriate when one considers the receptive nature of the butt of the joke there you see youre all laughing even now well true or not obscene or not funny or not dont blame marcus caelius the joke must have been pulled by some young wanker with a clever hand and a wayward bent again from the corner of my eye i thought i saw catulluss lips moving when i turned to stare at him he looked at me darkly and moved away losing himself in the crowd clodias face was a study in misery cicero accepted another sip of water from tiro and waited for the laughter to die down i have now stated my case judges my task is done the task is now yours to decide the fate of an innocent young man he proceeded to his summation a brief recapitulation of caeliuss career a recitation of his virtues an appeal to be merciful to his distraught father a final scornful dismissal of the spurious charges against him i heard these words only vaguely i couldnt take my eyes off clodia i saw a woman utterly unnerved pale defeated confused resentful she looked as if she had been poisoned again and polluted as well medea had become medusa to judge by the shiftyeyed friends who squirmed on the benches around her they looked nervously here and there but turned their faces from clodia as if the merest glance from those haunted eyes might turn a man to stone chapter twenty six ciceros speech was followed by a recess after which the magistrate declared the testimony of witnesses would commence the common sentiment in the crowd was that the trial would probably carry over for at least another day given the number of witnesses expected to testify but when the court reassembled the prosecutors were embarrassed to reveal that most indeed virtually all of their scheduled witnesses had declined to appear the coterie of young men who had filled the benches around clodia had vanished so had clodia herself the supporters of caelius could hardly contain their triumph even caeliuss father dressed in his ragged funeral garments looked smug a handful of witnesses dared to appearsome of the outraged husbands whose wives had been insulted by caelius senator fufius and even a couple of the bathhouse skulkers the prosecutors who had clearly lost heart perfunctorily interviewed them cicero crossexamined them with effortless panache restraining his wit lest it appear wasted on such minor opponents the spectators began to disperse the drama had reached its climax with ciceros oration and only the most inveterate believers in surprise endings held out to see what the verdict would be the judges tallied their votes and announced their decision marcus caelius was not guilty i felt relieved of a great burden what if they had declared him guilty of all the charges against him including dios murder how could i have remained silent but they had not declared him guilty the crisis was averted still what of the poison plot against clodia cicero had argued that it was all a fiction concocted by clodia herself just another part of her scheme to take vengeance on caelius and the judges had agreed but what if caelius had tried to poison her had i no obligation to speak up the moment had passed and there was no undoing it i told myself that my sole intention from the outset was to discover the truth about dios death as for caelius and clodia whatever the truth of their intrigues against each other surely i owed nothing to either of them after the verdict was announced caeliuss supporters broke into cheering and gathered in a ring around him the prosecutors and their assistants glumly dispersed some of the judges went to congratulate caelius and pay compliments to cicero and crassus for their orations spectators headed off to see what activities connected with the great mother festival were still going on elsewhere in the city slaves gathered up folding chairs and carried them off where shall we go now said eco i think i want to be alone for a while i said take belbo with you i dont need a bodyguard anymore the trials over and im no danger to anybody still papa its a holiday people get rowdy please eco take belbo with you or better yet send him home to bethesda ill feel better knowing hes there while im not where are you going im not sure why dont you go home yourself i shook my head not yet papa whats going on he lowered his voice if dio was poisoned in your house who did it and why you know dont you i shook my head well talk about it later but papa ill spend the night at your house if thats all right have the slaves fix up a couch for me to sleep on of course papa are you sure you dont want me to come with you we could talk talk is not what i need i need to think and i can think more clearly if im by myself this last turned out to be untrue i wandered the city in a daze paying no attention to where i was going my thoughts turning in sluggish circles why had bethesda deceived me had it been left to her would she ever have told me the truth of course i knew why she had remained silent how does a woman tell her husband that shes poisoned his respected old mentor under his roof right under his very nose still she had reason did she think i wouldnt understand why had she never told me of her mothers death and about the terrible thing that had happened to her before i found her did she trust me so little even after all our years together my own feelings confused me no less was i angry or hurt did i want to punish bethesda or beg for her forgiveness i felt as if i had done something wrong but couldnt say what it was i knew i had been made a fool of bethesda had known the truth all along and yet had let me plod down the wrong path in darkness was she amused at my folly did she fear my reaction if i should discover the truth or did she simply think that she could get away with never telling me and considered that easiest for everybody she knew the truth was precious to me and she had withheld it from me i resented her for that under my roof before my eyes she had murdered a man she hated i understood her reason but still i was appalled and shaken by the enormity of it perhaps she was right not to trust me with the truth after all i passed revelers and vendors in the street heard the roar of a large crowd from the circus maximus went by a square where a stage was being put up for a performance the next day heard tambourines and looked up to see a group of galli dancing on a rooftop now and again i heard snatches of conversation which must have been about the trial so the young man got off completely clever cicero had no idea the woman was such a wanton the clodii will think twice before trying a stunt like that again everybody laughedyou should have seen the bitchs face who gives a damn about those egyptians anyway they stone women like that in other countries did i say husband i mean brother of courseim always making that mistake not just a whore but a particularly lewd and depraved old whore from whats said about her someone probably should go ahead and poison the monster i kept walking hours passed the sky grew dark the streets became empty still i walked i never knew where i was headed until i got there the phallic lamp above the entrance burned bright promising warmth and light within i rapped on the door of the salacious tavern and the doorman let me inside as a rule i drink no more than other men and less than most that night i felt like getting drunk the slave who brought wine was glad to help me in the pursuit the room was so noisy that i could hear only snatches of conversation much of which was about the trial ciceros jokes were repeated and obscenely embellished the story of the pyxis and its contents was told in numerous variations and arguments broke out over which version was correct wine prompted crude bursts of insight caelius may have screwed the bitch before but it was cicero who screwed her today the consensus seemed to be that caelius had escaped by the skin of his teeth and that clodia had been ruined for good and it was all for the best i sat and drank making no particular effort either to listen or not listen letting the words of strangers enter my ears as they might when my cup was empty i called for the server to fill it again it was quite late in the evening when the door opened and a large party came stamping in they were mostly young too well groomed and poshly dressed for the place they had obviously come from some other more respectable venue there were shouts of greeting and then a general cheer as the patrons recognized marcus caelius he acknowledged the show of support with a smile and a wave then made a tipsy bow that turned into a stumble his friends licinius and asicius each grabbed an arm to pull him upright i was surprised but only a little to see catullus in the group looking even drunker than caelius caelius and his friends took over a corner of the room he ordered a round of the taverns best wine for everyone which earned him another cheer the drowsy midnight mood of the place was dispelled and the room was suddenly loud and festive again i stared glumly at the dregs in my cup and wondered if i dared to have it filled again the glow of the wine had begun to pall and i was beginning to feel slightly queasy when the server passed me i covered my cup with my hand and shook my head whats wrong a voice shouted gordianus wont drink the wine i offer ill wager its better than whatever cheap slop youve been guzzling i turned and saw caelius watching me from across the room his lips pushed out in a mock pout no insult intended i muttered whats that cant hear you caelius cupped his ear and grinned youll have to come closer i shook my head caelius snapped his fingers and a moment later a couple of brawny bodyguards were on either side of me lifting me up by my elbows and carrying me across the room they sat me down on a bench across from caelius who laughed and clapped his hands like a child watching a magic trick youre in an awfully good mood tonight i said why not if things had gone badly today id be on a boat heading for massilia right now he made a face instead here i am surrounded by my friends in the heart of the most wonderful city in the world licinius and asicius sat on one side of him catullus on the other the rest of his party had gathered around a nearby table to throw dice im free free i thought cicero had you in his snare again you owe him quite a favor now does he know youre out carousing tonight making a liar of him cicero caelius made a rude noise with his lips dont worry i can handle him ive been doing it for years the student controls the teacher something like that youre a spoiled brat marcus caelius and people love me for it except maybe you why wont you drink the wine i offer ive had enough tonight you look like youve already had rather a lot yourself you too catullus catullus looked back at me blearily and blinked a few times he seemed to be at a level of inebriation that made him neither giddy nor maudlin but simply numb so you think weve had too much to drink said caelius weve only started server bring out more of your best wine for everyone are you sure you can afford such extravagance i said caelius smiled all my debts are paid off i thought you had no debts didnt you pay attention to cicero in court today i dont even keep ledger books gordianus all my finances are in papas name i see technically you have no debts thats how it works nowadays but like i said all the debts are paid off even the ones you owed to pompey he hesitated for only a moment even those but not repaid with coin no with services rendered next to him licinius and asicius stiffened caelius said asicius caelius laughed dont worry the trials are over your trial asicius and my trial and we are both as innocent as lambs you should learn how to shut up caelius snapped licinius shut up about what i said oh my friends think i talk too much but wheres the danger now im free then perhaps you could set my mind at rest about a few things i said licinius and asicius fidgeted but caelius smiled blandly at me why not next to him catullus stared obliviously into space and moved his lips composing a poem in his head perhaps do you remember when i last saw you caelius here at the tavern you swore to me by the shades of your ancestors that you didnt murder dio yes i remember i told you the truth and you swore that it wasnt asicius either also true but when i asked where you were and what you were up to on the night dio died you refused to tell me how could i tell you with the trial still pending caelius shut up snapped asicius i believe you i said when you swear that you didnt kill dio its my belief that he died of poison and yet someone broke into coponiuss house that night and dio was found with stab wounds in his chest can you explain that caelius now you bring up a very interesting point caelius said raising one eyebrow and as a matter of fact caelius you fool shut up relax asicius the trial is over and gordianus can be trusted with the truth cant you gordianus swear to me by the shade of your father that youll keep secret what im about to tell you i hesitated only a moment i swear caelius youre an idiot asicius stamped his foot and angrily left the room licinius stayed behind looking around warily for eavesdroppers catullus stared blankly into his cup asicius what an ass he always was death to a good conversation caelius smiled where were we the night dio died ah yes well it was the oddest thing you see i was supposed to kill dio its exactly as you had it figured im sure king ptolemy wanted to get rid of dio and so did pompey i owed pompey a pile of gold which i couldnt possibly repay so it was up to me to do old dio in just as you arranged the attack on the alexandrian envoys when they arrived in neapolis caelius nodded and kept up the attacks in puteoli and on the way up to rome the egyptians were almost too easy to frighten theyre about as courageous as pigeons but pigeons scatter when theyre attacked and there were so damned many of them and the last one left was dio exactly and that pigeon made a nasty mess licinius rolled his eyes caelius youre crazy to be telling him this shut up licinius has my judgment ever steered me wrong gordianus is like a dog with a bone hell never let go of this thing until hes got the truth now that it cant hurt us better to simply tell him so that he can go find another bone to chew hes sworn himself to secrecy now where was i all the egyptians gone but dio ah yes well i tried to get the kitchen slaves to poison him at lucius lucceiuss house of course having met that idiot lucceius once at a party i figured i could get away with just about anything under his roof but the slaves bungled it and killed dios taster instead and off dio went to coponiuss house a good thing lucceius is the type to see no evil or he could have forced his slaves to testify against me and ruined everything so it was on to titus coponiuss house titus is no fool and his slaves are as loyal as slaves come added to that dio was more wary than ever and pompey was really beginning to press me well there was nothing to do but sharpen the daggers and go on a midnight raid i needed help for that so i called on asicius hes the one who actually staged the raids on the envoys down south for me hes been one of king ptolemys agents for years knows a lot more about daggers and blood and that sort of thing than i do thank the gods hes not here to hear you groaned licinius covering his face catullus was busy poking at something in the bottom of his wine cup i nodded then you and asicius oh yes we went out that night with every intention of killing old dio sorry i know he was your old teacher and all that but egyptian politics is a nasty business you had no confederates inside coponiuss house not a single one too dangerous his slaves are too loyal as i said but you knew the room where dio was staying caelius shrugged not too hard to figure out id stayed in the house as a guest myself so the two of you climbed over the wall broke in the window burst into dios room and found him lying on his couch as dead as king numa ill never forget the sight of himmouth gaping open eyes staring oh yes most definitely dead then what what else could we do pompey had sent us to kill dio and he knew we intended to use daggers i didnt want pompey to think that dio had died of natural causes or that someone else had murdered him i wanted my debt discharged so we went ahead and stabbed him enough times to kill him if hed still been living more than enough from what i heard caelius shrugged then we made a bit of a mess in the room as if there might have been a struggle and then we got out of there as quickly as we could the next day everyone was saying that dio had been stabbed to death in his bed pompey was satisfied my debts were discharged and i figured that was the end of it but asicius was never secretive about his links to king ptolemy his enemies decided to put him on trial for murdering dio ptolemy hired cicero to handle the defense and cicero got asicius off the prosecution never really had enough evidence against him nor against you it seems especially not with cicero on my side caelius grinned yes that explains it i said stabbed after he was already dead no one in coponiuss house noticed the discrepancieshardly enough blood spattered about for so many wounds and the wounds all neatly close together not spread around no struggle and the slave girl too afraid to tell what she knew whats that said caelius youre muttering to yourself gordianus was i a bad habit yes youve put my mind to rest about dio the old dog can stop gnawing that bone but i have another bone with some marrow still left in it do you server more wine the violence against dio and the alexandrian envoys werent the only charges against you noand a good thing too what do you mean why clodia adding that poisoning charge at the last minute crassus said we should disallow it he said it was technically too late for the prosecutors to include it and that we didnt have time to prepare a defense cicero told him he was mad that it was a gift from the gods dont you see theyve given us exactly what we need now we have every reason to drag clodia into the case and that will be the end of the prosecution and he was right of course if clodia had kept out of sight id have been in much worse trouble but with clodia right there showing her face bringing her own accusation against me cicero was able to turn the trial on its head not did caelius murder the egyptians but why is that wicked woman trumping up charges against the poor boy and it worked brilliantly the prosecution was totally discredited accusing me of trying to poison clodia actually weakened all the other charges yes caelius i said quietly but what about the accusation itself catullus suddenly looked up from his wine cup and showed signs of life caelius gave me a supercilious grin gordianus a roman court has declared me to be an innocent man wrongfully accused what more do you need to know the truth i said i reached for his arm the force i used caught him by surprise he dropped his cup wine splashed on the floor caeliuss bodyguards lurched forward he kept them back with a shake of his head and spoke to me through gritted teeth gordianus youre hurting my wrist let go or i shall tell them to cut your hand off the truth caelius it goes no further than me i swear by the shade of my father the truth licinius here very nearly got caught with a pyxis full of poison at the senian baths he managed to empty the stuff into one of the tubs on his way outa waste of good poison but i put the pyxis to good use later caelius shut up licinius clenched his fists and the second attempt i said catullus stared at caelius the truth tell me he jerked his arm free and rubbed his wrist the second attempt almost succeeded im glad now that it didnt cicero was right dead clodia would have been truly dangerous to me an object of sympathy alive she was an object of scorn an asset to me in spite of herself so it worked out for the best clodia got off with a bit of indigestion and i got the sympathy of the judges the poison you used for the second attempt different from the first time id wanted to use something very quick to act i didnt want her to suffer but licinius threw that batch away so i ended up trying something calledwhat is it called licinius gorgons hair yes thats it it would have taken a bit longer im told but been just as effective i am sorry that chrysis got caught poor thing shes so delicate and now clodia will take it all out on her catullus spoke in a slurred voice caelius you told me what you wanted to hear catullus and you never want to hear the truth do you so what if i tried to poison her what do you care she despises you even more than she does me caelius you lying bastard catullus lurched toward him caelius drew back and lifted his hands a signal for his bodyguards to rescue him it happened so quickly that i experienced the journey from the bench to the street outside as a blurred moment of levitation followed by a hard landing on my posterior when my head stopped spinning i saw that catullus was sitting on the paving stones beside me after a moment he rolled forward onto his hands and knees crawled to the gutter and was violently ill a little later he crawled back to me you should try that he said wiping his chin youd feel better i dont want to feel better selfpitying bastard you sound like me what have you got to be sad about woman trouble at your age live long enough whelp and youll see it never ends then how do men stand it the brief relief of vomiting gave way to his usual misery so caelius really did try to poison her not once but twice he told you otherwise he lied to my face imagine that what were you doing in his company tonight anyway catullus looked even more miserable dont tell me i said let me guess you were sharing in the celebration since you helped him write his speech you helped cicero write his speech as well how did you know the look on your face at the trial today you couldnt help but enjoy hearing your phrases spoken aloud that business about clytemnestraforaquadrans and medea of the palatineit had to come from you likewise the reference to those lovers trophies clodia keeps in her secret treasure box under her statue of venus you told me no one knew about that but you and you only found out by accident i saw her face when cicero mentioned it so did you that was the last straw for her the moment she broke he stripped her naked and you helped you knew the jokes that would hurt her the most the crudest puns the nastiest metaphors are you the poet of love catullus or the poet of hate i hate and i love if you ask me how i do not know stop quoting yourself why did you do it dont you know i thought you loved clodia i thought you hated caelius which is precisely why i had to help him destroy her you baffle me catullus she had to be destroyed it was the only way now i can reclaim her what are you talking about catullus he clutched my arm dont you see as long as she had this burning passion for caelius i could never get her back shed put up with anything from him any abuse but now hes gone too far now she cant possibly love him anymore not after what they did to her at the trial today caelius and his advocates have made her the laughingstock of rome yes i helped i went to caelius the morning after we ran into him here at the tavern i told him i had some ideas for his speech cicero was quite excited to have me along the three of us had quite a time going through the orations adding jokes wondering just how far we should go that pun about the pyxis dont make me hear it all again its not that im proud but it had to be done she had to be brought down shed become too full of herself too proud too arrogant ever since celer died and she started running her own household now shes been broken in the only way it could be done we took everything that made her strongher beauty her pride her love of pleasureand turned it against her her own ancestors were turned against her the ones shes always gloating about shell never be able to brag about the family monuments again without everyone snickering behind her back she cant even turn to clodius not in public its me shell turn to i shook my head catullus you are surely the most deluded man i ever met you think so come with me right now to her house youll see no thank you clodias house is the last place on earth id care to be at this moment no thats not quite true the last place id want to be is in my own house but then its also the only place i want to be now whos not making sense catullus staggered to his feet are you coming with me or not i shook my head which seemed to go on spinning after i stood up farewell then gordianus farewell catullus and he turned and looked back at me blearily good luck he nodded and stumbled off into the darkness i waited for my head to stop spinning and tried to figure out the direction to ecos house the subura seemed a long way off chapter twenty seven i woke late the next morning my head felt as if a whole toga had been stuffed inside it i could taste scratchy wool on my tongue dunking my head in cold water helped so did eating a bit of food i stepped shakily into the garden at the heart of ecos house and found a place to sit in the sun after a while menenia walked by beneath the portico she acknowledged my presence with a nod but did not smile a little while later eco sauntered out to join me you came in awfully late last night papa whos the son here and whos the father can we talk now i suppose so about dio and how he died you never told me yesterday what you think i sighed you were right about the poison in my house being used to kill him but who did it i took a deep breath then another it was hard to say it aloud bethesda eco looked at me steadily less surprised than i expected him to be why i told him about the conversation i had overheard in my house between clodia and bethesda it must have been dio she was talking about dio was the powerful respected man who owned her mother she never said anything about it to me never not a single word but she must have recognized dio the moment she saw him did he recognize her he looked at her strangely i remember but she was hardly more than a child when he last saw her and he had a great many things on his mind no i dont think he knew who she was but she surely recognized him i think back now and realize how oddly she behaved that night i thought it was because i was going away what i find so appalling is how quickly she must have made the decision to kill him no deliberation no hesitation she got the poison fixed the dinner made a special portion for the guest and then watched him eat it right in front of me you have to talk to her papa im not ready i dont know what to say tell her you know what she did go on from there go on as if it makes no difference that my wife is a murderer that she compromised the honor of my house by killing a guest she should have come to me before or after she poisoned dio if not before then certainly after there you see how angry it makes me to talk about it no im not ready to go home to her yet i wonder if i ever will be dont talk that way papa you must understand why she did it look i wasnt taken entirely by surprise by what youve just told me i had a lot of time to think on the ride up from puteoli wondering how dio could have been poisoned in your house and by whom bethesda does the cooking alexandria was a common threadi figured she might somehow be responsible so ive had more time to think about this than you have and to make up my mind that it makes no difference i was with zotica all that time seeing what the brute did to her i cant be sorry that someone killed him if it was bethesda and if she had as much reason to hate the man as zotica did then what is there to forgive but it was murder eco coldblooded calculated committed in secret does my name and my household stand for nothing we are not murderers i stood and began to pace around the garden talking does no good i need to be alone again i need to think not another walk why not youll wear out the streets papa where will you go a completely unrelated thought entered my head ill take care of my last bit of business with clodia the money i gave you for your trip southyou must have a lot left over quite a bit its clodias money it was meant to bribe me so that id testify for her or else it was meant to pay for the slaves of lucceius who knows what she really had in mind either way she didnt get what she paid for did she never say im like caelius that i took money from clodia and didnt return it go fetch it will you ill take it back to her right now at least i can wash my hands of that affair and put it behind me for good eco went into the house and returned with a purse full of coins by the way how is zotica doing i said now that shes rested is she any calmer eco lowered his eyes is something wrong after we talked to her yesterday menenia showed her to a place where she could sleep and left her alone it was a mistake to let her out of the locked pantry when i came home from the forum oh no she ran away papa i cant say im surprised i told you shes turned wild like an animal i doubt that well ever see her again heading to clodias house by the shortest way would have taken me by my own front door so i took a roundabout route the day was hot and the way was steep i arrived sweaty and winded i rapped on the door after a long pause i rapped again finally the peephole opened a dispassionate eye observed me my names gordianus i said i have business with your mistress the peephole was shut after a long wait it opened again the eye that now perused me was penciled with makeup from the other side of the door i heard a familiar but unexpected voice its all right i know him we can let him in the door swung open to reveal the gallus trygonion after i stepped inside he motioned to the slave to shut the door behind us what business could you possibly have with clodia he said tersely he walked at a hurried clip toward the garden and i followed did she forget to pay you as a matter of fact she overpaid me gave me money for expenses i didnt incur i jiggled the bag of coins im here to return it trygonion looked at me as if i were mad then nodded and sighed i understand you wanted an excuse to see her again dont be ridiculous no really i do understand but im afraid you cant see her why not shes gone where he hesitated down to her villa at solonium she left early this morning before dawn she wanted to slip out of the city without being seen we arrived at the steps leading down to the garden and stopped beneath the giant venus i found my eyes wandering to the pedestal where catullus had said she kept her trophies in a secret compartment trygonion noticed she emptied it before she left she burned everything that could be burned you can see the ashes in that brazier over there the things that wouldnt burnjewels and necklaces and suchshe took with her to throw into the sea she said but why he shrugged how can a eunuch understand these things he walked to the fountain suddenly the sound of chanting echoed through the garden coming from the house of the galli why arent you with them i said ill join them soon enough she sent a messenger for me in the middle of the night saying she needed my help i have to leave she said i cant stand it here she always goes south for a month right after the great mother festival like a lot of rich people do down to baiae usually but she wasnt waiting for the festival to be over and she wasnt going to baiae solonium she said its closer and nobody ever goes there i never want to see anybody again he smiled ruefully i thought she intended for me to go with her the chanting grew louder and faster trygonion closed his eyes and moved his lips with the words then blinked and gazed at the sunlight reflected in the fountain but she didnt want me to go with her i need someone to close up the house for me she said id ask clodius but he mustnt come near this place not for a while youll do it for me wont you trygonion make sure the windows are all shuttered and locked put the good wine away so the slaves cant get to it dispatch some lastminute letters for me that sort of thing i said yes of course have a good trip together we studied the broken sunlight on the water right before she left as she was going out the door she turned back she called my name i ran to her she said oh and dont tell anyone where ive gone i said of course i wont but i suppose its all right to tell you gordianus you can keep a secret you are the most honest man in rome arent you his lips curled into a sardonic smile did a visitor come late last night trygonion gave me a blank look then smiled wanly oh you mean the poet the one who recited that awful thing about attis at the party yes one of the slaves told me he came beating on the door in the middle of the night drunk and demanding bad timing clodia was in no mood to be harassed she sent barnabas and some of the burlier freedmen to run him off i think he got away with nothing worse than a broken nose i thought of poor catullus lying alone in his dreary little room with his books hung over with a bloody nose and a broken heart shes a cold woman trygonion looked at me sharply youre like all the rest you think she feels nothing of course she feels everything how could she not being who she is she feels everything it amazes me that she can bear it the chanting became dreamlike magical the bits of sunlight on the water were dazzling and you trygonion are you the same everyone thinks you feel nothing but in reality he looked at me steadily his eyes swimming with tears daring me to go on but i left the rest of the thought unspoken i took the same circuitous route back to ecos house perhaps you should write a letter to meto eco suggested doesnt that often help to clear your head i dont think it would be wise to put incriminating information about my wife in a letter you can always burn it afterward dont you often do that anyway i sometimes think my sons know me too well i asked eco to show me where he kept his writing tools i sat in his little study and stared at the blank parchment for a long time then finally wrote to my beloved son meto serving under the command of gaius julius caesar in gaul from his loving father in rome may fortune be with you i write this letter on the nones of aprilis the second day of the great mother festival i put down the stylus and stared again at the parchment there was a sound from the doorway i looked up and saw meto looking back at me the gods delight in catching us off our guard the threads of our lives weave back and forth across one another intersecting in a pattern no mortal can discern my thoughts had turned to meto and now he stood before me in the flesh as if my desire had conjured him up by hercules i whispered what are you doing here his older brother suddenly appeared behind him they both burst out laughing you knew eco i said he was already here when you suggested i write the letter of course i couldnt resist the joke meto arrived right after you left for clodias house when we heard you coming back i made him go and hide you should see the look on your face playing tricks on your father is despicable yes but at least youre smiling said eco i pushed the parchment away from me a good thing youre here meto writing it all down would have been impossible he smiled and sat down beside me im lucky to be here in one piece i put my hand over his and drew in a breath i was always worried for him knowing the dangers he faced in gaul but that wasnt what he meant the riot over near the forum he explained surely its still going on didnt you see it on your way back from the palatine i took a roundabout route theres a play being put on for the festival eco interjected apparently some of clodiuss hooligans commandeered the stage and set off a riot instant revenge for the nasty things that were said about him at the trial yesterday put a man like clodius in charge of a festival and hell use it for his own petty ends said meto in disgust politicians are all the same but whats this business about a trial i tried to explain as succinctly as i could but after a moment meto held up his hand its all too complicated give me military strategy any day i laughed but what are you doing in rome is caesar here hes up in ravenna actually but you never heard me say that having a secret meeting with crassus then hes going to luca to meet with pompey caesar wants to appoint more generals and raise four legions hell need the help of those two to get the senate to approve the expenditures and to quash complaints that hes becoming too powerful if you ask me the three of them are going to resurrect the triumvirate and make it work this time its inevitable sooner or later the senate will become entirely defunct the senate cant rule itself much less an empire its nothing more than a hindrance now another obstacle in caesars way a rotten limb that needs to be pruned all this judicial haggling politicians constantly dragging each other into courtthis nonsense has to stop sooner or later from what youve said this trial of caelius is just one more example of how far the standard has fallen but whats the alternative said eco meto looked at his brother blandly caesar of course youre talking about a dictator like sulla i said shaking my head or worse said eco an outright king like ptolemy im talking about a man who can lead ive seen with my own eyes what caesar can do all this petty squabbling in rome seems quite absurd when youre up in gaul watching romans conquer the world pompey and crassus are hardly petty i said thats why a triumvirate is the answer said meto temporarily anyway but you never heard me say that what about men like clodius and milo said eco or cicero for that matter or caelius meto made an expression to show that such men were beneath contempt what had his service to caesar done to my son i had only a moment to ponder the question for the twins suddenly rushed into the room in a burst of laughter and golden hair meto might know a thing or two about military strategy but he was no match for his niece and nephew titania advanced from the left titus from the right each grabbed hold of an arm and climbed onto him when did they get so big and so strong meto laughed they intend to wrestle you i think said eco chagrined or at least immobilize you i said theyve succeeded meto grunted the twins squealed with triumph youd better give up now while you can i suggested gaulfighting uncle meto can take a lot rougher treatment than their delicate old grandpa and they know it i give up gasped meto the twins released him at once and then turned to mount a skirmish against me their attack turned out to be an assault of harmless hugs and kisses to which i submitted without a struggle but whats this i said what said titania this piece of jewelry pinned on your tunic a gorgons eye cried titus it gives her magical powers and i have to get it away from her even if i have to chop her head off but where did it come from my mouth was suddenly dry it was an earring of simple design a silver crook with a green glass beadthe twin of the earring which had been used to force the lock of my strongbox and which had been carelessly dropped inside when the poison was taken it came from the land of libya where the gorgons live said titania it can make you invisible thats what titus says yes but how did you come to have it from the tone of my voice she knew i wanted a serious answer she gave it to me said titania she told me shed lost the other one and she didnt want it anymore who gave it to you titania told me my heart sped up and will it really make me invisible she said no my voice shook i mean yes why not the other earring made her invisible to my eyes anyway it made me think i saw the truth when i couldnt begin to see it oh cybele eco furrowed his brow papa what are you talking about i have to go home now i think i may have been very very wrong about something belbo answered the front door at the sight of me he broke into a grin master thank the gods youre here is something wrong no nothing at all now that youre back has her mood been that terrible belbo rolled his eyes in answer then jumped at the voice from behind him whose mood bethesdas voice was like frost in the springtime i nodded to dismiss belbo who quickly disappeared bethesda and i looked at each other in silence for a long moment where have you been she finally said i spent the night at ecos house and the night before that i was in bed with a drunken poet actually she snorted did you see the trial yesterday yes quite a spectacle wasnt it you were there of course belbo held me a place at the very front i never saw you though i was standing at the back i never saw you either strange isnt it that we could be so close and yet not see each other her gaze softened a bit caelius was acquitted i was glad so was i i suppose but what they did to clodia was horrible yes it was appalling i wanted to stop them i would have stopped them if i could have i felt the same now shes left the city said bethesda how did you know that bethesda saw the look on my face and scowled dont be so suspicious do you imagine theres some sort of secret conspiracy of women a slave brought a note from clodia this morning i was supposed to visit her tomorrow and she wanted to let me know that she wouldnt be home she didnt say where she was going only that she was leaving rome at once she crossed her arms and walked into the garden i followed she kept her back to me i apologize for deceiving you husband you know the truth dont you i think i do i should explain that man dio i can hardly say his name back in alexandria before you bought me i know how could you i overheard you talking to clodia the other day in the garden at the back of the house she looked over her shoulder her eyes lit up as she comprehended then became clouded but i never said his name i made a point of not saying his name to clodia even so she nodded and turned her face away you should have told me bethesda you should have told me long ago i stepped closer and put my hand on the back of her neck she reached up and touched my fingers then you understand i cant be sorry that dios dead when i think of what he did to you and your mother and to who knows how many others then say you forgive me forgive me first bethesda for having had less faith in you than i should have i forgive you husband and i forgive you wife for deceiving me and for poisoning a guest in your house you confess she took a deep breath yes i shook my head no i cant forgive you for poisoning dio she stiffened but i will forgive you for continuing to deceive me with a false confession she turned from the way she looked up at me searching my face for signs of what i knew i was satisfied that i had found the truth at last a little while later i was sitting in my library looking out the open windows onto the garden the vines and flowers were in bloom bees and butterflies flitted in the bright sunshine diana appeared in the doorway you wanted to see me papa yes she looked grave for a moment then brightened mother says that meto is back yes for a short visit hes at ecos house theyll all be coming over for dinner soon i cant wait to see him i nodded and found myself unable to look at her i watched the bees and butterflies instead did your mother tell you what i wanted to talk to you about yes papa she suddenly hardened her voice the way her mother always did at the beginning of an argument to show that she would not be shaken when did your mother first tell you about dio about what he did to her years ago papa as soon as i was old enough to understand and yet she never told me it was between her and me papa a thing for a mother to tell a daughter men have secrets they never share with women i suppose we do so when dio came to the house that day when you introduced him i had no idea who he was mother had never told me the mans name only how wicked he was but when i told mother the visitors name and where he was from i saw from her face that something was terribly wrong all at once i knew its him isnt it i said she couldnt be sure so we went to have a look yes i remember the way you both looked at him and the way he looked at you no wonder he was startled by the sight of you especially when the two of you stood side by side how much you look like her when she was young i saw every look that passed between the three of you and yet i understood nothinglike a dog watching orators debate and to think i was the one who suggested that the two of you fix something for dio to eat was it your mother who told you to get the poison no papa i thought of it myself i knew where the poison was of course you did because i made such a point of warning you about it when i got it from eco so dangerous i thought to have poison in a house with a child dangerous in a way i never considered but your mother must have known when you mixed it into dios portion no i did it while her back was turned then made sure that i did the serving you did it all on your own in the blink of an eye you made up your mind to kill a man then fetched the poison slipped it into his food and diana lowered her eyes all on your own she nodded i shook my head when did bethesda give you those old greenglass earrings of hers diana sighed ages ago papa she tired of them and there were scratches in the glass so she let me have them i wore them from time to time and i never noticed of course bethesda wears her hair up showing her ears you still wear your hair down like a girl its funny i cant remember wearing them that day i cant even remember using one of them to pry open the lock on the strongbox to get at the poison but i suppose i must have its like it all happened underwater i didnt realize until days later that id lost the earring i looked everywhere for it everywhere but inside your strongbox finally i gave up on finding it i gave the widowed earring to titania yes titania told me i shook my head you left the lock just as it was broken you never even tried to replace the poison youd taken if only with something that looked similar i winced that fact alone should have told me that bethesda wasnt responsible she would have covered her tracks you behaved like a child diana thinking you could leave such clues and not be found out when did you tell your mother not until just the other day after clodias visit why did you wait so long im not surprised that you didnt tell me but i thought you had no secrets from your mother i meant to tell her right after dio left the house i wanted to but i was suddenly afraid then i was confused the next day after you were gone we heard that dio had died i could see that mother was pleased though she never spoke a word but everyone said that dio had been stabbed to death and if that was so how could i have poisoned him maybe the stuff was harmless i thought not poison at all just a yellow spice maybe i had only imagined doing it it all seemed so strange i didnt know what to do i just wanted to forget and be done with it i nodded so bethesda didnt know the truth until after clodias visit all her protests that caelius was innocent were only statements of opinion she was also sure that caelius could never have poisoned clodia well she was wrong on both countscaelius tried his best to kill dio and clodia both so much for bethesda as a judge of character so much for me admiring dio what prompted you to finally tell her it was hearing her tell clodia what happened to her and her mother when she was a girl i was amazed to hear her talk about it to anyone but me it made me cry that was when i finally made up my mind to tell her i poisoned dio not because i was proud of what i did but because i didnt want to have any secrets from her so that night after clodia left i told her she said that we mustnt tell anyone not even papa i said especially not him but a couple of days later after the two of you came back from clodias house mother came into my room to tell me about the party and then you burst in shouting at her youd gone looking for the poison and found the broken lock and the empty pyxis you threw the earring on the floorand suddenly i realized where i had lost it but what you said made no sense you seemed to think that for some reason mother had stolen the poison for clodia i groaned and shook my head i accused her of deceiving me and she admitted itbut we were talking about different things i thought she had given the poison to clodia behind my back but the deception was something elseshe knew you had poisoned dio and kept it from me diana nodded after you went storming out of the house mother told me if he does figure out the truth keep your mouth shut let me take the blame but you found me out didnt you papa she spoke without recrimination but rather with a hint of pride of bethesda for shielding her of me for finding her out i looked at her face in the soft light from the garden and saw a girlchild with lustrous black hair and the beginnings of a womans beauty i dont know what to make of you diana youre a mystery like your mother why did you do it what gave you the strength to go through with it how can you not understand papa do you remember when we were in this room the other day and i wanted to see the letter you were writing to meto it was a letter about the work you were doing looking into dios death i asked you why it was so important for you to know who killed dio you talked about peace of mind you said to me if someone who was close to you had been hurt wouldnt you want to avenge that person to redress the wrong that was done to them if you could of course papa thats exactly what i did i did it for mother i did it for the grandmother ill never know would you have me undo it if i could if you could turn back time would you have me do nothing instead i studied her face confused and tried to remember what i believed about murder and justice right and wrong wouldnt you have done the same thing yourself papa for an instant the veil of mystery dissolved the eyes that looked back at me were as familiar and empty of secrets as my own eyes in a mirror flesh of my flesh blood of my blood i put my hands on her shoulders and kissed her brow from the garden came the noise of the family arriving for dinnereco menenia meto the allconquering twins i drew back and looked into dianas eyes again and saw with a shiver of regret that the veil had returned she was a mystery again distinct and wholly of herself another mortal adrift in the cosmos out of my control beyond my comprehension the moment of recognition was fleeting as such moments always are like music which fills the void to overflowing and then vanishes in the twinkling of an eye authors note within thirteen years many of the players in the trial of marcus caelius would be in the historian t p wisemans phrase spectacularly dead clodius murdered during a skirmish with milos gang an angry mob burned the senate house the next day crassus massacred along with twentythousand troops in his illfated campaign for military glory against the parthians pompey a casualty of the tumultuous civil war cicero a casualty of the peace republican judicial restraints on political violence clearly failed as did the second attempt by crassus caesar and pompey to form a stabilizing triumvirate at the end of the road stood augustus king ptolemy would also be dead leaving his children including the famous cleopatra to fight over egypt and to fend off roman domination for a little while longer as for marcus caelius he shifted allegiance once too often and against the wrong man unable to convince a garrison of soldiers to revolt against caesar in the middle of the civil war his ambitions ended in a violent death his colorful correspondence with cicero survived to make him the darling of historians like gaston boissier in the history we are studying there is perhaps no more curious figure than caelius and w warde fowler who called caelius the most interesting figure in the life of his age early on the firstcentury commentator quintilian delivered the judgment of posterity marcus caelius deserved a cooler head and a longer life catullus died the soonest of any in bc of unknown causes he was probably about thirty years old what of clodia after the trial she vanishes from the scene though i suspect that gordianus may not have seen quite the last of her we get a glimpse of her again nine years later in some of ciceros letters to his friend atticus who appears to have been on good terms with clodia looking to buy property where he can enjoy his retirement a place to grow old in atticus assumes to which cicero bluntly replies a place where i can be buried cicero asks his friend to check out various horti that might be for sale around rome this is cicero in shackleton baileys translation clodias gardens i like but i dont think they are for sale and a few days later but you say something or other about clodia where is she then or when is she coming i prefer her grounds to anyones except othos but i dont think she will sell she likes the place and has plenty of money and how difficult the other thing is you are well aware but pray let us make an effort to think out some way of getting what i want so far as i can tell the very last we hear of her is in a letter of april bc in which cicero writes to atticus clodia quid egerit scribas ad me velim i should like you to tell me what clodia has done was cicero seeking clarification of a bit of gossip he had heard was he inquiring about clodia out of the blue we do not know i should like to acknowledge some of the books i encountered in my research foremost among them is t p wisemans superbly annotated catullus and his world a reappraisal cambridge university press which ranges far and wide to render a vivid picture of catullus and his circle of history
