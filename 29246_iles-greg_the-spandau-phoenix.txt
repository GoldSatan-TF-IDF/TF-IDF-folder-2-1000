the spandau phoenix greg iles the north sea lay serene unusual for spring but night would soon fall on a smoking broken continent reeling from the shock of war from the bloody dunes of dunkirk to the bombshattered streets of warsaw from the frozen tip of norway to the deserted beaches of the mediterranean europe was enslaved only england beleaguered and alone stood against the massed armies of hitlers wehrmacht and tonight london was scheduled to die by fire at hours greenwich time the greatest single concentration of luftwaffe bombers ever assembled would unleash their fury upon the unprotected city and over seven hundred acres of the british capital would cease to exist thousands of incendiary bombs would rain down upon civilian and soldier alike narrowly missing st pauls cathedral gutting the houses of parliament history would record that strike against london as the worst of the entire war a holocaust and yet all thisthe planning the casualties the goliathan destructionwas but the puff of smoke from a magicians gloved hand a spectacular diversion calculated to draw the eyes of the world away from a mission so daring and intricate that it would defy understanding for generations to come the man behind this ingenious plot was adolf hitler and tonight unknown to a single member of his general staff he would reach out from the berghof and undertake the most ambitious military feat of his life he had worked miracles beforethe blitzkrieg of poland the penetration of the impassable ardennesbut this would be the crowning achievement of his career it would raise him at last above alexander caesar and napoleon in one stunning blow he would twist the balance of world power inside out transforming his mortal foe into an ally and consigning his present ally to destruction to succeed he would have to reach into the very heart of britain but not with bombs or missiles tonight he needed precision and he had chosen his weapons accordingly treachery weakness envy fanaticismthe most destructive forces available to man all were familiar tools in hitlers hand and all were in place but such forces were unpredictable traitors lived in terror of discovery agents feared capture fanatics exploded without warning and weak men invited betrayal to effectively utilize such resources hitler knew someone had to be on the scenereassuring the agent directing the fanatic holding the hand of the traitor and a gun to the head of the coward but who could handle such a mission who could inspire both trust and fear in equal measure hitler knew such a man he was a soldier a man of fortyeight a pilot and he was already in the air two thousand feet above amsterdam the messerschmitt bf zerstdrer plowed through a low ceiling of cumulus clouds and burst into clear sky over the glittering north sea the afternoon sun flashed across the fighters silver wings setting off the blackpainted crosses that struck terror into the stoutest hearts across europe inside the cockpit the pilot breathed a sigh of relief for the last four hundred miles he had flown a tiring highly restricted route changing altitude several times to remain within the luftwaffes prescribed corridors of safety hitlers personal pilot had given him the coded map he carried and with it a warning not for amusement were the safety zones changed daily hans bahr had whispered with british spitfires regularly penetrating hermann goerings impenetrable wall of air defense the danger was real precautions necessary the pilot smiled grimly enemy fighters were the least of his worries this afternoon if he failed to execute the next step of his mission perfectly it would be a squadron of messerschmitts not spitfires that shot him into the sea at any moment the luftwaffe flight controllers expected him to turn back for germany as he had a dozen times before test flying the fighter lent to him personally by willi messerschmitt then returning home to his wife and child his privileged life but this time he would not turn back checking his airspeed against his watch he estimated the point at which he would fade from the luftwaffe radar screens based on the dutch island of terschelling hed reached the dutch coast at pm it was now at miles per hour he should have put fortyfour miles of the north sea behind him already german radar was no match for its british counterpart he knew but he would wait another three minutes just to make sure nothing could be left to chance tonight nothing the pilot shivered inside his furlined leather flying suit so much depended upon his mission the fates of england and germany very possibly the whole world it was enough to make any man shiver and russia that vast barbaric land infected by the cancer of communismhis fatherlands ancient enemyif he succeeded tonight russia would kneel beneath the swastika at last the pilot nudged the stick dipping the messerschmitts left wing and looked down through the thick glass canopy almost time he looked at his watch counting five four three two now like a steel falcon he swooped toward the sea hurtling downward at over four hundred miles per hour at the last instant he jerked the stick back and leveled out skimming the wave tops as he stormed north toward aalborg the main luftwaffe fighter base in denmark his desperate race had begun fighting through the heavy air at sea level the messerschmitt drank fuel like water but the pilots main concern now was secrecy and finding the landing signal he reminded himself two dozen training flights had familiarized him with the aircraft but the detour to denmark had been unexpected he had never flown this far north without visual references he was not afraid but he would feel much better once he sighted the feords of denmark to starboard it had been a long time since the pilot had killed the battles of the great war seemed so vague now he had certainly fired hundreds of rounds in anger but one was never really sureabout the killing not until the charges came anyway the terrible bloody heroically insane assaults of flesh against steel he had almost been killedhe remembered that clearly enoughby a bullet in the left lung one of three wounds hed taken while fighting in the famous list regiment but he had survived that was the important thing the dead in the enemy trenches who knew really he would kill tonight he would have no choice checking the two compasses strapped to his left thigh he took a careful bearing then quickly returned his eyes to the horizon indicator this close to the surface of the sea the water played tricks on the mind hundreds of expert pilots had plowed into the waves simply by letting their concentration falter for a few moments only six minutes to aalborg he thought nervously why risk it he climbed to one thousand feet then leveled out and craned his neck to survey the sea below waveless it receded before him with the gentle curve of the earth except there dead ahead he could see broken coastline denmark he had done it feeling a hot surge of adrenaline he scanned the clouds for fighter patrols if one spotted him he decided he would sit tight hold his course and pretend to be a straggler from an early raid the hard empty northern land flashed beneath him his destination was a small ancillary strip just short of aalborg air base but where was it the runway his special cargo where a thousand feet below the red flash of railway flares suddenly lit up in parallel lines to his left the signal a lone green flare indicated the proper direction of approach the pilot circled wide until he had come degrees then began nursing the messerschmitt in the strip was shortno margin for error altimeter zero with hated breath he felt tentatively for the runway nothing nothing whumpthe wheels dropped hard onto concrete the plane shuddered from the impact but steadied fast cutting his engines the pilot rolled to a stop thirty meters beyond the last two flares before he could unfasten his harness two ground crewmen slid the canopy back over his head silently they helped him with his straps and pulled him from the cockpit their rough familiarity startled him but he let it pass to them he was just another pilotn a somewhat irregular mission perhaps operating solo from a practically deserted strip south of the basebut just a pilot all the same had he removed his flying helmet and goggles the crewmen would have exhibited quite a different attitude and certainly would not have touched him without permission the pilots face was known to every man woman and child in germany indeed to millions across europe and the world without a word he walked a little way off the strip and unzipped his suit to relieve himself there were only the two crewmen he saw and they had been well briefed from a battered tank truck one pumped fuel into the plane while the other toiled with special fittings beneath the messerschmitts left wing the pilot scanned the small runway there was an old socktype wind indicator a pile of scrap parts left from prewar days and several yards down the strip a small wooden shack that had probably once housed some danish mechanics tools it houses something quite different now ill wager he thought zipping up he walked slowly toward the shack alert for any sign of human occupation the sleek black bonnet of a daimler jutted from behind the ramshackle building gleaming like a funeral hearse the pilot slipped around the shack and peered through the windshield of the car empty remembering his instructions he wound a long flying scarf around the lower half of his face it made breathing difficult but combined with his flying helmet it left only his eyes visible to an observer he entered the shack without knocking darkness shrouded the interior but the fetid air was pregnant with human presence someone not the pilot lit a lantern and the room slowly revealed itself a major wearing the smart black uniform of himmlers ss stood less than a meter from the pilot unlike most of his type this representative of himmlers elite corps was quite fat he looked more accustomed to the comforts of a soft billet like paris than a battle zone behind him a thinner man dressed in a leather flying suit sat rigidly in a straightbacked wooden chair like the pilot his face was also draped by a scarf his eyes darted nervously between the newcomer and the ss man right on time the ss major said looking at his watch im major horst berger the pilot nodded but offered no name drink a bottle appeared from the shadows schnapps cognac my god the pilot thought does the fool carry a stocked bar about in his car he shook his head emphatically then jerked his thumb toward the halfopen door ill see to the preparations nonsense major berger replied dismissing the idea with a flick of his bottle the crewmen can handle it theyre some of the best from aalborg its a shame really it is the pilot thought but i dont think youre too upset about it i think youre enjoying all this im going back to the plane he muttered the man in the wooden chair stood slowly where do you think youre going major berger barked but the man ignored him oh all right berger complained he buttoned his collar and followed the pair out of the shack they know about the drop tanks the pilot asked when berger had caught up ja the ninehundredliter ones sure look theyre fitting them now berger was right on the far side of the plane two ground crewmen attached the first of two eggshaped auxiliary fuel containers to the messerschmitts blunttipped wings when they finished they moved to the near side of the aircraft doublecheck the wetpoints the pilot called the chief mechanic nodded already working the pilot turned to major berger i had an idea he said flying up the ss man frowned what idea i want them to grease my guns before we take off what do you mean lubricate them i assure you that the weapons are in perfect working order no i want them to pack the barrels with grease behind majo berger the man in the flying suit stepped sideways and looked curiously at the pilot you cant be serious berger objected he turned around tell him he said but the man in the flying suit only cocked his head to one side but thats suicide major berger insisted one chance encounter with a british patrol and he shook his head i simply cannot allow it if youre shot down my career could take a very nasty turn your career is over already the pilot thought grimly grease the guns he shouted to the crewmen who having fitted the empty drop tanks now anxiously pumped fuel into them the chief mechanic stood at the rear of the fuel truck trying to decide which of the two men giving orders was really in charge he knew major berger from aalborg but something about the tall masked pilot hinted at a more dangerous authority you cant do that major berger protested stop that there im in command here the chief mechanic shut off the fuel hose and stared at the three men at the edge of the runway slowly with great purpose the pilot pointed a long arm toward the crewman under the wing and shouted through his scarf you grease my guns thats a direct order the chief mechanic recognized the sound of authority now he climbed onto the fuel truck to get a grease gun from his tool box major berger laid a quivering hand on a schmeisser machine pistol at his belt you have lost your mind i believe he said softly rescind that order immediately or ill put you under arrest glancing back toward the crewmenwho were now busy packing the messerschmitts twentymillimeter cannon with heavy black greasethe pilot took hold of his scarf and unwrapped it slowly from his head when his face became visible the ss man fell back a step his eyes wide in shock behind him the man in the flying suit swallowed hard and turned away the pilots face was dark saturnine with eyes set deep beneath bushy black brows that almost met in the center his imperious stare radiated command remove your hand from that pistol he said quietly for several moments major berger stood still as stone then slowly he let his hand fall from the schmeissers grip jawohl herr herr reichminister now herr major and be about your business go suddenly major berger was all action with a pounding heart he hurried toward the messerschmitt his face hot and tingling with fear blood roared in his ears he had just threatened to place the deputy fuhrer of the german reichrudolf hessunder arrest in a daze he ordered the crewmen to speed their packing of the guns while they complied he harried them about their earlier maintenance were the wetpoints clear would the wing drop tanks disengage properly when empty at the edge of the runway hess turned to the man in the flying suit come closer he murmured the man took a tentative step forward and stood at attention you understand about the guns hess asked slowly the man nodded assent i know its dangerous but its dangerous for us both under certain circumstances it could make all the difference again the man nodded he was a pilot also and had in fact flown many more missions than the man who had so suddenly assumed command of this situation he understood the logic a plane purported to be on a mission of peace would appear much more convincing with its guns disabled but even if he hadnt understood he was in no position to argue its been a long time hauptmann hess said using the rank of captain in place of a name the captain nodded overhead a pair of messerschmitts roared by from aalborg headed south on patrol it is a great sacrifice you have made for your country hauptmann you and men like you have given up all normality so that men like myself could prosecute the war in comparative safety its a great burden is it not the captain thought fleetingly of his wife and child he had not seen them for over three years now he wondered if he ever would again he nodded slowly once were in the plane said hess i wont be able to see your face let me see it now before as the captain reached for the end of his scarf major berger scurried back to tell them the plane was almost ready the two pilots enthralled in the strange play they found themselves acting out heard nothing what the ss man saw when he reached them struck him like a blow to the stomach all his breath passed out in a single kasp and he knew that he stood at the brink of extinction before him two men with the same face stood together shaking hands and that face major berger felt as if he had stumbled into a hall of mirrors where only the dangerous people were multiplied the pilots gripped hands for a long moment their eyes heavy with the knowledge that both their lives might end tonight over foreign soil in the cockpit of an unarmed fighter my god berger croaked neither pilot acknowledged his presence how long has it been hauptmann hess asked since dessau herr reichminister you look thinner hess murmured i still cant believe it its positively unnerving then sharply is the plane ready berger i i believe so herr to your work then jawohl herr reichminister major berger turned and marched toward the crewmen who now stood uncertainly against the fuel truck waiting for permission to return to aalborg berger unclipped his schmeisser with one hand as he walked all finished he called jawohl herr major answered the chief mechanic fine fine step away from the truck please berger raised the stubby barrel of his schmeisser but herr major what are you doing what have we done a great service to your fatherland the ss man said nowstep awayfrom the truck the crewmen looked at each other frozen like terrified game finally it dawned on them why major berger was hesitating he obviously knew something about the volatility of aircraft fuel vapor backing closer to the truck the chief mechanic clasped his greasy hands together in supplication please herr major i have a family the dance was over major berger took three steps backward and fired a sustained burst from the schmeisser hess screamed a warning but it was too late used with skill the schmeisser could be a precise weapon but major bergers skill was limited of a twelveround burst only four rounds struck the crewmen the remainder tore through the rusted shell of the fuel truck like it was papr the explosion knocked major berger a dozen feet from where he stood hess and thecaptain had instinctively dived for the concrete now they lay prone shielding their eyes from the flash when hess finally looked up he saw major berger silhouetted against the flames stumbling proudly toward them through a pall of black smoke how about that the ss man cried looking back at the inferno no evidence now idiot hess shouted theyll have a patrol from aalborg here in five minutes to investigate berger grinned let me take care of them herr reichminister the ss knows how to handle the luftwaffe hess felt relieved berger was making it easy stupidity was something he had no patience with im sorry major he said looking hard into the ss mans face i cannot allow that like a cobra hypnotizing a bird hess transfixed berger with his dark deepset eyes quite naturally he drew a walther automatic from the forepouch of his flight su i it and pulled back the slide the fat ss mans mouth opened slowly his hands hung limp at his sides the schmeisser clipped uselessly to his belt but why he asked quietly why me something to do with reinhard heydrich i believe bergers eyes grew wide then they closed his head sagged onto his tunic for the fatherland hess said quietly he pulled the trigger the captain jumped at the report of the walther major bergers body jerked twice on the ground then lay still take his schmeisser and any ammunition you can find hess ordered check the daimler jawohl herr reichminister the next few minutes were a blur of action that both men would try to remember clearly for the rest of their livesplundering the corpse for ammunition searching the car doublechecking the drop tanks of the aircraft donning their parachutes firing the twin daimlerbenz engines turning the plane on the old cracked concreteboth men instinctively carrying out tasks they had rehearsed a thousand times in their heads the tension compounded by the knowledge that an armed patrol might arrive from aalborg at any moment before boarding the plane they exchanged personal effects hess quickly but carefully removed the validating items that had been agreed upon three compasses a leica camera his wristwatch some photographs a box of strange and varied drugs and finally the fine gold identification chain worn by all members of hitlers inner circle he handed them to the captain with a short word of explanation for each mine my wifes mine my wife and son the man receiving these items already knew their history but he kept silent perhaps he thought the reichminister speaks in farewell to all the familiar things he might lose tonight the captain understood that feeling well even this strange and poignant ceremony merged into the mindnumbing rush of fear and adrenaline that accompanied takeoff and neither man spoke again until they found themselves forty miles over the north sea arrowing toward their target as the plan dictated hess had yielded the controls to the captain hess now sat in the radio operators seat facing the twin tail fins of the fighter the two men used no namesonly ranksand limited their conversation to the mechanics of the mission range the captain asked tilting his head back toward the rearfacing seat twelve hundred and fifty miles with the ninehundredliter tanks hess replied i meant range to target the island or the castle the island six hundred and seventy miles the captain asked no more questions for the next hour he stared down at the steadily darkening sea and thought of his family hess studied a sheaf of papers in his lap maps photographs and minibiographies secretly copied from ss files in the basement of the prinzalbrechtstrasse ceaselessly he went over each detail visualizing the contingencies he could face upon landing a hundred miles off the english coast he began drilling the pilot in his duties how much did they tell you hauptmann a lot too much i think you see the extra radio to your right you can operate it if all goes well you have only a few things to remember first the drop tanks whatever happens you ditch them into the sea same with the extra radio after my time is up of course forty minutes is the time limit remember that forty minutes forty minutes i wait if you have not received my message within that time the mission has failed in that case there was a sharp intake of breath from the pilot quiet but audible hess knew what caused that soundthe unbanishable fear of death he felt it too but for him it was different he knew the stakes of the mission the inestimable strategic gain that dwarfed the possible loss of two human lives like the man in the pilots seat hess too had a familya wife and young son but for a man in his positiona man so close to the fuhrersuch things were luxuries one knew might be lost at any moment for him death was simply an obstacle to success that must be avoided at all costs but for the man in the pilots chair hauptmann hess said almost gently sir i know what frightens you now i really do but there are worse things than death do you understand me far worse the pilots reply was a hoarse hollow gurgle hearing it hess decided that empathy was not the proper motivator for this man when he next spoke his voice brimmed with confidence dwelling on that is of no use whatsoever hauptmann the plan is flawless the important thing is have you been studying have i been studying the captain was obviously relieved to be talking about something else my god some ironassed ss brigadefiihrer grilled me for two days straight probably schellenberg who never mind hauptmann better that you dont know silence filled the cockpit as the pilots mind drifted back to the fate that awaited him should his special passenger fail herr reichminister he asked at length yes how do you rate your chances of sudcess its not in my hands hauptmann so i would be foolish to guess its up to the british now my advice is to prepare for the worst hess thought bitterly the fuhrers bankers have been since january just concentrate on your part of the mission he said and for gods sake be sure to jump from a high enough altitude to destroy the plane its nothing the british havent seen before but theres no need to make them a present of it once youve gotten my message just jump and wait until i can get you released it shouldnt take more than a few days if you dont get the message verdammt hess cursed silently theres just no avoiding it his next words cut with the brittle edge of command if you dont get my message hauptmann you know what must be done jawohl the pilot murmured hoping he sounded more confident than he felt he was sickeningly aware of the small sticky cyanide capsule taped against his chest he wondered if he could possibly go through with this thing that everyone but him seemed to consider simply business as usual said earnestly you listen to me hauptmann hess know why your participation is necessary british intelligence knows i am coming to england hess kept talking trying to fill the emptiness that would give the pilot too much time to think up here with germany falling far behind the concept of duty seemed much more abstract than it did when one was surrounded by the reinforcing order of the army and the ss the captain seemed soundand heydrich had vouched for himbut given enough time to consider his position he might do anything after all what sane man wanted to die cut your speed hess ordered his voice quickening hold at the miles had melted away before the messerschmitts nose they were a mere sixty miles off the scottish coast on a clear evening like this the raf radar stations would begin to pick up reflections from the fighter at any moment hess tightened his parachute harness then set aside his maps and leaned backward stay high and clear he shouted to the canopy lid make sure they see us coming in where are you going out we should make landfall over a place called holy island ill jump there stay high over the mainland for a few miles then dive and run like hell theyll probably scramble a whole squadron once they realize what youre flying jawohl the pilot acknowledged herr reichminister what is it have you ever parachuted before nein never an ironic laugh cut through the drone of the twin engines whats so funny hauptmann ive never jumped either thats a pretty significant fact to have overlooked in the planning of this mission dont you think hess permitted himself a wry smile perhaps that fact was taken into account hauptmann some people might even be counting on it oh my god its too late to worry about that now we dont have the fuel to make it back to germany even if we wanted to what the pilot exclaimed but the drop tanks are empty hess finished or soon will be the pilot felt his stomach turn a somersault but before he could puzzle out his passengers meaning he spied land below herr reichminister the island i see it from sixtyfive hundred feet holy island was a tiny speck only distinguishable by the small bright ribbon separating it from the mainland and a flare i see a flare green or red hess asked his face taut red the canopy hauptmann move together the two men struggled to slide back the heavy glass parachuting from a messerschmitt was not common practicestrictly an emergency measureand quite a few aviators had died attempting it push the pilot yelled with all their strength the two men heaved their bodies against the transparent lid of the cockpit their straining muscles quivered in agony until all at once the frame gave way and locked in the open position the noise in the cockpit was deafening now the engines roaring the wind a screaming living thing that struggled to pluck the men from their tiny tube of steel above it all the pilot shouted were over the gap now herr reichminister go go suddenly hess looked into his lap empty he had forgotten to ditch his papers no sign of them in the cockpit they must have been sucked out the moment the canopy opened he prayed they had found their way down to the sea and not to the island below jump herr reichminister hess struggled into a crouch and faced the lethal tail fins of the zerstsrer the time for niceties had passed he reached behind him and jerked the pilots head back hauptmann he shouted heydrich only ordered those drop tanks fitted to make sure you came this far they are empty no matter what happens you cannot turn back you have no choice but to follow orders if i succeed your actions really wont matter but if i fail you cannot you know the price of failuresippenhaft never forget that sippenhaft binds us both now climb give me some draft the messerschmitts nose pitched up momentarily creating a small space shielded from the wind with a defiant yell hess hurled himself up and backward a novice he pulled the ripcord the moment he cleared the plane the tightfolded silk tore open with a ripping sound then quickly blossomed into a soft white mushroom that circled lazily down through the mist toward the scottish earth below cursing the pilot struggled to secure the canopy without help it was twice as difficult but hesss final words had chilled him to the core only a sheet of curved glass could now separate him from the terrifying destiny he had been ordered to face with the desperate strength of a condemned man he slammed it shut he dipped his left wingd glanced backward there was the descending chute soft and distant and peaceful barring a catastrophic landing the reichminister would at least begin his mission safely it heartened the pilot to know that a novice could actually clear the plane but something deeper in him recoiled in dread they had tricked him the bastards had lured him into a suicidal mission by letting him think he would have a way out after all his training they hadnt even trusted him to carry out his orders empty auxiliary tanks the swine they had known he would have sole control of the plane after hess jumped and they had made sure he wouldnt have enough fuel to turn back if the mission went bad and as if that werent enough hess had threatened him with sippenhaft sippenhaft the word caused the pilots breath to come in quick gasps he had heard tales of the nazis ultimate penalty for betrayal but he hadnt really believed them sippenhaft dictated that not only a traitors life but the lives of his entire family became forfeit when judgment was rendered against him children parents the aged and infirm none were spared there was no appeal and the sentence once decreed was swiftly executed with a guttural scream the pilot cursed god for giving him another mans face in that moment he felt it was a surer death sentence than a cancer of the brain setting his mouth in a grim line he hurled the plane into a screaming dive not pulling up until the rocky scottish earth seemed about to shatter the nose of his aircraft thenas hess had suggestedhe ran like hell opening the zerstdrer up to miles per hour over the low stone villages and patchwork fields in other circumstances the heartstopping groundlevel flight might have been an exhilarating experience tonight it felt like a race against death it was a patrolling boulton paul defiant had answered a scramble call from the raf plotting room at inverness the messerschmitt pilot never even saw it oblivious he stormed across the darkening island like a banshee sixteen feet above the earth with the twinengined messerschmitts tremendous speed advantage the pursuing british fighter was outpaced like a sparrow behind a hunting hawk dun avel hill rose in the distance height meters the information chattered into the pilots brain like a ticker tape there it is he muttered spying the silhouette of dungavel castle my part of this insane mission the castle flashed beneath his fuselage with one hand he checked the radio set near his right knee working please call he thought please he heard nothing not even static with shaking hands he touched the stick and hopped over a line of trees bisecting a sheep pasture he saw fields a road more trees then the town of kilmamock sprawled dark across the road he swept on a patch of mist then fog the sea like a black arrow he shot out over the western coast of scotland climbing fast to his left he sighted his turning landmark a giant rock jutting meters into the sky shining pale in the moonlight as if drawn by a magnet his eyes locked onto the tiny face of his newly acquired watch thirty minutes gone and no signal ten minutes from now his fate would be sealed if you receive no signal in forty minutes hauptmann you will turn out to sea and swallow your cyanide capsule he wondered if he would be dead before his plane plowed into the icy depths of the north atlantic christ in heaven his mind screamed what mad bastard dreamed this one up but he knewreinhard heydrichthe maddest bastard of them all steeling himself against panic he banked wide to the south and flew parallel to the coast praying that hesss signal would come his eyes flicked across the instrument panel altimeter airspeed compass fuelthe tanks without even looking down he jerked a lever next to his seat two auxiliary fuel tanks tumbled down through the darkness one would be recovered from the clyde estuary the next day by a british drifter empty the radio stayed silent he checked it again still working his watch showed thirtynine minutes gone his throat went dry sixty seconds to zero hour sixty seconds to suicide here you are sir one cyanide cocktailfor the glory of the reich for the last time the pilot looked longingly down upon the dark mirror of the sea his left hand crept into his flying suit and touched the cyanide capsule taped against his breast then with frightening clarity an image of his wife and daughter came into his mind its not fair he shouted in desolation its the fucking nobodies who do the dying in one violent flash of terror and outrage the pilot jerked the stick to port and headed the roaring fighter back inland his tearfilled eyes pierced the scottish mist searching out the landmarks he had studied so long in denmark with a shudder of hope he spied the firstrailroad tracks shining like quicksilver in the night maybe the signal will still come he hoped desperately but he knew it wouldnt his eyes scoured the earth for his second landmarka small lake to the south of dungavel castle there the messerschmitt streaked across the water like a mirage the small village of eaglesham appeared ahead the fighter thundered across the rooftops wheeling in a high climbing circle over dungavel castle he had done it like an intravenous blast of morphine the pilotfelt a sudden rush of exhilaration a wild joy cascading through him ignited by the nearness of death his survival instinct had thrown some switch deep within his brain he had but one thought nowsurvive at sixtyfive hundred feet the nightmare began with no one to fly the plane while he jumped the pilot decided to kill his engines as a safety measure only one engine coperated the other its cylinders redhot from the long flight from aalborg continued to ignite the fuel mixture he throttled back hard until the engine died losing precious seconds then he wrestled the canopy open he could not get out of the cockpit like an invisible iron hand the wind pinned him to the back panel desperately he tried to loop the plane hoping to drop out as it turned over but centrifugal force unforgiving held him in his seat when enough blood had rushed out of his brain he blacked out unaware of anything around him the pilot roared toward oblivion by the time he regained consciousness the aircraft stood on its tail hanging motionless in space in a millisecond it would fall like two tons of scrap steel with one mighty flex of his knees he jumped clear as he fell his brain swirled with visions of the reichministers chute billowing open in the dying light floating peacefully toward a mission that by now had failed his own chute snapped open with a jerk in the distance he saw a shower of sparks the messerschmitt had found the earth he broke his left ankle when he hit the ground but surging adrenaline shielded his mind against the pain shouts of alarm echoed from the darkness struggling to free himself from the harness he surveyed by moonlight the small farm at the edge of the field in which he had landed before he could see much of anything a man appeared out of the darkness it was the head plowman of the farm a man named david mclean the scotsman approached cautiously and asked the pilot his name struggling to clear his stunned brain the pilot searched for his cover name when it came to him he almost laughed aloud confused he gave the man his real name instead what the hell he thought i dont even exist anymore in germany heydrich saw to that are you german the scotsman asked yes the pilot answered in english somewhere among the dark hills the messerschmitt finally exploded lighting the sky with a momentary flash are there any more with you the scotsman asked nervously from the plane the pilot blinked trying to take in the enormity of what he had doneand what he had been ordered to do the cyanide capsule still lay like a viper against his chest no he said firmly i flew alone the scotsman seemed to accept this readilyi want to go to dungavel castle the pilot said somehow in his confusion he could notor would notabandon his original mission i have an important message for the duke of hamilton he added solemnly are you armed mcleans voice was tentative no i have no weapon the farmer simply stared a shrill voice from the darkness finally broke the awkward silence whats happened whos out there a germans landed mclean answered go get some soldiers thus began a strange pageant of uncertain hospitality that would last for nearly thirty hours from the mcleans humble living roomwhere the pilot was offered tea on the familys best chinato the local home guard hut at busby he continued to give the name he had offered the plowman upon landinghis own it was obvious that no one knew what to make of him somehow somewhere something had gone wrong the pilot had expected to land inside a cordon of intelligence officers instead hed been met by one confused farmer where were the sternfaced young operatives of mi several times he repeated his request to be taken to the duke of hamilton but from the bare room at busby he was taken by army truck to maryhill barracks at glasgow at maryhill the pain of his broken ankle finally burned through his shock when hementioned it to his captors they transferred him to the military hospital at buchanan castle about twenty miles south of glasgow it was there nearly thirty hours after the unarmed messerschmitt first crossed the scottish coast that the duke of hamilton finally arrived to confront the pilot douglas hamilton looked as young apd dashing as the photograph in his ss file the premier peer of scotland an raf wing commander and famous aviator in his own right hamilton faced the tall german confidently awaiting some explanation the pilot stood nervously preparing to throw himself on the mercy of the duke yet he hesitated what would happen if he did that it was possible that there had simply been a radio malfunction that hess was even now carrying out his secret mission whatever it was heydrich might blame him if hesss mission failed and then of course his family would die he could probably save his family by committing suicide as ordered but then his child would have no father the pilot studied the dukes face hamilton had met rudolf hess briefly at the berlin olympics he knew what did the duke see now fully expecting to be thrown into chains the pilot requested that the officer accompanying the duke withdraw from the room when he had gone the pilot took a step toward hamilton but said nothing the duke stared stupefied though his rational mind resisted it the first seeds of recognition had been planted in his brain the haughty bearing the dark heavybrowed patrician face hamilton could scarcely believe his eyes and despite the dukes attempt to conceal his astonishment the pilot saw everything in an instant the dizzying hope of a condemned man who has glimpsed deliverance surged through him my god he thought it could still work and why not its what i have trained to do for five years the duke was waiting without further hesitationand out of courage or cowardice he would never knowthe pilot stepped away from the iron discipline of a decade i am reichminister rudolf hess he said stiffly deputy fuhrer of the german reich leader of the nazi party with classic british reserve the duke remained impassive i cannot be sure if that is true he said finally hamilton had strained for skepticism but in his eyes the pilot discerned a different reaction altogethernot disbelief but shock shock that adolf hitlers deputyarguably the second most powerful man in nazi germanystood before him now in a military hospital in the heart of britain that shock was the very sign of hamiltons acceptance i am reichminister rudolf hess with a single lungful of air the frightened pilot had transformed himself into the most important prisoner of war in england his mind reeled drunk with the reprieve he no longer thought of the man who had parachuted from the messerschmitt before him hesss signal had not come but no one else knew that no one but hess and he was probably dead by now the pilot could always claim he had received a garbled signal then simply proceeded with his mission as ordered no one could lay the failure of hesss mission at his door the pilot closed his eyes in relief sippenhaft be damned no one would kill his family without giving him a chance to explain by taking this gamblethe only chance he could see of survivalthe desperate captain unknowingly precipitated the most bizarre conspiracy of the second world war and a hundred miles to the east alive or eat rea u hessa man with enough secrets in his head to unleash catastrophic civil war in englandisappeared from the face of the earth the duke of hamilton maintained his attitude of skepticism throughout the brief interview but before he left the hospital he issued orders that the prisoner be moved to a secret location and held under double guard book one we t berlin a talebearer revealeth secrets but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter proverbs chapter one the wrecking ball arced slowly across the snowcarpeted courtyard and smashed into the last building left on the prison grounds launching bricks through the air like mosscovered mortar rounds spandau prison the brooding redbrick fortress that had stood for over a century and housed the most notorious nazi war criminals for the past forty years was being leveled in a single day the last inmate of s andau rudolf hess was dead he had committed suicide just four weeks ago relieving the west german government of the burden of one million pounds sterling it paid each year to maintain the aged nazis isolated captivity in a rare display of solidarity france great britain the united states and the soviet unionthe former allies who guarded spandau by monthly turnshad agreed that the prison should be destroyed as quickly as possible to prevent its becoming a shrine to neonazi fanatics throughout the day crowds had gathered in the cold to watch the demolition because spandau stood in the british sector of berlin it fell to the royal engineers to carry out this formidable job at first light an explosives team brought down the main structure like a collapsing house of cards then after the dust settled into the snow bulldozers and wrecking cranes moved in they pulverized the prisons masonry dismembered its iron skeleton and piled the remains into huge mounds that looked all too familiar to berliners of a certain age this year berlin was years old all across the city massive construction and restoration projects had been proceeding apace in celebration of the historic anniversary yet this grim fortress the berliners knew would never rise again for years they had passed this way as they went about their business rarely giving a thought to this last stubborn symbol of what in the glow of glasnost seemed ancient history but now that spandaus forbidding battlements no longer darkened the wilhelmstrasse skyline they stopped to ponder its ghosts by dusk only the prison heating plant still stood its smokestack painted in stark relief against the gunmetal clouds a wreckingcrane drew back its mammoth concrete ball the stack trembled as if waiting for the final blow the ball swung slowly through its arc then struck like a bomb the smokestack exploded into a cloud of brick and dust showering what had been the prison kitchen only minutes before a sharp cheer cut through the din of heavy diesel motors it came from beyond the cordoned perimeter the cheer was not for the eradication of spandau particularly but rather a spontaneous human expression of awe at the sight of largescale destruction tated by the spectators a french corporal gestured for some german policemen to help him disperse the crowd excellent hand signals quickly bridged the language barrier and with trademark efficiency the berlin polizei went to work achtung they bellowed go home haue ah this area is clearly marked as dangerous move on its too cold for gawking nothing here but brick and stone these efforts convinced the casually curious who continued home with a story of minor interest to tell over dinner but others were not so easily diverted several old men lingered across the busy street their breath steaming in the cold some feigned boredom others stared openly at the wrecked prison or glanced furtively at the others who had stayed behind a stubborn knot of young toughsubbed skinheads because of their ritually shaven scalpsswaggered up to the floodlit prison gate to shout nazi slogans at the british troops they did not go unnoticed every passerby who had shown more than a casual interest in the wrecking operation had been photographed today inside the trailer being used to coordinate the demolition a russian corporal carefully clicked off two telephoto exposures of every person who remained on the block after the german police moved in within the hour these photographs would find their way into kgb caserooms in east berlin where they would be digi tized fed into a massive database and run through a formidable electronic gauntlet intelligence agents jewish fanatics radical journalists surviving nazis each exotic species would be painstakingly identified and catalogued and any unknowns handed over to the east german secret policethe notorious stasito be manually compared against their files these steps would consume priceless computer time and many manhours of work by the east germans but moscow didnt mind asking the destruction of spandau was anything but routine to the kgb lavrenti beria himself chief of the brutal nkvd under stalin had passed a special directive down through the successive heads of the cheka defining the importance of spandaus inmates to unsolved cases and on this eveningthirtyfour years after berias death by firing squadonly one of those cases remained open rudolf hess the current chief of the kgb did not intend to leave it that way a little way up the wilhelmstrasse perched motionless on a low brick wall a sentinel even more vigilant an the russians watched the germans clear the street dressed as a laborer and almost seventy years old the watcher had the chiseled face of a hawk and he stared with bright unblinking eyes he needed no camera his brain instantaneously recorded each face that appeared in the street making associations and judgments no computer ever could his name was jonas stern for twelve years stern had not left the state of israel indeed no one knew that he was in germany now but yesterday he had paid out of his own pocket to travel to this country he hated beyond all thought he had known about spandaus destruction of course they all did but something deeper had drawn him here three days agoas he carried water from the kibbutz well to his small ev desertsomething bilious had shack on the edge of e neg risen from his core and driven him to this place stern had not resisted such premonitions came infrequently and experience had taught him they were not to be ignored watching the bulwarked prison being crushed into powder he felt opposing waves of triumph and guilt roll through his chest he had knownhe knewmen and women who had passed through spandau on their way to the death factories of mauthausen and birkenau part of him wished the prison could remain standing as a monument to those souls and to the punishment meted out to their murderers punishment he thought but not justice never justice stern reached into a worn leather bag at his side and withdrew an orange he peeled it while he watched the demolition the light was almost gone in the distance a huge yellow crane backed too quickly across the prison courtyard stern tensed as the flagstones cracked like brittle bones ten minutes later the mechanical monsters ground to a screeching halt while the senior british officr issued his dismissal orders a pale yellow berlin city bus rumbled up to the prison headlights cutting through the lightly falling snow the moment it stopped twentyfour soldiers dressed in a potpourri of uniforms spilled into the darkening prison yard and broke into four groups of six these soldiers represented a compromise typical of the farcical four power administration of spandau the normal monthlong guard tours were handled by rota and went off with a minimum of friction but the destruction of the prison like every previous disruption of routine had brought chaos first the russians had refused to accept german police security at the prison thenbecause no allied nation trusted any of its allies to guard spandaus ruins alonethey decided they would all do it with a token detachment of west berlin police along to keep up appearances while the royal engineers boarded the idling bus the ncos of the four guard details deployed their men throughout the compound near the shattered prison gate a black american master sergeant gave his squad a final brief okay ladies everybodys got his sector map right sir barked his troops in unison then listen up this aint gate duty at the base got it the germs have the perimeterwe got the interior our orders are to guard this wreckage thats ostensibly as the captain says we are here to watch the russians they watch us we watch them same old same old right only these ivans probably aint grunts dig probably grumaybe even kgb so keep your pots on and your slits open questions i how longs the gig sarge this patrol lasts twelve hours chapman six to six if youre still awake thenand youd better bethen you qan get back to your hot little pastry on the bendlerstrasse when the laughter died the sergeant grinned and barked spread out gentlemen the enemy is already in place as the six americans fanned out into the yard a greenandwhite volkswagen van marked polizei stopped in the street before the prison it waited for a break in traffic then jounced over the curb and came to rest before the command trailer steps instantly six men wearing the dusty green uniform of the west berlin police trundled out of its cargo door and lined up between the van and the trailer dieter hauer the captain in charge of the police contingent climbed down from the drivers seat and stepped around the van he had an arresting face with a strong jaw and a full military mustache his clear gray eyes swept once across the wrecked prison lot in the dusk he noticed that the foulweather ponchos of the allied soldiers gave the impression that they all served the same army hauer knew better those young men were a fragmented muster of jangling nerves and suspiciontwo dozen accidents waiting to happen the germans call their police bullenbullsand hauer personified the nickname even at fiftyfive his powerful barrelchested body radiated enough authority to intimidate men thirty years his junior he wore neither gloves helmet nor cap against the cold and contrary to what the recruits in his unit suspected this was no affectation meant to impress them rather as people who knew him were aware he possessed an almost inhuman resilience against external annoyances whether natural or manmade hauer called attention as he stepped back around the van his officers formed a tight unit beneath the command trailers harsh floodlamp ive told anyone whod listen that we didnt want this assignment he said naturally no one gives a shit there were a few nervous chuckles hauer spat onto the snow a hostagerecovery specialist heplainly considered this token guard detail an affront to his dignity you should feel very safe tonight gentlemen he continued with heavy sarcasm we have the soldiers of france england the united states and mother russia with us tonight they are here to provide the security which we the west berlin police are deemed unfit to provide hauer clasped his hands behind his back im sure you men feel as i do about this but nothing can be done you know your assignments four of you will guard the perimeter apfel weissyoure designated rovers youll paol at random watching for improper conduct among the regular troops what constitutes improper conduct here i have not been told i assume it means unsanctioned searches or provocation between forces everyone do your best to stay clear of the russians whatever agencies those men out there serve i doubt its the red army if you have a problem sound your whistle and wail ill come to you everyone else hold your position until instructed otherwise hauer paused staring into the young faces around him his eyes lingered on a reddishblond sergeant with gray eyes then flicked away be cautious he said evenly but dont be timid we are on german soil regardless of what any political document may say any provocation verbal or physical will be reported to me immediately immediately the venom in hauers voice made it plain he would brook no insult from the soviets or anyone else he spoke as though he might even welcome it check your sector maps carefully he added i want no mistakes tonight you will show these soldier boys the meaning of professionalism and discipline go six policemen scattered hans apfel the reddishblond sergeant whom hauer had designated one of the rovers trotted about twenty meters then stopped and looked back at his superior hauer was studying a map of the prison an unlit cigar clamped between his teeth hans started to walk back but the american sergeant suddenly appeared from behind the police van and engaged hauer in quiet conversation hans turned and struck out across the snow following the line of the wilhemstrasse to his left angrily he crushed a loose window pane beneath his boot with no warning at all this day had become one of the most uncomfortable of his life one minute he had been on his way out of the friedrichstrasse police station headed home to his wife the next a duty sergeant had tapped him on the shoulder said he needed a good man for a secret detail and practically thrust hans into a van headed for spandau prison that in itself was a pain in the ass double shifts were hell especially those that had to be pulled on foot in the snow but that wasnt the real source of hanss discomfort the problem was that the commander of the guard detail captain dieter hauer was hanss father none of the other men on this detail knew thatfor which hans was gratefulbut he had a strange feeling that might soon change during the ride to spandau he had stared resolutely out of the van window refusing to be drawn into conversation he couldnt understand how it had happened he and his father had a longstanding arrangementa simple agreement designed to deal with a complex family situationand hauer must have broken it it was the only explanation after a few minutes of bitter confusion hans resolved to deal with this situation the way he always did by ignoring it he kicked a mound of snow out of his path so far he had made only two cautious circuits of the perimeter he felt more than a little tense about strolling into a security zone where soldiers carried loaded assault rifles as casually as their wallets he panned his eyes across the dark lot shielding them from the snow with a gloved hand god but the british did theirjob well he thought ghostly mountains of jagged brick and iron rose up out of the swirling snow like the bombedout remnants of berlin buildings that had never been restored drawing a deep breath he stepped forward into the shadows it was a strange journey for fifteen or twenty steps he would see nothing but the glow of distant street lamps then a soldier would materialize a black mirage against the falling snow some challenged him most did not when they did hans simply said versaillesthe code word printed at the bottom of his sector mapand they let him pass he couldnt shake a vague feeling of anxiety that had settled on his shoulders as he passed the soldiers he tried to focus on the weapon each carried in the darkness all the uniforms looked alike but the guns identified everyone each russian stood statuestill his sharklike kalashnikov resting buttfirst on the ground like an extension of his arrnthe french also stood though not at attention they cradled their famas rifles in crooked elbows and tried vainly to smoke in the frigid wind the british carried no rifles each having been issued a sidearm in the interest of discretion it was the americans who disturbed hans some leaned casually against broken slabs of concrete their weapons nowhere in evidence others squatted on piles of brick hunched over their m arinalites as if they could barely stay awake none of the us soldiers had even bothered to challenge hanss passage at first he felt angry that nato soldiers would take such a casual approach to their duties but after a while he began to wonder their indifference could simply be a ruse couldnt it certainly for an assignment such as this a highcaliber team would have been chosen after three hours patrol hanss suspicions were proved correct when he nearly stumbled over the black american sergeant surveying the prison grounds through a bulbous scope fitted to his m not wishing to startle him hans whispered versailles sergeant when the american didnt respond he tried again what can you see everything from the command trailer on the east to that ivan pissing on a brick pile on the west the sergeant replied in german never taking his eyes from the scope i cant see any of that imageintensifier the american murmured well well i didnt know the red army let its sentries take a pissbreak on guard duwhat the noncom wrenched the rifle away from his face what is it hans asked alarmed nothing damn this thing works by light magnification not infrared that smartass flashed a spotlight toward me and whited out my scope what an asshole hans grunted in mutual distaste for the russians nice scope he said hoping to get a look through it himself your outfit doesnt have em some units do the drug units mostly i used one in training but they arent issued for street duty too bad the american scanned the ruins this is one weird place isnt it hans shrugged and tried to look nonchalant like a graveyard man a hundred and fifty cells in this place and only one occupiedby hess dude mustve known some serious shit to keep him locked down that tight the sergeant cocked his head and squinted at hans man you know you look familiar yeah you look like that guy that tennis player becker hans finished looking at the ground becker yeah boris becker i guess everybody tells you that huh hans looked up once a day at least ill bet it doesnt hurt you with the frduleins id rather have his income hans said smiling it was his stock answer but the american laughed besides he added im married yeah the sergeant grinned back me too six years and two kids you hans shook his head weve been trying but we havent had any luck thats a bitch said the american shaking his head i got some buddies with that problem man they gotta check the calendar and their old ladys temperature and every other damn thing before they can even get it on no thanks when the sergeant saw hanss expression he said hey sorry bout that man guess you know more about it than you ever wanted to he raised his rifle again sighting in on yet another invisible target bang he said and lowered the weapon wed better keep moving boris he disappeared into the shadows taking the scope with him for the next six hours hans moved through the darkness without speaking to anyone except to answer the challenges of the russians they seemed to be taking the operation much more seriously than anyone else he noticed almost personally about four am he decided to have a second look at his map he approached the command trailer obliquely walking backward to read by the glow of the single floodlamp suddenly he heard voices peering around the trailer he saw the french and british sergeants sitting together on the makeshift steps the frenchman was very young like most of the twentyseven hundred conscripts who comprised the french garrison in berlin the brit was older a veteran of englands professional army he did most of the talking the frenchman smoked and listened in silence now and then the wind carried distinct words to hans hess was onelefenant and bloody russians were others suddenly the frenchman stood flicked his cigarette butt into the darkness and strode out of the white pool of light the englishman followed close on his heels hans turned to go then froze one meter behind him stood the imposing silhouette of captain dieter hauer the fiery eye of a cigar blazed orange in the darkness hello hans said the deep burnished voice hans said nothing damned cold for this time of year eh why am i here hans asked you broke our agreement no i didnt this was bound to happen sooner or later even with a twentythousandman police force hans considered this i suppose youre right he said at length it doesnt matter just another assignment right hauer nodded youve been doing a hell of a job i hear youngest sergeant in berlin hans flushed a little shrugged i lied hans hauer said suddenly i did break our agreement i requested you for this detail hanss eyes narrowed why because it was busy work killing time i thought we might get a chance to talk hans studied the slushy ground so talk hauer seemed to search for words theres a lot that needs saying or nothing hauer sighed deeply id really like to know why you came to berlin three years now you must have wanted some kind of reconciliation or answers or something hans stiffened so why are you asking the questions hauer looked hard into hanss eyes all right he said softly well wait until youre ready before hans could reply hauer vanished into the darkness even the glow of his cigar had disappeared hans stood still for some moments then shaking his head angrily he hurried into the shadows and resumed his patrol time passed quickly now the silence broken only by an occasional siren or the roar of a jet from the british military airport at gatow with the snow soaking into his uniform hans walked faster to take his mind off the cold he hoped he would be lucky enough to get home before his wife ilse left for work sometimes after a particularly rough night shift she would cook him a breakfast of weisswurst and buns even if she was in a hurry he checked his watch almost am it would be dawn soon he felt better as the end of his shift neared what he really wanted was to get out of the weather for a while and have a smoke a mountain of shattered concrete near the rear of the lot looked as though it might afford good shelter so he made for it the nearest soldier was russian but he stood at least thirty meters from the pile hans slipped through a narrow opening when the sentry wasnt looking he found himself in a comfortable little nook that shielded him completely from the wind he wiped off a slab of concrete sat down and warmed his face by breathing into his cupped gloves nestled in this dark burrow he was invisible to the patrolling soldiers yet he still commanded a surprisingly wide view of the prison grounds the snow had finally stopped and even the wind had fallen off a bit in the predawn silence the demolished prison looked like pictures of bombedout dresden he had seen as a schoolboy motionless sentries standing tall against bleak destruction watching over nothing hans took out his cigarettes he was trying to quit but he still carried a pack whenever he went into a potentially stressful situation just the knowledge that he could light up sometimes calmed his nerves but not tonight removing one glove with his teeth he fumbled in his jacket for matches he leaned as far away as he could from the opening to his little cave scraped a match across the striking pad then cupped it in his palm to conceal the light he held it to his cigarette drawing deeply his shivering hand made the job difficult but he soon steadied it and was rewarded with a jagged rush of smoke as the match flame neared his fingers a glint of white flashed against the blackness of the chamber when he flicked the match away the glimmer vanished probably only a bit of snow he thought but boredom made him curious gauging the risk of discovery by the russian he lit a second match there near the floor of his cubbyhole he could see the object clearly nownot glass but papera small wad stuck to a long narrow brick he hunched over and held the match nearer in the close light he could see that rather than being stuck to the brick as he had first thought the paper actually protruded from the brick itself he grasped the folded wad and tugged it gently from its receptacle the paper made a dry scraping sound hans inserted his index finger into the brick he couldnt feel the bottom the second match died he lit another quickly spreading open the crinkled wad of onionskin he surveyed his find in the flickering light it seemed to be a personal document of some sort a will or a diary perhaps handprinted in heavy blocked letters in the dying matchlight hans read as rapidly as he could this is the testament of prisoner i am the last now and i know that i shall never be granted the freedom that imore than any of those released before medeserve death is the only freedom i will know i hear his black wings beating about me while my child lives i cannot speak but here i shall write i only pray that i can be coherent between the drugs the questions the promises and the threats i sometimes wonder if i am not already mad i only hope that long after these events cease to have immediate consequencest n our insane world someone will find these words and learn the obscene truth not only of hammier heydrich and the rest but of englandof those who would have sold her honor and ultimately her existence forthe crunch of boot heels on snow jolted hans back to reality someone was coming jerking his head to the aperture in the bricks he closed his hand on the searing match and peered out into an alien world dawn had come in its unforgiving light hans saw a russian soldier less than ten meters from his hiding place moving slowly forward with his ak extended the flare of the third match had drawn him fool hans cursed himself he jammed the sheaf of paper into his boot then he stepped boldly out of the niche and strode toward the advancing soldier halt cried the russian emphasizing the command with a jerk of his kalashnikov versailles hans countered in the steadiest voice he could muster his calm delivery of the password took the russian aback what are you doing in there polizeilasked the soldier in passable german smoke hans replied extending the pack having a smoke out of the wind he waved his sector map in a wide arc as if to take in the wind itself no wind the russian stated flatly never taking his eyes from hanss face it was true sometime during the last few minutes the wind had died smoke comrade hans repeated versailles smoke tovarich he continued to proffer the pack but the soldier only cocked his head toward his redpatched collar and spoke quietly hans caught his breath when he spied the small transmitter clipped to the sentrys belt the russians were in radio contact in seconds the soldiers zealous comrades would come running hans felt a hot wave of panic a surprisingly strong aversion to letting the russians discover the papers gripped him he cursed himself for not leaving them in the little cave rather than stuffing them into his boot like a naive shoplifter he had almost reached the point of blind flight when a shrill whistle pierced the air in staccato bursts chaos erupted all over the compound the long anxious night of surveillance had strained everyones nerves to the breaking point and the whistle blast like a hair trigger catapulted every man into the almost sexual release of physical action contrary to orders every soldier and policeman on the lot abandoned his post to converge on the alarm the russian whipped his head toward the noise then back to hans shouted commands echoed across the prison yard rebounding through the broken canyons versailles hans shouted versailles comrade lets go the russian seemed confused he lowered his rifle a little wavering versailles he murmured he looked hard at hans for a moment more then he broke and ran rooted to the earth hans exhaled slowly he felt cold sweat pouring across his temples with quivering hands he pocketed his cigarettes then carefully refolded his sector map realizing as he did so that the paper he held was not his sector map at all but the first page of the papers he had found in the hollow brick like a fool he had been waving under the russians nose the very thing he wanted to conceal thank god that idiot didnt check it he thought he pressed the page deep into his left boot pulled his trouser legs down around his feet and sprinted toward the sound of confusion in the brief moments it took hans to respond to the whistle a routine police matter had escalated into a potentially explosive confrontation near the blasted prison gate five soviet soldiers stood in a tight circle around two fortyish men wearing frayed business suits they pointed their aks menacingly while nearby their commander argued vehemently with erhard weiss the russian was insisting that the trespassers be taken to an east german poliee station for interrogation weiss was doing his best to calm the shouting russian but he was obviously out of his depth captain hauer was nowhere in sight and while the other policemen stood behind weiss looking resolute hans knew that their walthers would be no match for the soviet assault weapons if it came to a showdown the sergeants of the nato detachments kept their men well clear of the argument they knew political dynamite when they saw it while the soviets kept their rifles leveled at the wideeyed captiveswho looked as if they might collapse from shock at any momentthe russian sergeant bellowed louder and louder in broken german trying to bully the tenacious weiss into giving up his prisoners to his credit weiss stood firyn he refused to allow any action to be taken until captain hauer had been apprised of the situation hans stepped forward hoping to interject some moderation into the dispute yet before he could speak a black bmw screeched up to the curb and captain hauer vaulted from its rear door what the hell is this he shouted the screaming russian immediately redirected his tirade at hauer but the german bnisquely raised his hand breaking the flood of words like a wave against a rock weiss he barked sir explain weiss was so relieved to have the responsibility of the prisoners lifted from his shoulders that his words tumbled over themselves captain five minutes ago i saw two men moving suspiciously inside the perimeter they must have slipped in somewhere between willi and me i flashed my light on them and shouted halt but they were startled and ran they charged straight into one of the russians and before i could even blow my whistle every russian on the lot had surrounded them radios hauer muttered captain the soviet sergeant bellowed these men are prisoners of the soviet government any attempt to interfere without a word hauer strode past the russian and into the deadly circle of automatic weapons he began a rapid professional interrogation of the prisoners speaking quietly in german the black american sergeant whistled low that cops got balls he observed loudly enough for all to hear one of his men giggled nervously the terrified civilians were elated to be questioned by a fellow countryman in less than a minute hauer extracted the relevant information from them and his men relaxed considerably during the exchange it revealed a familiar situationdistasteful perhaps but thankfully routine even the russians holding the kalashnikovs seemed to have picked up on captain hauers casual manner he patted the smaller of the two trespassers on the shoulder then slipped out of the circle a few of the rifles dropped noticeably as he stepped up to the russian officer theyre quite harmless comrade he explained a couple of homos thats all misunderstanding the slang the russian continued to scowl at hauer what is their explanation he demanded stiffly theyre homosexuals sergeant queers schwiile golden boys i think you call them looking for a temporary love nest thats all theyre all over berlin no matter the russian snapped grasping hauers meaning at last they have trespassed on soviet territory and they must be interrogated at our headquarters in east berlin he motioned to his men the rifles jerked back up instantly he barked an order and started marching toward the parking area hauer had no time to consult his superiors as to legalities but he knew that allowing russian soldiers to drag two of his fellow countrymen into the ddr without any semblance of a trial was something no west berliner with an ounce of pride would do without a fight glancingaround he tried to gauge the sympathies of the nato squads the americans looked as if they might be with him but hauer knew he couldnt rely on that if it came to a fight force would probably be counterproductive in any case he thought it usually was hed have to try a different tack five steps carried him to the departing russian he grasped the burly man by his tunic and spun him around listen sergeant he whispered forcefully or major or colonel or whatever the hell you are these man have committed no serious offense and they certainly pose no threat to the security of this site i suggest we search them then book them into one of our stations just like anybody else that way we keep the press out of it understand pravda izvestia if you want to make an international incident out of this youre quite welcome to do it but you take full responsibility am i clear the russian understood well enough and for a moment he considered hauers suggestion but the situation was not so simple now he had gone too far to back down in front of his men ignoring hauer he turned to his squad these men are suspected enemies of the soviet union they will remainin soviet custody until the objective of their mission has been determined corporal put them aboard our bus furious but outgunned hauer thought quickly he had dealt with russian officers for more than twentyfive years and all his experience had taught him one lesson the communist system inefficient as it was had grown proficient at breeding one thing out of its citizensindividual initiative this russian had to be reminded that his actions could have serious international implications with two fingers hauer removed his walther from its holster and handed it to an astonished weiss with a theatrical flourish again the soviet riflemen paused uncertainly their eyes riveted on the unpredictable policeman we have a stalemate comrade hauer declared loudly you wish to keep these men in soviet custody very well you now stand on the only plot of russian soil in west berlinan accident of history that will soon be rectified i think you may keep the prisoners here for as long as you wish the russian slowed his march however crossing into the ddr with two citizens of the federal republic is an entirely different mattera political matterand quite beyond my power or yours to authorize the prisoners must remain here until we have contacted our superior officers i shall accompany you to the command trailer where we can make the necessary calls hauer looked over his shoulder i would also suggest to the british sergeant that he join us as we are in the british sector of the city hauer started toward the trailer he didnt intend to give the russian time to argue apfel he shouted weiss drive everyone back to the station then go home ill handle the paperwork on this but captain weiss protested go hans grabbed weisss sleeve and pulled him toward the van the dazed recruits followed their eyes on hauer as he marched toward the trailer the british sergeant suddenly made aware of his responsibility conferred with his men a couple of whom restlessly fingered their browning hipower pistols bristling with fury the russian ordered his men to follow hauer with the prisoners it made a strange parade hauer unarmed strode purposefully toward the command trailer while the russianslooking a bit sheepish in spite of being armed to the teethherded their rumpled prisoners along behind the british brought up the rear the american master sergeant stood with his hands on his hips shaking his head in amazement that kraut is one smooth son of a bitch gentlemen i hope yall were paying attention he may be wearing a cops uniform but that man is a soldier yes sir id bet my stripes on it the american was right as hauer marched toward the trailer every inch of his ramrod bearing bore the indelible stamp of military discipline nothing betrayed the turmoil he felt knowing that the only thing stopping the angry russian from taking control of the prisoners was the ring of men and steel at the checkpoints leading out of the cityertainly not one headstrong police captain just six weeks from retirement inside the police van hans calmed down a little he pulled into the wilheimstrasse then wheeled onto the heerstrasse heading east for a time no one spoke hauers actions had unnerved them all finally weiss broke the silence did you see that hans of course he said tersely the sheaf of papers felt like a kilo of heroin strapped to his leg old hauer stepped in front of those machine guns like they werent even there said one of the younger men i kind of got the feeling hed done it before mused weiss he has hans said flatly when asked a chorus of surprised voices quite a few times actually he works hostage recovery for special tasks division how do you know so much about him hans felt his face flush he shrugged and looked out the window to cover it im glad it happened weiss said softly why asked one of the recruits showed those russians what for thats why showed them west berlins not a doormat for their filthy boots theyll have quite a little mess on their hands now wont they hans we all will erhard hauer ought to be prefect suggested an old hand of twentyone hes twice the man funk is he cant hans said in spite dr himself y not because of munich munich hans sighed and left the question unanswered how could they understand every man in the van but him and weiss had been toddlers at the time of the olympic massacre turning onto the friedrichstrasse he swung the van into a space in front of the colossal police station and switched off the engine he sensed them allweiss especiallywatching him for a clue as to what to do next without a word he handed weiss the keys climbed out of the van and started for his volkswagen where are you going weiss called exactly where hauer told me to go my friend home but shouldnt we report this do what you must hans called still walking he could feel the papers in his boot already damp with nervous sweat the sooner he was inside his own apartment the better he would feel again he prayed silently that ilse would be home when he got there after three unsuccessful attempts he coaxed his old vw to life and with the careful movements of a policeman who has seen too many traffic fatalities he eased the car into the morning rush of west berlin the car that fell in behind hima rental fordwas just like a thousand others in the city the man at the wheel was not jonas stern rubbed his tired eyes and pushed his leather bag a little farther toward the passenger door it simply would not do for a traffic policeman to see what lay on the seat beneath the bag not a gun but a nightvision scopea thirdgeneration pilkington far superior to the one the american sergeant had been toying with definitely not standard tourist equipment but worth its weight in gold stern decided following hanss battered vw around a turn in gold chapter two am soviet sector east berlin ddr the kgbs ryad computer logged the spandau call at hours central european time such exactitude seemed to matter a great deal to the new breed of agent that passed through east berlin on their training runs these days they had cut their toohandsome teeth on microchips and for them a case that could not be reduced to microbits of data to feed their precious machines was no case at all but to ivan kosovthe colonel to whom such calls were still routedhightech accuracy without human judgment to exploit it meant nothing snorting once to clear his chronically obstructed sinuses he picked up the receiver of the black phone on his desk kosov he growled the words that followed were delivered with such hysterical force that kosov jerked the receiver away from his ear the man on the other end of the phone was the sergeant from the spandau guard detail his actual rank was captain in the kgb third chief directoratethe kgb division responsible for spying on the soviet army kosov glanced at his watch hed expected his man back by now whatever the flustered captain was screaming about must explain the delay sergei he said finally start again and tell it like a professional can you do that two minutes later kosovs hooded eyes opened a bit and his breathing grew labored he began firing questions at his subordinate trying to determine if the events at spandau had been accidental or if some human will had guided them what did the polizei on the scene say yes i do see lis ten to me sergei this is what you will do let this policeman do just what he wants insist on accompanying him to the station take your men with you he is with you now what is his name kosov scrawled hauer polizei captain on a notepad ask him which station he intends to go to abschnitt kosov wrote that down too recalling as he did that abschnitt was in the american sector of west berlin on the friedrichstrasse ill meet you there in an hour it might be sooner but these days you never know how moscow will react what be discreet but if force becomes necessary use it listen to me between the time the prisoners are formally charged and the time i arrive youll probably have a few minutes use that time question each of your men about anything out of the ordinary they might have noticed during the night dont worry this is what you were trained for kosov cursed himself for not putting a more experienced man on the spandau detail and sergei question your men separately yes now go ill be there as soon as i can kosov replaced the receiver and searched his pocket for a cigarette he felt a stab of incipient angina but what could he expect he had already outfoxed the kgb doctors far longer than hed ever hoped to and no man could live forever the cigarette calmed him and before he lifted the other phonethe red one that ran only easthe decided that he could afford sixty seconds to think this thing through properly trespassers at spandau after all these years moscows cryptic warnings had finally come true had centre expected this particular incident obviously they had expected something or they wouldnt have taken such pains to have their stukatch on hand when the british leveled the prison kosov knew there was at least one informer on his spandau team and probably others he didnt know about the east german security service stasi usually managed to bribe aleast one man on almost every kgb operation in berlin so much forfraternal socialism he thought reaching for a pencil he jotted a quick list of the calls he would have to make kgb chairman zemenek at moscow centre the soviet commandant for east berlin and of course the prefect of west berlin police kosov would enjoy the call to west berlin it wasnt often he could make demands of the arrogant west germans and expect to be accommodated but today would be one of those days the moscow call on the other hand he would not enjoy at all it might mean anything from a medal to expulsion from service without a word of explanation this was kosovs fear for the past ten years operationally speaking berlin had been a dead city the husk of its farmer romance clung to it but the old cold war urgency was gone preeminence had moved to another part of the globe and kosov had no japanese or arabic his future held only mountains of paperwork and turf battles with the gru and the stasi kosov didnt give a damn about rudolf hess chairman zemenek might be obsessed with nazi conspiracies but what was the point the soviet empire was leaking like a sieve and moscow was worried about some intrigue left over from the great patriotic war the chainnans obsession thats what the kgb chiefs in berlin had called rudolf hess ever since the nuremberg trials when he was sentenced to life imprisonment in spandau four weeks ago kosov had thought he had received his last call about spandaus famous prisoner number seven that was when the americans had found the old nazi dead a lamp cord wrapped around his neck suicide kosov remembered with a chuckle thats what the allied board of inquiry had ruled it kosov thought it a damned remarkable suicide for a ninetythreeyearold man hess had supposedly hanged himself from a rafter yet all his doctors agreed that the arthritic old nazi couldnt lift his arms any higher than his shoulders the german press had screamed murder of course kosov didnt give a damn if it was murder one less german in the world made for a better world in his view he was just grateful the old man hadnt died during a soviet guard month another sharp chest pain made kosov wince it was thinking about the damned germans that caused it he hated them the fact that both his father and his grandfather had been killed by germans probably had something to do with it but that wasnt all behind the germans arrogance kosov knew lurked a childish insecurity a desperate desire to be liked but kosov never gratified it because beneath that insecurity seethed something else something darker an ancient tribal desirea warlike need to dominate hed heard the rumors that gorbachev was softening on the reunification issue and it made him want to puke as far as kosov was concerned the day the spineless politicians in moscow decided to let the germans reunite was the day the red army should roll across both germanys like a tidal wave smashing everything in its path thinking about moscow brought kosov back to hess because on that subject moscow centre was like a shrewish old woman the rudolf hess case held a security classification unique in kosovs experience it dated all the way back to the nkvd and in a bureaucracy where access to information was the very lifeblood of survival no one he had ever met had ever seen the hess file no one but the chairman kosov had no idea why this was so what he did have was a very short lista list of names and potential events relating in responses to rudolf hess which mandated certa one of those events was illegal entry into spandau prison and the response immediate notification of the chairman kosov felt sure that the fact that spandau now lay in ruins did not affect his orders at all he glanced one last time at the scrawled letters on his pad hauer polizei captain then he stubbed out his cigarette and lifted the red phone am british sector west berlin the warm apartment air hit hans in a wave flushing his skin enfolding him like a cocoon ilse had already left he knew it instinctively there was no movement in the kitchen no sound of appliances no running shower nothing still jumpy and halfstarved he walked hopefully into the kitchen he found a note on the refrigerator door written in ilses hurried hand wurst in the oven i love you back by thank you liebchen he thought catching the pungent aroma of weisswurst using one of his gloves as a potholder he removed the hot dish from the oven and placed it on the counter to cool then he took a deep breath bent over rolled up his pants leg and dug the sheaf of onionskin out of his boot his pulse quickened as he unfolded the pages in the light he backed against the stove for heat plopped a chunk of white sausage into his mouth and picked up reading where the russian soldier had surprised him i only hope that long after these events cease to have immediate consequences in our insane world someone will find these words and learn the obscene truth not only of himmler heydrich and the rest but of englandf those who would have sold her honor and ultimately her existence for a chance to sit at hitlers blooddrenched table the facts are few but i have had more time to ponder them than most men would in ten lifetimes i know how this mission was accomplished but i do not know why that is for someone else to learn i can only point the way you must follow the eye the eye is the key to it all hans stopped chewing and held the paper closer to his face sketched below this exhortation was a single stylized eye gracefully curved with a lid but no lashes it stared out from the paper with a strange intensity it seemed neither masculine nor feminine it looked mystical somehow even a little creepy he read on whatfollows is my story as best i can remember it hans blinked his eyes at the beginning of the next paragraph the narrative suddenly switched to a language he could not understand he didnt even recognize it he stared in puzzlement at the painstakingly blocked characters portuguese he wondered italian maybe he couldnt tell a few words of german were sprinkled through the gibberishnames mostlybut not enough to get any meaning from frustrated he walked into the bedroom folded the pages and stuffed them underneath the mattress at the foot of his bed he switched on the television from habit then kicked his mudcaked boots into an empty corner and dropped his coat on top of them ilse would scold him for being lazy he knew but after two straight shifts he was simply too exhausted to care he ate his breakfast on the bed as much as the spandau papers the thought of his father weighed on his mind captain hauer had asked him why hed come to berlin hans often wondered that himself three years it had been now he hardly thought of munich anymore hed married ilse after just five months here in berlin christ what a wedding it had been his motherstill furious at him for becoming a policemanhad refused to attend and hauer had not been included in the plans but hed shown up anyway hans remembered hans had spied his rigid uniformed figure outside the church standing alone at the end of the block hans had pretended not to notice but ilse had waved quite deliberately to him as they climbed into the wedding car angry again hans wolfed down another sausage and tried to concentrate on the television a silverhaired windbag of a frankfurt banker was dispensing financial advice to viewers saddled with the burden of surplus cash hans snorted in disgust at fifteen hundred deutschemarks per month a berlin policeman made barely enough money to pay rent and buy groceries without ilses income they would be shivering in a coldwater flat in kreuzberg he wanted to switch channels but the old siemens blackandwhite had been built in the dark ages before remote control he stayed where he was he took another bite of sausage and stared blankly at the screen beneath his stockinged feet the wrinkled sheaf of papers waited a tantalizing mystery beckoning him to explore yet he had already hit a dead end the strange staring eye hovered in his mind taunting him after breakfast he decided he would take a shower and then have another go at the papers he never made it off the bed exhaustion and the warm air overcame him even before he finished the sausage he slid down the duvet the unfinished plate balanced precariously on his lap the spandau papers hidden just beneath his feet am french sector west berlin ilse hated these visits no matter how many times she saw her gynakologe she never got used to it ever the astringent smell of alcohol the gleaming stainless steel the cold table palpating fingers the overly solicitous voice of the physician who sometimes peered directly into her eyes from between her upraised legs all these combined to produce a primal anxiety that solidified like ice in the hollow of her chest ilse knew about the necessity of annual checkups but until she and hans had begun trying to have a child shed skipped more exams than she would care to admit all that had changed eighteen months ago she had been up in the stirrups so many times now that the stress of the ordeal had almost diminished to that of a visit to the dentistbut not quite unlike many german women ilse possessed an extreme sense of modesty about her body she suspected it was because she had never known her mother but whatever the reason being forced to expose herself to a stranger albeit a doctor for her required a considerable act of will only her strong desire to have children allowed her to endure the interminable series of examinations and therapies designed to enhance fertility all done frau apfel doctor grauber said he handed a slide to his waiting nurse ilse heard that hard snap as he stripped off his surgical gloves and raised the lid of the waste bin with his foot it crashed down sending gooseflesh racing across her neck and shoulders ill see you in my office after youve dressed ilse heard the door open and close the nurse started to help her out of the stirrups but she quickly raised herself and reached for her clothes dr graubers office was messy but wellappointed full of books and old medical instruments and framed degrees and the smell of cigars ilse noticed none of this she was here for one thingan answer was she pregnant or was she sick the two possibilities wrestled in her mind her instinct said pregnant she and hans had been trying for so long now and the other option was too unnatural to think about her body was strong and supple lean and hard like the flanks of a lioness hans said once as if he knew what a lioness felt like how could she be sick she felt so well but she knew exterior health was no guarantee of immunity ilse had seen two friends younger than she stricken with cancer one had died the other had lost a breast she wondered how hans would react to something like that disfigurement he would never admit to revulsion of course but it would matter hans loved her bodyworshipped it really ever since their first night together he had slowly encouraged her until she felt comfortable before him naked now she could turn gracefully about the room like a ballerina or sometimes just stand silently still as alabaster that was quick dr grauber boomed striding in and taking a seat behind his chaotic desk ilse pressed her back into the tufted leather sofa she wanted to be ready no matter what the diagnosis as she met the doctors eyes a nurse stepped into the office she handed him a slip of paper and went out grauber glanced at it sighed then looked up what he saw startled him the poise and concentration with which ilse watched him made him forget the slip of paper in his hand her blue eyes shone with frank and disarming curiosity her skin with luminous vitality she wore little or no makeupthe luxury of youth grauber thoughtand her hair had that transparent blondness that makes the hands tingle to touch it but it wasnt all that he decided ilse apfel was no film star he knew a dozen women as striking as she it was something other than fine features deeper than the glow of youth not elegance or earthiness or even a hint of that intangible scent grauber called availability no it was quite simply grace ilse possessed that rare beauty made rarer still by apparent unconsciousness of itself when grauber caught himself admiring her breastshigh and round more gallic than teutonic he thoughthe flushed and looked quickly back at the slip of paper in his hand well he coughed thats that ilse waited expectantly too anxious to ask for the verdict your urine indicates pregnancy grauber announced id like to draw some blood of courseconfirm the urine with a betasubunit test but id say thats just a formality would you like to bring hans in i know hell be excited ilse colored hans didnt come this time grauber raised his eyebrows in surprise thats a first hes got to be the most concerned husband ive ever met the smile faded are you all right ilse you look as though id just given you three months to live ilse felt wings beating within her chest after all her anxiety she found it hard to accept fulfillment of her deepest hope i really didnt expect this she murmured i was afraid to hope for it my mother died when i was born you know and its its just very important to me to have a child of my own well youve got one started said grauber now our job is to see that heor shearrives as ordered ive got a copy of the standard visiting schedule and theres the matter of ilse heard nothing else the doctors news had lifted her spirit to a plane where no mundane detail could intrude when the lab technician drew her blood she felt no needle prick and on her way out of the office the receptionist had to call her name three times to prevent her leaving without scheduling her next visit at the age of twentysix her happiness was complete am pretoria the republic of south africa five thousand miles to the south of germany two thousand of those below the equator an old man sentenced to spend half his waking hours in a wheelchair spoke acidly into the intercom recessed into his oaken office desk this is not the time to bother me with business pieter the mans name was alfred horn and though it was not his native language he spoke afrikaans im sorry sir the intercom replied but i believe you might prefer to take this call its from berlin berlin horn reached for the intercom button ah i believe youre right pieter the old man let his finger fall from the button then pressed it again is this call scrambled sir this end as always i cant say for certain about the other i doubt it and the room swept last night sir im picking up now the connection was excellent almost noiseless the first voice horn heard was that of his security chief pieter smuts are you still on the line caller ja hissed a male voice obviously under stress and i havent much time are you calling from a secure location nein can you move to such a location nein someone may have missed me already calm yourself smuts ordered you will identify yourself again in five seconds answer any questions put to you you may remain on the line guardian horn interrupted in perfect german go ahead caller smuts said this is berlinone said the quavering voice there are developments here of which i feel you should be apprised two men were arrested this morning at spandau prison west berliners on what charge horn asked his voice neutral trespassing for that you call this number there are special circumstances russian troops guarding the prison last night have insisted that these men be charged with espionage or else transferred to east berlin for such action surely you are joking does a man risk his career for a joke horn paused elaborate i dont know much but there is still russian activity at the prison theyre conducting searches or tests of some sort thats all i searches at spandau horn cut in has this to do with the death of hess i dont know i simply felt you should be made aware yes horn said at length of course tell me why werent our own men guarding spandau the captain of the unit was one of us it was he who prevented the russians from taking the prisoners into east berlin he doesnt think the trespassers know anything though hes not supposed to think at all hehes very independent said the timid voice a real pain in the neck his name is hauer horn heard smutss pen scratching was there anything else nothing specific but yes the russians theyre being much more forceful than usual they seem unworried by any diplomatic concerns as if whatever they seek is worth upsetting important people the americans for example there was a pause you were right to call horn said finally make sure things do not go too far keep us informed call this number again tonight there will be a delay as the call is rerouted north wait for our answer but i may not have access to a private phone that is a direct order jawohl caller disconnect smuts commanded the line went dead horn hit the intercom and summoned his security chief into the office smuts seated himself opposite horn on a spartan sofa that typified its owners martial disdain for excessive comfort with his wheelchair almost out of sight behind the desk alfred horn appeared in remarkably good health despite his advanced years his strong mobile face and stillbroad shoulders projected an energy and sense of purpose suited to a man thirty years his junior only the eyes jarred this impression they seemed strangely incongruous between the high cheekbones and classical forehead one hardly movedbeing made of glassyet the other eye seemed doubly and disturbingly alive as if projecting the entire concentration of the powerful brain behind it but it wasnt really the eyes smuts remembered it was the eyebrows horn had none the bullet wound that had taken the left eye had been treated late and badly despite several plastic surgeries the pronounced ridge that surmounted the surviving eye was entirely bare of hair giving an impression of weakness where in fact none existed the other eyebrow was shaved to prevent an asymmetrical appearance comments pieter horn said i dont like it sir but i dont see what we can do at this point but monitor the situation were already pushing our timetable to the limit smuts looked thoughtful perhaps number sevens killer left some evidence that was overlooked or perhaps number seven himself left some hidden writings which were never found horn suggested a deathbed confession perhaps we can take no chances where spandau is concerned do you have any speeific requests handle this as you see fit but handle it im much more concerned about the upcoming meeting horn tapped his forefinger nervously on the desktop do you feel confident about security pieter absolutely sir do you really feel you are in immediate danger spandau prison is one thing but horn house is five thousand miles from britain im certain horn averred something has changed our english contacts have cooled lines of communication are kept open but they are too forced inquiries have been made into our activities in the south african defense program ever since the murder of number seven you dont think it could have been suicide horn snorted in contempt the only mystery is who killed him and why was it the british to silence him or did the jews finally kill him for revenge my money is on the british they wanted him silenced for good as they want me silenced horn scowled im tired of waiting thats all smuts smiled coldly only seventytwo hours to go sir horn ignored this reassurance i want you to call vorster at the mine have him bring his men up to the house tonight but the interim security team doesnt arrive until noon tomorrow smuts objected then the mine will just have to work naked for eighteen hours horn had wounded his security chiefs pride but smuts kept silent his precautions for the historic meeting three nights hence though unduly rushed were airtight he was certain of it situated on an isolated plateau in the northern transvaal horn house was a veritable fortress no one could get within a mile of it without a tank and smuts had something that could stop that too but alfred horn was not a man to be argued with if he wanted extra men they would be there smuts made a mental note to retain a contract security team to guard horns platinum mine during the night tell me pieter how is the airstrip extension proceeding as well as we could hope considering the time pressure were under six hundred feet to go ill see for myself tonight if we ever get out of this blasted city that helicopter of mine spends more time in the service hangar than it does on my rooftop yes sir i still dont like those aircraft pieter they look and fly like clumsy insects still i suppose we cant very well put a runway on the roof can we not yet at least we should look into something like the british harrier wonderfully simple idea vertical takeoff there must be a commercial variant in development somewhere surely youre joking sir horn looked reprovingly at his aide you would never have made an aviator pieter to fight in the skies you must believe all things are possible bendable to the human will suppose youre right but you are excellent at what you do my friend i am living proof of your skill and dedication i am the only one left who knows the secret the only one and that is due in no small part to you you exaggerate herr horn no though i havegreat wealth my power rests not in money but in fear and one instrument of the fear i generate is you your loyalty is beyond price and beyond doubt you know that horns single living eye pierced smutss soul we can know nothing for certain pieter least of all about ourselves but i have to trust someone dont i i shall never fail you smuts said softly almost reverendy your goal is greater than any temptation yes the old man answered yes it is horn backed the wheelchair away from the desk and turned to face the window the skyline of pretoria for the most part beneath him stretched away across the suburbs to the sootcovered townships to the great plateau of the northern transvaal where three days hence horn would host a meeting calculated to alter the balance of world power forever as smuts closed the door softly horns mind drifted back to the days of his youth the days of power gingerly he touched his glass eye der tag kommt he said aloud the day approaches chapter three pm british sector west berlin hans awoke in a sweat he still cowered inside a dark cave watching in terror as a russian soldier came for him with a kalashnikov rifle the illusion gripped his mind difficult to break he sat upright in bed and rubbed the sleep from his eyes still the wrecked compound hovered before him his soiled uniform still chafed still smelled of the dank prison yard he shook his head violently but the image would not disappear it was real on the screen of the small siemens television two meters in front of hans a tall reporter clad in the type of topcoat favored by west berlin pimps stood before a wide shot of the wasteland that yesterday had been spandau prison hans clambered over the footboard of the bed and turned up the volume on the set deutsche welled broadcasting live from the wilhelmstrasse as you can see the main structure of spandau prison was destroyed with little fanfare yesterday by the british military authorities it was here early this morning that soviet troops in conjunction with west berlin police arrested the two west german citizens whom the russians are now attempting to extradite into east berlin there is virtually no precedent for this attempt the russians are following no recognized legal procedure and the story that began here in the predawn hours is rapidly becoming an incident of international proportions to the best of deutsche welles knowledge the two berliners are being held inside polizei abschnitt where our own peter muller is following developments as they occur peter before switching to the second live feed the producer stayed with the spandau shot for a few silent seconds what hans saw brought a sour lump to his throat a hundred meters behind the reporter dozens of uniformed men slowly picked their way across the ruined grounds of spandau they moved over the icy rubble like ants in search of food some not far from the very mound where hans had made his discovery a few wore white lab coats but othershanss throat tightenedothers wore the distinctive redpatched brown uniforms of the soviet infantry hans scoured the screen for clues that might explain the soviet presence but the scene vaporized now a slightly betterdressed commentator stood before the great threearched doorway of the police station where hans reported to work every morning he shifted his weight excitedly from one foot to the other as he spoke thank you karl he said other than the earlier statement by the police press officer that a joint investigation with the ussr is under way no details are forthcoming we know that an undetermined number of soviet soldiers remain inside abschnitt but we do not know if they are guests here as is claimed or ifas has been rumoredthey control the station by force of arms while the spandau incident occurred in the british sector of the city the german prisoners were taken by a needlessly lengthy route to abschnitt here in the american sector just one block from checkpoint charlie informed sources have speculated that a quickwitted police officer may have realized that the soviets would be less likely to resort to violence in the americancontrolled part of the city we have received no statements from either the american or the british milimq commands however if soviet troops are in fact inside this police station without the official sanction of the us army the allied occupational boundaries we have all by familiarity come to ignore may suddenly assume a critical importance this small incident could well escalate into one of the most volatile crises of the postglasnost era we will update this story at this evening so please stay tuned to this channel this is peter muller deutsche welle live while the reporter solemnly wrapped his segment he failed to notice the huge station door open behind him haggard but erect captain dieter hauer strode out into the afternoon light he looked as though he hadnt slept in hours he surveyed the sidewalk like a drill sergeant inspecting a barracks yard then apparently satisfied he gave the reporter a black look turned back toward the station door and dissolved into a bmw commercial hans fell back against the footboard of the bed his mind reeling russian troops still in his home station who had leaked the spandau story to the press and who were the men in the white lab coats what were they searching for was it the papers hed found it almost had to be no one cared about a couple of homosexuals who happened to trespass public property in their search for a love nest the realization of what he had done by keeping the papers hit hans like a wave of fever but what else could he have done surely the police brass would not have wanted the russians to get hold of the papers he could have driven straight to polizei headquarters at platz der luftbriicke of course but he didnt know a soul there no when he turned in the papers he wanted to do it at his home station and he couldnt do that yet because the russians were still inside it he would simply have to wait but he didnt want to wait he felt like a boy who has stumbled over a locked chest in a basement he wanted to know what the devil hed found anxiouly he snapped his fingers ilse he thought suddenly she had a gift for languages just like her arrogant grandfather maybe she could decipher the rest of the spandau papers he lifted the phone and punched in the first four digits of her work number then he replaced the receiver the brokerage house where ilse worked did not allow personal calls during trading hours hans would break a rule quicker than most germans but he remembered that several employees had been fired for taking this rule lightly a reckless thought struck hans he wanted information and he knew where he could get some after sixty seconds of hard reflection he picked up the telephone directory and looked up the number of der spiegel several department numbers were listed for the magazine he wasnt sure which he needed so he dialed the main switchboard der spiegel answered a female voice i need to speak to heini weber hans said could you connect me with the proper department please one moment thirty seconds passed news said a gruff male voice heini weber please hes a friend of mine a bit of an exaggeration hans thought but what the hell webers gone the man growled he was just here but he left again field assignment hans sighed if he comes back wait i see him weber telephone hans heard a clatter of chairs then a younger male voice came on the line weber here whos this hans apfel who sergeant hans apfel we met at right right weber remembered that kidnapping thing gruesome listen im in a hurry can you make it fast i need to talk to you hans said deliberately its important hold onim coming already whats your story sergeant not over the phone hans said knowing he probably sounded ridiculous jesus weber muttered ive got to get over to hannover a mob of greens is disrupting an american missile transport on the e and i need to leave five minutes ago i could ride with you twoseater weber objected and ive got to take my photographer i guess your big scoop will have to wait until tomorrow no hans blurted surprised by his own vehemence it cant wait ill just have to call someone else a long silence all right weber said finally where do you live lijtzenstrasse number ill meet you out front i can give you five minutes good enough hans hung up and took a deep breath this move carried some risk in berlijf all police contact with the press must be officially cleared beforehand but he intended to get information from a reporter not to give it without pausing to shower or shave he stripped off his dirty uniform and threw on a pair of cotton pants and the old shirt he wore whenever he made repairs on the vw a light raincoat and navy scarf completed his wardrobe the spandau papers still lay beneath the rumpled mattress he retrieved them scanning them again on the off chance that hed missed something before at the bottom of the last page he found it several hastily written passages in german each apparently a separate entry the threats stoppedfor a time foolishly i let myself hope that the madness had ended but it started again last month can they read my thoughts no sooner do i toy with the idea of setting down my great burden than a soldier of phoenix appears before me who is with them who is not they show me pictures of an old woman but the eyes belong to a aurtger i am certain my wife is dead my daughter is alive she wears a middleagedface and bears an unknown name but her eyes are mine she is a hostage roaming free with an invisible sword hanging above her head but safe she has remained i am strong the russians have promised to find my angel to save her if i will but speak her name but i do not know it it would be useless if i did heydrich wiped all trace of me from the face of germany in god alone knows what that demon told my family my british warders are stern like guard dogs very stupid ones but there are other englanders who are not so stupid have you found me out swine and a jagged entry phoenix wields my precious daughter like a sword of fire if only they knew am i even a dim memory to my angel no better that she never knows i have lived a life of madness but in the face of death i found courage in my darkest hoursi remember these lines from ovid it is a smaller thing to suffer punishment than to have deserved it the punishment can be removed the fault will remain forever my long punishment shall soon cease after all the slaughtered millions the war finally ends for me may god accept me into his heaven for i know that heydrich and the others await me at the gates of hell surely ihave paid enough number a car horn blared outside strangely shaken hans folded the pages into a square and stuffed them back under the mattress then he tugged on a pair of old sneakers locked the front door and bounded into the stairwell he bumped into a tall janitor on the third floor landing but the old man didnt even look up from his work hans found heini weber beside a battered red fiat spyder bouncing up and down on his toes like a hyperactive child a shaggyhaired youth with a leica slung round his neck peered at hans from the fiats jump seat so whats the big story sergeant weber asked over here said hans motioning toward the foyer of his building he had seen nothing suspicious in the street yet he could not shake the feeling that he was being watchedif not by hostile at least by interested eyes itsjust the photographer he told himself weber followed him into the building and immediately resumed his nervous bouncing this time against the dirty foyer wall the meters running said the reporter before i tell you anything hans said carefully i want some information weber scowled do i look like a fucking librarian to you come on out with it hans nodded solemnly then played out his bait i may have a story for you heini but to be honest im curious about what it might be worth well well the reporter deadpanned the police have joined the club listen sergeant i dont buy stories i track them down for pay thats the news game you know if you want money try one of the american tv networks when hans didnt respond weber said okay ill bite whats your story the mayor consorting with the american commandants wife the wall coming down tomorrow ive heard them all sergeant everybodys got a story to sell and ninetynine percent of them are shit whats yours hans looked furtively toward the street what if he murmured what if i told you id got hold of something important from the war from the nazi period something weber echoed like hans sighed anxiously like papers say like a diary weber scrutinized him for some moments then his eyebrows arched cynically like the diary of a nazi war criminal maybe hanss eyes widened in disbeliel how did you know scheisse weber cursed he slapped the wall is that what you got me over here for christ where do they find you guys thats the oldest one in the book hans stared at the reporter as if he were mad what do you mean weber returned hanss gaze with something akin to pity then he put a hand on his shoulder whose diary is it sergeant mengeles borinanns neither hans snapped he felt strangely defensive you ing t about the spandau papers what the hell are try say im saying that you probably just bought the german equivalent of the brooklyn bridge hans blinked then looked away thinking fast he clearly wasnt going to get any information without revealing some first this diarys genuine he insisted and i can prove it sure you can said weber glancing at his watch when gerd heidemann discovered the hitler diaries back in he even had hugh trevorroper swearing they were authentic but they were crap sergeant complete fakes i dont know where you got your diary but i hope to god you didnt pay much for it the reporter was laughing hans forced himself to smile sheepishly but what he was thinking was that he hadnt paid n all papers he had found them o e pfennig for the spand and if heini weber knew where he had found them the reporter would be begging him for an exclusive story hans heard the regular swish of a broom from the firstfloor landing heini he said forcefully just tell me this have you heard of any missing nazi documents or anything like that floating around recently weber shook his head in amazement sergeant what youre talking aboutnazi diaries and thingspeople were selling them tenapenny after the war its a fixed game a scam his face softened just cut your losses and run hans dont embarrass yourself weber turned and grabbed the door handle but hans caught him by the sleeve but if it were authentic he said surprising himself what kind of money would we be talking about weber pulled his arm free but he paused for a last look at the gullible policeman the swish of the broom had stopped but neither man noticed for the real thing he chuckled no limit sergeant stern magazine paid heidemann million marks for first rights to the hitler diaries hanss jaw dropped the london sunday times went in for pounds and i think both time and newsweek came close to getting stung weber smiled with a touch of professional envy heidemann was pretty smart about it really he set the hook by leaking a story that the diaries contained hitlers version of rudolf hesss flight to britain of course every rag in the world was panting to print a special edition solving the last big mystery of the war they shelled out millions careers were ruined by that fiasco the reporter laughed harshly guten abend sergeant call me next time theres a kidnapping eh weber trotted to the waiting spyder leaving hans standing dumbfounded in the doorway he had called the reporter for information and he had gotten more than hed bargained for million marks jesus make way why dont you croaked a highpitched voice hans grunted as the tall janitor shouldered past him onto the sidewalk and hobbled down the street his broom was gone now a worn leather bag swung from his shoulder hans followed the man with his eyes for a while then shook his head paranoia he thought looking up at the drab facade of his apartment building he decided that a walk through the city beat waiting for ilse in the empty flat besides he always thought more clearly on the move he started walking just over a hundred meters long the liitzenstrasse was wedged into a rough trapezoid between two main thoroughfares and a convergence of elevated sbahn rail tracks forty seconds walking carried hans from the dirty brown stucco of his apartment building to the polished chrome of the kurfiirstendamm the showpiece boulevard of berlin he headed east toward the center of the city speaking to no one hardly looking up at the dazzling window displays magisterial banks openair cafes art galleries antique shops and nightclubs of the kudamm bright clusters of shoppers jostled by gawking and laughing together but they yielded a wide path to the lone walker whose aryan good looks were somehow made suspect by his unshaven face and ragged clothing the tall spare man gliding purposefully along behind hans could easily have been walking at his shoulder the man no longer looked like a janitor but even if he had it wouldnt have mattered hans was lost in heady dreams of wealth beyond measure he paused at a newsstand and bought a pack of american cigarettes he really needed a smoke as he sucked in the first potent drag he suddenly remembered something from the spandau papers the writer had said he was the last the last what the last prisoner and then it hit hans like a bucket of water in the face the spandau papers were signed prisoner number seven and prisoner number seven was rudolf hess himself he felt the hand holding the cigarette start to shake he tried to swallow but his throat refused to cooperate had he actually found the journal of a nazi war criminal with heini webers cynical comments echoing in his head he tried to recall what he could about hess all he really knew was that hess was hitlers righthand man and that hed flown secretly to britain sometime early in the war and had been captured for the past few weeks the berlin papers had been full of sensational stories about hesss death but hans had read none of them he did remember the occasional feature from earlier years though they invariably portrayed an infantile old man a oncepowerful soldier reduced to watching episodes of the american soap opera dynasty on television why was the pathetic old nazi so important hans wondered why should even a hint of information about his mission drive the price of forged diaries into the millions catching his reflection in a shop window hans realized that in his work clothes he looked like a bum even by the kudamrns indulgent standards he stubbed out his cigarette and turned down a side street at the first opportunity he soon found himself standing before a small art cinema he gazed up at the colorful posters hawking films imported from a dozen nations on a whim he stepped up to the ticket window and inquired about the matinee the ticket girl answered in a sleepy monotone american western film today john wayne der searchers in german nein english excellent one ticket please twelve dm demanded the robot voice twelve thats robbery you want the ticket reluctantly hans surrendered his money and entered the theater he didnt stop for refreshments at the posted prices he couldnt afford to no wonder ilse and i never go to movies he thought just before he entered the screening room he spied a pay phone near the restrooms he slowed his stride thinking of calling in to the station but then he walked on there isnt any rush is there he thought no one knows about the papers yet as he seated himself in the darkness near the screen he decided that he might well have found the most anonymous place in the city to decide what to do with the spandau papers six rows behind hans a tall thin shadow slipped noiselessly into a frayed theater seat the shadow reached into a worn leather bag on its lap and withdrew an orange while hans watched the tides roll the shadow peeled the orange and watched him thirty blocks away in the liitzenstrasse ilse apfel set her market basket down in the uncarpeted hallway and let herself into apartment the operation took three keysone for the knob and two for the heavy deadbolts hans insisted upon she went straight to the kitchen and put away her grocenes singing tunefully all the while the song was an old one walking on the moon by the police ilse always sang when she was happy and today she was ecstatic the news about the baby meant far more than fulfillment of her desire to have a family it meant that hans might finally agree to settle permanently in berlin for the past five months he had talked of little else but his desire to try out for germanys elite counterteffor force the grenzschutzgruppe gsg oddly enough the unit whose marksmen his estranged father coached hans claimed he was tired of routine police work that he wanted something more exciting and meaningful ilse didnt like this idea at all for on thing it would seriously disrupt her career policemen in berlin made little money most police wives worked as hairdressers secretaries or even housekeeperslowpaying jobs but jobs that could be done anywhere ilse was different her parents had died when she was very young and she had been raised by her grandfather an eminent history professor and author shed practically grown up in the free university and hadtaken degrees in both modern languages and finance shed t even spent a semester in the united states studying french and teaching german her job as interpreter for a prominent brokerage house gave hans and her a more comfortable life than most police families they were not rich but their life was good if hans qualified for gsg however they would have to move to one of the four towns that housed the active gsg units kassel munich hannover or kiel not exactly financial meccas ilse knew she could adapt to a new city if she had to but not to the heightened danger assignment to a gsg unit virtually guaranteed that hans would be put into lifethreatening situations gsg teams were germanys forward weapon in the battle against hijackers assassins and god only knew what other madmen ilse didnt want that kind of life for the father of her child and she didnt understand how hans could either she despised amateur psychology but she suspected that hanss reckless impulse was driven by one of two things a desire to prove something to his father or his failure to become a father himself no more conversations about stun grenades and storming airplanes she told herself because she was finally pregnant and because today was just that kind of day returning to work from the doctors office shed itund that her boss had realized a small fortune for his clients that morning by following a suggestion she had made before leaving of course by market close the cretin had convinced himself that the clever bit of arbitrage was entirely his own idea and who really cares she thought when i open my brokerage house hell be carrying coffee to my assistants ilse stepped into the bedroom to change out of her business clothes the first thing she saw was the halfeaten plate of weisswurst on the unmade bed melted ice and dirt from hanss uniform had left the sheets a muddy mess then she saw the uniform itself draped over the boots in the corner thats odd she thought hans was as human as the next man but he usually managed to keep his dirty clothes out of sight in fact it was odd not to find him sleeping off the fatigue of night duty ilse felt a strange sense of worry and then suddenly she knew at work there had been a buzz about a breaking news storysomething about russians arresting two west berliners at spandau prison later in her car shed halfheard a radio announcer say something about russians at one of the downtown police stations she prayed that hans hadnt got caught up in that mess a bureaucratic tangle like that could take all night she frowned telling hans about the baby while he was in a bad mood wasnt what she had had in mind at all she would have to think of a way to put him in a good mood first one method always worked and she smiled thinking of it for the first time in weeks the thought of sex made her feel genuinely excited it seemed so long since she and hans had made love with any other goal than pregnancy but now that she had conceived they could forget all about charts and graphs and temperatures and rediscover the intensity of those nights when they hardly slept at all she had already planned a celebratory dinnernot a healthconscious american style snack like those her yuppie colleagues from the yorckstrasse called dinner but a real berlin feast eisben sauerkraut and pease pudding shed made a special trip to the food floor of the kadewe and bought everything readymade it was said that anything edible in the world could be purchased at the kadewe and ilse believed it she smiled again she and hans would share a firstclass supper and for dessert he could have heras healthy a dish as any man could want then she would tell him about the baby ilse tied her hair back then she took the pork from the refrigerator and put it in the oven while it heated she went into the bedroom to strip the soiled sheets she laughed softly a randy german woman might happily make love on a forest floor but on dirty linens never she knelt beside the bed and gathered the bedclothes into a ball she was about to rise when she saw something white sticking out from under the mattress automatically she pulled it out and found herself holding a damp sheaf of papers what in the world she certainly didnt remember putting any papers under the mattress it must have been hans but what would he hide from her bewildered she let the bedclothes fall stood up and unfolded the onionskin pages heavy handprinted letters covered the paper she read the first paragraph cursorily her mind more on the circumstances of her discovery than on the actual content of the papers the second paragraph however got her attention it was written in latin of all things shivering in the chilly air she walked into the kitchen and stood by the warm stove she concentrated on the word endings trying to decipher the carefully blocked letters it was almost painful like trying to recall formulas from gymnasium physics her specialty was modern languages latin she could hardly remember ilse went to the kitchen table and spread out the thin pages anchoring each corner with a piece of flatware there were nine she took a pen and notepad from the telephone stand went back to the first paragraph of latin and began recording her efforts after ten minutes she had roughed out the first four sentences when she read straight through what she had written the pencil slipped from her shaking hand mein gott she breathed this cannot be hans exited the cinema into the gathering dusk he couldnt believe the afternoon had passed so quickly huddling against the cold he considered taking the ubahn home then decided against it it would mean changing trains at fehrbellinerplatz and he would still have some distance to walk better to walk the whole way and use the time to decide how to tell ilse about the spandau papers he started west with a loping stride moving away from the crowded kudamm he knew he was dutybound to hand the papers over to his superiors and he felt sure that the mixup with the russians had been straightened out by now yet as he walked he was aware that his mind was not completely clear about turning in the papers for some irritating reason when he thought of doing that his fathers face came into his mind but there was something else in his brain something he soon recognized as heini webers voice saying three point seven million deutschemarks hans had already done the calculations at his salary it would take years to earn that much money and that represented the offer of a single magazine for the hitler diaries that was a powerful temptation even for an honest man as hans reached the mouth of the side street a dark shape disengaged itself from the gloom beneath the cinema awning and fell into step behind him it neither hurried nor tarried but moved through the streets as effortlessly as a clouds shadow chapter four pm american sector west berlin colonel godfrey a god rose reached into the bottom drawer of his mammoth victorian desk withdrew a halfempty bottle of wild turkey bourbon and gazed fondly at the label for five exhausting hours the us armys west berlin chief of intelligence had sifted through the weekly reports of his snitchesthe highly paid but underzealous army of informers that the us government maintains on its shadow payroll to keep abreast of events in berlinand discovered nothing but the usual sordid list of venalities committed by the host of elected officials bureaucrats and military officers of the city he had come to regard as the sodom of western europe the colonel had a single vicewhiskeyand he looked forward to the anesthetic burn of the kentucky bourbon with sublime anticipation pouring the turkey into a lenox shot glass rose glanced up and saw his aide sergeant clary silhouetted against the leaded glass window of his office door with customary discretion the young nco paused before knocking giving his superior time to straighten his desk by the time clary tapped on the glass and stepped smartly into the office colonel rose appeared to be engrossed in an intelligence brief clary cleared his throat colonel rose looked up slowly yes sergeant sir ambassador briggs is flying in from bonn tomorrow morning state just informed us by courier rose frowned thats not on my calendar is it no sir well apparently the soviets have filed some sort of complaint against us sir through the embassy us the army sir its something to do with last nights detail at spandau prison thats all i could get out of smittyi mean the courier sir spandau what about it christ weve watched the damned coverage all day havent we ive already filed my report state didnt elaborate sir rose snorted they never do do they no sir care to see the message rose gazed out of his small window at the berlin dusk and wondered about the possible implications of the ambassadors visit the american diplomatic corps stayed in bonn most of the timewell out of roses area of operationsand he liked that just fine the message colonel sergeant clary repeated what no sergeant dismissed sir clary beat a hasty retreat from the office certain that his colonel would want to ponder this unpleasant development over a shot of the good stuff clary roses bark rattled the door is major richardson still down the hall the sergeant poked his head back into the office ill run check sir cant you just buzz him uh the major doesnt always answer his pages sir after five that is says he cant stand to hear the phone while hes working who the hell can dont people just keep on ringing the damned thing when he doesnt answer well sir i think hes rigged some type of switch to his phone or something he just shuts it off when he doesnt want to hear it rose stuck out his bottom lip i see checking now sir said clary on the fly since berlin has been an island city it is a political isiana quadrisected by foreign conquerors and a psychological island as insulated from the normal flow of german life as a child kidnapped from its mother berlin was an island before the wall during the wall and it will remain so long after the wall has fallen kidnapped children can take years to recover the american community in berlin is an island within that larger host it clusters around the us military mission in the affluent district of dahlem a giant concrete block bristling with satellite dishes radio antennae and microwave transmitters in this city of hastily built office towers bombscarred churches and drab concrete tenement blocks whose color accents are provided mostly by graffiti the american housing area manages to look neat midwestern suburban and safe known as little america it is home to the sixtysix hundred servicemen their wives and children who comprise the symbolic us presence in berlin these families bustle between the us mission the officers club the wellstocked px the private burger king and mcdonalds and their patio barbecues like suburbanites from omaha or atlanta only the razor wire that tops the fences surrounding the manicured lawns betrays the tension that underpins this bucolic scene few americans truly mix with the berliners they are more firmly tied to the united states than to the streets they walk and the faces they pass each day in berlin they are tied by the great airborne umbilical cord stretching from tempelhof airport to the mammoth military supply bases of america major harry richardsonthe man colonel rose had sent sergeant clary to findwas an exception to this pattern richardson needed no umbilical cord in berlin or anywhere else he spoke excellent german as well as russianand not with the stilted state department cadence of the middle and upper ranks of the army he did not live in dahlem or zehlendorf the ritzy addresses of choice but in thoroughly german wilmersdorf he came from el iiiuiieyed family had attended both harvard and oxford yet he had served in vietnam and remained in the army after the war his personal contacts ranged from tjs senators to supply sergeants at distant army outposts from english peers to scottish fishing guides from berlin senators to kabobcooks in the turkish quarter of kreuzberg and that in colonel roses eyes made harry richardson one hell of an intelligence officer harry saluted as he sauntered into roses office and collapsed into the colonels infamous hot seat the chair dropped most people a head lower than rose but harry stood six feet three inches without shoes his gray eyes met the stocky colonels with the selfassured steadiness of an equal richardson rose said across the desk colonel rose eyed harrys uniform doubtfully it was wrinkled and rather plain for a major harry had won the silver star in vietnam yet the only decoration he ever wore was his combat infantrymans badge rose didnt like the wrinkles but he liked the modesty he clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth bigwig briggs is flying in from bonn tomorrow he announced harry smiled wryly i thought he might you did whys that stands to reason doesnt it with the hamfisted way the soviets have handled the spandau mess so far i figured the negotiations would have to be bumped up a notch on both sides sir can the sir crap harry just what do you think did happen last night do you have anything that wasnt on tv nothing substantive master sergeant jackson pretty much confirmed the press accounts of the incident and the german police arent saying squat christ youd think if the russians wanted to file a complaint against the army theyd give it to us and not the goddamn state department harry rolled his eyes if its got anything to do with spandau the state department doesnt trust us and you know why bird rose muttered he sighed wearily in the first us commandant of spandau prison lieutenant colonel eugene bird had been relieved of his duties for secretly bringing a tape recorder and camera into spandau over a period of months and compiling a book on rudolf hess which was published in the colonels entrepreneurial spirit hadnt exactly improved the relationship between the army and the state department the point rose went on is that the ambassador will be here in the morning and hell want to grill me for breakfast i want you with me when i talk to him and i want to know everything hes going to say before he says it no problem colonel okay harry whats your read on this thing im not sure yet i was over at abschnitt for a few minutes this morning you what ive got a friend over there harry explained naturally rose opened his bottom drawer and set the bottle of wild turkey between them on the desk drink he asked already pouring two shots harry accepted the glass raised it briefly then drank it off neat and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand as i was saying colonel i dropped by there just to get a feel for what was going on the problem was i couldnt even get near my guys office i got through the reporters okay but inside the station it was walltowall cops there was a squad of russian soldiers guarding the cellblock and they werent ceremonial roosters one guy was wearing a sergeants uniform but he was no noncom wasnt even regular army kgb down to his bvds rose groaned is this the hess thing again harry shook his head i dont think so colonel theyve run hess into the ground already pardon the pun but its a dead issue so what is it i think this is a russian territorial thing spandau was a soviet foothold in west berlinsmall maybe but they dont like giving it up hmm what about the russian accusations that someone murdered hess harry sighed colonel i dont think the russians ever believed prisoner number seven was hess but if this is about hess i think we should stay out of it let the russians knock themselves out theyve been obsessed with the case for years but i dont think thats it i think its russian paranoia plain and simple jesus rose grumbled i thoughtthe goddamn cold war was over harry smiled wryly the reports of its death have been greatly exaggerated which reminds me colonel i caught a glimpse of ivan kosov at that police station this morning kosov what the hell was that old bear doing in our sector harry shrugged wed better find out okay what do you need do you have a list of all personnel with access to the spandau site last night ours and theirs ill have clary get ray down here to crack the computer file dont bother ill get it rays the only one with the codes harry he buries that stuff deep harry smiled thinly just get me into his office rose cocked an eye at richardson then pushed on theres something else i know youre pretty chummy with some of the brits over here been fishing in scotland with a few ministers and such but on this thingthe spandau thingid like to keep the brits out of it just for the time being its a matter of understood colonel youre not sure theyve always played straight with us on the hess affair exactly rose said relieved even if youre right about this not having anything to do with hess id feel better keeping it inhouse for a while no problem rose smiled humorlessly right ill just shit harry muttered there is one problem ive got a racquetball date this evening with a girl from the british embassy cancel it harry looked thoughtful colonel i understand your thinking on this but dont you think breaking the date might call more attention think rose cut in with surprising ill tell you what force i think the goddamn brits killed hess and during our goddamn guard month how about that his face flushed you think im crazy major harry swallowed his surprise no sir i wouldnt say that scenario was outside the realm of possibility possibility ever since gorbachev came out with the goddamn glasnost the limeys have been quaking in their boots thinking the russians would go soft and let hess out to spill his guts to the world the russians were the only ones vetoing his release those last few years you know the brits knew if they ever had to step in and veto it all the old questions would start again rose nodded angrily i think those smug sonsofbitches slipped one of their exsas killers over the wall last month strangled that old nazi and left us holding the goddamn bag thats what i think about the british major and you will cancel your racquetball date as of now is that clear absolutely colonel i want your report on my desk by oheighthundred rose growled harry stood saluted and marched out clary roses gruff baritone boomed through the open i door yes sir let major richardson into captain donovans office hes got a little work to do on the computer yes sir and clary sir i want one of those phone gadgets like richardsons got grinning sergeant clary backed out and pulled the door shut rose looked longingly at the wild turkey bottle then slipped it back into his bottom drawer he closed his eyes leaned his chair all the way back and propped his legs up on f the huge desk that richardson is one strange bird he thought damn near insubordinate sometimes but he gets the job done rose congratulated himself on a f me piece of human resource management harry can handle the fairies from state he thought with satisfaction and ill take care of thefriggin russians and if the brits stick their stufft noses into it the devil take the hindmost pm mi headquarters charles street london england sir neville shaw looked up from the report with anger in his eyes as director general of mi he had witnessed his share of crises but the one he now faced was one he had long prayed would remain buried in the ashes of history this cockup started almost twelve hours ago he snapped yes sir neville admitted his deputy the unit on the scene reported it to general bishop in berlin bishop informed mi but saw no reason to apprise us the russian complaint went to the foreign office and the fo apparently felt as the general did weve got one contact on the west berlin police force hes the only reason we got onto this at all he cant tell us much though because hes stationed in our sector these german trespassers were taken to a police station in the american sector the things been on the telly over there since this afternoon good god sir neville groaned one more bloody week and this would have been nothing but a minor flap how do you mean sir shaw rubbed his forehead to ease a migraine forget it this was bound to happen sooner or later damned journalists and curiosity hounds poking at the story for years matter of time thats all yes sir the deputy director commiserated who did we have at spandau anyway regular military detail the sergeant in charge said he knew nothing about any papers he didnt have the foggiest idea of the implications what monumental stupidity shaw got to his feet still staring at the report in his hands can this russian forensic report be relied upon our technical section says the soviets are quite good at that sort of thing sir sir neville snorted indignantly papers at spandau good christ whatever has turned up over there ten to one its got something to do with hess weve got to get hold of it wilson fast who else was at spandau the americans the frogs and the russians plus a contingent of west berlin police sir neville wiped his mouth with the back of his hand i could hang for this one thats sure what do we have in berlin not much what we do have is mostly on the commercial side no one whos cleared for this i didnt think anyone was cleared for this rot shaw murmured all right you get me four men who are cleared for itmen who can quote me the bloody official secrets actand get them here fast arrange air transport to west berlin straightaway i want those lads airborne as soon as ive briefed them yes sir after an almost interminable silence shaw said there is a ship wilson i want you to locate her for me a ship sir yes a freighter actually mv casilda out of panama get on to lloyds or whoever keeps up with those things talk to the satellite people if you have to just find out where she is perplexed the deputy director said all right sir and turned to go at the door he paused sir neville he said hesitantly is there anything i should know about this hess business a small brief perhaps shaws face reddened if there was youd know it already wouldnt you he snapped wilson displayed his irritation by clipping out a regimental sir before shutting the door shaw didnt even notice he walked to his wellearned window above the city and pondered the disturbing news spandau he thought bitterly hess may stab us in the back yet in spite of the ticklishness of his own position sir neville shaw smiled coldly therell be some royal arses shaking in their beds tonight he thought with satisfaction right along with mine he reached for the telephone pm liitzenstrasse west berlin hans reached the apartment building too winded to use the stairs he wriggled into the elevator yanked the lever that set the clattering cage in motion then slumped against the wroughtiron grillwork despite his frayed nerves he was smiling heini weber could joke all he wanted but in the end the joke would be on him because hans knew something weber didnt where he had found the papers and that single fact would make him rich he was certain of it he jerked back the metal grille and trotted to the apartment door ilse he called letting himself in im home in the kitchen doorway he stopped cold wearing a white cotton robe ilse sat at the table holding the papers hans had found at spandau where did these come from she asked coolly hans searched for words this was not the way hed planned to explain the papers your night duty was at spandau prison wasnt it yes but liebchen give me a chance to explain it was a secret detail thats why i couldnt call you she studied him silently you havent told anyone about this have you hans remembered his conversation with heini weber but decided that would be best kept private for now no he lied i didnt have time to say anything to anyone hans youve got to turn these papers in i know she nodded slowly then why am i so worried about you he took a deep breath exhaled we have a chance here ilse if you looked at those papers you know that as well as i do finding those papers its like winning the lottery or something do you realize what they might be worth ilse closed her eyes hans what is going on you could lose your job for this im not going to lose my job so i found some old papers what was i supposed to do turn them in to the proper authorities the proper authorities hans snorted and who are the proper authorities the americans the british the french this is berlin ilse every person every company every nation here is looking after its own interestsnobody elses why shouldnt i look after ours for once ilse rubbed her throbbing temples with her fingertips liebchen hans insisted no one even knows these papers exist if youd just listen for five minutesif you heard how i found themyoud see that theyre a godsend she sighed hopelessly all right tell me four floors below the apartment in the cold wind of the liitzenstrasse jonas stern accepted a thick stack of files from a young man wearing a west berlin police uniform thank you baum he said this is everyone everyone from the spandau patrol yes sir i couldnt get the file on the prefect its classified stern sighed i think we know enough about dear herr funk dont we shivering from the wind the young policeman nodded and looked up at the suntanned old man with something near to awe in his eyes youve done well baum stern flipped through the computer printouts he stopped at apfel hans but saw little of interest hauer dieter however told a different story stern read softly to himself attached to federal border police promoted sergeant captain in sharpshooter qualification national match champion decorated for conspicuous bravery in and all kidnapping cases transferred with rank to the west berlin civil police january hmm stern mused id say thats a demotion he picked up further down sharpshooting coach and hostage recovery adviser to gsg since stern paused again memorizing silently credentials like those made dieter hauer a match for any man stern read on member of international fraternal order of police since ah he said suddenly member of der bruderschaft since now we learn something the israeli looked up surprised to see his young informant still standing there something else baum ohno sir stern smiled appreciatively youd better get back to your post try to monitor whats going on in abschnitt if you can yes sir shalom shalom stern cradled the files under his arm and stepped back into the apartment building he reclaimed his broom and dustpan then started noisily back up to the fourth floor this role of custodian isnt halfbad he thought he had certainly known much worse ilses eyes flickered like camera lenses they always did when she was deep in thought hans had ended his account of the night at spandau with captain hauers facing down the furious russian commander now he sat opposite ilse at the kitchen table staring down at the spandau papers your father she said softly why did he pick last night to try to talk to you i wonder hans looked impatient coincidence what does it matter what matters right now is the papers yes she agreed i read what i could he said breathlessly but most of its written in some strange language its like latin she finished its latin you can read it a little what does it say ilses lips tightened hans have you told anyone about these papers anyone at all i told you i didnt he insisted compounding the lie ilse twisted two strands of hair into a rope the papers are about rudolf hess she said finally i knew it what do they say hans latin isnt exactly my specialty okay its been years since i read any she looked down at her notes the papers mention hesss name frequently and some othersheydrich for instanceand something called the sd they were signed by prisoner number seven you saw that hans nodded eagerly the odd thing is that prisoner number seven was rudolf hess yet these papers seem to be talking about hess as if he were another person she pushed her notes away ive probably got it all wrong the writer describes a flight to britain but mentions a stop somewhere in denmark its crazy there seem to be two men in the plane not one and i do know one thing for certainrudolf hess flew to britain alone hans blinked wait a minute are you saying that the man who died in spandau prison might not have been rudolf hess no im saying that the papers say that i think but i dont believe it for a minute why not ilse got up went to a cupboard and removed a beer which she placed on the counter but did not open think about it hans for weeks the newspapers brave run wild with speculation about prisoner number seven was he murdered why did he really fly to britain was he really hess at all now you find some papers that seem to indicate that the prisoner wasnt hess just as some of the newspapers have been speculating she brushed a strand of hair out of her eyes its too convenient this has to be some kind of press stunt or somethingmy god he said coming to his feet dont you see it doesnt matter if the papers are real or not the fact that i found them in spandau is enough they could be worth millions of marks ilse sat down carefully and looked up at hans when she spoke her voice was grave hans listen to me i understand why you didnt turn in the papers immediately but now is the time for clear thinking if these papers are fakes theyre worthless and they can only get us into trouble and if they are genuine she trailed off glanced up at the clock on the kitchen wall hans i think we should call my grandfather she said suddenly i could only read part of this diary i guess youd call it but opa will be able to read it all hell know what we should do she pushed her chair away from the table wait hans cried what business is this of his ilse reached out and hooked her fingers in hanss trouser pocket hans i love you she said gently i love you but this thin is too deep for us i heard some of the news bulletins at work today the russians have gone crazy over this spandau incident imagine what they might think about these papers we need some good advice and opa can give it to us hans felt a hot prickle of resentment the last thing he wanted was ilses arrogant grandfather strutting around and telling him what to do were not calling the professor he said flatly ilse started to snap back but she checked herself all right she said if you wont call opa then call your father hans drew back as if struck physically i cant believe you said that for gods sake hans three years without more than a nod to the man cant you admit that hes in a position to help you to help us he obviously wants to three years he went twenty year without talking to me there was a long silence im sorry ilse said finally i shouldnt have said that but youre not acting like yourself and whats so wrong with that liebchen people get a chance like this once in their lives if theyre lucky i found these papers i didnt steal them the man they belonged to is dead theyre ours now imagine all the things youve ever wanted all the things i could never afford to buy you your friends from work are always flaunting their fine houses their clothes the best of everything you never complain but i know you miss those things you grew up with them and now you can have them again but i dont care about those things ilse countered you know that you know whats important to me thats what im talking about children arent cheap you know when you finally get pregnant well need all the money we can get he snatched up one of the spandau pages and its right here in our hands for the first time since finding the papers ilse remembered the baby she had been so happy this afternoon so ready to celebrate their blessing shed wanted everything to be perfect but now hans she said solemnly i wasnt being honest okay i probably would prefer driving to work in a mercedes rather than riding the ubabn suddenly ilse laughed flirting momentarily with the idea of easy money i wouldnt turn down a new wardrobe or a mansion in zehlendorf either but if these papers are real hans they are not our ticket to getting those things finding these papers isnt like finding a lottery ticket if they are genuine they are a legacy of the nazis of war criminals how many times have we talked about the hitler madness even almost fifty years after the war its like an invisible weight dragging us backward when i spent that semester in new york i made some friends but i also saw the looks some people gave mejews maybe i dont knowwondering about the blond german girl does she think shes better than we are racially superior hans our whole generation has paid the price for something we had nothing to do with do you want to profit from that hans looked down at the papers on the table suddenly they looked very different than they had before in a span of seconds their spell had been broken ilses laugh had done it he realized not her impassioned speech her musical selfmocking laugh he gathered up the loose sheets and stacked them at the center of the table ill turn them in tonight he promised ill take them downtown right after supper good enough ilse smiled good enough she stood slowly and pulled hans to her he could feel the swell of her breasts through the cotton robe she laughed softly you see doing the right thing sometimes has its rewards she stood on tiptoe and nuzzled into his neck at the same time pressing her bare thigh into his groin hans laughed into her hair he wanted her and his want was obvious but he sensed something more than desire behind her sudden affection what are you up to he asked pulling away a little ilses eyes glowed with happiness ive got a secret too she said she reached up and touched her forefinger to his lipsthen the telephone rang with a curious glance hans tugged playfully at her rote and walked into the living room hans apfel he said into the phone he looked back toward the kitchen standing in the doorway ilse opened her robe with a teasing smile he forced himself to look away yes sergeant apfel yes i was at spandau last night right ive seen the television what what kind of questions sensing ilse behind him he motioned for her to keep quiet i see formalities sure his face darkened you mean now whats the hurry is everyone to be there what do you mean you cant say who is this hanss jaw tightened yes sir yes i do realize that sir dont worry ill be there im leaving now slightly dazed he returned the phone to its cradle and turned around ilse had retied her robe what is it she asked her eyes troubled im not sure he looked at his watch that was the prefects aide on the phone a lieutenant luhr he said the russians are still in the station theyre making some kind of trouble and the prefect wants to satisfy them before the allied commandants get too involved he wants to ask everyone from the spandau detail some questions ilse felt a tremor in her chest what do you think he swallowed hard i think i dont feel so good about that call he slipped into the bedroorii to change into a fresh uniform are you going to take the papers with you not with the russians still there he called ill pull somebody aside when i get a chance and explain what happened maybe even the prefect hans dont be angry with me she said but i really think you should talk to your father first hed cover for you on this i know he would just let me handle it okay hans realized he had spoken much louder than hed meant to he buttoned up the jacket of a freshly pressed uniform and went back into the living room he was reaching for his gloves when the telephone rang again ilse practically pounced on it who is this please what just a moment she covered the mouthpiece with her palm its someone named heini weber he says hes a reporter for der spiegel hans moved toward the phone then stopped im not here he whispered ilse listened for a few moments then hung up her eyes showed puzzlement and fear he said to tell you he made a mistake before she said slowly he wants to meet you as soon as possible he he said moneys no object little crimson moons appeared high on ilses cheeks hans she said uncertainly he knows doesnt he she stepped forward hesitantly her face flushed with fear and anger she tried to summon harsh words but her anger faltered hans take the papers with you she said the sooner were rid of them the better he shook his head if i let the russians get those papers i really could lose my job you could slip them under somebodys door nobody would ever have to know they came from you he considered this thats not a bad idea he admitted but not while the russians are there besides our forensic lab might still be able to link me to the papers its scary what those guys can do ilse reached out hesitated the tendons in her neck stood out hans dont go she begged theres something we need to talk about he kissed the top of her head ilses hair smelled of flowers a scent he would remember for a long time i dont have any choice he said tenderly everything will be fine i promise were just jumpy because of the papers dont worry ill be back in an hour before ilse could say anything else he slipped through the door and was gone ilse sagged against the wood holding back tears hans im pregnant the words had been right on her tongue yet shed been unable to force them out the lie had done it first hanss crazy idea about selling the papersthen the lie she wanted badly to call her grandfather yet she hesitated he would probably take an i told you so attitude when ilse admitted that hanss behavior had shaken even her he had been against her marrying hans to begin with ilses doubts made her think back to when she had first met hans three years ago at a traffic accident an old opel had broadsided a gleaming jaguar right before her eyes on the leibnizstrasse smashing the jaguars door and trapping its driver thered been a police patrol car behind the opel two officers had jumped out to help but as they tried to free the trapped driver the jaguar had burst into flame all they could do was hold back the crowd and wait for the fire police to arrive suddenly a young foot patrolman had hulled his way through the crowdright past ilseand dashed to the jaguar shouting at the driver to get down in the seat he drew his walther fired several shots through the stuck window and kicked out what was left of the glass he dragged the stunned driver to safety only moments before the gas tank exploded the handsome young officer with singed eyebrows had taken ilses slightly awestruck statement then accepted her invitation to go for coffee afterward their romance like the newspaper accounts of hanss heroism had been brief and fiery he was promoted to sergeant and they were married as his splash of celebrity faded from the picture magazines ilse had always believed she made a good choice no matter what her snobby friends or her grandfather said but this madness from spandau was no traffic accident hans couldnt summon a burst of physical courage to stop the danger she felt tightening around them now the papers lying on her kitchen table were like a magnet drawing death toward themshe knew it she did not believe in premonitions but as she thought of hans driving anxiously toward a situation he knew nothing about her heart began to race a wave of nausea rolled inside her the pregnancy afraid she might throw up she hurried into the kitchen and leaned over the sink she managed to choke down the nausea but not her terror with tears blurring her eyes ilse lifted the phone and dialed her grandfathers apartment chapter five pm polizei abschniff a stubborn group of reporters huddled on the sidewalk in the freezing wind hoping for a break in the spandau prison story or the weather as hans idled his volkswagen past the front steps of the police station he saw klieg lights and cameras leaning against a remotebroadcast truck evidence of how seriously the berlin media were taking the incident he felt a nervous thrill when he realized that even now the press was driving up the asking price of the spandau papers for him he accelerated past the journalists before they could get a decent look at him or the car and swung into the rear lot of the station the unexpected summons had taken him by surprise but upon reflection he wasnt really worried it made sense for the police brass to try to defuse the crisis before the allied commandants got too involvedif they werent already nobody liked the four powers poking about in german affairs even if berlin still technically belonged to them as he unlocked the rear door of the station he spied erhard weisss red coupe parked against the wall a good sign hans thought at least he hadnt been singled out for questioning he flicked his cigarette onto the snow and walked inside the back hallway was usually empty but tonight a pinchfaced young man he didnt know waited behind a rickety wooden table the unlikely sentry leapt to attention when he saw hans identify yourself he ordered what your identification im hans apfel i work here who are you the little policeman shot hans an exasperated look and reached for a piece of paper on his desk it was apparently a list of some sort he ran his finger down it like a pnm schoolmaster sergeant hans apfel thats right report immediately to room six for interrogation under normal circumstances hans would have challenged the mans authority on general principles alone officers from other districtsspecially snotty bureaucrats like this onewere treated coolly at abschnitt until they had proved their competence tonight however hans didnt feel quite confident enough to push he walked on toward the stairs without comment the oppressive block of interrogation rooms lay on the second floor out of the main traffic of the station at least they chose number six he thought slightly larger than the other questioning rooms six held a long table on a dais some straightbacked chairs and mercifully an electric heater emerging from the stairwell on the second floor hans saw another unfamiliar policeman standing guard between rooms six and seven a silent alarm sounded in his head but it was too late to turn back suddenly a door further down the hall burst open two uniformed men with heavy beards bustled erhard weiss out of the room and down the hall away from hans weisss feet seemed to be dragging behind him he turned and gave hans a dazed look then he was gone hans slowed down something odd was happening here interrogation the guard queried noticing him hans nodded warily wait in room seven hans looked for a name tag on the mans chest but saw none you from wansee he asked when the man didnt answer he tried again whats going on in there friend room seven the man repeated seven hans echoed softly all right then taking a deep breath he stepped through the door there was only one man inside the smoky roomkurt steger one of the four recruits from the spandau assignment kurt jumped to his feet like a nervous puppy when he saw hans thank god he cried whats going on hans hans shook his head ive no idea it looks like the whole place has been taken over by strangers what have you seen nichts almost nothing we started in here togetherall of us from spandau except you one by one they call us into room six nobody comes back hans frowned they were practically dragging weiss down the hall when i walked up it didnt look right at all he hated to ask the next question but he needed the information have you seen captain hauer kurt no i think the prefects handling this hans considered this in silence i havent been on the force very long said kurt but i get the feeling captain hauer and the prefect arent too fond of each other hans nodded thoughtfully to say the least theyve been at each others throats since funk took over eight years ago whats the problem the problem is that funk is an asskissing bureaucrat with no real police experience and hauer reminds him of it every chance he gets cant the prefect fire whoever he wants firing hauer isnt worth the controversy it would start hans felt himself coloring as he went to the defense of the father he had accused of terrible things in the silence of his own mind hes a decorated hero one of the best cops in the city he also works with gsg the counterterror unit connections like that dont hurt plus hes only got one month before retirement funks been waiting for that day a long time now hes almost rid of him what a bastard kurt snapped his fingers anxiously you got any cigarettes we smoked all we had hans handed over his pack and matches have they said whos handling the questions kurts hands shook slightly as he lit up they havent said anything weve tried to listen through the wall but its useless they could beat a man to death in there and youd never hear him scream thanks a lot ill remember that while im in there what about the russians kurt cut his eyes toward the door weiss said he saw the very same bastard who tried to take the prisoners from us the door banged open silencing the young recruit a bearded man wearing captains bars stared back and forth between hans and kurt then pointed to hans you he growled but ive been here for two hours kurt protested the captain ignored him and motioned for hans to follow in the hall hans saw another young officer being led around the corner toward the elevators his arms pinned to his sides by two large policemen fighting a growing sense of unreality hans stepped into room six the scene unnerved him the sparsely furnished interrogation room had been transformed into a courtroom a single wooden chair faced a long raised table from which five men stared solemnly as hans entered at the center of the table sat wilhelm funk prefect of west berlin police he eyed hans with the cold detachment of a hanging judge a young blond man wearing lieutenants bars hovered at funks left shoulder hans guessed he was lieutenant luhr the aide who had summoned him by telephone to the prefects right sat three men wearing soviet army uniforms hans recognized one as the sergeant who had bullied weiss at spandau but the othersboth colonelshe had never seen before and to funks left a little apart from lieutenant luhr sat captain dieter hauer dark sacs hung under his gray eyes and he regarded hans with a buddhalike inscrutability setzen she sich funk ordered then looked down at a buff file open before him as hans turned to sit he saw more men behind him six berlin policemen stood in a line to the left of the door he knew them all slightly all were from other districts on the right side of the door stood the russian soldiers from the spandau detail their bloodshot eyes gave the lie to their freshly shaven faces and the mud of the prison yard still caked their boots hans looked slowlyfrom face to face when his eyes met those of the russian who had caught him in the rubble pile hans looked away first he did not see the russian nod almost imperceptibly to the sergeant at the table nor did he see the sergeant soffly touch the sleeve of one of the colonels as funk began his interrogation you are sergeant hans apfel the prefect asked still looking at the file before him born munich bundeswehr service to twoyear tour federal border police attached munich municipal force transfelled berlin promoted sergeant may of yes sir speak up sergeant hans cleared his throat i am better i want you to listen to me sergeant i have convened this informal hearing to save everyoneyourself includeda great deal of unnecessary trouble because of the publicity surrounding this mornings events the allied commandants have scheduled a formal investigation into this matter to commence at seven oclock tomorrow morning i want this matter cleared up long before then the problem is that our soviet friendsfunk nodded deferentially to his rightoberst zotin and oberst kosov claim to have uncovered something rather disturbing at spandau today their forensic people say they have evidence that something was removed from the area of the cellblocks last occupied by the nuremberg war criminals hanss stomach rolled for a moment the room seemed to spin wildly it righted itself when he focused on the immobile mask of captain hauerof course i denied their request to question our officers directly funk went on but for the sake of expediency ive agreed to act as the soviets proxy that way they can be quickly satisfied as to our lack of complicity in this matter thus the whole mess is over before it really begins you see sergeant its really better all around for the first time hans noticed another man in the room he had been hunched out of sight behind hauer but when funk spoke again he moved by the way sergeant funk said casually in the interest of veracity ive agreed to monitor all responses by polygraph hans felt a jolt of confusion polygraph test results were inadmissible as evidence in a germancourt the berlin polizei were not even permitted to use the polygraph as an investigative tool or almost never anyway buried in the budget of the experimental section of the forensics division was a small cadre of technicians devoted to the subtle art of lie detection they were used only in crisis situations where hives were at stake the only explanation hans could come up with for the use of a polygraph tonight was that the russians had requested it well be using our own man of course funk said perhaps you know heinz schmidt hans knew of schmidt and what he knew made his heart race the ferretlike little polygrapher took perverse pleasure in wringing secrets out of peoplecriminals or notno matter how trivial he even moonlighted to sate his fetish screening employees for industrial inns funks inquisitor padded around hauers corner of the table pushing his precious polygraph before him on a wheeled cart like the head of a heretic ilse had been right hans realized he should never have come here i said is that all right with you sergeant funk repeated testily hans could see that both hauer and lieutenant luhr had suddenly taken a keen interest in him it took all his concentration to keep his facial muscles still he cleared his throat again yes sir no problem good the procedure is simple schmidt asks you a few calibration questions then we get to it funk sounded bored hurry it up schmidt as the polygrapher attached the electrodes to his fingers hans felt his earlier bravado draining away then came the bloodpressure cuff fastened around his upper arm and pumped until he could feel his arterial blood throbbing against it like a toumiquel last came the chest bandsrubber straps stretched around his torso beneath his shirtto monitor his respiration three separate sensing systems cold and inhuman now silently awaited the slightest signals of deception hans wondered which vital sign would give him away a trace of sweat translated into electrical resistance his thudding heart or just his eyes i must be crazy he thought wildly why keep it up anyway theyllfind me out in the end for one mad moment he considered simply blurting out the truth he could exonerate himself bdfore schmidt even asked the first stupid control question he couldare you sergeant hans apfel schmidt asked in a high abrasive voice i am yes or no please sergeant is your name hans apfel yes do you reside in west berlin yes hans watched schmidt make some adjustments to his machine the ferrets shirt was soiled at the collar and armpits his fingernails were long and grimy and he smelled of ammonia suddenly schmidt pulled a red pen from his pocket and held it up for all to see is this pen red sergeant he asked schmidt mader seemed to makestill more adjustments to his machine nervously hans wondered how much schmidt knew he knew about the polygraph test because hans knew a good deal the concept of the lie detector had always fascinated him he had taken the experimental interrogation course at the police school at hiltrup and a close look at his personnel file would reveal that as schmidt tinkered with his machine hans marshaled what he remembered from the hiltrup course the first tenet of the polygrapher was that for test results to be accurate the subject needed to believe the machine infallible polygraphers used various methods to create this illusion but hans knew that schmidt favored the card trick schmidt would ask his subject to pick a playing card at random from a deck then to layit facedown on a table schmidts ability to name the hidden card after a few yes or no questions seemed to prove his polygraph infallible of course the subject always chose his card from a deck in which every card was identical but he had no way of knowing that many skilled criminals had confessed their crimes immediately after schmidts little parlor show certain that his machine would eventually find them out hans saw no deck of cards tonight maybe schmidt thinks his reputation is enough to intimidate me he thought nervously and maybe hes right already perspiring hans tried to think of a way to beat the little weasels machine some people had beaten the polygraph by learning to suppress their physiological stress reactions buthans knew he had no hope of this the suppression technique took months to master and right now he could barely hold himself in his chair he did have one hope if he could keep a cool head picking out the control questions most people thought questions like is this pen red were the controls but hans knew better the real control questions were ones which would cause almost anyone asked them to lie have you ever failed to report income on your federal tax return was a corrtmon control most people denied this almost universal crime and by doing so provided schmidt with their baseline lie later when asked did you cut your wifes throat with a kitchen knife a guilty persons lie would register far stronger than his baseline or control reference questions like is this pen red were asked simply to give a persons vital signs time to return to nominal between the relevant questions hans knew if he could produce a strong enough emotional response to a control question then an actual lie would appear no different to the polygraph than his faked control responses schmidt would be forced to declare him innocent the best method to do this was to hide a thumbtack in your shoe but hans knew that an exaggerated response could also be triggered by holding your breath or biting your tongue he decided to worzy about method later if he couldnt pick out the control questions method wouldnt matter schmidts voice jolted him back to reality sergeant apfel prior to discharging your spandau assignment did you conununicate with any person other thaln the duty sergeant regarding that assignment no hans replied that was true he hadnt had tim i e to discuss it with anyone is captain hauer a married man irrelevant question hans thought bitterly to anyone except me no he answered schmidt looked down at the notepad from which he chose his questions have you ever stopped a friend or public official for a traffic violation and let them go without issuing a citation control question hans thought almost any cop who denied this would be lying keeping a straight face he bit down on the tip of his tongue hard enough to draw blood he felt a brief flush of perspiration pass through his skin no he said when schmidt glanced up from the polygraph hans knew he had produced an exaggerated response am i holding up two fingers schmidt asked irrelevant thought hans yes he answered truthfully schmidt came a step closer sergeant apfel youve made several arrests for drug possession in the past year have you ever failed to turn the entire quantity of confiscated drugs over to the evidence officer control queshans started to bite his tongue again then he hesitated if this was a control question schmidt had upped the stakes of the game giving an exaggerated response here would not be without serious consequences police corruption involving drugs was an epidemic problem with accordingly severe punishment for those caught the men at the table gave no indication that they saw this question as anything but routine but hans thought he detected a feral gleam in schmidts eyes the dirty little man knew his business sergeant schmidt prodded hans fidgeted he did not want to appear guilty of a drug crime but the spandau questions still awaited if he intended to keep the papers secret he would have to give at least a partially exaggerated response to this question in silent desperation he held his breath counted to four then answered no and exhaled slowly is your wifes maiden name natterrnan sergeant irrelevant yes hans replied schmidt wiped his upper lip were you the last man to arrive at the scene of the argument over custody of the trespassers at spandau prisont relevant question hans glanced up at the panel all eyes were on him now stay calm i dont remember he said things were so confused then i really didnt notice yes or no sergeant i suppose i could have been exasperated schmidt looked to funk for guidance the prefect fixed hans with his imperious stare sergeant he said curtly one of your fellow officers told us you were the last man there would you care to answer the question again im sorry hans said sheepishly i just dont rememher he looked at the floor the russian soldier who had caught him in the rubble pile could call him a liar right now he knew but for some reason the man hadnt spoken up funk appeared satisfied with hanss answer and told schmidt to move along there cant be many more questions hans thought just a little longersergeant apfel schmidts voice cut like slivers of glass did you remove any documents from a hollow brick in the area of the cellblocks last occupied by the nuremberg war criminals holy mother of god hans choked down a scream every eye in the room burned upon his face for the first time hauers steely mask cracked his probing eyes fixed hans motionless in his chair stripping away the pathetic layers of deception but it was too late to come clean no hans said lamely specifically schmidt bored in did you discover remove see or even hear of documents pertaining to or written by prisoner number sevenrudolf hess hans felt cold sweat running down his spine his heart became an enemy within his chest thumping out the tattoo of his guilt and there stood schmidt liehungry watching each centimeter of paper unspool from his precious machine looking at him now hans fancied he saw a mad doctor reading an electrocardiograph a diabolical quack watching each fateful squiggle in the hope of witnessing a fatal heart attack hans felt his willpower ebbing away the truth welled up in his throat beyond his control just tell the truth urged a voice in his head tell it all and take whatever consequences come then this insanity willfocus elsewhere yet as hans started to do just that schmidt saidsergeant have you ever omitted an important piece of information from a job application hans felt like a spacewalker cut loose from his tether schmidt had asked another control question hadnt he but why hadnt he triumphantly proclaimed hanss guilt to the tribunal hans had expected the little demon to dance a jig and scream him him there is the liar nono i havent hans stammered thank you sergeant while hans sat stunned schmidt turned to funk and shook his head the prefect closed the file before him then turned to the soviet colonels and shrugged any questions he asked the russians looked like sleeping bears when one finally shook his head to indicate the negative the gesture seemed the result of a massive effort hans even sensed the soldiers in the back of the room relaxing only captain hauer and lieutenant luhr remained tense for some reason it struck hans just then that jiirgen luhr was the kind of german who made jews nervous he was a racial typethe proto germanic man tall and broadshouldered thinlipped and squareheadeda mythical aryan fiend passed down in whispered tales from mother to daughter and father to son thank you for your cooperation sergeant funk said wearily well contact you if we need any further details then over hanss shoulder bring in the last officer hans floundered they had drawn him into the trap yet failedto pounce for the kill am i free to go he asked uncertainly unless you wish to stay with us all night funk snapped excuse me prefect lieutenant luhr cut in all eyes turned to him id like to ask the sergeant a question funk nodded tell me sergeant did you notice officer weiss acting in a suspicious manner at any time during the spandau assignment hans shook his head remembering weiss being dragged down the hall no sir no i didnt luhr smiled with understanding but he had the watchful eyes of a police dog officer weiss is a jew isnt he sergeant one of the russian colonels staffed but his comrade laid a restraining hand on his shoulder i believe thats right hans said tentatively yes hes jewish luhr gave a curt nod of the head as if this new fact somehow explained everything you may go sergeant funk said hans stood they were telling him to go yet he sensed that some unspoken understanding had passed between the men in the room it was as if several decisions had been taken at once in some language unknown to him he turned toward the soldiers and police at the back of the room and shuffled toward the door no one moved to stop him why hadnt schmidt called him a liar why hadnt the russian whod caught him searching called him a liar and why did he feel compelled to keep lying anyway because of the russians he realized if the prefectr even hauerhad only questioned him alone he could have told them just as ilse wanted him to he would have told them a burly policeman held open the door hans walked through hearing funks tired voice resume behind him he quickened his pace he wanted to get out of the building as soon as possible he entered the stairwell at a near trot but slowed when he saw two beefy patrolmen ascending from the first floor nodding a perfunctory greeting he slipped between the two menthen they took him hans had no chance at all the men used no weapons because they needed none his arms were immobilized as if by steel bands then the men reversed direction and began dragging him down the stairs what is this hans shouted im a police officer let me go one of the men chuckled quietly they reached the bottom of the stairs and turned down a disused hallway a repository of ancient files and broken furniture when the initial shock and disorientation wore off hans realized that he had to fight back somehow but how in the darkest part of the corridor he suddenly let his body go limp appearing to lose his will to resist scheisse one man cursed dead weight he soon will be commented his partner dead weight with speed born of desperation hans fired his elbow into a rib cage he heard bone crack arrghh the man let go with his free hand hans pummeled the other attackers head aiming for his temple the policeman held him fast you bastard from the darkness hans kept pounding the mans skull the grip on his arm was looseningan explosion that seemed to detonate behind his right eye paralyzed him darkness less than sixty feet away from hans colonels ivan kosov and grigori zotin stood outside an idling east german transit bus in the central parking lot of the police station inside the bus the soviet soldiers from the spandau patrol waited for their longdelayed return to east berlin most were already fast asleep zotin a gru colonel didnot particularly like kosov and he was deeply offended at the kgb colonels effrontery in donning the uniform of the red army but what could he do one couldnt keep the kgb out of something this big especially when higher powers wanted kosov involved rubbing his hands together against the cold zotin tested the kgb mans perception can you believe it ivan they gave them all clean reports of course kosov growled what did you expect but one of them was certainly lying certainly but how did they fake the polygraph readouts kosov looked bored we were six meters from the machine they could have shown us anything grigori zotin knew exactly which policeman had lied but he wanted to keep the information from kosov long enough to initiate inquiries of his own he was aware of the kremlins interest in the hess case and he knew his career could take a giant leap forward if he cracked it he made a mental note to decorate the young gru officer who had caught the german policeman searching and showed enough sense to tell only his immediate superior youre right of course zotin agreed kosov grunted what exactly do you think was discovered a journal perhaps do you think they found some proof of they found a hollow brick kosov snapped our forensic technicians say their tests indicate the brick held some type of paper for an unknown period of time it could have been some kind of journal it could also have been pages from a pornographic magazine it could have been toilet paper never trust experts too much zotin the gru colonel sucked his teeth nervously dont you think we should have at least mentioned zinoviev during the interrogation we could have idiot kosov bellowed that name isnt to be mentioned outside kgb how do you even know it zotin stepped back defensively one hears things in moscow things that could get you a bullet in the neck kosov warned zotin tried to look unworried i suppose we should tell the general to turn up the pressure at the commandants meeting tomorrow dont be ridiculous scoffed kosov too little too late what about the trespassers then why are you letting the germans keep them because they dont know anything what do you suggest we do then zotin ventured warily kosov snorted are you serious it was the second to last manapfel he was lying through his bosche teeth those idiots did exactly what we wanted if theyd admitted apfel was lying hed be in a jail cell now beyond our reach as it is hes at our mercy the fool is bound to return home and when he doeskosov smiled coldlyill have a team waiting for him zotin was aghast but how he stifled his imprudent outburst with a cough how can you get a team over soon enough he covered i have two teams here now kosov snapped get me to a damned telephone startled the gru colonel clambered aboard the bus and found a seat and zotin kosov said leaning over his rival yes keep nothing from me again it could be very dangerous for you zotin blanched i want everything there is on this man apfel everything i suggest you ride your staff very hard on this powerful eyes are watching us how will you approach this policeman approach him kosov cracked a wolfish smile break him you mean by morning ill know how many times that poor bastard peeked up his mothers skirts hans awoke in a cell there was no window hed been thrown onto a stack of damp cardboard boxes one pale ray of light filtered down from somewhere high above when he had focused his eyes he sat up and gripped one of the steel bars his face felt sticky he put his fingers to his temple blood the familiar slickness brought back the earlier events in a throbbing rush of confusion the interrogation his fathers stony silence the struggle in the hallway where was he he tried to rise but he collapsed into a narrow space tween two boxes rotting cardboard covered almost the entire concrete floor a cell full of boxes puzzled hans reached into one and pulled out a damp folder he held it in the shaft of light traffic accident report he thought typed on the standard police fonn he found the date flipping through the yellow sheaf of papers he saw they were all the same all traffic accident reports from he checked the station listed on several forms abschnitt every case suddenly he realized where he was in the early s abschnitt had been partially renovated during a city wide wave of reform that lasted about eighteen months there had been enough money to refurbish the reception area and overhaul the main cellblock but the third floor the basement and the rear of the building went largely untouched hans was sure hed been locked in the basement but why no one had accused him of anything not openly at least who were the policemen who had attacked him funks men were they even police officers at all they had said he would soon be dead weight it was crazy maybe they were protecting him from the russians maybe this was the only way the prefect could keep him safe from them thats it he thought with relief it has to be a door slammed somewhere in the darkness above someone was comingseveral people by the soundand making no effort to hide it hans heard clattering and cursing on the stairs then he saw who was making the noise outlined in the fluorescent light streaming down from the basement door two husky uniformed men were wrestling a gurney off the stairs slowly they cleared a path to the cell through the heaps of junk covering the basement floor hans closed his eyes and lay motionless on the holes where hed been thrown looks like hes still out said one mdn i hope i killed the son of a bitch growled the other that wouldnt go over too well upstairs roil who gives a shit the bastard broke my ribs hans heard a low chuckle be more careful the next time come on weve got to clear a space in there for this thing fuck it just throw this filthy jew in on top of that one not much left of him anyway apfel isnt a jew jewlover then the doctor said leave this one on the gurney make him clear a space said rolf pointing in at hans sure if you can wake him up rolf picked up a rusted joint of pipe from the floor and rankled the bars with it wake up asshole hans ignored him get up or well kill you hans heard the metallic click of a pistol slide being jerked back christ slowly he rose to his feet see said rolf hes not dead clear out a space in there you and be quick about it hans tried to see who lay on the gurney but rolf smashed the pipe against the bars near his face it took him forty seconds to clear a space wide enough to accept the gurney get back against the wall rolf ordered go on hans watched the strange policemen roll the man on the gurney feetfirst into the cleared space then slam the door behind him you stay away from this jewboy sergeant olf warned anything happens to him its on your head the pair hurried up the stairs taking the shaft of light with them hans couldnt make out the face of his new cellmate he felt in his pocket for a match then remembered hed given them to kurt in the waitin room upstairs he put his hands on the unconscious mans shoulders and stared downward waiting for his eyes to adjust to the blackness but they didnt moving his hand tentatively he felt something familiar shoulder patches surprised and a little afraid hans felt his way across the mans chest like a blind man brass buttons patch collar pins hans felt his left hand brush an empty leather holster a police officer shutting his eyes tight he put his right hand on the mans face and waited when he opened his eyes again he could just make out the lines of the face my god he thought feeling a lump in his throat weiss erhard weiss for the second time tonight hans felt cut loose from reality gripping his friends body like a life raft he began trying to revive him he spoke into weisss ear but heard no answer he slapped the slack face hard several times no response groping around in desperation hans crashed into the back wall of the cell his palms touched something moist and cold foundation stones condensation rubbing his hands aross the stones until they were sufficiently wet he returned to weiss and laved the cool liquid over his forehead still weiss lay silent alarmed hans pressed both forefingers against weisss carotid arteries he felt pulse beats but very faint and unbelievably far apart weiss was alive but just the jailers had mentioned a doctor hans remembered what kind of doctor would send a man to a cell in this condition the obscenity of the situation drove him into a rage as he stood by the cadaverous body of his friend someone would answer for this outrage lurching to the front of the cell hans began screaming at the top of his lungs he screamed until he had no voice left but no one came slipping to the floor in exhaustion he realized that the stacks of boxes in the basement must be deadening the sound of his voice he doubted anyone upstairs had heard even a whimper suddenly hans bolted to his feet in terror someone had screamed it took him a moment to realize that the scream had come from inside the cell he shivered as it came again an animal shriek of agony and terror erhard weisswho had lain like a corpse through all hanssattempts to revive himnow fought the straps that held him as if the gurney were on fire as hans tried to restrain the convulsing body the screwning suddenly ceased it was as if a great stone had been set upon weisss chest the young policemans right arm shot up and gripped hanss shoulder like a claw quivered desperately then after a long moment relaxed hans checked for a pulse nothing he hadnt expected one erhard weiss was dead hans had seen this death beforea heart attack almost certainly he had seen several similar cases during the last few yearsyoung apparently healthy men whose hearts had suddenly stopped exploded or fibrillated wildly and fatally out of control in each case there had been a common factordrugs cocaine usually but other narcotics too this case appeared no different except that weiss never used drugs he was a fitness enthusiast a swimmer on several occasions he and his fiancee had dined with hans and ilse at a restaurant hans remembered and once in their apartment in their home and now weiss was dead dead the young man who had argued so tenaciously to keep two fellow berlinersstrangers at thatout of the clutches of the russians in one anguished second hanss exhaustion left him he sprang to the front of the cell and stuck his arm through the bars frantically searching the floor with his right hand therethe iron pipe rolf had brandished steadily hans began pounding the pipe against the steel bars the siimr ui the blows rattled his entire body but he ignored the pain he would hammer the bars until they came for weissuntil they came for his friend or he opped dead at that moment he did not care chapter six pm ldtzenstrasse british sector west berlin seated at the kitchen table in apartment professor emeritus of history georg natterrnan hunched over the spandau papers like a gnome over a treasure map his thick reading glasses shone like silver pools in the lamplight as he ran his hand through his thinning hair and silver beard what is it opa ilse asked is it dangerous patience child the professor mumbled without looking up knowing that further questions were useless until her grandfather was ready to speak she opened a cupboard and began preparing tea perhaps hans would get back in time to have some she hoped hed been gone too long already ilse had told her grandfather as little as possible on the telephone and by doing so she had failed to communicate the depth of her anxiety professor natterman lived only twelve blocks away but it had taken him over an hour to arrive he understood the gravity of the situation now he hadnt spoken a word since first seeing the spandau papers and brusquely questioning ilse as to how they came into her possession as she poured the tea he stood stiddenly pulled off his reading glasses and locked the nine pages into his ancient briefcase my dear he said this is simply unbelievable that this this document should have come into my hands after all these years its a miracle he wiped his spectacles with a handkerchief you were quite right to call me dangerous does not even begin to describe this find but what is it opa what is it really natterman shook his head in terms of world war two history its the rosetta stone ilses eyes widened what are you saying that the papers are real given what ive seen so far i would have to say yes ilse looked incredulous what did you mean the papers are like the rosetta stone i mean natterman sniffed that they are likely to change profoundly the way we view the world he squinted his eyes and a road map of lines crinkled his forehead how much do you know about rudolf hess ilse she shrugged ive read the recent newspaper stories i looked him up in your book but you hardly even mentioned his flight the professor glanced over to the countertop where a copy of his acclaimed germany from bismarck to the bunker lay open i didnt feel the facts were complete he explained so i omitted that part of the story altogether was i right about the papers do they claim that prisoner number seven was not really hess oh yes yes indeed very little doubt about that now it looks as though the newspapers have got it right for once the wrong man in prison for nearly fifty years very embarrassing for a lot of people ilse watched her grandfather for any hint of a smile but she saw none youre joking with me arent you how could that even be possible oh its quite possible the use of lookalikes was standard procedure during the war on both sides patton had one erwin rommel also field marshal montgomery used an actor who could even imitate his voice to perfection thats the easiest part of this story to accept ilse looked skeptical maybe during the war she conceded from a distance but what about the years in spandau what about hesss family natterman smiled impishly what about them prisoner number seven refused to see hesss wife and son for the first twentyeight years of his captivity he savored ilses perplexed expression the factual discrepancies o on and on hess was a fastidious vegetarian prisoner number seven devoured meat like a tiger number seven failed to recognize hesss secretaries at nuremberg he twice gave the british wrong birth dates for hess and he missed by two years and on and on ad nauseam ilse sat quietly trying to take it all in beneath her thoughts her anxiety for hans buzzed like a lowgrade fever why dont i let number seven speak for himself natterman suggested would you like to hear my translation ilse forced herself not to look at the kitchen clock hes i yes all right she told herself just wait a ittle longer please she said putting his reading glasses back on the professor opened his briefcase cleared his throat and began to read in the resonant tones of the born teacher i prisoner number seven write this testament in the language of the caesars for one reason i know with certainty that rudolf hess could not do so i learned latin and greek at university in munich from to but i learned that hess did not know latin at the most exclusive school in the worldreinhard heydrichs institute for practical deceptionin at this instituten isolated barracks compound outside dessaui also learned every other known fact about hess his childhood military service party record relationship with the fuhrer and most importantly his personal idiosyncrasies ironically one of the first facts i learned was that hess had attended university in munich at the same time i had though i do not remember meeting him i did not serve as a pilot in the first world war but i joined one of hermann gdrings flying clubs between the wars it was during an aerial demonstration in that the reichsmarschall first noticed my remarkable resemblance to deputyfuhrer hess at the time i did not make much of the encountercomrades had often remarked on this resemblancebut seven months later i was visited at the factory where i worked by two officers of heydrichs sd they requested me to accompany them on a mission of special importance to the reich from munich i was flown to the practical school building outside dessau i never saw my wife and daughter again during the first week at the school i was completely isolated from my fellow students i received my orientation from standartenfiihrer ritter graf headmaster of the institute he informed me that i had been selected to fulfill a mission of the highest importance to the fuhrer my period of trainingwhich would be lengthy and arduous he saidwas to be carried out in total secrecy i soon learned that this meant total separation from my family to alleviate the stress of this separation graf showed me proof that my salary from the factory had been doubled and that the money was being forwarded to my wife after one week i met the other students i cannot express the shock i felt in one room in one night i saw the faces of not only famous party gauleiters and wehrmacht generals but also the most celebrated personalities of the reich at last i knew what my mission was hermann gdring had not forgotten my resemblance to rudolf hess it was goring who had given my name to reinhard heydrich the sd commender responsible for the program there were many students at the institute some completed the program others did not the unlucky ones paid for their failure in blood we were constantly reminded of this incentive one of the most common causes for dismissal from the school was the use of ones real name two slipups were forgiven the third guaranteed erschlessen execution we were known by our role names or in situations where these were not practical by our farmer ranksin my case hauptmann i trained in an elite group there were eight of us hitler students studied him gdring himmler goebbels stretcher and myself hess the training for our group lasted one year during that year i had four personal interviews with deputyfuhrer hess the rest of my training was accomplished through study of newsreels and written records during our training several of the doubles for the party gauleiters left the school to begin their duties apparently their roles did not riquire so much preparation as ours at the end of the training period my group was broken up and sent to various locations to await duty i was sent first to grvnau where i was kept in isolation then later to a remote airfield at aalborg denmark i repeatedly requested to be allowed to see my wife and daughter but by this time germany was at war and my requests were summarily rejected i spent my time in solitude reviewing my hess mate rials and occasionally being visited by an sd officer i did have access to newspapers and from them i deduced that hesss position in the nazi hierarchy seemed to have declined somewhat in favor of the generals since the outbreak of war i took this to be the reason i had not yet been assigned a mission i must admit that in spite of the hardship of the duty i was very proud of the degree to which i could impersonate the deputy fuhrer during my final interview with h at the school he was so shocked by my proficiency that his reaction verged on disorientation actually a few of the other students had honed their skills to a finer edge than my own but what happened to them i have no idea natterman removed his spectacles put the papers back into his briefcase then closed and locked it a rather detailed story to be made up out of thin air wouldnt you say and thats only the first two pages ilse was smiling with satisfaction very detailed she agreed so detailed that it destroys your earlier argument if this double was so meticulously trained to imitate hess he certainly wouldnt make factual mistakes as obvious as missing hesss birthday or eating meat when hess was a vegetarian would he natterman met his granddaughters triumphant smile with one of his own actually ive been thinking about that since i first translated the papers youre quite right a trained double wouldnt make factual mistakes like thatnot unless he did so on purpose ilses eyes narrowed what do you mean just this since the double remained silent for all these years he could only have done so for one of two reasons either he was a fanatical nazi right up until the end which i dont accept orand this is supported by the papersthe fear of some terrible retribution kept him from speaking out if we accept that scenario number sevens mistakes appear to me to be a cry for helpa quiet but desperate attempt to provoke skeptics to investigate his case and thus uncover the truth and believe me that cry was heard hundreds of scholars and authors have investigated the case dozens of books have been written more every year natterman held up an admonishing finger the more relevant question is this why would the real hess make such mistakes because he was crazy ilse retorted everyones known that for years everyone has said that for years natterman corrected hitler and churchill started that rumor yet theres not one scrap of evidence suggesting that hess was unbalanced right up until the day he flew to britain he trained months for that mission can you seriously believe hitler didnt know that hess was eccentric yes but mad it was the men he left behind who were mad hess could have written those papers himself she argued if hess didnt know latin when he went into spandau he certainly could have learned it during his years of imprisonment true nattennan admitted but unlikely did you note the quote from ovid highflying language for a selftaught student but thats verifiable in any case ilse tasted her tea it had gone cold opa you cant really believe that the allies kept the wrong man in prison all these years why not ilse you should understand something these papers do not exist in a vacuum they merely confirm a body of evidence which has been accumulating for decades circumstantial evidence testimonial evidence medical evidence what medical evidence the professor smiled he loved nothing more than a willing student evidence unearthed by a british army surgeon who examined number seven while he was in spandau hes the man who really cracked this case open my god hell be ecstatic when he finds out about these papers what evidence did he discover a war wound or a lack of one i should say this surgeon was one of hesss doctors in spandau and in the course of his duties he came across hesss first world war record hess was wounded three times in that warthe worst wound being a rifle bullet through the lung yet when the surgeon examined number seven he found no scars on the chest or back where that wound should have been and after looking into the matter further examining the prisoners x rayshe found no radiographic evidence of such a wound there should have been scarring of the lung caused by the force of the bullet and other organic particles tearin through it but the surgeon found none he had quite a b of experience with gunshot wounds too hed done a tour of duty in northern ireland natterman chuckled at ilses bewildered expression youre surprised by my knowledge you shouldnt be any german or british historian could tell you as much he laughed i could give you twice as much speculation on who started the reichstag fire but the details she said suspiciously dates medical evidence its almost as if you were studying the case when i called you the professors face grew grave my dear you have obviously failed to grasp the monumental importance of this find these papers could shake the world the time period they describethe fortyfour days beginning with rudolf hesss flight to britain and ending with hitlers invasion of russiarepresents the turning point of the entire second world war of the entire twentieth century in the spring of adolf hitler held the future of the world in his hands of all europe only england still held out against him the americans were still a year from entering the war german uboats ruled the seas if hitler had pressed home the attack against england with all his forces the british wouldnt have stood a chance the americans would have been denied their staging post for a european invasion and hitler could have turned his full might against russia with his flanks protected natterman held up a long crooked finger but he didnt invade england and no one knows why the professor began pacing the kitchen punctuating his questions by stabbing the air with his right forefinger in hitler let the british army escape at dunkirk why all through the fall of and the spring of he delayed invading britain why operation sealionthe planned invasion of britainwas a joke hitlers best generals have admitted this churchill publicly taunted hitler yet still he delayed why and then the core of the whole mad puzzle on may tenth rudolf hess flew to britain on a secret mission scarcely a month laternatterman clapped his hands together with a crackhitler threw his armies into the icy depths of russia to be slaughtered ilse that single decision doomed nazi germany it gave churchill the time he needed to re arm england and to draw roosevelt into the war it was military suicide and hitler knew it for twenty years he had sworn he would never fight a twofront war he had publicly proclaimed such a war unwinnable so why did he do it ilse blinked do you know natterman nodded sagely i think i do there are dozens of complex theories but i think the answer is painfully simple hitler had no choice i dont believe he ever intended to invade england russia was his target all along his own writings confirm this hitler hated churchill but he had tremendous respect for the english as a peoplefellow nordics and all that i think hitler put off invading britain because he believedright up until it was too latethat england could be neutralized withoutfiring a shot i think certain elements of the british government were prepared to sign a peace treaty with hitler so that he would be free to destroy communist russia and i believe rudolf hess was hitlers secret envoy to those englishmen the moment hesss presence in england was made public joseph stalin accused the british of conspiring with hitler i think stalin was right the professors eyes blazed with fanatical conviction but neither stalin nor all his spies nor a thousand scholars nor i have ever been able to prove that for nearly fifty years the truth has lain buried in the secret vaults of the british government by law the relevant hess files are to remain sealed until the year some will never be opened what are the british hiding whom are they protecting a secret cabal of highly placed british nazis were there powerful englishmeneven members of the royal familywho were so afraid of communism that they were ready to climb into hitlers bed for protection no matter how many jews he slaughtered natterman punched a fist into his palmby god if these spandau papers end up proving that the walls of parliament will be hard put to withstand the firestorm that follows ilse stared at her grandfather with astonishment his passion had infected her but it could not blot out the worry she felt for hans yet somehow she couldnt bring herself to confess her fears to the old man at least debating the fine points of conspiracy theories helped to pass the time quickly but if the prisoner was a double shesaid how could he fool his allied captors even an actor couldnt hold out under interrogation natterman snorted scornfully the british claim they never professionally interrogated him and why should they they knew hess was a double from the beginning they held him incommunicado in england for the first four years of his captivity and theyve been playing this ridiculous game ever since to cover up the real hesss mission the american government supports britains policy right down the line and the french have never made a fuss about it they have their own skeletons to hide but the russians ilse reminded him you said stalin suspected a plot from the beginning perhaps the double didnt fool them natterman suggested then why wouldnt they expose him natterman frowned i dont know thats the conundrum isnt it its the key to this whole mystery there are reasons that the russians wouldnt have talked in the early years one is that certain alleged anglonazi intriguesbetween hess and the duke of windsor for exampletook place on spanish and portuguese soil if such meetings did actually occur moscow would have known all about themnatterman grinned with gleebecause the mi officer responsible for the spanish desk at that time was none other than kim philby what irony the russians couldnt reveal the windsorhess connection without exposing the philbykgb connection of course that only explains the russian silence up until the year philby fled england the real mystery is what kept the russians quiet during the remaining years ilse was shaking her head you make it sound so plausible but its like a huge house of cards its just too complex ill give you something simple then why did the british never use hess for propaganda during the war they locked him away from the world and refused even to allow him to be photographed think about that england and germany were locked in a death struggle even if hess had refused to cooperate the british could easily have released statements criticizing hitler that were supposedly made by hess think of the boost that would have given english morale and the negative effect on the german people yet the british never tried it the only possible reason i can see for that is that the british knew they didnt have the real hess they knew if they tried to use hess against the nazis joseph goebbels could jump up and say fools youve got a bloody corporal in your jail or something similar if thats true why wouldnt the nazis have said that from the beginning natterman smiled enigmatically hitlers reasons i cannot divine but as for the other top nazisgoring himmlerthey were only too glad to be rid of hess he was their chief rival for hitlers favors if the fuhrer for his own reasons was content to let the world believe that his lifelong friend and confidant had gone insane and was a prisoner of the british hesss chief rivals would have been only too glad to go along natterman rubbed his hands together yes it all ties up rather neatly so says the great professor ilse said dryly but youve missed one thing even if the allies had reasons to keep quiet why in gods name would the doubleyen if he had agreed to such a missionkeep silent for nearly fifty years what could anyone threaten him with solitary confinement in spandau prison must have been a living death natterman shook his head youre a clever girl ilse but in some ways frighteningly naive soldiers arent asked to agree to missions theyre ordered in hitlers reich refusal meant instant death you saw the word sippenhaft in the papers she nodded what does it mean clan punishment thats close enough sippenhaft was a barbaric custom that himmler borrowed from the ancient teutonic tribes it mandated that punishment be visited not only upon a traitor but upon his clan after graf von stauffenbergs abortive attempt on hitlers life not only the count but his entire family was executed six of the victims were over seventy years old that is sippenhaft ilse and a more effective tool for ensuring the silence of living men has yet to be devised but after five decades who would be left to carry out such a sentencet natterman rolled his eyes how about one of those bald neonazi psychopaths who roam our streets at night with brickbats no then how about these soldiers of phoenix that number seven mentions he certainly seems terrified of them and dont forget this at the end of the war close to forty divisions of warren ss remained under arms throughout the world thats more than a quarter of a million men i dont know how many deathshead ss survived but what if it were only a few hundred just one of those fanatics could wipe out a mans family even today i fought in the war and i could easily shoot someone down in the street tonight natterman glanced at his watch and that is my final word on the subject he announced i must go go ilse said uneasily where are you going natterman picked up his briefcase to do what must be done to show the arrogant selfrighteous british for what they were during the warno better than we germans his eyes sparkled with youthful excitement ilse this could be the academic coup of the century opa what are you saying those papers are affecting you just like they did hans natterman looked sharply at his granddaughter where is hans by the way at the police station i guess ilse tried to summon a brave face but her mask cracked hans had been gone far too long opa whatif they know what hans did what he found what would they do i dont know he answered frankly why dont you call the station if hanss superiors dont know about the papers it cant hurt and if they do well theyll be expecting your call anyway wont they ilse moved uncertainly toward the phone in the living room then snatched it up listen very closely natterman cautioned background voices everything yes yes hello may i speak to sergeant hans apfel please this is his wife oh do you know where he is now she covered the mouthpiece with her palm the desk sergeant says he knows hans but hasnt seen him tonight hes checking she pulled her hand away i beg your pardon is this the same man i spoke to earlier yes illbe home all evening natterman shook his head violently im sorry ilse said quickly i have to go she dropped the phone into its cradle what did he tell you natterman asked hans stopped in to answer a few questions but left soon after the sergeant said he wasnt there longer than twenty minutes opa natterman touched his granddaughters quivering cheek ilse is there some place in particular hans goes when he is under stress ilse held out for a moment more then the words poured out of her he talked about showing the papers to a journalist about trying to sell them my god said natterman his face white he wouldnt he said he wouldnt but ilse he cant do that its crazy and far too dangerous i know that but hes been gone so long maybe thats where he is meeting a reporter somewhere natterman shook his head god forgive me i hope thats it hell probably turn up any minute but im afraid i cant wait he held up his hand please ilse no more questions im going to the university to get some things then im leaving the city leaving the city why natterman donned his long overcoat then picked up his i briefcase and took his umbrella from the stand by the front door because anyone could find me in berlin and eventually they would people are searching for these papers nowi can feel it he laid a hand on ilses shoulder we have stumbled into a storm my child im trying to do what is best its nine oclock now you wait here until midnight if hans hasnt returned by then i want you to leave ill be at the old cabin on the canal but thats two hundred kilometers from heref i just hope its far enough im serious ilse if hans hasnt arrived by midnight leave the cabin telephones still connected i always pay the bill you have the number she nodded but what about hans she asked her voice tremble ngthe professor set down his briefcase and hugged his granddaughter hans is a grown man he said gently a policeman he knows how to take care of himself hell find us when hes ready now i must go you do exactly as i said he patted his briefcase this little discovery is going to make a lot of people very nervous too dazed to argue ilse kissed him on the cheek you be careful she said youre not a young bull anymore you know no said natterman softly his eyes glittering im a wise old serpent he grinned you havent forgotten your patronymic have you natter still means snake dont worry about me with that the professor kissed ilses forehead and slipped outside the door he looked disdainfully at the old elevator then he stepped into the stairwell and despite his excitement started down with an old mans careful tread he did not hear the stairwell door open again behind him or the whisper of jonas sterns stockinged feet descending the concrete steps stern knew the game now it was a simple one follow the papers strange how the peaceful present could be shattered by a few strokes from an old pen he reflected cryptic telegrams from an unquiet past for in the israelis pocket nestled another scrap of paperthe sleed of the premonition that had brought him to germany after so many years one hour before hed driven out of the negev desert headed for bengurion airport stern had dug it out of the little chest hed saved from jerusalemhis unfinishedbusiness chest an old cherry box containing the musty collection of loose ends that would not leave a man in peace on this scrap of paper was a brief note written in cyrillic script unsigned a russian jew had translated it for stern on the day it arrived in his office june people of zion beware the unholy fire of armageddon may soon be unleashed upon you i speak not from hatred or from love butfrom conscience fear of death stays my hand from revealing the secret of your peril but the key awaits you in spandau god is the final judge of all peoples sterns colleagues had not been impressed in israel such warnings were common as dust each was routinely investigated but rarely did any prophesy real danger but stern had had a feeling about that particular note it was vague yes was the author referring to spandau prison in west berlin or the district of spandau which covered over five square miles of the city stern never found out two days after the spandau note arrived the war erupted shells were falling on jerusalem and the note was brushed aside like junk mail israel was in peril but from egyptian tanks and planes not the unholy fire of armageddon whatever that meant later when the smoke had cleared and the dead were buried sterns superiors decided the note had merely been a warning of egypts imminent war plans after all the note was in russian and it was the russians who had been supplying egypt with weapons a communist with a religious conscience theyd said a common enough breed but stern had never accepted that why would the note have mentioned spandau of all things and so hed kept the note at the foot of the stairs he slipped his shoes back on and glided out into the frigid darkness forty meters up the liitzenstrasse stood professor natterman clinging to his briefcase like a diamond courier he flagged down a speeding yellow taxi and climbed inside stern smiled and climbed into his rental car four floors above the street ilse sat crosslegged on the floor behind her triplebolted door fixed her eyes on the wall clock and waited with both hands on the telephone pm polizei abschnih the clang of the pipe apparently carried much farther than a human voice hans had been smashing it against the bars for less than a minute when the basement door crashed open and a powerful flashlight beam sliced down through the darkness stop that goddamn banging shouted a guttural voice rolf again hans thought the profanity was a dead giveaway the same bearded man trailed behind him but this time the pair stayed well back from the cell and aimed the flashlight in well said rolf from behind the glare what the hell do you want the facilities not up to your high standards hans flexed his fists in rage if he could only lure one of them into the cell this mans dead he said pointing to the gurney neither guard responded come in here and check his pulse if you dont believe me if hes dead what can we do said rolf chuckling his logic get him out of here hans cried sorry said the other guard with a trace of sympathy we cant come in orders in desperation hans shoved the gurney to the front of the cell and thrust his friends lifeless arm through the bars feel it damn you take it easy said the second man ill do it he pinched weisss wrist expertly between his thumb and middle finger and counted to thirty the mans dead all right rolf checked weisss pulse himself so he is well you just stay right here with him sergeant well send somebody down for him eventually hans turned to the wall in despair obviously these two thugs werent going to be lured into the cell when he finally turned back around they had gone he picked his way to the rear of the cell and sat down on a box of files i can wait he told himself someones got to come in here eventually and when they do fifteen minutes later the basement door crashed open again this time hans heard no cursing r stumbling from the stairs the tread of boots was loud and regular whoever was coming knew his way around down here this way idiot muttered a disembodied voice nothing could have prepared hans for the next few seconds when the boots stopped in front of his cell the flashlight beam arced in and blinded him completely he squinted in pain then out of the blackness behind the dazzling light came a voice that froze his heart hans are you okay oh god slowly his contracting pupils filtered out the glare he saw the hand gripping the flashlight through the bars then just above it captain dieter hauers mustached face coalesced in the darkness the leering grin of rolf floated above and behind him hans felt a caustic wave of bile rising into his throat whatever was going on hauer was part of it his mind reeled fighting the realization that his own father had helped murder his friend he felt a knifelike pain in his chest as if his very heart had cracked come in here you bastard he thought savagely just come right in apparently hauer intended to do just that he turned to rolf give me the key he said but were not supposed to go in rolf objected lieutenant luhr said hauer snatched the key from rolfs hand and opened the cell door hans listen he said softly i need to ask aaaaaarrgh with every ounce of strength in his body hans drove himself off the back wall and into hauers midsection the flying tackle crushed hauer against the steel bars driving the breath from his lungs he collapsed in a heap on the floor sucking for air hans grabbed his neck and began throttling him in blind hatred here was the man to pay for weisss life and so much more it was a simple matter for rolf to pick up the lead pipe and knock hans unconscious having done so he viciously kicked the limp body off of hauer and revived the captain by taking hold of his belt and lifting him repeatedly off the floor slowly hauer sat up and looked at hans lying motionless on the cell floor thanks he coughed you owe me for that said rolf that prick meant to kill you i dont blame him hauer muttered what rolfs eyes narrowed what were you trying to say to him anyway hans moaned and rolled over his head banged against the bars shit rolf grumbled why dont we just kill this klugscheisser we need him help me get him up on one of these boxes focusing his eyes slowly hans sat up hed vomited a little on his shirt front fa he moaned father you cant be part of this what did he say rolf asked hes delirious weiss is dead hans screamed suddenly so are you rolf spat you pathetic fuck the next four seconds were a blur of motion hauers lips flattened to a thin line quicker than thought he whirled on rolf and shattered his jaw with a killing blow from his right fist almost simultaneously he snatched the pipe away with his left hand and brought it down on rolfs skull fracturing his cranium with a sickening crunch rolf died before he hit the floor hans had been stunned by the blow to his head but even more by this sudden reversal but there was no time to think hauer knelt over him dont ask me anything he snarled dont say anything i dont know how you got involved in this but youre in way over your empty head i dont know if weiss was in it but he paid the price tonight youre hiding somethingi saw that at funks little hearing and so did anyone else who was paying attention you cant lie for shit hans youre too honest for it waiti dont understand hans stammered why quiet were about to take the most dangerous walk of our lives if someone finds this shitbag before we get out of the station were dead can you move hans tried to rise but his legs buckled get up i cant its my head my balance christ with a sudden violence hauer shoved weisss corpse off the gurney and onto the floor captain listen hans hes gone were alive you just be ready when i get back with startling speed hauer battled the gurney through the dark basement then collapsed its legs and dragged it up the stairs in two minutes he was back in the cell leaning over hans im going to carry you up to that gurney and wheel you out the back door can you hang on hans nodded dully i want you to see something before we go hauer picked up the flashlight and held it to the right side of rolfs smashed skull he dug in the blond hair until he found what he wanted then lifted the head slightly and leaned back to make room for hans first this he said look hans looked at first he saw nothing only the bloody roots of rolfs flaxen hair then hauers thick fingers scratched against the dead mans scalp scraping some of the blood away hans saw it now behind the right ear it was a tattoo bloodred ink had en injected into rolfs scalp by a very talented needle the design itself was less than two centimeters long but very detailed it was an eye a single gracefully curved red eye with a lid but no lashes hans felt his stomach turn a slow somersault the eye was identical to the one sketched on the opening page of the spandau papers you mustfollow the eye the eye is the key to it all see it hauer grunted hans nodded dumbly rolfs head thudded against the cement floor hauer stepped across the cell and dragged weisss corpse over to where hans sat against the wall you wont forget this for a while he said he put his hands into weissshirt and ripped it open down the front then he pulled up the undershirt what are you doing hans asked offended by this further indignity visited upon the dead hauer picked up the flashlight and shone it onto weisss almost hairless chest hans leaned over straining his eyes then he froze weisss chest was awash in blood take a deep breath hauer advised he wiped away most of the blood with weisss undershirt now he said see it hans felt dizzy with horror gouged deep into erhard weisss flesh by some unspeakable instrument was a large sixpointed star the star of david the edges of the linear wounds looked so ragged that whoever had inflicted them must have done it with a screwdriver or a long nail hans felt vomit coming up like a geyser he gagged and turned away no hauer snapped grabbing his shoulder get up choking down bile hans tried to stand with a stifled groan hauer caught hold of him slung him over his shoulder like a sack and plodded out of the cell tlwice hauer stumbled as they crossed the cluttered basement floor but both times he regained his balance the stairs took longer each successive step required increasing amounts of time and energy from hauers sleepdeprived body stop hans begged fearing they would both fall put me down i can make it just as he felt hauers broad back sag under the strain he saw a crack of light in the darkness the basement door they had made it grunting hauer kicked open the door and heaved hans onto the gurney dont even breathe he said wheezing like a draft horse if anyone stops us i take him out you stay on this cart as far as anyone knows you killed rolf then i killed you period hauer shoved the gurney into motion and veered right rolling his human contraband toward the rear entrance hans had used when he arrived hans opened one eye to orient himself but hauer promptly struck him on the head rounding the last corner hauer saw the pinchfaced young policeman who had questioned hans earlier the guard rose from his desk before hauer reached him where are you taking this man he challenged no one leaves the building without written orders from the prefect this mans dead hauer said slowing to a stop he was alive when he walked in here the prefect doesnt write orders that tie him to embarrassing corpses now let me pass for a moment the officer looked uncertain then he cocked his chin up and resumed his arrogant tone theres no one back here but us it wont hurt to ring lieutenant luhr upstairs he lifted the phone from its cradle then leaned over hanss face and stared hans lay completely still but it would not have saved them hauer could see what was comw ing the policemans left hand as moving up to hanss wrist searching for a pulse hauer brought his right fist down like a hammer on the mans temple hanss eyes shot open when the body landed on him but he stayed on the gurney hauer quickly wrapped the telephone cord several times around the stunned guards wrists then spying a cloth napkin on the desk stuffed it into his mouth and let him fall to the floor hang on he bellowed he slammed the gurney through the heavy door that led to the rear parking lot the cold hit them like a wall of ice get up hauer said weve got to steal a car mines parked in front of the station mines back here hans groaned trying to rise youve still got your keys no one took them idiots give them to me hans fished the keys out of his pocket and handed them over hauer helped him off the gurney and into the car then climbed into the drivers seat and fired the engine incredibly the volkswagen kicked over without grumbling this is our lucky day hans croaked still a bit silly from the blow to his head hauer drove slowly out of the lot turning south on the friedrichstrasse to avoid the reporters then shot down the first side street he came to he had to make some decisions very fast but he could think of nowhere safe to make them just drive he thought headfor the seedy section of the city and let my mind clear instinct would guide him it always had maybe hans could give him a direction he reached over and jerked hanss chin up wake up its time to talk my god hans mumbled weiss what did they do to him hauer cruised past the anhalter banhof then wrenched the vw into another side street that was play time he growled compared to what theyll do if they find us youd better have some answers hans i just threw away my badge my reputation my pension and probably my life if you mention our stupid agreement now ill brain you myself now make yourself useful start watching for patrol cars praying that he would awaken from this nightmare hans slid up in his seat put a hand to his throbbing head and peered out into the icebound berlin darkness chapter seven pm british sector west berlin as captain hauer wheeled hanss volkswagen out of polizei abschnitt professor natterman stepped out of a taxi thirty blocks away paid his cabbie and hurried into the milling throngs of zoo station he tried to walk slowly but found it difficult missing his train would mean standing around the station for hours with nothing to do but worry about the nine sheets of onionskin taped into the small of his back sighting a ticket window with a short queue he got into line and set down his heavy suitcase ten minutes later professor natterman was safely berthed in a firstclass car poring over a short volume by dr j r rees the british army psychiatrist who had supervised the first extensive examinations of rudolf hess after his famous flight it made for tedious reading and natterman had trouble concentrating his mind kept returning to the spandau papers he had no doubt that prisoner number seven had told the truthif only because to date the man had provided the only possible version of events that fit all the known facts the rudolf hess case natterman believed shared one major similarity with the assassination of the american president john f kennedy there was simply too much information a surfeit of facts inconsistencies myth and conjecture everyone had his pet conspiracy theory if one accepted the medical evidence that number seven was not hess then two general theories held popular sway natterman dismissed them both out of hand but like most farfetched theories each was based upon a tantalizing grain of truth the primary theoryput forward by the british surgeon who first uncovered the medical evidenceheld that one of the top nazis either heinrich himmler or hermann goring had wanted to supplant hitler and had decided to use hesss wartime double to do it to accomplish this either goring or himmler or both would have to have ordered the real hess shot down over the north sea then sent his double rushing on to england there the double would supposedly have asked the british government if it might accept peace with germany if someone other than hitler reigned in berlin natterman considered this pure fantasy both nazi chieftains had possessed the power to give such orders of course and there was quite a body of evidence suggesting that both men had prior knowledge of hesss plan to fly to britain but the question natterman could not ignore was why himmler or goring should have elected to murder hess then use his double for such a sensitive mission in the first place it was a harebrained scheme that would have carried tremendous risk of discovery by hitler and thus was totally out of character for both the prudent ss chief and the flamboyant but wily luftwaffe commander only a week before hesss flight himmler had sent a secret envoy to switzerland to discuss the possibility of an anglogerman peace with himself as chancellor of the reich that might not be so exciting as murder in the skies but it was himmlers true style the other popular theory held that the real hess had reached england alive but that the british governmentfor reasons of its ownhad wanted him silenced they supposedly killed hess then searched among german prisoners of war for a likely double whom they brainwashed bribed or blackmailed into impersonating the deputy fuhrer natterman considered this tripe of the lowest order his researches indicated that a brainwashed man was little more than a zombiecertainly not capable of impersonating hess for more than a few hours much less for fortysix years and as far as british bribes or blackmail natterman didnt believe any german impersonator would sacrifice fifty years of his life for british money or even british threats yet this theory too was partially based on fact no informed historian doubted that the british government wanted the hess affair buried they had proved it time and again throughout the years and professor natterman did not discount the possibility that the british had murdered hesss double just four weeks ago it was also true that only a native german could have successfully impersonated hess for so long not just any german however it would have to have been a german trained specifically by nazis to impersonate hess and whose service was either voluntary or motivated by the threat of some terrible penalty a penalty like sippenhaft natterman felt a shiver of excitement the author of the spandau papers had satisfied all those requirements and more for the first time someone had offered a credibleprobably the onlyanswer to when and how the double had been substituted for the real hess if the papers were correct he never had been hess and his double had flown to britain in the same plane it had been the double in british hands from the very first moment natterman recalled that a prominent british journalist had written a novel suggesting that since the messerschmitt could carry two men hess might not have flown to britain alone but no one had ever suggested that hesss double could have been that passenger natterman drummed his fingers compulsively as his brain shifted up to a higher plane of analysis facts were the province of history professors motives were the province of historians the ultimate question was not how the double had arrived in england but why why was it necessary for both the double and the real hess to fly to britain as the spandau papers claimed they had whom did they fly there to meet why was it necessary for the double to remain in spandau had he been murdered for the same reason if so who murdered him circumstantial evidence pointed to the british yet if the british killed the double why had they done it now after all these years publicly they had joined france and the united states in calling for number sevens early release though they knew full well they could rely on the russians to veto it as they had done every year beforemy god natterman thought suddenly was that it had mikhail gorbachev in the spirit of glasnost proposed to release hess at last as natterman scrawled this question in the margin of dr reess book the huge bright yellow diesel engine disengaged its brakes with a hiss and lurched out of the great glass hall of zoo station accelerating steadily toward the benighted fields of the ddr in a few minutes the train would enter the narrow fragile corridor linking the is land of west berlin to the federal republic of germany natterman pulled the plastic shade down over his small window there were ghosts outsideghosts he had no wish to see memories he thought long laid to rest had been violently exhumed by the papers he now smuggled through communist germany god he wondered does it ever end the deceit the casualties he touched the thin bundle beneath his sweater the casualties more were coming he could feel it yet he couldnt give up the spandau papersnot yet those nine thin sheets of paper were his last chance at academic resurrection he had been one of the lions once an academic demigod a colleague once told natterman that he had heard willy brandt quote from nattermans opus on germany no less than three times during one speech in the bundestag three times but natterman had written that book over thirty years ago during the intervening years he had managed to stay in print with distinguished contributor articles but no publisher showed real interest in any further natterman books the great professor had said all fie had to say in from bismarck to the bunkeror so they thought but now he thought excitedly now the cretins will be hammering down my door when he offered his explosive translation of the secret diary of spandau prisoner number sevenboasting the solution to the greatest mystery of the second world warthey would beg for the privilege of publishing him startled by a sharp knock at the compartment door natterman stuffed dr reess book under his seat cushion and stood probablyjust customs he reassured himself this was the very reason he had chosen this escape route from the city trains traveling between west berlin and the federal republic did not stop inside east germany so passport control and the issue of visas took place during the journey still more important there were no baggage controls yes he called who is it someone fumbled at the latch then the door shot open a tall wiry man with a dark complexion and bright eyes stared at the professor in surprise a worn leather bag dangled from his left hand oh dear he said dreadfully sorry an upperclass british accent natterman looked the man up and down at least my own age he thought stronglooking fellow thin tanned beaked nose looks more jew ish than british come to think of it which is ridiculous because judaism isnt a nationality and britishness isnt a religionalthough the adherents of both sometimes treat them as suchi say there the intruder said quickly scanning the room sterns my name im terribly sorry cant seem to find my berth whats the number natterman asked warily sixteen just like it says on the door here stern held out a k e y natterman examined it right number he said wrong car though you want second class next car back stern took the key back quickly why youre right thanks old boy ill find it no trouble natterman scrutinized the visitor as he backed out of the cabin you know i thought id locked that door he said dont think it was really stern replied just gave it a shove and it opened right up your key fit it went in who knows they always use the oldest trains on the berlin run one key probably opens half the doors on the train stern laughed sorry again for an instant the tanned strangers face came alive with urgent purpose so that it matched his eyes which were bright and intense it was as if a party mask had accidentally slipped before midnight stern seemed on the verge of saying something then his lips broadened into a sheepish grin and he backed out of the compartment and shut the door puzzled and more than a little uncomfortable natterman sat down again an accident that fellow didnt seem like the type to mix up his sleeping arrangements not one bit and something about him looked familiar not his face but his carriage the loose ready stance hed been unseasonably tanned for berlin impossibly tanned in fact retrieving dr reess book from beneath the seat cushion the professor tapped it nervously against his leg a soldier he thought suddenly natterman would have bet a years salary that the man who had stumbled into his compartment was an exsoldier and an englishman he thought feeling his heart race or at least a man who had lived among the english long enough to imitate their accent to per c n na fe tio tterman didnt like the arithmetic of that accident at all if he was right not at all pm mi headquarters charles street london england deputy director wilson knocked softly at sir neville shaws door then opened it and padded onto the deep carpet of the director generals office shaw sat at his desk beneath the green glow of a bankers lamp he took no notice of the intrusion he continued to pore over a thick dogeared file on the desk before him sir neville wilson said shaw did not look up what is it your hard boys arrived no sir its something else a bit rum actually sir neville looked up at last well its israeli intelligence sir the head of the mossad as a matter of fact hes sent us a letter shaw blinked so well its rather extraordinary sir damn it wilson how so the letter is countersigned by the israeli prime minister it was handdelivered by courier what sir neville sat up what in gods name is it about his ruddy face slowly tightened in dread not hess wilson quickly shook his head no sir its about an old intelligence hand of theirs chap named stern seems hes been holed up in the negev for the past dozen years but a couple of days ago he quietly slipped his leash shaw looked exasperated i dont see what the devil thats got to do with us the israelistheir prime minister latherseem to think we might still hold a grudge against this fellow that there might be a standing order of some type on him a liquidation order thats preposterous shaw bellowed after all this time the deputy director smiled with forbearance its not so preposterous sir neville our own special forces clubwhich the queen still visits occasionally im proud to say still refuses to accept israeli members they welcome elite troops from almost every democratic nation in the world even the bloody germans everyone but the israelis and theyre probably the best of the lot and all because the older agents still hold a grudge for the murder of an sas man by zionists during the mandate just a minute shaw interrupted stern you said yes sir jonas stern i pulled his file jonas stern shaw murmured by god the israelis ought to be concerned one of our people has been after that old guerilla for better than thirty years wilson looked surprised one of our agents sir retired shaw explained a woman actually code name swallow a real harpy youd better pull her file in fact just in case shes still got her eye on this fellow shaw nodded thoughtfully i remember stern he was a terrorist during the mandate not even twenty at the time ill bet he swallowed his vinegar and fought for us during the war it was the only way he could get at hitler i suppose did a spot of sticky business for us in germany as i recall wilson looked at shaw in wonder thats exactly what it says in the file yes shaw remembered he worked for lakam during the sixties and seventies didnt he safeguarding israels nuclear development program shaw smiled at his deputys astonishment no strings or mirrors wilson stern was a talented agent but the reason i remember him so clearly is because of this swallow business i think she actually tried to assassinate him a couple of times thats why the mossad sent that letter do you really think this woman might pose a danger to him shaw shook his head i doubt sterns in england or even in europe for that matter hes probably sunning himself on mykonos or something similar which reminds medid you find that freighter for me oh yes sir lloyds puts her off durban she rounded the cape three days ago shaw rummaged through the stack of papers on his desk until he found a map of southern africa durban he murmured running his finger across the paper twenty knots twentyfive two days yes well shaw brushed the map aside and thumped the stack of papers before him this is the hess file wilson ino ones cleared to read it but medid you know that i tell you theres enough rotted meat between these covers to make you ashamed of being an englishman wilson waited for an explanation but shaw provided none about the israeli letter sir he prompted its basically apolite request to leave this stern alone how should i reply what oh the israeli prime minister is an old terrorist himself you know sir neville chuckled and still looking after his own after all these years his smile turned icy no reply let him sweat for a while eh yes sir and himy those hard boys along would you i thought i had it tough with the pm climbing my back an hour ago i got a call from the bloody queenmother herself she makes the iron lady sound like a french nanny as wilson slipped out sir neville butted and went back to the hess file on top lay a very old eightbyten glossy photograph scarred and faded it showed a man in his late forties with dark hair a strong jaw and a black oval patch tied rakishly across his left eye shaw jabbed his heavy forefinger down on the eye patch you started it all you sneaking bastard he muttered he slammed the file closed and leaned back in his chair sometimes i wonder if the damned knighthoods worth the strain he said protecting skeletons in the royal bloody chest pm lfitzenstrasse outside the apartment another car rattled down the street without slowing number twelve ilse was counting wait until midnight her grandfather had told her if hans isnt home by then get out sound advice perhaps but ilse couldnt imagine running for safety while hans remained in danger she fumed at her own obstinacy how could she have let a stupid argument keep her from telling hans about the baby she had to find him find him and bring him to his senses but where to start the police station the nightclub district hans might meet a reporter anywhere rising from her telephone vigil she went to the bedroom to put on some outdoor clothes outside a long low groan built slowly to a rattling roar as a train passed on the elevated sbahn tracks up the street during the day trains passed every ten minutes or so at night thank god the intervals were longer as ilse tied a scarf around her hair yet another automobile clattered down the liitzenstrasse coughing dnd wheezing in the cold unlike the others however this one sputtered to a stop near the front entrance of the building please she prayed rushing to the window please let it be hans it wasnt looking down she saw a shiny black bmw sedan not hanss volkswagen she let her forehead fall against the freezing pane the cold eased the throb of the headache that had begun an hour earlier she halfwatched as the four doors of the bmw opened simultaneously and four men in dark business suits emerged they grouped together near the front of the car one man pointed toward the apartment building and waved in a circle another detached himself from the group and disappeared around the corner curious ilse watched the first man turn his face toward the upper floors and begin counting windows his bobbing arm moved slowly closer to her window how odd she thought who would be out counting apartment windows at midnight in she jumped back from the window the men below were looking for her or for hansfor what hed found she groped for the light switch to turn it off then thought better of it instead she ran into the living room opened the door and peered cautiously down the hall empty she dashed down the corridor and around the corner to a window that overlooked the buildings rear entrance three men huddled there speaking animatedly ilse wondered if they might be plainclothes police suddenly two of them entered the building while the third took up station in the shadow of some garbage bins near the exit the metallic groan of the ancient elevator jolted ilse from the window too late to run they would reach her floor in seconds with her back to the corridor wall she inched toward the corner that led back to her apartment she felt a tingling numbness in her hands as she peeked around it a tall young man in a dark suit stood outside her door remembering the fire stairs she started in the other direction but the echo of ascending steps made her thought redundant hopelessly trapped she decided to try to bluff her way out feeling adrenaline suffuse her body she stepped around the corner as if she owned the building and marched toward the man outside her apartment she cocked her chin arrogantly upward intending to walk right past him and into the lift that would take her to the lobby after all she had appeared from another part of the floorshe might be anybody if she could only reach the lobby the man looked up he began to stare first at ilses legs then at her breasts then her face i cant do it she thought ill never make it past himin a millisecond she saw her chance stay calm she told herself steady fifteen feet away from her apartment she stopped and withdrew her apartment key from her purse she smiled coolly at the guard then turned her back to him and bent over the door handle of apartment be here eva she screamed silently for gods sake be here ilse scratched her key against the knob to imitate the sound of an unlocking door then she said one last prayer and turned the knob it opened like a reprieved prisoner she backed into her friends apartment smiling once at the guard before she shut and locked the door after shooting home the bolt she sagged against the door her entire body quivering in terror for an unsteady moment she thought she might actually collapse but she forced down her fear and padded up the narrow hall to her friends bedroom door a crack of light shone faintly beneath it ilse knocked but heard no answer eva she called softly eva its ilse too anxious to wait she opened the door and stepped into the room from behind the door a hand shot out and caught her hair then jerked her to the floor she started to struggle but froze when she felt a cold blade press into the soft flesh of her throat eva she rasped eva its meilse the hand jerked harder on her hair drawing her head back the blade did not relent then suddenly she was free ilse eva hissed what the hell are you doing here i might have killed you i would have i thought you were a rapist or worse the remark threw ilse off balance whats worse than a rapist a faggot dearie eva answered bursting into laughter she folded the straight razor back into its handle ilses panic finally overcame her tears streamed down her cheeks and she sobbed as her middleaged friend hugged her wet face to a considerable bosom and stroked her hair like a mother comforting her child ilse darling eva murmured whats happened youre beside yourself eva im sorry i came here but it was the only place i could go i dont know whats happening shh be quiet now catch your breath and tell eva all about it did hans do sometfiing naughty he didnt hit you no nothing like that this is madness crazy you wouldnt believe me if i told you eva chuckled ive seen things in this city that would drive a psychiatrist mad if you could find one who isnt already just tell me whats wrong child and if you cant tell me that tell me what you need i can at least help you out of trouble ilse wiped her face on her blouse and tried to calm down despite the presence of the men outside she felt better already eva beers had a way of making any problem seem insignificant a barmaid and tavern singer for most of her fiftyodd years she had worked the roughandtumble circuit in most of the capitals of western europe she had returned home to berlin three years ago to live out my days in luxury as she jokingly put it hans sometimes commented that eva was only semiretired for the frequent pilgrimage of welldressed and everchanging old gentlemen to her door seemed to indicate that something slightly more profitable than conversation went on inside number but that was evas business hans never asked any questions she was a cheerful and discreet neighbor who often did favors for the young couple and ilse had grown very close to her eva were in trouble ilse said hans and i what kind of trouble hans is polizei what cant he fix ilse fought the urge to blurt out everything she didnt want to involve eva any more than she already had i don t know eva i dont know hans found something something dangerous its drugs isnt it eva wrinkled her nose in disgust hashish or something right i told you i dont know but its bad theres a man in the hall right now and hes waiting for hans to get home there are three more men outside by the doors what outside here who do you mean child police ilse threw up her hands i dont know all i know is that hanss station said he left hours ago ive got to get out of here eva ive got to warn hans how can you warn him if you dont know where he is ilse wiped a wet streak of mascara from her cheek dont know she said trying to stop her tears but first ive got to get past those men outside as the old barmaid watched ilses mascara run a hot wave of anger flushed her cheeks you dry those tears she said there hasnt been a man born to woman that mama eva cant handle p m europe center breitscheid platz west berlin major harry richardson stared curiously at the receding back of eduard lenhardt his contact in abschnitt in seconds the policeman disappeared into the crush of bodies crowding the bar of the imitation irish pub in the basement of the europe center west berlins answer to the american megamall this twentytwostory tower housed dozens of glitzy shops bars restaurants banks travel agencies and even a hotelall of whose goods and services seemed to be priced for the japanese tourist harry had chosen it for its crowds he swallowed the last of an excellent bushmills and then began to gather his thoughts eduard lenhardt was only the third in a chain of personal contacts harry had spoken with tonight contrary to colonel roses orders harry had kept his racquetball date and by so doing he had learned that sir neville shaw director of britains mi hid ordered british embassy personnel to burn the midnight oil in west berlin shortly after that harry had called a state department contact in bonn an old college buddy who had let it slip that the russian complaint filed against the us army specified papers taken from spandau prison as the primary object of soviet concern the british and the french had received the same complaint harry could well imagine the british consternation at such an allegation after the phone call harry had finally gained an audience with his reluctant contac from abschnitt lieutenant eduard lenhardt lenhardt had revealed information to harry in three ways by what hed said by what he hadnt said and simply by how hed looked in harrys professional opinion the policeman had looked scared shitless what he had not said was anything about papers found in spandau prison what he had said was this that the prefect of police wilhelm funk had moved out of the police presidium and set up a command post in abschnitt after which the station had taken on the demeanor of an ss barracks after graf stauffenbergs briefcase exploded in hitlers bunker that two berlin policemen had been detained in a basement cell then had either escaped or been killed and that while the russians had pulled out of abschnitt at eight they had acted as if they might return at any time with t tanks all this in breathless gasps from a veteran policeman whom harry had never seen get excited about anything other than the piano quartets of brahmsharry dropped ten marks on the table and hurried out of the pub sixty seconds later he was on the kudamm where he flagged down a taxi and gave the driver an address near the tiergarten the man who occupied the house there was one of harrys private assets a rather highstrung german trade liaison named klaus seeckt during harrys first year in berlin he had spotted klaus at the philharinonie in the company of an arrogant and wellknown kgb agent named yuri borodin it hadnt taken harry long to establish that klaus was using his semiofficial cover to funnel restricted technology to moscow that had not interested harry much what had interested himafter a thorough investigation of seecktwas that while klaus dealt directly with the kgb he had no ties voluntary or otherwise to the east german secret police the stasi and that was a very rare combination in berlin rather than arrest klaus for the hightech ripoff harry had opted to use his leverage whenever he needed a direct line into kgb operations he never even filed a report on klaus colonel rose might have insisted that hariy push the german too hard which would only have spooked him into fleeing the city men like klaus had to be treated delicately harry cultivated the mans ego pretending to share with him the fraternal enjoyment of superior intellect and applied pressure only when necessarytonight was different eduard lenhardts apprehensions were worming their way into harrys gut and the checks he nonnally kept on his imagination began to erode as his mind raced through the possible implications of the events at abschnitt when the taxi reached the tiergarten house harry tipped its driver enough to satisfy but not enough to draw attention and as he reached klauss door he decided that his sensitive east german would have to pay the remainder of his debt tonight pm the bismarekstrasse captain hans warnedmotorcycle patrol three cars back i see him hauer swung the volkswagen smoothly around a corner just as the traffic signal changed stranding the police cycle in the line of vehicles stopped at the light weve got to get off the street where do we go my apartment your house think hans theyll be covering both places youre right maybe he grabbed hauers sleeve jesus ilses at the apartment alone easy hans well get her but we cant walk in there like lambs to the slaughter but funk could have men there already hold your water where are we bergstrasse there should be a hotel four blocks south of us the steglitz just what we need a hotel get in the backseat hauer ordered and stepped on the accelerator what are you going to do do it as hans climbed into the backseat hauer ripped the police insignia from his collar and spurred the vw into the steglitz garage the violent turn threw hans against the side door they squealed down the curving ramp to the parking sublevels below and into a tiny space between two large sedans all right hans hauer said out with it everything what really happened at spandau this morning hans climbed awkwardly through the narrow gap between the seats ill tell you on the way to my apartment hauer shook his head we dont move one meter until you talk hans bridled but he could see that hauer would not be swayed look i would have reported it if it hadnt been for those damned russians reported what the papers the papers i found at spandau christ you mean the russians were right hans nodded where did you find these papers what did they say hauer looked strangely hungry hans looked out the window i found them in a pile of rubble in a hollow brick just like schmidt asked me what does it matter i started reading them but one of the russians stumbled on me i hid them without even thinking he turned to hauer thats it thats all i did so why has everyone gone crazy what did the papers say hans i dont know gibberish mostly ilse said it was latin you showed them to your wife i didnt intend to but she found them she understood more of it than i did anyway she said the papers had something to do with the nazis that they were dangerous he looked down at his lap god was she right tell me everything you remember hans look i hardly remember any of it the german part sounded bitter like a revenge letter but there was fear in it too the writer said he had written because he could never speak about what he knew that others would pay the price for his words hauer hung on every syllable what else nothing nothing at all it was latin i told you i couldnt read it latin hauer mused leaning back into his seat who wrote the papers were they signed hans shrugged uncomfortably there wasnt any name just a number a number hauers eyes grew wide what number hans seven goddamnit the lucky number what a fucking joke now can we get out of here hauer shook his head slowly hess he murmured its impossible the restriction the endless searches it cant hans ground his teeth angrily captain i know what youre talking about but right now i dont care i just want to know my wife is safe hauer laid a hand on his shoulder where are these papers now at the apartment no you made copies no damn it i dont care about the papers anymore were going to get ilse now hauer pinned him against the seat with an arm of iron you saw weiss didnt you if you go charging into your apartment the same thing could happen to you and to ilse the memory of weisss mutilated corpse brought a strange stillness over hans what did happen to weiss hauer sighed someone got too impatient pushed the doctor too far probably luhr funks personal stormtrooper he shook his head later tonight theyll shoot his body full of cocaine and dump him in the havel my god hans breathed you saw it you were there he balled his hands into fists hans get hold of yourself i did not see weiss tortured you knew about his chest hauer grimaced i overheard someone talking about it its its sort of a specialty of theirs with certain jews why did that boy join the department at all youd think a jew would know better hanss mouth fell open youre saying it was weisss fault someone mutilated him im saying if youre a lamb you dont run with the wolf pack the memory of weiss brought back the mark on rolfs head the haunting eye from the spandau papers what about the tattoo hans asked quietly what does that mean hauer shook his head its complicated hans the eye is a mark some people usesome very dangerous people im not one of them i just wanted you to remember the design he leaned his head across the seat look behind my right ear in the hair if i had the tattoo it would be there hans studied hauers closecropped scalp but he saw no tattoo im not one of them said hauer straightening up but until five minutes ago they thought i was weve fot to find somewhere safe to hide hans somewhere with a phone before we can get your wife weve got to know what funk and luhr are up to ive got a man inside the station i can call so lets go upstairst there are probably a dozen phones up in the lobby i can call ilse warn her to get out hans reached forthe door handle but hauer stopped him again we cant hans were in uniform everyone will be staring at the two beatup cops using the pay phones funks men would find us in no time hans jerked his arm free where then a friends house no no friends no family its got to be untraceable an empty house or something slowly almost mechanically hans removed his wallet from his pants pocket and took out a tattered white business card he stared at it a moment then handed it to hauer whats this hauer read aloud benjamin ochs the best tailor in berlin you want to go to your tailor shop hes not my tailor hans said tersely elevenfifty goethestrasse no one can trace you to this place trust me hauer looked skeptical hans turned away the stress of being treated like an animal caged and hunted was congealing into something cold and hard in the pit of his stomach with a guttural groan he slammed his open hand against the dashboard get this fucking car moving hauer looked hard into hanss eyes gauging the mettle there right he said finally he fired the engine and roared out of the hotel garage with tires squealing making for the goethestrasse chapter eight ll pm liitzenstrasse west berlin the men waiting within and without ilses apartment building were not police they were kgb agents sent to the liitzenstrasse by colonel ivan kosov kosov himself waited impatiently in a second bmw parked at the end of the block kosov hated stakeouts long ago he had foolishly thought that once he attained sufficient rank he would be spared the monotony of these endless vigils and perhaps one day he would but tonight was one more in an endless series of proofs to the contrary exasperated he reached for the radio microphone mounted on the autos dash report one he said the lobbys clear crackled a metallic voice two nothing in the hall the doors locked no sound from inside four threes with me no sign of apfel or the wife stay awake kosov said gruffly out shit he thought how long will it take sitting in this ballfreezing cold chattering over the shortrange radios as if simply alternating frequencies could mask the russianaccented commands ricocheting through the berlin audio net like lines from a bad movie he wished there were another way but he knew there wasnt three floors above kosov the door to apartment opened and two garishly madeup redheads stepped into the hallway one locked the door while her young companion stared invitingly at the man standing at attention outside apartment the young woman nudged her middleaged com anion who chuckled and led the wa over to the silent manna mein siisser eva flirted in a husky voice all alone up here tonight taken aback by her directness the russian stared back in silence shes at least fifty he thought much too old for my taste but youre something else altogether he thought hungrily eyeing the younger womans cleavage with a flash of surprise he realized that she was the demure blonde he had seen enter apartment twenty minutes earlier he barely recognized her beneath the heavy makeup and wig she cant be more than twentyfive he guessed and breasts like a georgian goddess guten abend frdulein he said to the younger woman i think you looked much better before ilse felt her throat tighten i think hes set on you helga eva said laughing she patted the russian on his rear too bad dearieiittle helgas

pulling ilse down the hall if you dont know what you want we dont have time to wait kosovs young agent watched the middleaged redhead follow her shapely companion into the elevator cage eva yanked the lever that started the slow descent and then still holding eye contact with the guard pumped her fist lewdly up and down the iron rod when the russian colored in embarrassment she hiked her bright skirt over a wellpreserved thigh and burst into laughter as soon as the cage sank below the line of the floor eva cut her voice to a whisper here comes the hard part we were lucky that time the odds just wentdown ilse clutched her friends arm you shouldnt have come with me youd never have made it by yourself darling but youre in danger too eva plucked a gob of mascara out of her eye im glad to do

i do you and hans have always known and youve never treated me any different than family so shut up and take some help were not out of this yet the elevator screeched to an uncertain stop eva yanked open the screen and stormed through the lobby cursing the elevator and every other mechanical device ever invented with ilse struggling along behind on a pair of evas fourinch heels the old barmaid clacked past the two russians at the buildings entrance as if they did not exist halt yelled one of kosovs men as ilse hurried past ilses heart thudded in her chest the russian caught hold of her elbow hey frdulein he said leaning close to her why the hurry eva paused impatiently at the curb she looked up and down the street then walked back to the door next time sweetie she snapped stepping protectively in front of ilse weve got a party to go to it can wait said the young man leering at his companion stay here and keep us warm for a while its cold out colder by the minute arschloch eva spat if we dont get out of this wind in thirty seconds our tits will snap off the russian shed his smile like a snakeskin his eyes glazed with a reptilian sheen he took a step toward eva forget it misha urged his companion theyre just whores fucking filth the russian muttered misha said his partner anxiously remember colonel kosov misha took a long look at eva as if to mark her for future retribution then snorted and walked into the lobby when he next looked outside the two women were already across the street and halfway down the block moving toward colonel kosovs bmw kosov had just lifted the microphone from the dash when he spied two prostitutes walking quickly up the liitzenstrasse report one he said halfwatching them lobby still clear two no movement inside the apartment damn three and four r all clear here no sign of him the prostitutes reached the hood of the bmw passed it all positions said kosov i have two women passing me from your direction anyone see where they entered the street the radio squawked as three signals competed for reproduction four here sir they came from the apartment building looked like two whores to us kosov felt a tic in his cheek he turned away as the headlights of a passing car shone through the bmw when he looked again he saw one of the women raise an arm and flag the car to a stop thats odd he thought a taxi here at this hour and picking up a couple of streetwalkers two here crackled the radio those prostitutes came from number fortythree this floor opposite my position one of them even propositioned me kosov struck the dash with his fist one of them is the wife misha to the car two enter number forty and proceed kosov looked frantically for an alley in which to turn the bmw around with cars parked both sides of the street he had no room to make a u inside the taxi eva spoke rapidly perfect timing ernst darling now zoom around the corner and stop as fast as you can she looked back over her shoulder ilse when he stops you jump right out and get into the alley there if they keep after me youve made it if they dont who were those men eva police stinking russians sweetie didnt you catch the name misha the taxi jounced onto the curb eva how can i thank go eva cried squeezing ilses hand jump go the screech of tires drowned ilses reply as the taxi sped down the gervinusstrasse ilse ducked into the alley just as kosovs bmw careened around the corner and surged after eva and her cabbie friend she collapsedagainst the cold concrete wall of an office building her heart beating wildly ten seconds later a second bmw raced after the first turning her back to the icy wind ilse doffed the sluttish clothes eva had given her and tossed the wig into an overflowing garbage bin now she wore the conservative casuals shed had on when she first spotted the bmw habit made her hang on to one costume accessory eva had thrust into her handa large plastic purse as she debated whether to keep evas flashy coat ilse heard the rumble of a heavy automobile engine seconds later a pair of headlights nosed into the far end of the alley ilse snatched up the discarded clothes and climbed into the only hiding place she could seethe garbage bin the smell was terrible cloyingly sweet she held her nose with one hand and covered her eyes with the other the powerful purr of the bmw edged closer a tiger trying to spook its prey ilse knotted herself into a tight ball and prayed it took little imagination to guess how thless the men in the black autos must be the young man who had propositioned her at the front doorthe one called mishahis eyes had glazed almost to sightlessness when eva insulted him like fish eyes ilse thought she shuddered the bmw picked up speed as it approached the garbage bin weaving occasionally to probe every inch of the alley with its halogen eyes the walls of the trash bin vibrated from the noise ilse shivered from terror and bitter cold she had no doubt that if the car engine were shut off the russians would find her by the chattering of her teeth suddenly with a scream of protesting rubber the big black sedan roared out of the alley ilse scrambled up out of the garbage and dug into evas purse for her shoes her hand closed over something soft and familiar she peered into the bag folded into a thick wad at its bottom were three hundred deutschemarks in small bills scrawled across the top banknote in red lipstick were the words ilse use rr stuffing the bills back into the purse ilse climbed out of the bin and edged a little way down the alley damn all of this she thought angrily if eva can get me this far i can do the rest in less than fifteen seconds she had analyzed her options and made a decision she kicked off the stiletto heels eva had loaned her pulled on her own flats and started running toward the hazy glow at the opposite end of the alley pm tiorgartan district west berlin the moment harry richardson raised his hand to knock on klaus seeckts door the door jerked open to the length of the chain latch go away major said a voice from the dark crack the door slammed shut harry moved to the side of the door out of the light open the door klaus please go away harry more puzzled than angry harry flattened himself against the wall normally he telephoned klaus before coming over but tonight he hadnt wanted to give the east german a chance to postpone the meeting feeling exposed on the lighted stoop he pounded his fist against the heavy oak im not in uniform for gods sake open up now the bolt shot back with a bang klaus pulled the door open but remained out of sight in the dark foyer take it easy harry said well play it as an official visit however you want klauss voice dropped in volume but doubled in urgency harry get out of here theyre watching us as harrys eyes adjusted to the gloom he recognized the stubby barrel of a makarov pistol in klauss hand the east german wore only his bathrobe but his ashen face and the quivering pistol gave him a frighteningly lethal aspect harry glanced back at the street to try to spot watchers he saw none but he knew that didnt mean anything i tried to keep you out klaus said resignedly remember that writing off klauss pistol to paranoia harry slipped past the east german and started toward the living room with a hopeless sigh klaus shut the door and locked it behind them when harry reached the living room he saw that klaus was indeed being watchedbut from inside the house not out five men wearing dark business suits sat leisurely on sofas and chairs arranged around a glasstopped coffee table harry looked back over his shoulder at klaus the german hovered ghostlike in the shadows of the foyer the makarov slack against his leg harry considered bolting but klaus hadnt tried it so perhaps things werent so bad orperhaps harry thought uneasily klaus didnt run because he knows the front door is covered from the outside harry turned back to the living room none of the men around the table looked older than thirty and no one had said anything yet was that good or bad suddenly the oldestlooking of the group stood good evening major he said in heavily accented english what can we do for you the young mans accent was unmistakably russian there would be no attempt to pass these men off as other than what they were harry realized a very bad sign he cleared his throat and by what rank do i address you comrade he asked in flawless russian the russian smiled seeming to relish the idea of a catandmouse game you speak excellent russian major and i am but a lowly captain to answer your question captain dmitri rykov what are you doing so far from home captain am i so far from home rykov asked gamely a debatable point but im protecting the interests of my country of course the young mans candor was an unveiled threat i see harry said warily i also note that we have a mutual friend he observed trying to shift the focus away from himself i in the foyer klaus turned deathly pale yes rykov agreed giving klaus a predatory i glance this is proving to be an enlightening evening take his gun andrei no foolish heroics please klaus its not your style the east german slumped against the foyer wall his pistol hanging slack he looked broken already resigned to the grisly fate that undoubtedly awaited him in moscow corporal andrei ivanov moved to disarm him as you can see major rykov continued youve stumbled upon us at a most inopportune time ill certainly speak to my superiors about it but i suspect that your unfortunate timing may cost you your life before andrei could reach the unfortunate klaus the east german raised the makarov to his own temple and fired the sheer madness of the act stunned everyone causing a moment of confusion in desperation harry bolted for the door he had his fingers on the brass door handle when someone peppered the wall beside him with a burst from a silenced machine pistol dont move major captain rykov ordered his voice strained but even harry let his fingers fall from the handle he turned around slowly in the time it had taken him to reach the door the russians behind him had been transformed from a quiet group of social acquaintances into a squad of paramilitary soldiers moving in concert to control the unexpected emergency two men knelt over klauss body checking for signs of life two others covered the front and rear windows of the house rykov issued orders yuri get the car major move back into the room now rykov tapped the shoulder of a young man leaning over klauss corpse leave him andrei touch nothing klaus was a traitor he deserved a cowards death leave the gun in his hand we couldnt have set this up better ourselves shouldnt we take him along andrei asked the kriminalpolizei arent stupid rykovs eyes gleamed ideally i suppose but we wont have room for him what about the weapons compartment the major will be in there rykov turned to harry you dont want to spend the next hour hugging a corpse do you major harrys mind raced if this russian intended to kidnap an american army officer from the heart of tightly controlled west berlin something very big indeed was going on and to harrys mind that something could only be the events at spandau prison kosov wont like this he said remembering seeing the russian colonel at abschnitt this morning you better take some time to think captain rykov smiled youre very clever major the sound of an engine rumbled through the front door thats yuri said rykov all right major lets go harry didnt move conscious or unconscious i dont care but i must tell you its never quite as clean as the movies when you bash someone in the back of the head with a pistol harry moved he couldnt warn colonel rose if he was dead it was only a few steps from the front door to the car a black mercedes the russians crowded close around him all the way theres got to be a way out thought harry got to be ive got to warndmitri rykov slammed the butt of his skorpion machine pistol into the base of harrys skull he heard a dull thud but no crunch americans are so gullible he said laughing lucky for this one he has a wooden head corporal ivanov looked distressed are you sure we shouldnt just kill him here he said anxiously make it look like some illegal business perhaps a homosexual tryst im in command here rykov snapped losing a bit of his earlier control ill do the thinking yes sir i was only thinking of colonel kosov if he doesnt approve i know what kosov wants corporal did he not choose me for command we may need this american later as a bargaining chip rykovs voice softened andrei the other team is running down sergeant apfels wife as we speak kosov is with them do you want us to return to east berlin emptyhanded ivanov did not look entirely convinced but he said no more lying halfconscious at their feet harry slipped a hand into his inside coat pocket fished out a white business card and let it fall there was no name on itonly a telephone number as the russians lifted him into the mercedes he glanced down he saw his own blood but the white card had already vanished against the snow pm lielzensee park british sector once again ivan kosov said struggling to keep his voice steady where did the girl get out pressed into the corner of the taxis rear seat eva beers scowled and said nothing her hands were tied behind her head with her own stockings the young russian called misha had twice smashed her right cheek with his gloved fist but so far eva had refused to speak misha kosov growled the interior of the taxi echoed with the force of the third blow a large purplish bruise was already visible beneath the thick patina of makeup eva wore in the front seat beside kosov ernst the cabbie slumped unconscious over the wheel of his old mercedes i have no time for your stupid loyalty woman kosov said if you dont answer this time this zealous young man will have to slit the throat of your sleepy old hero you dont want that do you misha drew a longbladed stiletto from an ankle sheath and brandished it under evas chin i think hes quite eager to use that observed kosov arent you misha eva saw feral eyes glinting in the dark now where did frau apfel get out eva struggled to think through the pain of the blows and her growing apprehension that she would not survive the night how long had ernst evaded the black sedan two minutes three with his taxi finally trapped in the deadend lane beside the lietzensee lake the old cabbie had done his best to fend the russians off but the young kgb agents had simply been too agile for him how far could ilse have gotten in that time without warning misha savagely thrust his knee into evas left breast crushing itall right she gasped the pressure eased a little you have regained your memory kosov asked perhaps theyll spare ernst eva thought swine we stopped two or three blocks back she whispered when we rounded a corner ilse jumped out there skolka asked kosov two blocks or three which is it again misha jabbed his knee forward stop eva begged please she could fight no more but she could fire a last covering shot three blocks she lied laboring for breath the seehof hotel by the lake she ran inside kosov nodded that wasnt so difficult was it eva gulped air like a landed fish kosov sighed angrily debating with himself how in hell was he supposed to find the spandau papers three times moscow had signaled him each time telling him just a little more about the hess case doling out information like scraps of meat to a dog names without physical descriptions dates of events kosov had never heard of and t the center of it all apparently a oneeyed man who had no name kosov could make no sense of it and of course that was how moscow wanted it now that youre talking he said amiably i have one more question did frau apfel mention any names in connection with what her husband found no eva groaned she told me someone was after her thats all i didnt ask unbelievably mishas knee buried itself still deeper into evas chest the pain was excruciating she felt as if she were going to vomit please she choked the pressure relented just enough for her to take a shallow breath kosov heaved a bearlike shoulder over the front seat and bellowed names woman names are what i want did frau apfel mention the name zinoviev to you do you hear me znvev its a russian name did ghe mention it eva shook her head violently she had passed the point of being able to lie and something in her eyes must have shown it after several moments kosov nodded and misha removed his knee from her chest the old colonels face softened unlike my young friend he murmured i do not believe in needless killing however if you are lyingthat is if we do not find frau apfel or if you feel the sudden urge to speak to the authoritieswell quite obviously we know where to find you and we will find you i would send misha personally do you understand eva lay as still as she could the animals were going to let her live ja she breathed good kosov climbed out of the old taxi misha a reminder with an expert flick of his stiletto the young kgb agent opened a twoinch gash along evas left cheek eva shrieked in pain misha grinned watching her struggle in vain to reach the wound and stop the bleeding as the young russian backed out of the taxi kosovs hard face appeared in the front window free her hands he ordered cursing quietly misha slashed the stockings over evas head but instead of getting out of the car he thrust his hand viciously beneath evas skirt and clenched her pubic mound in a clawlike fist with flashing eyes he leaned close so that kosov couldnt hear when i find your little friend he snarled the pretty oneshes going to bleed old woman everywhere he wrenched his hand away tearing hair and skin as he backed out of the taxi shaking like an epileptic eva turned away and tried to stanch the flow of blood from her lacerated face she heard kosovs bmw skid around and speed down the lietzenseelifer in the direction of the seehof hotel screw you she spat swine youll never find her slowly she leaned forward and put her bloody hand to the old cabbies forehead ernst are you all right poor darling you fought well for an old soldier wake up for eva the old man didnt move if only some of my old friends were here eva lamented that young pigs balls would be meat for the dogs

of impala and zebra gathered around the waterholes on the veld below inside the choppers luxurious cabin alfred horn sat gripping the arms of his wheelchair which was bolted to the carpeted deck by specially designed fittings pieter smuts horns afrikaner security chief leaned closer to his master and spoke above the low beating drone of the rotor blades i wanted to wait until we were airborne to tell you sir the old man nodded slowly what is so important that you dont even trust your own security weve received the new figures from britain sir the american figures they were delivered by courier just an hour ago the bikini figures more than that sixtyfive percent of american test data from eniwetok atoll in fiftytwo up to the test ban in sixtythree the afrikaner shook his head sir you cant imagine what a one megaton surface blast will actually do yes i can pieter it leaves a crater one mile across and sixteen stories deep christ weve got the design the plants if we had six months we could probably divert ill be dead in six months horn snapped what do these figures tell you about our current resources the blast effects will be greater than we predicted using round figures a fortykiloton air burst should vaporize everything within three kilometers of ground zero intense heat will incinerate anything for a fivekilometer radius beyond that and the resulting winds and fires will wreak havoc for a considerable distance beyond those already mentioned and the fallout horn asked twenty percent higher than we predicted horn digested this without emotion and these figures you believe they are more reliable than our own sir except for the secret indian ocean test all south african figures are purely theoretical by definition they are predictions the american figures represent verified data horn nodded thoughtfully apply them to our scenario everything depends on the target sir obviously groundzero at the center of tel aviv or jerusalem would obliterate either city but if the weapon were used at the right time its effects could be greatly enhanced possibly even doubled by a collateral factor the weather how by the wind sir at this time of year the prevailing winds in israel blow southeast if the weapon were detonated in jerusalem the fallout would probably dissipate over jordan but if it were detonated intel aviv not only would it obliterate the city but it might well spread a lethal blanket of strontium over jerusalem within one or two hours horn closed his eyes and sighed with satisfaction and if we get the cobaltseeded bomb case in time the afrikaner turned his palms upward we wont sir not sooner than twenty days the technical problems are formidable but if we did get it smuts pursed his lips with a cobaltseeded bomb case and the revised yield figures id say sixty percent of the israeli population would be dead within fourteen days and palestine would be rendered uninhabitable for at least a decade horn let out a long sigh increase the bounty pieter five million rand in gold to the team that delivers a cobalt bomb case within seven days yes sir do we have any further information on the israeli doctrinal response smuts shook his head our london source dried up after we requested the american satellite photos frankly i dont even trust his initial reports on that subject why do you really think israel would target russian cities horn smiled of course its the only way the jews could win a war against a united arab force they must be able to prevent soviet resupply of the arabs and the only way they can do that is to blackmail the soviets what do they have to lose by doing so but the deployment plan for israels nuclear arsenal is the most closely guarded secret in the world how could our london sourceknow what he claims to know horn smiled not the most closely guarded secret pieter no one has yet proved that south africas nuclear arsenal even exists thanks in no small part to us smuts observed the afrikaner began cracking his knuckles the russian matter aside i think we can safely assume that if tel aviv or jerusalem were destroyed israel would go beyond a measured response if they knew the source of the attack they would respond with a significant portion of their black bomber and missile forces they will know the source of the attack horn rasped there is one unpredictable factor smuts said carefully if our clients were to detonate the weapon at dimona israels weaponsproduction plant there is a slight chance that the rest of the world might believe the explosion to be a genuine israeli accident the americans might coerce the jews into waiting until an outside investigation was completed by that time cooler heads might prevail horn made a dismissive gesture with his skeletal arm dont worry im relying on arab impatience not stupidity hussein assad these men might have the selfcontrol to wait and try to develop a cohesive plan nof our friend he will strike swiftly consider how quickly he agreed to our meeting he wont purposefully hit jerusalemthere are too many sacred muslim sites there and the security around dimona is airtight we neednt worry on that score the target will betel aviv horns one living eye focused on the afrikaner what of the spandau matter pieter have they captured the traitor have they found the papers not yet sir berlinone assures me it is only a matter of time however i received a call from his immediate subordinate berlintwo hes a lieutenant i believe jiirgen luhr and lieutenant luhr doesnt feel the prefect is up to the job hes moved some of our german assets into play without the prefects knowledge he checked the files on the two missing officers and dispatched men to all locations they might possibly run to i approved his action who knows what those bruderschaft clowns are really doing a little competition might speed up the capture im surprised that these policemen were able to escape at all horn remarked smuts shifted uncomfortably i did a little checking on my own sir the man who betrayed ushauerhes quite an officer it seems an exsoldier even the young man with him was decorated for bravery horn raised a long crooked finger in smutss tanned face never underestimate the german soldier pieter he is the toughest in the world let this be a lesson to you smuts colored yes sir keep me posted hourly im anxious to see how this exsoldier does you almost sound as if you want them to escape nonsense pieter by getting hold of the spandau papers we might well buy ourselves extra time at least we can keep the russians and the jews out of our business if not the british but thats it you see at this moment mi the kgb and the mossad must be scouring berlin for our two german policemen yet so far they have failed to capture them if these men live up to their racial heritage i suspect they will manage to evade their pursuers in the end we will have to find them ourselves the afrikaner nodded ill find them horn smiled coldly i know you will pieter if this hauer but knew you as i do he would already have given himself up chapter nine pm goethestrasse west berlin there hauer grunted he had wedged hanss volkswagen so tightly between two parked cars that the one behind would have to be moved to reveal the license plate all right wheres the house im not sure hans replied peering through his window ive never been here before are you joking hauer stared in disbelief so why are we here because its just what you asked fora place we cant be traced to hans climbed out of the vw and started up the deserted street skirting the pools of light from the street lamps thats it he said glancing back over his shoulder hauer followed a few paces behind see it elevenfifty quiet said hauer youll wake the whole block hans was already halfway up the walk he rapped loudly on the front door waited half a minute then knocked again finally a muffled voice came from behind the wood im coming already someone fumbled with the latch theri the door opened wide standing in a pair of blue silk pajamas a tiny man with silver hair and a tuft of beard squinted through the darkness he reached for a light switch please leave the light off herr ochs hans said what who are you finally the uniform registered in the old mans brain polizei he murmured is there some problem hans stepped closer he took the tattered business card from his pocket and handed it to the old man i dont know if you remember me herr ochs but you said that if i ever needed a favor gott im himmel ochs cried his eyes wide sergeant apfel hans nodded thats right im sorry to disturb you at this hour but theres an emergency my captain and i need to make some telephone calls we cant use the station just nowi say no more sergeant come inside did i not tell you ben ochs knows how to return a favor and what a vor bernice an even tinier grayhaired woman appeared behind ochs she stared at the uniforms with trepidation what is it benjamin its young hans apfel he needs our help get your slippers bernice well need some tea and ochs trailed off noticing the large bruise at the base of hanss skull a souvenir of rolfs lead pipe something stronger i think please said hans following the old man inside all we need is a telephone nonsense you look terrible you need food and something to calm your nerves bernice frau ochs bustled into the kitchen talking all the way theres chicken in the refrigerator boys and cabbage too its no feast but this is very short notice the old tailor pulled two chairs from beneath the kitchen table hans immediately collapsed into one the ochses kindness seemed otherworldly after the events of the past four hours hans felt as if hed been running for days hauer had been too amazed by the warm rece tion to say anything summoning a smile he extended his hand to ochs guten abend herr ochs im captain dieter hauer ochs nodded respectfully im afraid hans is right a ratherspecial situation has arisen i myself believe its just another of the endless exercises they put us through but of course we never know for sure if we could just use your telephone for a few minutes we would be gone before you know it ochs nodded again slower this time you are a poor liar captain but i count that in your favor most honest men make poor liars if youre anything like your young friend you are always welcome in my house this boyochs grinned and patted hans on the shoulderthis boy saved my life three years ago i was trapped in a burning car and hans was the only man who had the nerve to get me out the light of realization dawned on hauers face only now did he notice the old mans left hand it was withered and covered with scar tissue from a deep burn ochs shook his head in wonder i thought he was trying to kill me he blasted out the window right over my head the old man laughed and stepped over to the counter here is the chicken he said then he held up a dark bottle his wife had pulled from a high cabinet and here is some brvm fn randyfor the nerves well leave you to your business now come along bernice taking his wife under his silkcovered arm benjamin ochs left the kitchen without looking back unbelievable said hauer shaking his head hans snatched up the telephone and dialed the apartment he heard three rings four then someone picked up he waited for ilses voice but heard only silence ilse he said finally liebchen are you there a brittle male voice chilled him to the bone guten abend sergeant im afraid your wife is unable to get to the phone just now who is this hans shouted let me speak to my wife hauer signaled him to keep his voice down but hans ignored the warning put my wife on the phone as i said the voice continued the lovely frau is occupied just now indisposed let us say if you wish to speak to her it would be much quicker for you to come here im on my way you bastard if shes harmed in any way ill hans looked at hauer in a daze the line had gone dead he slammed down the phone they have her weve got to get to the apartment he was halfway to the foyer when hauer barked wait hans whirled wait have you lost your mind hauers voice went flat you wont get far without keys hans groped in his pockets give them to me he said quietly i cant hans youre making a mistake hans took a step forward give me my keys hauer shook his head you dont know they have ilse you didnt actually speak to her give me my goddamn keys hans sprang forward ready to thrash hauer until he gave up the keys but when he raised his hands to hauers neck he felt something hard pressing into his stomach when he looked down he saw a mm walther pi pistol standard issue for the west berlin police now said hauer youre going to sit there quietly while i make a phone call then well decide what to do about ilse dont you understand hans pleaded they have my wife i have to go you you his voice changed suddenlyyou dont understand do you you never had a wife you ran out on the one woman who loved you my mother thats a lie hauer whispered hanss face burned with emotion it isnt you ran out on her when she was pregnant pregnant with me give me those keys you son of a bitch hauer had gone very still his big fists were clenchedone around the butt of the walther you think you know something about me he said you dont know anytning a file isnt a man hans yes i know you went through my personnel file he worked his left fist angrily i dont know if you deserve the truth but the truth is that i didnt know i had a son until you were twelve years old youre lying hans insisted but something about that age had sparked a strange light behind his eyes im not hauer said softly think back you were twelve years old hans felt his chest tightening the pain in his eyes told hauer that he had remembered i knew you couldnt have forgotten that hauer said it was bad munich the day after the olympic massacre did you ever make that connection hans looked away hauer spoke quickly as if the words burned his mouth passing through it it was the lowest point in my life those jewish athletes died for nothing hans because of german arrogance and stupidity just like in the war and i was a part of it id been flown into munich as a sharpshooter hauer seemed about to continue the storythen he stopped realizing that one more telling wouldnt change anything after the slaughter was over he murmured i went crazy went off on my own i needed somethinga human touch a lifeline and there i was in the city my old lover had run off to totally by chance after a dozen schnapps though i started thinking maybe it wasnt by chance so i went looking for your mother you found her i found you you were the last thing in the world i expected your mother called the munich police on me of course my showing up after all those years was her worst nightmare but the moment i saw you hans i knew you were mine i knew it she didnt even try to deny it hauers eyes focused on the kitchen floor but she had me over a barrel hans somehow theyd fixed ither and her rich husbandso that hed legally adopted you i paid a lawyer two months salary to look into it but in the end he told me to forget it your mother had already poisoned you against me anywayshe let me know that before anything else hauer looked up into hanss eyes what did she tell you about that day hans shrugged she told me who you were that you were my real father but she said youd only come back to ask for money to beg for a loan hauer looked stunned i dont think i believed her though hans said softly even then not deep down you know what i remember about that day hauer shook his head your uniform a perfect green uniform with medals on the chest i never forgot that and when the police showed up to take you away you showed them your badge and they went away instead hauer swallowed hard is that why you became a policeman partly i guess i really became a cop because it was absolutely the worst thing i could do in mothers eyes shed spent twenty years trying to mold me intoa banker like her first husband and i guess he wasnt so bad really looking back but when she married that goddamn lawyer i started to hate her she was so transparent always trying to buy respect and i hated her more because i knew that in some twisted way she was doing it all for me after she married the lawyer i wanted to hurt her as much as shed hurt me and the best way to do that was to become everything she had run away from when she was young to become a workingclass slave just like you hans laughed then i found out i liked the job what would freud say about that i wonder hauer forced a smile i believe what youve told me hans said but when i showed up in berlin wearing this uniform why didnt you tell me your side of it that was ten years after munich hauer explained long before then id resigned myself to the fact that id have to live the rest of my life without you or any family when you came marching up to me outside that police station with a hundredpound chip on your shoulder and reciting that stupid agreement youd worked out i didnt know what to think youd already come that far back to me on your own i wasnt going to rush anything hans nodded i wanted to make it on my own i didnt want an help from you and no matter how much i hated mother then i wasnt ready to find out the truth about you not if the truth was that you really had run out on us she never told me she was pregnant hans its an old story i was good enough to fall in love with but not to marry its sad really she hadnt grown up any better than i had but shed set her sights on marrying rich fear of poverty i guess she did love me i still believe that but there was no way her kid was going to be raised by a cop she wanted it all for you hans gymnasium universityi you dont have to tell me hans cut in i know it all by heart but what i cant forgive is her putting it all on me making me out to be christ i dont know its okay it is how could she tell me it was her fault i didnt have a father hanss eyes fell on the face of his watch he looked up quickly hauer was still pointing the walther at him i know what youre thinking hauer said dont try it look if whoever was in your apartment really had ilse they would have put her on the phone theyd have made her draw you its you they wantr what you found but you cant know that what if shes hurt what if she couldnt speak what if shes deaal hauer lowered the pistol a few centimeters i concede those possibilities but were not going to charge into a situation we know nothing about to die like romantic fools first we must know if we are being hunted officially he picked up the telephone with his left hand and punched in a number i want you to think of any possible places ilse might have run to or even gone innocently and hansthink like a policeman not a husband that if anything will save your wife with a last look at hans he stuck the walther into his belt hans felt his fists quivering a wild voice told him to bash hauers skull and take the car keys that quick action was ilses only chance but his police experience told him that hauerthat his fatherwas right communications desk hauer said curtly whos calling telefon theres a line problem hold bitte hauer put his hand over the mouthpiece pray steubens still on duty he whispered this is sergeant steuben said a deep voice we have no line problem steuben dieter my god where are you lets just say im still under my ownrecognizance steubens voice dropped to a whisper youre damned lucky funk has an army out looking for you and that young

dieter listen theyre saying that you and apfel yes theyre saying that you and apfel killed erhard weiss theyre playing it like a simple murder they brought weisss body up from the basement and paraded a few lieutenants and pressmen through ill tell you dieter some of the boys were pretty upset the story is that you and apfel were tied into organized crime and weiss found out most dont quite believe you did it but everyones damned angry youd better walk softly if you come up on any old friends i understand josef what about that other matter another call went out from an empty office about this afternoonsame destination pretoria right steubens voice dropped lower dieter he said hesitantly you didnt really kill young weiss did you my god josef you know better than that steuben hesitated what about apfel i dont know him he tried to save the boy they were comrades think josef weiss was jewishthat doesnt lead you anywhere steubens reply was almost inaudible phoenix yes ive got to go now i

cover them just as i promised there are two men with them now good friends of mine gsg veterans no worries there funk couldnt get into your house with anything less than a fullscale military assault thank you my friend auf wiedersehen josef before hauer could set the phone in its cradle hans broke the connection and punched in a new number who are you calling hauer asked none of your goddamn business hans snapped you can cover your friends with gsg men but you cant take twenty minutes to save ilse hans you dont understand eva he said loudly hans yes eva i want you to look outside your door and listen to me hans someone is tearing your apartment to pieces right now that tells me they havent found her yet what youve seen ilse seen her i sneaked her out of the apartment tonight just before the stinking russians got her what the hell have you done russians hanss exclamation brought hauer out of his chair like a cannon shot tell me eva hurry eva related the story of their escape from kosovs team ending with ilse fleeing into the dark alley hans slammed his fist against the table but you dont know where she is now no but she told me to give you a message what message mittelland thats it one word thats it mittelland like the canal i guess she didnt want me to know anything hans shook his fist in exultation eva thats it i know where shes gone so get her you damned fool and youd better get some serious help i dont think your polizei friends are up to it she paused and if you come up on a young fellow called misha yest kill the bastard send him to hell he cut my face hans felt his heart thump what happened just find ilse hans if anything happens to that girl youre going to answer to me and stay the hell away from here your apartment sounds like a bremen bar fight eva hung up hauer grabbed hanss shoulder you said russians eva said russians came to the apartment looking for me how does she know they were russian hans shrugged shes been around you know shes an old barmaid who turns a few tricks for rent money she got ilse out of the building but thats all she could tell me it must be kosov hauer muttered the quiet colonel from funks polygraph session he knew that test was rigged from the start did ilse have the papers with her i dont know for gods sake hans youve got to start thinking like a policeman i dont give a damn about those papers quiet youll bring ochs in here and youd better give a damn about those papers they may be the only thing that can keep us or ilse alive now he held up a forefinger you said you knew where ilse had gone where hanss eyes narrowed why should i tell you he asked suddenly suspicious christ you might have brought me here just to find out where she is where the papers are god you might hauer slapped him hard get hold of yourself hans you brought me here remember youve got to trust somebody and im all you have hans scowled wolfsburg he said quietly what ilses grandfather has a small cabin on the mittelland canal near wolfsburg its an old family retreat the professor must have been working there and ilse found out god i hope shes made it his face clouded but how could she ive got the car train hauer suggested she didnt have any money at home all women have money at home hans believe me they hide it for emergencies we never think about captain ive got to get to wolfsburg i agree but before i give you the keys youre going to listen to me for ten minutes then ill figure out a way for us to get out of berlin you know youd never make it without my help hans knew hauer was right he could never evade funks dragnet on his own ten minutes he agreed hauer sat down and leaned forward youve got to understand something hans early this morning you stumbled into a case that ive been working on for over a year thats what i meant about steuben theres more that needs protecting at his house than his wife and children theres a fireproof safe full of evidence that he and i have compiled over the past year until a couple of hours ago i had no idea that spandau prison had anything to do with this case but now im almost certain that it does what the hell are you talking about those papers you found at spandau arent just some relic from the past hans the russians havent gone crazy searching for a museum piece those papers pose a very serious threat to someone nowin the present hauer took a cigar from his pocket and bit off the tip before i tell you anything else you must understand some thing very important right now as we speak germanythe two germanysare very close to reunification what i dont mean its going to happen tomorrow or next week but six months from now a year maybe are you mad hauer paused to light his cigar most germans would say so he said and they would be as wrong as you are tell me as you grew up didnt you notice all the societies who clamor for the reunification of the fatherland i dont mean administrative committees plodding through mountains of paper i mean the hardcore groups the ones that exist only to restore germanys lost might hans shrugged sure so what whats wrong with working to make germany strong i agree with them not some of the crazier factions maybe but i want germany to be united again one nation without the wall hauer raised an eyebrow hans colored its my country isnt it i want it to be strong of course you do boy so do but there are different kinds of strength some of these groups have some very strange ideals old ideals old agendas what do you mean how do you know hauer studied his cigar because weve been to their meetingssteuben and i stumbled into this whole thing by accident about two years ago i got drawn into a special tasks drug case the money trail led me to two police officers in short order i became aware that quite a few cops were involved in the drug traffic flowing into and through germany and in spite of orders to the contrary i began to compile evidence on these officers steuben helped me all the way it didnt take us long to realize that their drug operation extended into the highest ranks of the force prefect funk excellent example but then things got strange pretty soon we discerned a attem every officer involved in the drug traffic was also a member of a semisecret society called der bruderschaft the brotherhood ive heard of that hauer exhaled a cloud of blue smoke im not surprised i joined it myself last year thats what the tattoo is about the eye is their symbol ever see a policeman with a bandage behind his right ear that means hes gotten the mark they wear the bandage till the hair grows back i dont know what the eye means but i was only a month away from getting it myself you get marked after a year in the group hauer stood up and flicked some cigar ash into ochss sink the real name of the organization is not der bruderschaft however its bruderschaft der phoenix have you heard of that hanss eyes widened i have it was in the spandau papers something about the soldiers of phoenix appeanng before prisoner number seven christ what else do you remember hans shook his head i only remembered that because it was in german not latin hauer began pacing the kitchen god its so easy to see now der bruderschaft is neonazi it would only be natural for them to try to contact hess in prison to try to use him as some kind of mascot but maybe hess didnt like the idea eh maybemy god hauer said suddenly they might well be the ones who killed him hess would be much more valuable to them as a martyr than a pathetic prisoner who comes to these bruderschaft meetings hans asked a bunch of malcontents and young toughs mostly you know the typeops who wont answer a call to help a turkish woman whos being beaten in the street most werent even born until fifteen or twenty years after the war hauer shook his head in disgust they get drunk argue make speeches about throwing the traitors out of bonn and making berlin the capital again then they sing deutschland fiber alles if theyre really tanked they sing the horst wessel at first the whole thing seemed comical but after a while i realized something these clowns were bringing in millions of marks through their drug operations yet they didnt seem to be keeping any of it no ferrans no new houses where was all the money going i traced the command chain all the way up to prefect funk but after six months of investigation i hit a dead end hauers eyes flickered then i had my revelation it had been right in front of me all the time their money came from drugs right well where do the drugs flow in from the east hans said softly right so i asked myself what if their organization extended laterally not vertically you see how were the drugs getting through east germany were the vopos blind hell no they were allowing the drugs to get through the east german police have their own bruderschaft members hans blinked in astonishment the volkspolizei hauer nodded and the stasi hans drew back at the mention of the hated east german secret police but why would the stasi smuggle drugs for hard currency hauer shook his head think about being a stasi agent for a minute hans what its really like no thanks hauer waved his cigar sure a lot of them are scum but theyre german scum you see all day and night they have the russians leaning over their shoulders telling them what to do they hate the russians more than we ever could theyre communists sure but what choice do they have theyve beenunder the russian boot since so what do you think they do lie down and take moscows crap most of them do hauers eyes gleamed but some of them dont the hvaeast german intelligencesucks moscows shitpipe theyre like a german arm of the kgb but the stasi forget it they go theirown way they can beat the kgb at their own game and the kgb knows it if moscow complains about the stasi honecker himself tells the kremlin to mind its own business you sound like you admire the bastards hauer shook his head this isnt a case of absolutes hans the point is that some elements of the stasi want reunification even more than we in the west do and theyre willing to fight for it they want their slice of the european economic pie and they know that so long as theyre separate from us theyll never get it and that brings us to the drugs how drugs are their slice of the pie no drugs are part of the strategy i think their theory runs something like this the more rapidly the social situation in west germany breaks down the more rapidly the rightwing and nationalist factions in the west consolidate their power think about it for twenty years the stasi supplied the red army faction and other leftwing terrorists with guns and plastique why just to create chaos no because every time those misguided hotheads blew up a bank or an airport lounge the right wing in the west hit back a little bit harder the public reaction got a little stiffer im telling you hans its a sound strategy moscow has never been more lenient than it is right now the entire eastern bloc is restless trouble and sedition are brewing everywhere and east germany is the most independent satellite of all the stasi monitors everything there student unrest political volatility economic stress plus they have that rarest of all commodities direct intelligence lines into russia i think der bruderschaftand whoever controls itbelieves that a strong enough chancellor in west germany could seize the right opportunity and wrench the two germanys back together hauer was breathing hard and by god they may be right hans stared fascinated is the stasi really as powerful as people say ive heard they have hundreds of informers here and in bonn hauer chuckled hundreds try thousands if i had the files from stasi headquarters i could break half the political careers in west germany and a good many in moscow i mean that some of our most powerful senators are actually on the stasi payroll funk is just small beer hans was shaking his head do you really believe all this hauer shrugged i dont know one minute i believe every word of it the next i wonder if schnapps has pickled my brain when i stand in those bruderschaft meetings i want to laugh funk and his rabble are just grownup children fantasizing about a fourth reich its classic infantile bullshit germany will be united again dont doubt it but not by drunk policemen or skinheads its the bankers and board chairmen wholl bring it off men from the world your mother worshipped were the richest country in europe now hans and anything can be bought for a price even a united germany hauer tugged at his mustache the question is this is there a connection between der bruderschaft and those bankers and board chairmen and if so what is it how much power does phoenix exert over the institutions in germany the stasis potential for blackmail is formidable funks group may seem like clowns but no matter how you look at it the polizei are an arm of the state hans look confused but how could all this tie in with the spandau papers with ilse bruderschaft der phoenix remember phoenix was mentioned in the spandau papers therefore it ties funk and the stasi to the papers your hooker friend said russians came looking for you and chased ilse the russians went on the rampage when you discovered the spandau papers do the russians know about phoenix maybe theyve infiltrated der bruderschaft through the stasi maybe they suspect the stasis role in a grab for reunification what the hell is phoenix a man a group of men at one bruderschaft meeting i heard funkwho was drunk out of his mindbabbling about how phoenix was going to change the world make everything right again clean out the jews and the turks once and for all but when i tried to pump him lieutenant luhr shut him up hauer shifted in the small chair whatever phoenix is im almost certain its based outside germany about a month ago steuben started noticing calls going out from funk to different towns in south africa i assumed it was more drug business looking for new markets et cetera but i dont think that anymore hans i think you have dredged up something so politically hot that we ant even imagine it i hope ilse managed to get those papers to wolfsburg but hether she did or not we wont get out of berlin by driving your vw through checkpoint charlie weve got to take precautions make arrangements people owe me pardon me said a soft voice from the shadows hauer turned in his chair benjamin ochs stood silhouetted against the lighted hall door forgive me he said but the shouting alarmed my wife could i join you for a moment the old man shuffled into the kitchen and took a seat at the table he poured a brandy into one of the unused tumblers his wife had set down earlier drank it then wiped his mouth on his pajama sleeve i know what youre thinking captain he said how much did the old goat hear yes well ill tell you i didnt hear everything but i heard enough i wish id heard damned all what i heard god help us you never said it but i know what you were talking about are you afraid to say it im not sure what you mean hauer said nazis ochs cried his wizened head shaking thats what youre talking about isnt it and not just a pack of hooligans desecrating jewish cemeteries youre talking about policemenprofessional men bankers board chairmen you misunderstood herr ochs its not so bad as that captain its probably worse than that dont you know what the phoenix is its the bird that perishes in the fire only to be reborn from its ashes the old tailor drew himself up to his full height i am a jew captain a german jew before the war there were of us here in berlin now we are i was not a child during the war while you hunted scraps in the streets i existed in a place you cannot imagine beyond hope outside of time i lost my entire familyparents brother two sistersat this place while they passed into oblivion i sewed uniforms for the german army i lived while my family died i promise you captain no uniforms were ever more poorly made than those benjamin ochs made for the wehrmacht every bit of skill i had went into producing a uniform that would last just long enough to get a soldier to the frozen russian front then fall into pieces fit only for a shroud ochs raised his withered hand if you protect such men captain i tell you now to get out of my house now but if you mean to fight them then let me help you tell me what you need hans sat speechless but hauer lost no time taking advantage of his offer we need a car he said done ochs said simply we need something to wear besides these uniforms do you have anything that might fit us well enough not to draw attention ochs smiled am i not a tailor i wont be a minute with the clothes take whatever food you can find in the refrigerator if youre going through east germany tonight you wont be stopping for coffee he turned and started for the hall herr ochs hauer called yes what kind of car do you have ochss eyes twinkled british jaguar she runs like the wind petrol both tanks are full the old man took a step back toward hauer you stop these men captain root them out show them what the german people are made of turned and scurried down the hall is he right hans asked are you talking about real nazis hauer shook his head i dont think so germany is the last place fascism could take hold again we have the strongest democracy in europe and even if we didnt nato and the warsaw pact would vaporize us before they allowed another german dictator i think were dealing with accelerated reunificationconomic political and military there are massive profits to be made and phoenix knows that the nationalist button is the one to push to get the german people behind them funk and his clowns are just foot soldiers moneymaking drones hauer knitted his brow goddamn it the answer is right in front of me and i cant pin it down all of this fits together somehow phoenix reunification the spandau paper s hauer stopped dead my god what if hesss papers contain something that could be used as leverage against nato against england and the us or even russia people have always said hess knew some terrible secret what if its something phoenix could use to pressure the four powers on reunification even to pressure one power hauer thrust the vw keys into hanss hand move your car down the block we dont want to set the dogs on this old fellow hes been through enough hell for one lifetime as hans disappeared through the front door hauer opened the refrigerator he couldnt remember when hed last eaten as he reached for a jar of polish pickles an image of rudolf hess flashed into his mind tall and cadaverous the solitary specter shuffled silently through the snowcovered spandau courtyards what could that old man have known he wondered what did he leave behind something big enough to blackmail a superpower could anything really be that big if it is he told himself with a shiver im not sure i want to know hauer pressed down a wave of guilt he had lied to hans earlierhe had seen erhard weiss tortured and he could not blot out the memory funk and his goons werent sophisticated enough for chemicals they used beatings and electricity on the face up the anus clipped to the penis and they enjoyed it especially luhr young weiss had screamed until hauer thought his jawbone would pop out of its socket the poor boy would have shot his own mother to make them stop but luhr had wanted information and weiss hadnt had any and hauerthe brave captainhad stood by in rigid silence while it happened he could have tried to stop it of course but he would soon have taken weisss place in the torture chair weiss is dead he told himself you cant bring him back concentrate on the living hauer hoped hanss wife had made it to wolfsburg but he didnt think much of her chances of getting safely out of berlin tonight if she had been caught he hoped it was by the russians god alone knew what jiirgen luhr would do to a woman if he got the chance chapter ten pm polizei abschnih west berlin prefect wilhelm funk appeared on the verge of a myocardial infarction a critical situation he thought admirably under his control had suddenly exploded in his grossly veined face and he could do precious little about it a genetic bureaucrat funk searched instinctively for scapegoats but the unfortunate rolf already lay dead in the basement cell with weisss mutilated corpse now funk sat fuming in his office accompanied by his aide lieutenant jijrgen luhr and captain otto greener of the kreuzberg district they cannot escape prefect luhr said trying to calm his enraged superior we have men at every checkpoint even the smugglers know that taking hauer out would be fatal i made the threats myself funks fury eased a little at this news luhr had always been his favorite the man had almost no human weaknesses mercy least of all where do you think hauer might run jijrgen and why in gods name would he betray us to save some green sergeant it doesnt matter none of that matters well find him its only a question of time well thats the point isnt it funk exploded who knows what that traitorous bastards gotten hold of he could destroy years of work and planning funk leaned forward and put his face in his plump hands at least you got the damned russians out im not sure kosov bought the lie detector charade luhr said thoughtfully funk waved away his concern you said it yourself jiirgen its just a matter of time before we run them down and when we do our problem is solved all bruderschaft men have the shoottokill order and the rest of the force will probably do the same out of anger the spandau papers will be confiscated and that will be that what if we dont catch them before they leave the city otto greener cut in we shall funk snapped the alternative is impossible to contemplate but you must contemplate it prefect greener insisted laying smug emphasis on the title an old rival of funks groaner enjoyed seeing him placed squarely on the hot seat worry about your own district funk grumbled but the problem isnt in my district funk slammed his fist down on the desk one small setback and already the dogs are yapping at my heels what would you do in a real crisis greener loot our accounts and sell out phoenix how can i sell out someone im not even sure exists funk sighed shut up otto this problem will soon be resolved and when it is i shall turn my attention to you the rotund greener leaned back in his chair and lit a stained pipe i hope youre right wilhelm he said amiably for your sake but somehow i dont think you are my instinct tells me that something unexpected has happened unexpected not only here but in pretoria he raised a fat eyebrow perhaps phoenix is not the omnipotent force we have been led to believe fool jiirgen luhr spat words like that could cost you your life you think youre in private here because there are four walls around you im starting to believe you think like a cow as well as look like one you insolent swine greener bellowed coming to his feet luhr stood defiantly daring the big man to move against him his psychotic blue eyes and formidable physique made any question of rank irrelevant hauer is loose in the city and here you two sit arguing like children what are you going to do groaner searched for a graceful way to reclaim his chair funk looked like a dog disciplined for some reason it doesnt understand havent i every car has the names and pictures god every man out there knows hauer by sight ive convinced everyone that he and apfel murdered one of their own what more can i do luhr paced worriedly im not sure but im not so certain youve convinced everyone most officers will get the report only by radio they wont actually have seen weisss body hauer and apfel have friends out there hauer especially men hes been under fire with they wont betray him on the basis of a rumor particularly one started by you funk reddened but a moment ago you told me they couldnt escape luhr smiled thinly im afraid that was to make you feel better im really not that confident his face hardened tell me about munich he said i know hauer was demoted because of the olympic massacre but what exactly did he do there funk wiped his forehead with a handkerchief i dont see what that has to do with anything humor me said luhr funk sighed all tight hauer was in the federal border police then he was a sharpshooter or sniper or whatever you want to call it the black september fedayeen were holding the jew athletes at the olympic village theyd demanded a jet to take them to cairo theyd also demanded the release of andreas baader and ulrike meinhof whom wed just captured that year plus a couple of hundred arab political prisoners in israel the israeli government asked us to allow one of their commando teams into germany to attempt a rescue and that wet rag willy brandt wanted to let them in hed offered to release baader and meinhof from the very beginning thank god the final authority was in the hands of the state government and hauer luhr prodded im telling you funk said testilythe fedayeen and their hostages were given buses and allowed to drive out to two helicopters which had been brought to the olympic village some peoplehauer among themthought that was the best time to try a rescue but the state government said no the ambush was to be at fijrstenfeldbrijck airport when the terrorists tried to move from the helieopters to the waiting jet almost as soon as the choppers touched down at fiirstenfeldbriick someone gave the order to fire hauer was one of five sharpshooters the light was terrible the distance prohibitive and the shooting reflected the conditions the whole firelight took about an hour in the end it took an infantry assault to kill all the arabs but not before they had blown up the jews in the helicopters luhr nodded and hauer i just told you but the shootinghauer missed his targets no said funk with grudging admiration as a matter of fact he killed one of the terrorists with his first shot and wounded another with his second the fool might even have held on to his job if hed kept his mouth shut but of course he didnt he had to tell everyone what we had done wrong why the rescue was doomed from the beginning he was screaming for reforms in our counterteffor capability he wanted us to copy the damned israelis so what happened to him funk chuckled softly he paid the bureaucratic price along with everyone else associated with the massacre he was transferred to the civil police here and hes been a thorn in my ass ever since i never wanted that bastard in our group i never trusted him after munich hes carried a chip on his shoulder about those jews ever since that day funk snorted imagine losing sleep over a few jewish wrestlers funk toyed with a shellcasing paperweight on the desk the irony is that bonn created the gsg because of munich hauer wanted to join of course but by the time his old friends had lobbied successfully for his acceptance he was too old to pass the physical tests you have to be practically an olympic athlete to get in he coached their sharpshooters for a while but thats it i think they still use him occasionally in some kind of consulting capacity wunderbar luhr snapped and you think were going to catch this man with standard tactics christ weve got to do something more what funk asked almost pleading luhr shook his head angrily i dont know yet but i know this youd better inform pretoria of whats happened and the sooner the better funk blanched greener heaved himself from his chair and reached for his cap i should get back to kreuzberg yes i suppose so otto luhr mocked well be sure and tell phoenix you mentioned him greener slammed the door luhr laughed what an old woman how did he ever survive twentyfive years on the force by doing just what he did then funk replied lifting the phone making judicious exits besides nobody wants kreuzberg its the shithole of berlin nothing there but filthy turks and studentsis that you steuben youre still on duty funk cut his eyes at luhr this is the prefect get me an international operator again same number right pretoria i need some advice from an old friend in the nis those fellows down there really know how to handle a problem crack a few heads and no more problem yes ill wait in the firstfloor communications room sergeant josef steuben reached under his computer desk and activated a small tape recorder after surveying the main station room through the window behind him he logged funks call into a small notebook he had kept religiously for the past four months steuben had no university degree but hauer considered him an electronics genius it had taken him less than a minute to piggyback the signal cable coming from the thirdfloor office funk had commandeered there were no voltagemeasuring devices monitoring abschnitt so he felt reasonably safe besides he thought if this thing ever gets to court wild charges by a computer technician and an accused murderer will be worthless weve got to have physical evidence dieter will love this he said aloud catch the buggers in the act a voice like cracking ice froze steuben in his chair are you the only man on duty in here it asked steuben whirled lieutenant jijrgen luhr stood in the doorway of the communications room his right hand resting on the butt of his walther stand back from the console he ordered pm prinzenstrasse west berlin blindness hans thought this must be what blindness is like he felt as if he were staring backward into his own skull he couldnt see his fathers face although he knew it was only centimeters from his own cramped and disoriented he reached out be still hauer grunted sorry somehow he and hauer had stuffed themselves into the boot of benjamin ochss jaguar ochs had thrown an old blanket on top of them and luckily they had gone in head first so that what little heat passed through the rear seat by convection kept their heads reasonably warm now they sped across the city the nattily dressed old couple staring sternly ahead whenever they passed a green police vehicle in the lightless boot hans struggled to keep his limbs awake one leg was completely numb already and his left shoulder felt as though it might actually be dislocated captain he said ive been thinking about what you said about stasi officers working for reunification it just doesnt make sense to me if the wall came down wouldnt the stasi be dismantled even prosecuted for criminal actions yes and that should tell you something someone in the west must be guaranteeing them some kind of immunity in exchange for their assistance dont ask me who because i dont know hans digested this in the rumbling blackness do you really think it could happen he asked at length reunification i mean its inevitable hauer said its just a question of when and how mayor diepgen himself said as much this year this year with the th anniversary we begin with the idea of berlin as the capital of all germany no one outside germany took any notice of course but they will hans youre young people on the other side of the wall seem different to you and they are in some ways big things separate us the wall our educational system ideologies but little things join us what we eat our old songs the mothers in the east tell their children the same fairy tales your mother told you at night the fathers tell the same stories of heroism from the same wars little things maybe but in my experience the little things outlast the big things hauer shifted position we germans are a tribe hans thats the best and the worst thing about us hans nodded slowly in the darkness where are we crossing he asked staaken no thats what everyone will expect theyll assume that if we run well run west thats where the heaviest security should be so where are we crossing heinrichheine strasse were going right into the heart of east berlin then swinging south around the city that old jew has balls ill tell you how are we getting out exactly hans asked above the drone of the jaguars engine you dont think theyre going to let this car through without checking the boot hauer chuckled softly in the dark id hoped you wouldnt ask the truth is im glad the old man demanded to come now weve got three things going for us glasnost the weather and the reluctance of the border guards to bother two old jews traveling to a funeral funeral what are you talking about whose funeral before hauer could answer benjamin ochs leaned back and struck the rear seat with his balled fist two muted thuds sounded in the boot thats it hauer whispered were there two more thuds reverberated through the closed space damn hauer muttered extra security dont say a word hans and pray the vopos are lazy tonight benjamin ochs stared through his spotless windshield at the gauntlet ahead thirty meters away redandwhite steel barriers blocked the road at both checkpoints on the east german side a steelhelmeted vopo stood at the window of a white volkswagen checking the drivers papers the west berlin border guards had gone into their booth to escape the biting wind the border guards werent the problem ten meters in front of ochss jaguar a black minivan marked polizei had been parked diagonally across the road partially blocking it beside the van two greatcoated police officers were questioning four men in a black mercedes that sat idling just ahead of ochss jaguar as casually as he could benjamin ochs rolled down his window step out of the car herr gritzbach said a large surly police sergeant to the driver of the black mercedes and shut off the engine certainly officer kgb captain dmitri rykov smiled and turned the ignition key the mercedes engine sputtered into silence rykov climbed slowly out of the car moving as if he had all night to stand in the cold and chat with his west german comrades his three passengers soon joined him why do you travel at this late hour the policeman asked sharply rykov smiled our employer wants us back at a construction site in the east apparently theres some sort of emergencywhat was your business in west berlin rykov pointed to his papers its all there on the second page were architects for the firm of huber and rhi were building a civic hall near the muggelsee we came to west berlin to consult with some architects here and also to study the philharmonie building magnificent yes quite added corporal andrei ivanov whose east german assport identified him as one gunther burkhalter the policeman grunted he knew about these men he had seen the black mercedes with their drivers who spoke notquiteperfect german too many times before he also knew that their cover stories would check out when operating in west berlin the kgb carried authentic east german id documents supplied by the stasi still the sergeant was in no mood for a silkyvoiced russian whoacted as if he expected the west berlin police to kowtow to him open the boot herr gritzbach he said rykov smiled again and reached into the car for the keys andrei and the others tensed but their worries were for nothing hidden in the cramped compartment beneath the rear seat of the mercedes harry richardson remained unconscious his hands and feet were boand so tightly with duct tape that they received almost no blood at all even if he had regained consciousness he couldnt have moved crammed into every inch of space unoccupied by his body were the oiled weapons of the kgb team you see said rykov gesturing into the mercedes trunk nothing but suit bags disappointed sergeant the burly policeman slammed down the lid and moved back to the side of the car he had no legal reason to detain these men however badly he might want to brusquely he handed the passport and other papers back to rykov pass he said grinning rykov slid halfway into the mercedes and started the engine while he waited for his comrades to climb in he stared at the policeman through the open door and laughed i love this he thought the idiot knows yet he can do nothaaarrrgh he shrieked oh im sorry herr gritzbach i didnt realize the police sergeant had slammed the heavy mercedes door on rykovs exposed leg are you all right herr gritzbach should i call a doktor rykovs ashen face quivered with rage no he snarled rubbing his leg furiously but your leg might be broken rykov lifted his throbbing leg into the car and slammed the door very well then the policeman said gleefully i hope your stay in west berlin has been a memorable one ill remember you rykov vowed his face twisted in pain depend on that the mercedes screeched away it stopped perfunctorily at the western checkpoint then shot beneath the raised barrier on the east german side accelerating all the way just as i thought the sergeant muttered precleared he turned and signaled the next car forward benjamin ochs swallowed his fear placed a reassuring hand on his wifes arm and eased the jaguar toward the roadblock the sergeant turned his back to the bowling wind and lit a cigarette then he walked back to the police van a younger officer stepped up to ochss window guten abend officer ochs said handing over his passport is there some emergency im afraid so herr ochs were looking for two fugitives i must ask you a few questions what is the purpose of your visit to east berlin family emergency my nephew has been killed were on our way to braunschweig frau ochs gave a little sob then turned away as if she were crying the young policeman leaned over and peered in at her then scrutinized her husbands papers ochs patted his wifes shoulder now now bernice well be there soon inside the dark boot hans could hear every word distinctly captain he whispered what do we do if shut up hauer breathed its all up to the old man now but if they open the boot do we fight do you still have your gun if they open the boot we do nothing if i pulled out a gun this close to the wall theyd be hosing us off the street in the morning the old couple too just be quiet and dont move though every muscle twitched in pain hans struggled to remain still he tried to ignore the voices outside but it was impossible he died in an auto accident early this evening ochs was saying my brother called me a horrible thing fourcar pileup why do you exit here asked the young officer sharply braunschweig lies due west ochs tried to think of what hauer had told him to say but he hesitated a second too long open the trunk please the policeman ordered you may remain in the car if you have an automatic release with his heart in his throat ochs slowly reached for the button why is this taking so long frau ochs cried suddenly hes only doing his job bernice ochs said his heart pounding the men were after murdered two policemen the young man answered stiffly they must be brought to justice he looked over at the van and motioned toward the jaguars boot the surly sergeant who had smashed rykovs leg walked to the rear of the jaguar he drummed his fingers on the boot lid waiting for ochs to release the catch inside hans tensed like a coiled spring hauer shoved his walther deep into the spare tire receptacle praying it wouldnt be spotted until they were safely away from the vehicle just as he got the pistol covered the catch popped open the lid rose a little then the sergeant flipped it all the way up seeing the old blanket he took hold of a corner and jerked it aside blinding glare from the checkpoint spotlights struck hans and hauer full in the face illuminating their twisted bodies the big policeman froze this tiny compartment was the last place he had expected to find the fugitives he groped clumsily for his gun squinting into the light hauer discerned the outlines of the policemans face steiger he hissed through gritted teeth the policeman gaped in surprise then leaned low over the trunk dieter he whispered what the hell are you doing hauer shook his head violently sergeant steiger glanced around the boot lid at his companion who was still questioning ochs then he leaned lower and looked into hauers eyes dieter was it you he whispered did you kill weiss hauer shook his head still more violently funk he spat that bastard ordered it steiger straightened up and glanced over the trunk lid past his partner to the american checkpoint and then farther on to where the east german vopos waited he made a hard decision very fast leaning back over the boot he shoved down hard on the car frame with his thighs and hands giving the impression of checking for a false bottom then he stood up glanced once at hauer and slammed the lid nothing here he called to his partner suitcases steiger sauntered to the police van and picked up his cigarette his partner was still questioning ochs this is highly irregular the young man said officiously whats happening ochs thought wildly why didnt that policeman jerk them out of the boot my wife is very upset officer he stammered theres an old synagogue in east berlinin the kollwitzstrasse not far from here she was practically raised in that synagogue before the war of course you are jewish the policeman asked sharply ochs heard blood roaring in his ears memories of his youth flooded into his mind midnight knocks at his door screams for help ignoredyes he answered quietly we are jewish the young man smiled and handed back ochss papers there is also a very beautiful synagogue in braunschweig he said you must see it i spent my summers there as a boy thats why i asked ochs swallowed the lump in his throat thank you yes weve seen it many times with a shaking hand he shifted into first gear you have your money ready for the vopos the policeman asked you know you must change twentyfive deutschemarks as you cross over ive got it thank you right here the old tailor patted his breast pocket he let out the clutch pedal and moved slowly away from the van crushing out his cigarette sergeant steiger stepped away from the police van and waved to the west german checkpoint guards they raised the barrier from inside their booth and let the jaguar pass unmolested ochs rolled to a stop on the east german side in the boot hans held his breath and listened for the voices of the vopos he heard ochs inquire about the exchange rate complaining a little but not too much the wait seemed interminable to hans but at last the redandwhite post lifted and the jaguar glided slowly past the dragons teeth barbed wire minefields and machine gun towers that fortified the eastern side of the wall where are we now hans whispered swinging south around the city i hope hauer replied would you mind getting your knee out of my balls hans squirmed in the darkness his heart was still racing why didnt that sergeant arrest us steiger and i go back a long way he was with me on the baadermeinhof case that got me my captains bars stormed a house with me but if theres a warrant for our arrest he could be arrested too he knows that but he also knows funk and his kind mealymouthed bureaucrats whove never seen the real berlin never had to face down a crazy kid with a gun steiger asked me if i killed weiss i said no that was enough for him how long will it take us to cross the ddr if we get out of east berlin you mean depends on the old man were taking the long way around but it shouldnt take over two hours to reach the marienbornhelmstedt crossing if we make it well leave the ochses at helmstedt and you can drive us from there hans made an uncertain sound of acknowledgment dont tell me hauer said youve never been to this cabin actually i havent but ill recognize it when we get there ive seen dozens of pictures hauer didnt bother berating hans it was difficult to speak for long in the boot there didnt seem to be much oxygen chapter eleven pm polizoi abschniff west berlin funk set the phone back in its cradle and reached for the bottle of soda water on his desk his hand quivered as he poured i gather pretoria was not amused luhr said softly funk swallowed a huge gulp of soda outraged he gargled said we were a disgrace to the german people was it phoenix himself are you joking his aide or security chief or whatever that diabolical afrikaner calls himself i believe herr smuts is halfgerman prefect and how would you know that that one time he came here in person to our plenary meeting one of his men told me that he was such an efficient security chief because hed got the toughest qualities of both races from his parents the worst qualities if you ask me funk complained the man doesnt have much tact i dont think tact is a major asset in his business luhr said dryly hoping he didnt sound too sarcastic for the time being funk was still his superior in both the police and phoenixs hierarchies and until that changed a brisk knock at the door startled luhr komm funk barked an impeccably uniformed patrolman marched into the office and saluted theres been a murder prefect he announced near the tiergarten funk looked unimpressed so the murdered man sir he was an east german trade liaison hed lived here just four years and the way he was killed sir shot in the head at close range by a makarov pistol the gun was in his own hand like a suicide but a makarov luhr interrupted yes but there were other shots fired at the scene a burst of automaticweapons fire what what was the victims name klaus seeckt herr oberleutnant who do we have on the scene funk interjected a kripo homicide team sir but theyre from the tiergarten district the photographers ours but he didnt get a chance to call until just now leave us funk ordered the officer clicked his boot heels together and marched out what do you make of this funk asked anxiously luhr looked thoughtful i dont know but id better get over there we cant let anything slip until we run hauer down i dont like any of this first the russians barge in here like an invasion force then hauer betrays us then i find steuben taping our calls at theswitchboard and now some east german is murdered with a russianmade pistol what did apfel find at spandau funk frowned worriedly if the russian forensic people are right some type of paper a journal perhaps whatever it is jiirgen phoenix isnt amused do you think steuben could be part of an official investigation one i dont know about something hauer initiated perhaps luhr shook his head steuben was working with hauer but i dont think it went any farther up than that wed have been warned if it did as soon as i get back ill make the bastard own up to the whole thing dont worry were going to bag hauer send phoenix his papers and end up better off than we were before youre probably right funk said wearily he stood ill be at home if you find anything i should know about luhr pulled on his coat and strode into the hall smiling confidently until he closed the door you bumbling fool he thought all you care about is collecting your filthy drug percentages and keeping your mistress happy luhr felt a thrill of secret satisfaction as soon as he had learned of hauers treason and escape he had dispatched some of phoenixs deadliest assets to every possible place hauer or apfel might go to groundfrom the apartment of a woman that hauer spent his weekends with to a remote cabin on the mittelland canal near the east german border and as soon as one of phoenixs killers recovered the spandau papers luhr would step forward and take the credit by tomorrow morning he thought ill have enough to break that fool with phoenix and then berlinone will pass to me to a true german he shoved open the main station door and hulled through the crowd of reporters ignoring all questions he climbed into an unmarked audi and slammed the door in a journalists face those south africans had better be good he muttered as he rewed the cold engine because dieter hauer isnt going to die easily ten minutes after luhr pulled away from the curb ilse apfel trudged through the huge doors of abschnitt and presented herself to the desk sergeant like the reporters outside he mistook her for a prostitute and so ignored her for as long as he could while she waited for him to finish a telephone conversation ilse tried to wipe off the remainder of evas garish makeup with a tissue she did not feel comfortable coming into the station but her choices were limited she could talk either to hanss superiors or to the men in the black bmws twice during her journey here she had spotted the big sedans combing the streets for her but shed managed to evade them at an allnight ubahn cafe she had changed some of evas paper deutschemarks for coins which she used to phone the wolfsburg cabin she had tried every ten minutes for an hour but her grandfather never answered the proprietor had started to frown after her third cup of coffee and ilse decided to get out before he called someone to remove her what can i do for you friiulein the sergeants booming voice startled ilse but she stepped up to his high desk and spoke in her clearest voice im looking for my husband sergeant hans apfel earlier tonight someone told me that he had come here and gone but i think he may have returned could you check for me please the sergeants demeanor changed instantly he jumped from his chair and escorted ilse to an unoccupied desk frau apfel im terribly sorry i kept you waiting please sit down i know your husband personally let me call upstairs im sure someone will know where he is for the first time since seeing the spandau papersver six hours agoilse began to relax she watched the desk sergeant at the telephone drumming his fingers as he waited to speak to someone he smiled back hans has probably straightened everything out already she told herself but he cant be gone the sergeant insisted quietly he the sergeant fell silent as wilhelm funk emerged from a first floor office he dropped the phone so loudly that funk looked his way what is it ross funk barked im in a hurry the desk sergeant cut his eyes toward ilse then crossed the room and interposed funks corpulent body between ilse and himself prefect he whispered the woman sitting behind you is sergeant apfels wife shes come here to find him funks mouth fell open it took all his willpower not to whirl and snatch the woman up by her hair go back to your desk he whispered the sergeant obeyed without a word funk glanced at his watch gauging luhrs probable time of return then he summoned his warmest smile turned and extended his plump hand frau apfel i am wilhelm funk prefect of police i believe your husband was on the spandau prison security detail thrown offbalance by funks lofty rank and his apparent knowledge of her plight ilse stood and put her small hand into his pink paw yes she said yes hans was at spandau have you seen him tonight funks smile broadened i have indeed i questioned him earlier this evening in fact ive been trying to locate him ever since just after hans left the station i remembered something i neglected to ask him simply a formality of course but i try to keep everything proper you understand every thing in its place every paper signed and all that youre looking for hans now yes my dear when sergeant ross told me who you were i hoped you might be able to help us find him but i see that youre as perplexed as we are please let me escort you upstairs i have a temporary office there ill have coffee sent up and perhaps together we can deduce where your husband has gone this is too much to ask funk thought gleefully as he whisked ilse up the stairs the instrument of my deliverance walks straight through my front door with a lecherous look at ilses backside he closed his office door and seated her before his desk frau apfel i wanted to get you in private before i spoke frankly about this may i speak frankly to you in spite of her fatigue ilses adrenaline began to course again facing the supreme police officer of west berlin was a little unnerving about hans she asked warily funk paused appraising the woman before him what did she know and more importantly what did she suspect remembering his unpleasant call to pretoria funk decided to gamble my dear im afraid our hans may be in some trouble what do you mean she asked quickly what kind of trouble when we questioned the officers from the spandau patrol this evening we conducted the proceedings with the aid of a polygraph you know a lie detector i know what they are you have to pass a polygraph test to work at my company ah youre a career woman then yesplease just tell me whats going on why did you use a polygraph funk smiled condescendingly this is a complex matter my dear there are other parties involved funk lowered his voice the russians for instance they were present at this polygraph session im afraid all of our men passed this examination except your husband and a young officer named erhard weiss i know erhard funk thrust out his lower lip i see he glanced at his watch luhr might return any minute naturally he said in a confiding tone i instructed our lygraph operator to make no sign if any of our men failed we even took the precaution of preparing clean reports from several men before the interrogation began glasnost may be the flavor of the month but we cant have a pack of russians barging in here and demanding access to german officers im sure you understand ilse nodded uncertainly funk took a deep breath now for the gamble as soon as wed cleared the russians out i questioned weiss ai your husband alone weiss had nothing to tell i believe simple nervousness caused him to fail the test but hansfunk pausedhans told me that he had discovered something at spandau just as the russians claimed he said that he had removed it to a safe place ilse buried her face in her hands the insane events of this night had become too much to bear if she had been less tired perhaps she might have been more suspicious but the prefect seemed to know everything already and he wanted to help her find hans raising her head she looked funk in the eye and posed a single test question what did hans tell you he found she asked her redrimmed eyes lockd on his bluff face funk didnt hesitate he assumed the soviet forensic people knew their business why papers my dear he said nonchalantly when hans left the station he assured me he was going to retrieve them but as you can seefunk flicked his palms toward the ceilinghe has yet to return ilse stifled a sob it was no use she had to trust someone c e a e try as she might to control herself the tears am re the russians looking for hans too she asked for the papers gott im himmel funk felt his heart thud in triumph it was papers im not sure he replied trying to hold his voice steady its possible why do you ask because they came to my apartment she blurted they were looking for hans i know it i almost didnt get away my god ive done it funk thought wildly i have her rising to his feet he hurried around the desk and sat beside ilse like a concerned father he clasped both her hands in his and patted them reassuringly now now child he consoled her well find hans dont worry we have thousands of men at our disposal just calm down and tell me everything everything from the very beginning ilse did am british sector west berlin by the time jiirgen luhr arrived at the murder scene the forensic team had repacked its equipment and stacked it beside the front door a uniformed patrolman guarded the door against any prowling pressmen who might arrive chainsmoking technicians rubbed the sleep from their eyes and cursed the man who had the nerve to be killed in the middle of the night the man of the hour lay wrapped in the polyurethane bag that would be his sole vestment until someone came forward to claim him for it was murderanyone could see that the attempt to disguise the shooting as a suicide had been clumsy at best everyone agreed or almost everyone detective schneider hadnt said anything yet naturally luhr approached a thin man who sat on a sofa fiddling with a camera whos in charge here he asked in a clipped tone detective schneider said the man without looking up from his camera hes in the back im lieutenant luhr the prefect sent me to inquire into this matter funks title brought the photographer to his feet its about time you got here he whispered who is the dead man luhr asked his passport says klaus seeckt occupation he worked in some kind of liaison capacity for the west berlin governmentsomething to do with trade from the looks of this place he didnt do much but cash his checks and stay around the house theres a threequarterinch video camera in the back bedroom ill bet this guy made some interesting movies back there who discovered the body luhr broke in annoyed by the photographers prurient speculation a patrolman hes gone already though an old couple next door heard the shooting and called it in they didnt see anything they never do do they said liihr trying to foster some comradely spirit have you found anything significant flattered to be asked his opinion the photographer drew himself to his full height well its pretty clear this was no suicide at least to me we dug eight slugs out of the front wall they came from some kind of automatic weapon fresh prints everywhere too at least three people besides the victim were here tonight we cant know exactly what happened of course but i dont see this fellow deciding to commit suicide just because someone broke into his house i think he surprised a gang of thievesprosand they killed him with his own gun then they panicked put the gun in his hand and ran any sign of forced entry no like i said pros luhr cracked a knuckle joint yes thats what you said what type of bullets were fired from the automatic weapon millimeter brand unknown didnt find any shell casings luhr smiled skeptically lets summarize your theory shall we your burglars break in without leaving a trace when the owner surprises them they panic and kill himleaving fingerprints everywhereyet in their panic they stop to hunt down eight shell casings ejected from an automatic weapon fired in the heat of the moment rather contradictory actions wouldnt you say the photographer frowned and rubbed his chin i dont know they make those attachments now that fit right onto your weapon they catch every shell you can pump out a bit exotic for housebreakers dont you think luhr glanced around the room anything else well there was in fact detective schneider found a card outside in the snow near the walkway it didnt have anything on it but a number a telephone number luhrs eyes narrowed where is this card now i dont know if its still here schneider would have it hes in the back as luhr stepped down onto the small stone terrasse a bearish man wearing a hat and a rumpled raincoat waded into the pool of yellow light thrown off by a dim spotlight above the glass doors the man stopped when he saw luhr taking in the silver lieutenants bars stchedflat uniform and gleaming boots what can i do for you lieutenant he asked warily detective schneider i presume the big man nodded i am here as the unofficial representative of the prefect he has expressed an interest in this case as the murdered man apparently has some tie to the east german government the prefect fears that there might be repercussions you understand detective schneider waited for the lieutenant to ask what he had come outside to ask he didnt like the way luhrs arrogant little mouth softened his classic nordic face or the eyes he thought rapists eyes the photographer tells me that you discovered a card on the premises a card with only a telephone number where is this card now i didnt actually find it schneider said slipping his right hand into his trouser pocket patrolman ebert did schneider fingered the white card and watched luhrs face im not sure where it is now i had it but i think officer beck asked me for it hes still here i believe what have you got in your pocket luhr asked sharply schneider slowly withdrew his hand he held the brass gorget plate and chain that identified him as a kripo detective with a hiss of frustration luhr went in search of officer beck as soon as he disappeared schneider pulled a ballpoint pen from his shirt pocket and copied the number from the card onto the palm of his hand then he followed luhr into the house lieutenant he called herr lieutenant luhr barrelled back through the front door his face flushed with anger im sorry lieutenant schneider shook his head as if he were a fool and knew it that card was in my coat pocket all the time i could have sworn i gave it to beck here you are luhr snatched the card officer beck says he never asked you for the card schneider continued shaking his head must have been somebody else i tell you past midnight and my mind just goes i suggest detective luhr said acidly that you either get more sleep or look for a new line of work have you had anyone trace this number yet no sir not yet ill handle it then while luhr stalked out to his unmarked audi schneider stood in the foyer and scratched his large head something had felt wrong about this case from the moment he walked in the door while everyone else had gone on about the sloppiness of the murder schneider had kept silent twenty minutes later the nameless card had turned up and now this nazilooking lieutenant had appearedthe prefects aide no lessto spirit that card away schneider couldnt remember ever having seen luhr at a crime scene before that bothered him he hurried past the few technicians left outside the house and climbed into his battered opel kadett telephone he murmured as he cranked the old car jiirgen luhr had beat him to it as schneider rounded the corner of levetzow and bachstrasse he spied the prefects aide standing at a corner call box schneider slowed then drove on maddeningly shut out of the conversation passing through the wires just over his head frau funk luhr asked when a woman answered im sorry to disturb you so late this is jijrgen luhr could i speak with the prefect please but he was leaving the station luhr broke the connection and punched in the number of abschnitt berlintwo he snapped the prefect immediately a full minute passed before funk came on the line his voice smug and unruffled in contrast to its earlier panic yes jiirgen ive found something odd at the tiergarten house a card with nothing but a phone number on it we should trace it immediately the crime looked very suspicious evidence of automatic weapons fire conflicting signs of amateurishness and professionalism i think our brothers in uniform may have been there how interesting said funk why dont you come back to the station and well discuss your theory whats the matter is someone with you a pause there was someone here jijrgen sergeant ross just took her downstairs to her new accommodations her who are you talking aboutt the wife of one of our brothers in uniform as you put it a frau ilse apfel she walked into the station just after you left she had a most interesting story to tell what the sergeants wife thats right i understand the situation much better after talking to her i suggest you get back here jiirgen if you want to be in on this at all ive already spoken to pretoria i received some very interesting orders and they involve you luhr left the receiver dangling from the call box and dashed to his car he squealed down the bachstrasse in a rage damn that imbecile how could he be so lucky he screeched around a curve its all right he assured himself calming a little he hasnt found hauer or apfel yet or the spandau papers and thats what phoenix wantswhat hes frightened of and that distinction will be mine in his fury luhr failed to notice the burly figure of detective julius schneider standing at a yellow call box four blocks from the one he had used to place his own call unlike luhr schneider wasnt about to try to trace the mysterious phone number through normal channels an inquiry in his own name might draw unpleasant attention possibly even the prefects and schneider didnt need that besides he had always believed in taking the shortest route between two points reading the telephone number off the palm of his hand he lifted the receiver and punched in the digits he heard five rings then a click followed by the familiar hiss and crackle of an automated answering machine this is harry richardson said a metallic voice im out friends can leave a message at the tone if youre a salesperson dont call back if its a military matter call my office the previous message will be repeated in german thank you schneider waited until the german version of the message had finished then hung up his pulse normally as steady as a hibernating bears was racing schneider knew who harry richardson was hed even met him once american intelligence officers who took the time to cultivate investigators of the kriminalpolizei were rare enough to remember schneider doubted if richardson would remember him but that didnt matter what mattered was that an american army officer was somehow involved in what was fast shaping up to be an explosive murder case schneider took several deep breaths and forced himself to think slowly hed found richardsons card outside the victims house but there had been blood all around it what did that mean and what should he do he thought of the prefects insolent aide and the overly officious manner that in schneiders experience spelled coverup with sudden insight schneider realized that he now stood at one of those crossroads that can change a mans life forever he could get into his car and go home to his wife and his warm beda course of action almost any sane german would chooseor he could make the call that he suspected would pluck him from his old life like the wind sweeps a seed from the ground god he murmured godfrey rose schneider jumped into his car and fired the engine thirty minutes ago he had been mildly intrigued by the nights events now his mind ran wild with speculation electrified by the smell of the kind of chase he had become a detective for in the first place squealing away from the curb he made an illegal uturn and headed east on the budapester strasse making for the tiergarten station he hoped his english was up to the task chapter twelve am veipke frg near the east german border professor natterman swung the rattling audi back toward the frontier and pushed the old sedan to kilometers per hour now that the end of his harrowing journey approached he could not keep from rushing the speed was exhilarating the protesting whine of the tires as he leaned the car into the curves kept his fatigued mind alert thank god for old friends he thought a boyhood churn had come through for him tonight providing the audi with no questions asked thankfully the mysterious englishman who had accidentally stumbled into his compartment had disappeared natterman hadnt seen him again on the train nor at helmstedt when the few passengers disembarked a few times during the last hour he had caught sight of headlights in the blackness far behind him but they came and went so frequently that he wrote them off to nervousness as the audi jounced over the railroad linking gardelegan to wolfsburg the professor spied the eerie neverdimming glow of the sprawling factory city to the west the sight startled him still when he was a boy wolfsburg had been a tiny village of less than a hundred its few houses scattered hodgepodge around the old feudal castle but when the volkswagen works came there in the village had been transformed almost overnight into an industrial metropolis he could scarcely believe his fathers tiny cabin still remained in the quiet forest northeast of the city it had been eleven months since he last visited the cabin but he knew that karl riemeck a local laborer and old family retainer would have both the grounds and the house in fine shape the thought of spending some time in the old place had almost blotted out the wild theories whirling through nattermans weary brain almost as he roared down the narrow road cut through the deep forest visions of notorious and celebrated faces from the past flickered in his mind like pitted newsreels hitler and churchill the duke of windsor stalin joseph p kennedy the american ambassador to wartorn britain a nazi appeaser and father of a future u s president lord halifax the nerveless british foreign secretary and secret foe of churchill those smiling faces now seemed to conceal uncharted worlds of deception worlds waiting to be mapped by an intrepid explorer the thrill of impending discovery coursed through the old historians veins like a powerful narcotic infusing him with youthful vigor he eased off the gas as he crossed the mittelland canal bridge again he had arrived at the impenetrable core of the mystery what were the british hiding if hesss double had flown to britain to play a diversionary role what was he diverting attentionfrom why had the real hess flown to britain to meet englishmen of course his mind answered but which englishmen with a pang of professional jealousy natterman thought of the oxford historians who were documenting the pronazi sympathies of over thirty members of the wartime british parliament whom they believed had known about hesss flight beforehand the gossip in academic circles was that the oxford men believed these mps were nazi appeasers enemies of churchill whom hess had flown secretly to britain to meet natterman wasnt so sure he had no doubt that an apparently prohitler clique of upperclass englishmen existed in the real question was did those men really intend to betray their country by forging an unholy alliance with adolf hitler or was there a deeper more noble motive for their behavior the answer to this lay in hitlers war plans the fuhrers ultimate goal had always been the conquest of russiathe acquisition of lebensraum for the german peoplewhich made him very popular with certain elements of british society for despite being at war with germany many englishmen saw the nazi state as an ideal buffer against the spread of communism similarly the fuhrer had visions of germany and england united in an aryan front against communist russia hitler had never really believed that the english would fight him yet when winston churchill refused to accept the inevitable surrender to and alliance with germany the fuhrer got angry and there natterman believed lay the basis of rudolf hesss mission hitler had assigned himself a very strict timetable for barbarossahis invasion of the soviet union he believed that if he did not invade russia by stalins red army would gain an overwhelming superiority over him in men and materiel that meant that to be successful his invasion armies had to jump off eastward by may of at the latest before the snows melted and made the effective use of tanks impossible and the british natterman remembered had known this an raf group captain named f w winterbotham had worked it out in and this knowledgeorrectly exploitedould have given the british a peculiar kind of advantage for the longer they could fool hitler into believing they wanted a negotiated peace the longer they could stave off an invasion of britain and the nearer would draw the date when hitler would have to redeploy the bulk of his armies eastward if hitler could be fooled long enough england would be spared but had those pronazi englishmen understood that in nattennan wondered were they altruistic patriots who had lured rudolf hess to britain on a fools errand and thus saved their homeland from the nazis or were they traitors who had decided adolf hitler was a man they could deal witha bit of a boor perhaps but with sound policies visavis the communists and jews the answer seemed simple enough if a group of powerful englishmen had merely pretended to treat with hitler in order to save britain they would be heroes and would require no protection from public scrutiny especially fifty years after the fact however the welldocumented efforts of the british government to suppress the details of the hess case tended to reinforce the opposite theory that those englishmen really had been admirers of hitler and fascism the variable that confused this logic was a human wild cardedward viii duke of windsor former prince of wales and abdicated king of england the dukes progerman sympathies and contact with the nazisboth before and during the warwere documented and very embarrassing facts at the very least windsor had made a fool of himself by visiting hitler and all the top nazis in germany then trumpeting the fuhrers achievements to a shocked world at worst he had committed treason against the country he was born to rule after his stormy abdication the duke living in neutral spain had pined away for the throne he had so lightly abandoned startling evidence unearthed in indicated that in july of windsor had slipped secretly into neutral lisbon to meet a top nazi where they explored the option of windsors return to the english throne and that natterman thought excitedly was the core of it all because according to british historian peter allen the nazi whom windsor had sneaked into portugal to meet had been none other than rudolf hess natterman gripped the wheel tighter a clear picture had begun to emerge from the blurred background of speculation he could see it now while hitlers british sympathizers may have been feigning sympathy for the nazis in order to save england the duke of windsor most definitely was not and if windsor had committed treasonr even come closethat was the kind of royal peccadillo that the british secret service would be forced to conceal suppressing the entire hess story the heroism as well as the treason natterman felt his heart thump a fourth and stunning possibility had just occurred to him what if the british traitors really were pronazi but had been allowed to pursue their treachery by an even more devious british intelligence that way the nazis could not possibly have picked up on any deception because the conspirators themselves would not have been aware that they were part of one nattermans mind reeled at the implications he tried to focus on that uncertain timethe spring of but his memories seemed foggy misted at the edges somehow his brain contained so many fragments of history that he was no longer sure what he had merely read about and what he had actually lived through he had lived through so much more books he thought thats what i need now documentation ill have ilse stop at the university library on her way here ill make a list as soon as i get to the house churchills memoirs speers book copies of reich documents a sample of hesss handwriting ill need all that for even a preliminary study of the document and eventually the ink the paper itselfnatterman hit the brakes bringing the audi to a sliding stop he had reached the cabin he turned slowly onto the narrow snowpacked lane that wound through the forest to the cabin when the familiar flicker of a lantern appeared in the darkness ahead he smiled and watched it wink in and out of sight as he negotiated the last few curves as he pulled the car into the small turnaround beside the cabin he decided to invite karl riemeck up for a schnapps tomorrow the old caretaker had obviously taken the trouble to drive out here and light a lamp for him and natterman suspected he would also find a good supply of firewood laid by for his convenience deciding to retrieve his suitcase later he halted his heavy book satchel over his shoulder and climbed out of the audi the cold practically pushed him up onto the cabin porch where he found a weeks supply of oak logs stacked on a low iron rack thank you karl he murmured this is no night for old men like us to go without heat on impulse he tried the knob the door swung open soundlessly you think of everything old friend he said shivering i come to the door with a burden and must i search for my key no all is prepared for me switching on the electric lightswhich the cabin had done without until he saw that the main room looked just as it always had not too small but cozy lived in nattermans father had liked it that way no false opulence just rough comfort in the old ways built of birch and native oak the cabin felt more solid today than it had when natterman was a boy he tossed his satchel on a worn leather chair and walked back out to the porch adjusting his eyes to the darkness he stared out through the forest up the dark access road searching for the glimmer of headlights but he saw none he gathered as much wood as he could hold carried it into the cabin and stacked it carefully in the rack beside the fireplace then he placed two wellsplit logs on the castiron rack dropped to his knees and began to build a small pyramid of twigs beneath them just as his father had taught him to do six decades before though his brain still simmered in anticipation of uninterrupted study of the spandau papers the familiar ritual calmed him when his pyramid stood ready to be lit he searched the hearth for matches but found none rising with a groan he padded over to the woodstove that occupied an entire alcove in the rear of the front room along with a walkin pantry this antique constituted the cabins kitchen here also the professor had no luck muttering quietly he recrossed room and opened the bedroom door when he saw what lay beyond his chest muscles contracted with a force he thought would burst his heart on the bed directly before him bound to the brass bedframe with a thick leather belt karl riemeck stared sightlessly ahead his face contorted in a mask of rage incomprehension and pain a huge freshly clotted stain of blood blossomed on the caretakers chest like an obscene flower natterman became as a child his bowels boiled urine dribbled into his trousers he desperately wanted to run but he had no idea where safety lay he whirled back toward the main room empty and pristine as a magazine photograph unable to focus on karl he stumbled to the front door and locked it my god my god my god he muttered bending over and putting his hands on his knees my god his chant was a mantra an incantation a way to begin thinking a way back to reality forcing down the wave of bile that struggled to erupt from his throat the old professor stood erect and strode back into the bedroom to see if he could do anything for his friend he ignored the gore that matted the shirt and placed his hand directly over karls heart still natterman had expected nothing he knew death when he saw it perhaps it was the shock of karls death that dulled nattermans instincts blinding him to further danger perhaps it was fatigue but when the cold hand reached from beneath the bed and locked itself around his spindly ankle he froze he opened his mouth to scream but no sound came again his brain shut itself off against reality the iron claw jerked his feet from under him he crashed to the floor like a sack of kindling certain that his hip was broken moaning in pain and terror he tried to crawl toward the doorway but strong arms caught his shoulders and spun him onto his back when his eyes focused a flashing silver blade filled almost his entire field of vision beyond it he saw only a mane of blond hair he tried to breathe but an anvil seemed to have settled on his chest when the pressure eased slightly then moved higher he realized the anvil was a mans knee you have something i want old man the words were quick and angry the voice flint against stone the knee pressed down so hard into nattermans chest that he could not have spoken if he wanted to answer me the man screamed thats not a british accent natterman thought with relief his mind on the safety of the spandau papers thank god its only a robbera rvbber who has killed karl the professors brain raced through its knowledge of languages trying to place the unfamiliar accent but to no avail dutch maybe the blond man flicked the blade back and forth in a lethal dance then inserted the point deep into nattermans left nostril dont be stubborn like your friend old man it cost him what little life he had left now talk the pressure eased a little take whatever you want natterman rasped my god poor karl pool karl you idiot you know what i want speak where is it for another moment nattennans mind resisted then he knew as impossible as it seemed this murderer knew his secret he knew about the spandau papers and he had managed to beat natterman hereto his fathers houseto steal them oh god natterman whispered oh no no the blond man sneered but i dont know what liar in a rage the killer jerked his knife up and outward severing the old mans left nostril in a spray of blood tears filled nattermans eyes temporarily blinding him a warm rush of blood flooded over his lips and chin he coughed and gurgled struggling for air listen you jew maggot youre nothing to me the killer put his lips to nattermans ear and lowered his voice to a deadly whisper if you dont signal your agreement to cooperate in five seconds im going to sever your carotid artery do you understand thats the pipeline to your addled brain to validate his threat the killer jabbed the point of his knife into the soft skin beneath nattermans left ear choking horribly on his own blood natterman tried to nod youll show me where its hidden natterman nodded again spitting up frothy red foam the killer hauled him to his feet as easily as he would a dead branch he took out a white handkerchief and thrust it toward the professors streaming wound direct pressure he muttered natterman nodded stanching the flow surprised at even this small gesture of humanity the man before him looked scarcely thirty the long mane of blond hair gave him a starvingstudent look that the professor knew well a handsome face lit by zealots eyes now the killer said softly show it to me natterman turned back to the bed where karls body lay he began to sob as the enormity of what had happened struck him for gods sake old man dont fall apart on me your friend stuck himself into this business and wouldnt clear off he forced me come into the other room like a drone natterman followed the killer into the front room with his face partially masked by the bloody handkerchief he tried frantically to think of a way out of his predicament chess he thought suddenly its just like a game of chess but played to the death dont think you idiot show me where it is now the blond killer stood two meters from natterman but when he thrust the knife forward he halved the distance with fearful effect natterman dropped the bloodsoaked handkerchief on the floor and began to fumble with the buttons of his shirt what are you doing fool its taped to my back natterman explained for a moment the man looked confused then his face resumed its tight grimace well then he said uncertainly be quick about it my god thought natterman he doesnt know what hes looking for he was sent by someone else who how did they connect me with hans and the papers shaking with terror the professor stripped the foilwrapped bundle from his back he felt as if three layers of skin had come up with the tape i must survive he told himself survive to learn the truth i must distract him now said the killer walk forward slowly and hand it to me natterman tossed the taped bundle across the room it landed on the floor and slid partially under a heavy cabinet that stood in the corner you cracked bastard pick it up and bring it here natterman hesitated for a moment then slowly walked to the cabinet bent over retrieved the bundle just like chess he thought i movehe moves hand it to me natterman extended the packet watching curiously as several drops of blood fell from his nose onto his twitching biceps i must be in shock he realized im watching someone else keeping his eyes on natterman the killer stripped the tape from the foil that the professor had used to protect the papers carefully natterman pleaded theyre very delicate is this all there is natterman shrugged thats it is this all you filthy yid the killer shook the papers in the air afrikaans blurted a voice in nattennans brain the accent is afrikaner but why does the animal think im jewish i swear thats all there is he said please be careful thats a very important document as natterman spoke he let his eyes wander toward his book satchel it lay exactly where he had tossed it when he came inon the leather chair by the door he stared for a moment then looked quickly back at the intruder again you lie the afrikaner cried if i find something else in that bag old man youre dead natterman stood by the corner cabinet silently he willed the killer toward the satchel toward the chair holding his knife out in front of him the afrikaner backed slowly toward the satchel just a little further natterman thought a little further the killer averted his eyes as he reached for the satchelnow natterman groped in the space between the cabinet and the wall and closed his hand aroufid the big mannlicher shotgun that had stood there for over sixty years the shotgun his father had always kept out of the way yet within easy reach if a deer wandered into the clearing or poachers encroached on his land the professor cocked both hammers as he brought the weapon up and fired the moment the barrels cleared the back of the couch the killer dived for cover behind the leather chair but not quickly enough twentyfour pellets of doubleaught buck shot tore through his right shoulder leaving his upper arm a mass of pulp and bone that hung from his torso by sinew alone the bloody knife that had butchered karl riemeck clattered to the floor its owner blown out of sight behind the chair bastard natterman screamed never in his life had he wanted to kill another human beingnot even in the war but now a rage of terrifying power surged through him as his stinging eyes probed the outline of the chair for a clear shot the afrikaner knelt motionless behind the chair thinking he had known pain before and he knew that to give in to it meant death silently he seized the door handle with his good arm and jerked inward his shattered shoulder seared with pain his agonized scream filled the small cabin as he fought to stay conscious an almostforgotten voice shouted from the depths of his brain move soldier move and move he did in seconds he had scrambled alligatorstyle through the doorway dragging his useless arm behind pulling the door shut with his foot as he passed through he flopped off the porch into the snow just as the second blast from nattermans shotgun splintered the lower quarter of the oak door i should have known the afrikaner thought furiously should have anticipated i underestimated the old bastard he had a mm automatic in his car but hed parked his car in the woods beyond the clearing hed never make it not if the old man could see at all in desperation he swept away a hummock of snow and rolled beneath the cabin into icy blackness above him professor natterman rooted hysterically through the cabinet in search of extra shotgun shells there i beneath an overturned wicker basket he found a full box of twelvegauge shells he broke the breech of the antique weapon removed the empties chambered two shells jammed the gun closed and cocked both ammers then he bolted the splintered oak door the papers he thought suddenly the afrikaner had them in a panic he searched the cabin for the onionskin pages but saw none no his mind screamed he cannot have them crazed with rage he blasted another hole in the door then unbolted it and shoved it open just outside crumpled and matted in a huge smear of blood lay six of the nine spandau pages natterman darted outside and frantically gathered them up then scanned the snow for the other pages he saw none furious he staggered back into the cabin and snatched up the tinfoil that had protected the papers he wrapped it carefully back around the bloodstained pages then stuffed the foil packet deep into his pocket the exertion had broken loose the clot in his nose blood poured down his bare chest the animal must have a gun he thought wildly he must he wouldnt have come with just the knife natterman seized his shirt and jacket from the floor and stumbled into the bedroom where karl still stared sightless at the door aaarrrgh he roared in anguish it took almost all his remaining strength to drag the linen chest from the foot of the bed and wedge it against the bedroom door when he had blocked it as well as he could he picked up the telephone beside the bed dead as karl he thought bitterly pinching his bloody nostrils closed he surveyed the room a washstand a chair an old pine armoire his fathers bed beside the window the window even as natterman realized his vulnerability he saw a pale hand working just over the sill trying to force the glass upward he obliterated the window with a doublebarreled blast gibbering like a madman as he did the stress had finally overcome him like a drunkard he staggered over to the armoire and heaved and pushed until finally it slid across the gaping window then he collapsed in a heap against it not even trying to stop the blood that continued to plop onto his heaving chest his last act before he fainted was to chamber two more rounds into the mannlicher am the northern transvaal republic of south africa alfred horn sat hunched in his motorized wheelchair his prehensile forearms pressing a leopardskin rug against his arthritic knees and stared into the fire as always his mind raced back and forth between past and present searching for causes and connections cataloguing injustices to be avenged perhaps it was his advanced years but to horn the present seemed merely a small space between two doorsone leading back into a past he could not changethe other opening onto a future that after five decades of planning and struggle and living with defeat promised the fulfillment of ultimate destiny time was short he knew and growing shorter did he have a week or a month before his ability to leave his imprint upon the world was stolen from him he needed a month how ironic he reflected that his knowledge of the past posed the greatest threat to his plans for the future but he was nearly ready a soft knock sounded behind him he answered without turning his gaze from the fire yes the door opened soundlessly smuts stood silently at attention what news from berlin pieter theres a flurry of british and russian intelligence activity sir im almost certain they have not located the papers no sign so far of israeli involvement but what of our two policemen pieter they have the papers sir berlinone informs me that while he has not yet captured the young man whom he believes found the papers he does have custody of the mans wife horn pondered this intelligence at length he said we shall have them all here bring the woman the man will follow send a jet tonight ive already ordered it done sir good can the husband be reached by phone smuts cleared his throat we havent located him yet sir while horns glass eye remained immobile his good eye flickered with birdlike suspicion over his security chiefs lanky frame finally settling on his craggy face under its unrelenting gaze smuts shifted his weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other pieter horn asked finally yes sir our two policemen have escaped from west berlin havent they to smutss credit he did not dissimulate that appears likely sir the older manhauerapparently has a great deal of influence in berlin we have a man waiting at their last known destinationa cabin near wolfsburgbut he hasnt reported in horn toyed with a poker in the stand these policemen are proving to be a credit to their race pieter after youve drawn them here we must see what our young friend has dug from the rubble of spandau it will be done tell me how will you convince the young husband that you have his wife if you havent reached him by the time shes airborne smuts suppressed a smile horns attention to the smallest details of an operation constantly surprised him a simple matter really sir he explained audio recordings on two separate tape machines prerecorded affirmatives and negatives to be used as needed with a short statement to open the exchange with adequate noise reduction the results are quite convincing excellent pieter im pleased smutss boot heels cracked like a muffled pistol shot horn unconsciously picked at the stippled scar tissue around his glass eye ive been thinking pieter i want you to shut down all our drug and weapons trading for the time being i want no roads leading from the outside world to here smuts nodded very good sir we do have that shipment of gold coming from colombia though payment for our ether two million dollars in bullion its coming by ship and the ship is almost here horn considered this well let her land then but everything else shuts down yes sir when the policemans wife arrives bring her directly to me its so seldom i get a chance to meet young germans anymore i should like very much to speak with her meet her but sir the risks nonsense pieter if you are present what are the risks smuts nodded as you command horn eyed smuts appraisingly anything else beg your pardon sir horn frowned the radiation leak you failed to update me on your progress smuts colored im sorry sir ive been meeting with the engineers about the runway extension he raised his fore arm and read the time from the inside of his wrist the leak was contained as of two hours ago minimal exposure to personnel the basement lab is clean any word on our cobalt case no sir im sorry all right pieter dismissed sir again the boots fired and smuts disappeared in spite of his frustration horn smiled wistfully a jungfrau he thought a true daughter of the fatherland my god how long has it been since i spoke with a german woman who wasnt raised in this savage country pieter he called suddenly smuts raced back into the room a beretta pistol in his hand im sorry horn apologized i spoke too loudly more wood for the fire thats all my joints are driving me mad smuts holstered his weapon yes sir without hesitation a man who had commanded troops with distinction across half the african continent marched to a woodpile less than a yard from his employers chair added a fresh log to the fire and stoked the flames beneath it hows that sir fine pieter fine horn slumped back into his padded wheelchair and there motionless until dawn slept the sleep of the saved aw togel airfield west berlin wing tanks full the pump jockey said screwing down the tank cap he scurried down the hydraulic ladder and onto the tarmac of the fueling area on account he asked handsomely dressed in a tailored gray suit lieutenant jijrgen luhr nodded curtly then marched up the ramp that fed into the belly of the sleek lear turbojet on the plush carpeted floor of the passenger cabin trussed from head to toe with industrial tape ilse apfel struggled desperately to breathe try to relax frau apfel luhr said the trip will be much more comfortable for us both with great difficulty ilse inclined her head toward the blond policeman and glared she hoped defiance would mask the abject terror squirming in her stomach one hour ago she had been forced to watch this insane lieutenant drag a knife across the throat of sergeant josef steuben ilse had never met steuben but she had vomited from sheer horror and beneath the horror she cursed herself for her stupidity how could she have walked right into the arms of these ruthless animals its useless to struggle luhr advised i would have preferred more subtle measures myself but im told that our host is opposed to the use of drugs quite ironic considering the source of some of his income luhr tapped a small syringe against his armrest im sure this has all been a shock to you he said but its only the result of your husbands stupidity however in spite of thatand for reasons quite beyond my understandingyou as well as are to be granted a great opportunity tomorrow were going to meet the man who owns this jet it is a great honor luhr chuckled to himself or so ive been led to believe the walls of the lear thrummed as the engines spooled up for the taxi run still he said i dont think we need all that constricting tape ilse struggled harder luhr grinnedyoure sure you wouldnt like a little sedative we have a long flight ahead he stood carefully holding his head sideways beneath the low cabin ceiling he towered over ilse on the floor although he said heavily i think we might arrange some interesting inflight diversions as if about to relieve himself luhr unzipped his trousers and withdrew a large uncircumcised penis while ilse stared in disgust he tugged himself eagerly watching her reaction she wasnt frightened by the sight of his organmost berlin girls have seen their share of male anatomyit was his eyes in a single instant all humanity had gone out of them as the grunting lieutenant rulled at himself his blue eyes burned not with lust but with blind furious hatred jiirgen luhr wanted to do more than rape ilsehe anted to kill herto rape her to death if he could she shut her eyes tight and forced her mind away from this place back to a time just after she and hans were married they had gone to munich to visit hanss mother at a small pfahlbauten on the long silver lake outside the city frau jaspers ne apfel had een bitchy but hans and ilse had spent hours together on the water paddling a small boat and you think you can handle this luhr rasped brandishing his organ youre going to get it ways you never even dreamed about suddenly the plane lurched forward luhr lost his balance and fell back into his seat laughing wildly ilse struggled in vain against the tape trapped like a living mummy putting himself back into his trousers luhr leaned back in his seat and sighed deeply plenty of time for that he muttered the madness had faded from his eyes he leisurely raised a gleaming boot and prodded ilses bottom then laughed again the learjet reached its assigned runway and paused engines shuddering pointed east like a porcelain arrow the legend on its tail read lasertek but this company was merely a tiny division in the labyrinthine network of subsidiaries owned by horn intercomm a holding company on the outer edges of a vast but nebulous corporate entity known as phoenix ag this familial relationship was symbolized by a small design painted on the nosecone of the lear the single gracefully curved blood red eye stared down the runway from the port side of the lear with a strange awareness as if it and not the pilot would guide the plane on its long journey south inside the pressurized cabin luhr held ilse in place with his boot as the jet screamed into the night sky the flight plan filed in the tegel tower designated the lear as flight destination london but as soon as the sleek jet faded from tegels main radar screen it would dive and race southward to a remote airfield in turkey another subsidiary of phoenix ag maintained extensive holdings in the antalya province among them a surprisingly wellequipped airstrip on a farm near dashar this company fostered extremely cordial relations with the provincial government officials who often made use of phoenix jets to take factfinding excursions to the pleasure capitals of europe after the lear left dashar it would no longer have a right number or plan and its destination would be a matter into which only the most uninformed would inquire the grasp of the reclusive president and ceo of phoenix ag corporation was known to be very long indeed chapter thirteen am near woltsbarg frg thats it hans cried whipping his head around for a better look you passed it hauer hit the brakes thats what you said two minutes ago im sure this time reluctantly hauer shifted the jaguar into reverse why here its just another break in the trees another deadend road in the dark no this is the place were between two hills and that low bridge back there this is it hauer released the clutch pedal and backed the car into position to turn the jaguar shot forward he accelerated down the winding drive at twice the speed natterman had squinting ahead through the darkness for any sign of an occupied dwelling i dont see any lights he said skeptically maybe theyre sleeping jus hauer looked across at hans your wife has t escaped from the kgb she has no idea where you are and you think shes sleeping watch out hauer slammed his boot down on the brake just as the jaguar broke into the small clearing around the cabin the car hit a sheet of ice spun degrees and skated toward the building it crashed into the trunk of a plane tree just meters from the porch crumpling the jaguars offside wing the motor died but the headlights still shone off into the darkness to the right of the cabin this better be the place hauer mumbled shaking his head to clear the fog of impact hans stuck his head through the shattered passenger widow and compared what he saw to his mental image of his wifes family retreat this is it he said quietly he turned to hauer why were you driving so goddamn fast hauer bit back a sharp retort he halfexpected them to find the bloody remains of ilse and her grandfather inside the cabin just knock on the door he said evenly hans muttered angrily as he struggled with the unfamiliar door handle not even trying to conceal his exasperation ilse he shouted its me hans just as hans popped the door open it hammered him back into the car he did not even hear the booming explosion that resounded through the forest get down hauer bellowed his warning was lost as the front windshield shattered in a storm of flying glass shotgun hans down hans had hunkered down on the floor when a third blast shredded the leather upholstery above his head the fourth missed the jaguar altogether hauer grabbed his walther from beneath the seat and jerked back the slide wait hans pleaded grabbing his arm ilse wouldnt know this car he kicked open the shotriddled door ilse professor its hans this time he saw the fire leap from the muzzles the twin barrels exploded simultaneously shearing off the frozen branches hanging low over the car hans ducked behind the jags door professor your father alfred was a blacksmith he built this house in you helped him make the nails silence now youre thinking hauer said the splintered cabin door creaked open slightly hans rasped a voice almost too weak to hear hans is that you dont shoot professor im coming out gingerly he raised his hands above the car door and waved then he put a foot onto the packedsnow and slowly raised himself into nattermans line of sight i cant see you natterman called step into the light painfully aware of the loaded weapon pointed at his chest hans eased forward into the twin beams hans the voice was louder now the relief in it obvious are you alone no i have he looked back at hauer in the jag i have my captain with me there was a long pause do you trust him for the hundredth time that night hans examined his feelings about his father did he trust him hauer could just as easily be a member of the fanatical societies whose meetings he described as no hans slammed that door shut in his mind if dieter hauer could contemplate killing a brother officer and kidnapping his own sons wife the whole world had turned upside down i trust him he called hinges screeched as natterman pushed open the cabin door he slumped to his knees all right he croaked thats the old man fell flat on his face his empty shotgun beside him hans sprinted up onto the porch and bent over him hauer stayed in the jaguar his walther extended covering the porch and the clearing as best he could professor hans cried shaking him roughly where is ilse i got him the old man mumbled i think hans slapped him then again harder he saw crusted blood around nattermans disfigured nose but he had too much at stake to wait where is ilse professor where is ilse did the people who attacked you take her hans turned to the open door ilse not not here natterman mumbled home i think yes his voice gained strength shes at the apartment hans coming here later tried to call but oh god hans shivered as the implication of nattermans ramblings struck him oh no captain help me get him into the house hauer scrambled out of the car he backed up onto the porch keeping the pistol pointed at the woods as he moved shes not here hans told him shes not here take his legs hauer ordered grabbing the old man under the arms he had to keep hans moving keep his mind on something besides his wife until there was time to analyze the situation they laid natterman on the sofa in the front room hauer sent hans to fill a sock with snow then tried his best to determine the seriousness of the professors wound cleaning it started the bleeding againwhich seemed incredible given the amount of blood splattered throughout the cabinbut the frozen compress stanched the flow nicely hauer substituted adhesive tape for sutures fastening the edges of the severed nostril together with surprising skill he leaned back to survey his work wouldnt pass inspection at a bundeswehr hospital but not bad for a field dressing lets get a blanket on him he looked around hans standing rigid at the bedroom door hans gasped and staggered backward hauer darted to the door saw karl riemecks body then returned to nattermans side whos the man in the bedroom he asked his mouth an inch from the old mans ear a friend of yours natterman nodded who killed him did you see him killed the professor shook his head then opened his eyes slowly karl was my caretaker he whispered the animal killed him animal what animal hauer groaned as the old mans eyes closed he was out again hans get over here and help me hans didnt move his eyes seemed to be fixed on some undefined point in space hauer had seen the look before american army officers called it the thousandyard stare it was the vietnam variant of shell shock but hauer knew that neither bullets nor blood had caused hanss torpor what had overloaded his mind was the justified fear of losing his wife forever giving hans hope became hauers primary objective for he knew that hanss unearthly calm was merely the silence before the storm the moment when all his fear and impotent rage would explode through his selfcontrol like a hurricane ilse must still be on her way hauer said confidently preparing to restrain hans physically if necessary hanss jaw muscles flexed steadily i would have seen her he mumbled you wouldnt have seen her we crossed east germany in the trunk of a car for gods sake maybe she took a late train like the professor maybe she hitched a ride in a truck she could still be waiting for a train right now keeping his eyes on hans hauer shook natterman gently is there a telephone professor dead i think the man who attacked me cut the line repair it hans hauer ordered check the unit then trace the wire hans finally focused on hauers face no he said quietly im going back to berlin he was trying to rebutton his coat but his shaking fingers seemed unable to keep hold of the small buttons you cant get back in hauer told him its ilses only chance she could be no professor nattermans stentorian voice boomed through the small room like a thunderclap hauer stared as the old man slowly raised himself and leveled a long finger at hans you will not go back to return now would be suicide can you help ilse if youre dead the telephone must be our lifeline now the professors rebuke left him winded but it had a dramatic effect on hans he rubbed his forehead furiously with both hands as he walked away from the two older men if only i hadnt tried to keep those goddamn papers he muttered you did the right thing hauer said firmly if you had turned the papers in funk would have them now and youd be as dead as your friend weiss hans looked up with redrimmed eyes trace the wire hauer said softly looking to natterman for support it runs out of a hole in back of the cabin said the professor hans still looked uncertain hauer drew his walther and take this whoever attacked the professor may still be out there hans snatched the pistol and disappeared through the front door natterman turned to hauer will he try to leave he cant ive got the keys natterman studied hauers face youre hanss father he said after some moments arent you i can see the resemblance hauer took a slow deep breath then he nodded curtly natterman made a sound that was almost a chuckle ilse told me you had been at spandau so youve acknowledged your son at last eh i acknowledged him the first moment i saw him hauer said in a clipped tone natterman looked skeptical tell me captain youre the expert do you believe i will ever see my granddaughter again hauer pursed his lips who has the papers hans found at spandau natterman hesitated thinking of the three pages that had disappeared with karl riemecks murderer i do he confessed theyre safe hauer wondered if the old man had the papers on him then ill give you sixtyforty odds that shes still alive frankly id expect a ransom demand any time now and you know what theyll be asking for he walked over to the cabinet that had concealed the shotgun he touched it softly appearing to examine the grain of the wood so he said exactly what is in these papers hans discovered natterman propped himself up on the arm of the sofa it made him dizzy but he felt better able to deal with questions from an upright position you must realize that youll need assistance to do anything from this point on hauer said you must also realize that im the only man within a great distance who is able to help you on the contrary natterman said testily there are many nearby who would help me hauer sighed men like the one in thebedroom there nattermans eyes smoldered why should you help me he snapped what exactly are you after hauer hauer stiffened in germany the cavalier omission of a mans rank or title is an open insult he was moving forward when boots clattered loudly on the porch the splintered door banged open i need a knife said hans his breath steaming as he closed the door he stamped his icy boots on the floorboards while he searched the kitchen alcove how long will it take hauer asked his eyes still on natterman less than a minute if i didnt have to climb that goddamn pole its covered with ice and the bastard cut the wire at the top hans found a sharp paring knife in a drawer and clomped out again im waiting said hauer natterman sighed he would have to say something he knew but misdirecting a police captain shouldnt be too difficult all right captain he said what hans found at spandauwhat your son foundis a letter of sorts a diary if you will a diary written in latin by the man known to the world for almost fifty years as rudolf hess perfect said hauer a dead language from a dead man the professor sniffed indignantly this diary happens to prove that that particular dead man was not rudolf hess hauers eyes narrowed you believe that natterman looked sanguine its nothing new youve heard all the theories im sure himmler tricked hess into becoming a pawn in his quest for hitlers job goring had hess shot down then ive heard the theories hauer cut in and thats just what they are theories bullshit your expert opinion notwithstanding natterman said i believe that the man who died last month in spandau was never the deputy fuhrer of the third reich and from what i saw on television today id say the russians believe that too hauer snorted the russians would hound a rat right up their backsides if they thought it endangered their precious motherland what proof is there that the papers are authentic natterman bridled why the diary itself of course you mean that it exists that hans found it where he did the professor tugged at his silver beard no those things are significant but its the papers themselves that are the proof how the language captain you might think that prisoner number seven wrote in latin to conceal his words from the prison guards or something similar but thats not the case at all think man here was a man who knew he was near death who decided to leave a record of the truth yet all proof that he ever lived had been wiped out long ago by reinhard heydrich how could he prove who he was ill tell you as hesss trained double number seven had studied everything about the deputy fuhrer yet no matter how much like hess he became he still possessed certain traits and abilities that hess did not and knowing those abilities better than anyone he used one to prove his identity thus he wrote his final record in latin nattermans eyes flashed with triumph and so far as i have been able to determine rudolf hessthough better educated than most of hitlers inner circleaid not know more than twenty words of latin if any that proves nothing hauer argued in fact that suggests to me that some crank wrote this diary why do you fight this so hard captain number seven was the only prisoner at the end there were others before yes natterman admitted a few but cranks no and the searches captain there were thousands of them the diary must have been written near the end it could have been slipped in by a guard hauer suggested but the cold ache in his chest belied his words natterman shrugged its not my job to convince you captain but given whats already occurred i suggest we work on the assumption that the diary is genuineat least until i can take further steps to authenticate it hauer rummaged through his borrowed suit for a cigar but whats the point of all this the kgb and half the berlin police force havent gone mad over some scrap of history what does the diary mean now now natterman smiled i suppose that depends on who you happen to be paradoxically enough the answer to your question lies in the past that is why the diary is so important the old mans voice climbed a semitone with repressed excitement it is a veritable tunnel into the past into history hauer walked to the front window of the cabin and stared out into the frozen darkness professor he said finally if this diary were real is there any conceivable way it could be embarrassing enough to influence nato possibly even the soviet union natterman raised an eyebrow given the lengths to which certain countries have gone to suppress the hess story i would say yes of course it would depend on what one wanted to influence those nations to do hauer nodded suppose someone wanted to use the diary to make the superpowers more amenable to the idea of german reunification nattermans face darkened with suspicion i think i have answered enough questions captain i think you should the splintered cabin door banged open again when hauer turned he saw hans hunched over dragging something into the cabin it took him a moment to realize that it was a human body then he saw the hairlong blond hair hans he said hoarsely hans grunted and fell backward breathing hard the corpses head thudded to the floor hauer walked slowly across the room and looked down at the body it wasnt ilse it was a man a dead man with long blond hair the right arm hung from the torso by a single cord of tendon the shoulder had been blasted into mush by the professors shotgun but the most shocking sight was the throat it had been expertly cut from ear to ear a thorough job professor said hauer ii didnt do that natterman stammered not the throat hauer glanced furtivelyat the windows theres someone else out there natterman cried hauer watched in astonishment as the old man flew at the carcass like a grave robber he rifled every pocket then began groping beneath the frozen bloodmatted shirt what are you doing professor natterman looked up his eyes wild iim trying to find out who he is any papers on him natterman shook his head violently afraid for a moment that hauer had asked about the missing diary pages but he doesnt know theyre missing he reassured himself getting to his feet he doesnt know hauer said its a good thing he didnt get hold of the spandau papers theres no telling where they might be now you have the papers hans asked in surprise my god natterman thought wildly where are those pages ilse gave them to me he said the question hauer mused is who finished this bastard off with a grunt he crouched over the body and heaved it onto its stomach the halfsevered head flopped over last hauer probed the thick blond hair behind the corpses right ear well well he said at least we know who sent this one look hans and the professor knelt and examined the spot hauer had exposed with his fingertips beneath the roots of the dead mans hair was a mark just under two centimeters long it was an eye a single blood red eye phoenix hauer muttered natterman jerked as if he had been stunned with electricity its the eye from the spandau papers the exact design the allseeing eye what does it mean there on this mans head hauer stood it means that funks little cabal sent this fellow or his masters did you said phoenix you havent read the spandau papers what do you know about the word phoenix not nearly enough but who killed him hans asked whoever it was its almost as if hes helping us maybe he knows something about ilse hans darted toward the door but hauer caught him by the sleeve hans whoever killed this man did it to get the papers not to help us you were outside for ten minutes and no one talked to you obviously no one wanted to whoevers out there could cut your throat as easily as he did this fellows so forget it he kept hold of hanss sleeve did you fix the telephone hans looked longingly at the door the wires spliced he said in a monotone good ill call steuben at the station if somethings changed in berlin we just might be able to slip back in before morning hauer knew it was a lie when he said it they wouldnt be going back to berlin not until they had followed the spandau diary wherever it leduntil they had traveled the professors tunnel into the past to its bitter end one look at the mangled carcass at his feet told him it was going to be a bloody journey wed better stand watches he said whoever killed our tattooed friend may still be out there youre up first hans thirty meters from the cabin a tall ntinel stood in the deep snow beneath the dripping trees in one hand he held three bloodstained sheets of onionskin paper in the other a knife by holding the blade at a certain angle he could illuminate the pages by reflecting light from the cabin windows but it was no use he spoke three languages fluently but he could not read latin as he watched the silhouettes moving across the yellowlit windows he envied the old mans education not that it made any difference he had known what the papers said ever since hed stood outside the door of the apfel apartment and listened to the arguments inside stuffing the pages into his coat pocket he murmured a few words in hebrew then he squatted down on his haunches in the deep snow he had lived in the burning desert for the past twelve years but the cold was nothing to him jonas stern knew he could outwait anybody especially germans mi headquarters charles street london england sir neville shaw jerked his head up from the hess file hed been poring over it so long that he had dropped into a kind of halfsleep he snapped out of it when wilson his deputy barged into his dim office without knocking something he was forbidden to do on pain of bloodcurdling punishments what the devil shaw snapped im sorry sir wilson panted i think weve got a problem well we finally got something on spandaufrom a ukrainian in the technical section of kgb east berlin it seems the kgb shot pictures of everyone who gathered to watch the destruction of the prison he didnt know why they took the pictures but he slipped us the list of names their computers matched to the photos they actually turned up a couple of old ss men get to the point shaw barked its stern sir jonas stern the israeli that the mossad wrote us about he was at spandau prison on the day we tore it down only a steady whitening of shaws knuckles on the desktop revealed how shocked he was he rocked slowly back and forth for nearly a full minute then he looked up at wilson his eyes bright with purpose did you pull the file on the woman i told you about swallow yes sir ann gordon is her real name is she living in england in a little hamlet about thirty miles west of london shaw nodded contentedly ill need to speak to her i dont want her coming here though set up a secure line so that i can brief her by phone wilsons brow knit with confusion but i dont understand sir neville swallow is retired i seriously doubt that but even if she is shell come running when she hears sterns name do you mean to reactivate this woman sir shaw ignored the question i dont know how jonas stern is tied into the hess case but he cant be allowed to get near those papers if papers are whats been found but why use swallow at all shes shes an old woman my lads can handle any situation with twice the reliability shaw laughed quietly wilson we tread shadowy paths but there are deeds done in this world that should never see the light of day swallow has done more than her share of them ill bet your four best men couldnt sandbag that old harridan wilson looked indignant sir neville this seems terribly irregular going out of school like this thats exactly the point shaw snapped swallow is absolutely totally deniable if something embarrassing were to happenif she happened to kill stern sayall could be blamed on this old vendetta even the israelis couldnt fault us their letter practically exonerates us before the fact it proves stern was at risk the moment he left israel sir neville folded his hands into a church steeple and studied a wedgwood paperweight on his desk wilson watched his master with growing apprehension the mi director looked as if hed aged five years in the brief hours since their last meeting youre to put together a second team shaw said slowly no brief as yet but have them ready more hard boys the hardest wilson cleared his throat may i ask what for sir sir neville ran his hands through his thinning hair then massaged his high forehead with his fingertips im afraid wilson that if your other lads are unlucky enough to find those spandau papers theyll have cashed in their chips wilsons face went white but you he faltered recognizing the diamondhard gleam in shaws eye when you briefed them you gave direct orders not to read the papers if found they wont sir neville sighed we cant be sure of that but theyre my best three men wilson exploded sir neville raised an eyebrow your men interesting choice of words wilson his craggy face softened damn it robert its not my choice is it its the word from on high tablets from the bloody mountaintop wilsons mouth worked in silent furious incomprehension but what does that mean neville we are a constitutional monarchy for gods sake sir neville cleared his throat thats quite enough old boy ive been instructed that as regards this case were to consider ourselves on a war footing but were not at war we cant just kill our own people sir neville attempted a paternal smile and it was terrible to see his eyes had focused into some foggy distance that he alone perceived some wars wilson he murmured last a very long time a war like the last onethe last real oneaoesnt end on a battlefield or on some baize treaty table there are loose ends unfinished business left uncut those loose ends tangle and eventually get drawn into the skein of the next war thats whats happening here for too long we simply hoped that this hess business would go away well it hasnt sir neville blinked then splayed his hands on the mahogany desktop its settled he said with resignation ive got my orders when those papers are found everyone down the chain is on borrowed time but thats insane wilson almost shouted you sound like a bloody nazi yourself sir neville bit his lip in forbearance wilson he rasped if your lads find those papers and bring them to you you shut your eyes and shove them right in here to me because no one in that chain will be exempt am i clear he examined his fingernails and ive got a feeling that includes myself the deputy directors eyes widened what in gods name is in those papers sir neville what could that motheaten old nazi have known shaw grimaced its not whats in them robert but what might be in them what they could lead to you think the cold wars over what a load of tripe twenty hours ago it reared its ugly head and not for the last time ill wager ive heard half a dozen backcorridor versions of the hess affair in my time and not one of them is true there are guilty consciences on high wilson its evidence were after of what a bargain with the devil britishstyle a marriage of convenience to the teutonic mephistopheles enough black ink to smudge out the oldest reputations in banking government and manufacturing maybe enough heat to crack the bloody crown itself wilson flexed his fists the crown be damned he said softly we should have killed hess years ago arctic fire flickered in sir neville shaws eyes we did kill him robert he said i suppose its high time you knew wilson felt cold sweat heading on the back of his neck i i beg your pardon sir neville i said we killed hess shaw plucked an errant lash from his eye the damned thing of it is were going to have to kill him again chapter fourteen dd am tiorgarten kriminalpolizei division west berlin detective julius schneider lifted the telephone receiver and dialed a number from the special list he kept in his top desk drawer a very loud voice inside his head was telling him it would be better to drop this matter altogetherbetter for his marriage much better for his career but the adrenaline pulsing through his body kept the phone in his hand what growled a tired voice at last colonel rose he said concentrating on his english pronunciation yeah rose here whos this clary jesus its two am colonel my name is julius schneider you dont know me im a detective with the west berlin kriminalpolizei what are you awake colonel i have something very important to tell you yeah yeah im awake go ahead this is a very sensitive matter perhaps we could meet somewhere rose was definitely awake now his voice took on a hard edge of suspicion who did you say this is detective julius schneider colonel eighteen months ago you gave a lecture on nato intelligencesharingnovember us army headquarters in dahlem i attended along with nine other kripo detectives uhhuh rose grunted okay lets say im mildly interested whats your problem as i said colonel i dont feel comfortable going into it on the telephone outline the situation id prefer to meet you somewhere its gonna take more than that to get me out into the cold alone son give me something schneider glanced through his office window at the sluggish activity of the night duty officers i think youve got a man over the wall he whispered quickly a what rose sounded incredulous what do you mean a defector schneider spoke still lower no colonel i think one of your officers has been taken over the wall against his will dont say another word rose snapped where are you the tiergarten kripo station colonel rose pulled a map of berlin from his bedside table okay mr detective he said slowly you know the penta hotel should be two blocks from where you are now i know it be standing in the front service doorway in fifteen minutes ill cruise by with my door openyou jump in got it ja you in uniform nein kripo dont wear uniforms when you move toward the car have both hands extended empty wait a second what was your name full name julius k schneider kripo detective first grade right fifteen minutes schneider heard rose disconnect looking at his watch he decided to wait fourteen minutes in his office then sprint the two blocks to the penta at twotwelve he donned his hat and overcoat said good night to the duty sergeant and strolled casually out of the station the wind hit his face like a shrews slap schneider turned into the blast and began running with surprising speed for a man of his bulk he glanced at his watch as he crossed to the next block twothirteen come on colonel a car moved up from his rear slowed passed halfway up the second block he ducked into the front service doorway of the imposing penta hotel his gasps filled the lighted alcove with steam twofourteen and still no colonel schneider pulled off his left boot and smashed the fluorescent bulb over his head no sense in advertising he thought tugging the boot back on as he straightened up a battered us army ford came roaring up the nijrnberger strasse the passenger door swung open thirty meters from the pentas service door but the car showed no signs of slowing schneider judged the fords speed at sixty kilometers per hour like a fullback he charged from the safety of his niche and sprinted alongside the car with both hands extended he could see the bullnecked american colonel in the drivers seat scrutinizing him over the barrel of what looked like a caliber pistol tiring quickly schneider flailed his arms for rose to stop the ford slowed to thirty kilometers per hour schneider could hear rose yelling for him to jump in almost out of wind he managed to catch hold of the doorframe and dive headlong across the front seat when he tried to rise he felt the cold metal of a gun barrel pressed to his temple thats a colt on your noggin son rose growled dont move until i say so understand ja schneider grunted with a skillful swing of the steering wheel rose simultaneously slammed the passenger door and swung onto the sixlane hohenzollemdamm heading west full name he barked julius k schneider rank detective first grade length of service sevenno eight years name of spouse what the hell does it matter im the one rose jammed the pistol barrel into schneiders ear name of spouse aarrghh liese damn you rose withdrew the gun okay get up rattled and angry schneider thrust himself against the passenger door and rubbed his cheek where the gun had scraped it what the hell was that for he asked in german you ought to have expected it rose repliedin english you call in the middle of the night to tell me one of my men has been kidnapped and you expect a cocktail party is this the way americans return favors schneider said stiffly last i checked you hadnt done me any favors well see how i return one when you do now what the hells this all about major harry richardson schneider answered relishing the poorly concealed look of shock that crossed roses face you know him go on rose said noncommittally very well colonel tonight i was called to the scene of a murder a house near the tiergarten the murdered man was one klaus seeckt an east german trade liaison employed by my government my colleagues believe seeckt surprised a gang of professional thieves who murdered him then tried to make it look like suicide and they could be right of course the kripo are famous for their skill in solving homicides get to the point detective i believe a real suicide took place colonel not a simple suicide but a suicide still im listening you can speak germanif you like schneider sighed with reliel physical evidence colonel first eight mm slugs fired into an interior wall beside the front doorburst pattern we found no shell casings to match these slugs second no fingerprints on the pistol in the corpses hand except his own third i found something odd outside the house it was a white business cardschneider paused for effectwith nothing but a telephone number on it he saw roses jaw tighten when i called the number on the card i got an answering machine with a message from one harry richardson as im sure youre aware major richardson makes a rather special effort to know berlin consequently we berliners know him rose exited right off the hohenzollemdamm onto clayallee then looped under to the avus autobahn solemn ranks of bare trees closed about the car as it rolled into the grunewald the colonel seemed to feel more comfortable here schneider noticed perhaps because from the heart of the grunewald jutted the teufelsbergthe devils mountaina massive hill constructed from the millions of tons of rubble that was berlin after the war schneider thought it depressingly symbolic that the highest peak in berlin was crowned by the futuristic onion domes of a gargantuan usbritish radar spying station rose slowed and turned to schneider as they rolled through the darkness and what does all that tell you mr detective the mm slugs tell me czech vz skorpion machine pistol i translate that kgb i know it would be stupid for them to use one here but theyve made stupid mistakes before i also happen to know that in spite of the drawbacks of the cartridge several berlinbased kgb agents still favor the skorpion granted burglars could use one but i havent seen any pass through the evidence room lately rose eyed the german with increasing interest then theres the weapon that killed seeckt if burglars faked a suicide they had to shoot seeckt wipe the pistol then press a set of his fingerprints onto it leaving what one good set of seeckts prints but there were dozens if they used gloves theyd have smudged many of seeckts original prints but they didnt so what happened burglars forced seeckt to kill himself unlikely but thekgb its possible if kgb agents had just discovered that richardson had turned seeckt for example seeckt might have preferred a quick bullet to what would have been waiting for him in lubyanka my trieb colonelmy instincttells me thats what happened the question is what was your man doing there in the first place was klaus seeckt working for you rose said nothing one more thing schneider added there was blood near the card rose winced a good bit of it too colonel i think richardson dropped that card as an sos why else would it be there without really knowing why rose decided to trust the german he really didnt have much choice harry richardsons an exceptional officer he said tersely a bit of a loner maybe but sound as a kbar especially in tradecraft but even if he has been kidnapped what makes you think hes not still in west berlin schneiders barrel chest swelled a size he recognized the respect that came with roses decision to trust him because russians wouldnt have the nerve to keep him here he explained east germans wouldthe stasi has assets all over the city but this crime scene was too clumsy for tt stasi they would never never use weapons of eastern manufacture in the west also burglarsturnedkidnappers would soon recognize their mistake in snatching an american officer unless they were parttime terrorists it would scare them to death that leaves one optionkgb it has to be alert the checkpoints said rose his voice taking on the weight of command see if any known agents have passed through tonight ive already checked schneider told him its too late a bordet officer at heinrichheine strasse told me four kgb agents with flawless cover passed through at elevenfifteen tonight richardson was probably inside that car goddamn what was richardson working on colonel sorry schneider i cant go that far i see the german said icily well then ill leave you to discover the remaining facts for yourself rose slammed on the brakes and glared at schneider dont you hold out on me schneider this is still a us military zone of occupation i can have you r ass detained for a year if i need to that is true schneider retorted but while you carry out that useless exercise your man could be dying in a kgb cell or worse yet he could be on the next flight to moscow even the kgb is smart enough to know that in east berlin a live american major is more of a liability than an asset youre pushing schneider the germans voice hardened i want this case colonel rose pursed his lips and leaned back into his seat okay detective he said finally quid pro quo you give me everything youve got and ill see youre included in any developments on this side of the wall schneider searched out roses eyes in the darkness you give me your word as an american officer and a gentleman rose eyed the german strangely i didnt think that bought much overseas anymore it does from me schneider said solemnly rose felt as if he had somehow stepped back in time as an officer and a gentleman then he vowed gut grunted the german quickly he told rose about lieutenant luhrs unusual appearance at the murder scene and his interest in richardsons card when schneider revealed that prefect funk was personally directing the spandau case from abschnitt rose looked very uncomfortable was richardson working on something related to the spandau incident schneider asked rose nodded slowly the german shook his large head something very big is happening colonel i can feel it at pm the prefect issued an alldistrict alert for two police officers who allegedly murdered a third in a dispute over drugs and this murder supposedly took place in that police station what schneider nodded one of the fugitives is a decorated officer a gsg adviser no less and boththe german smiled thinlywere on the team assigned to guard spandau prison last night roses eyes widened holy shit schneider smiled with satisfaction stasi agents call you god the allknowing colonel did you know that ive heard rose answered barely listening i guess they exaggerate rose grabbed the germans beefy shoulder okay schneider you listen richardson wasnt due to report until this morning so technically hes still on schedule but ive got a bad feeling about this my sphincters twitching and that aint good he paused you got any whiskey on you schneider shook his head nonplussed by the americans sudden change of demeanor okay heres the deal harry was looking into the spandau thing for me he thought there was a lot more to it than your bosses were letting on and with the damned state department and the brits breathing down my neck i was all too willing to give him room to maneuver rose paused angrily if youre right and the soviets have taken my boy over that wall he smashed his fist against the fords dashboard with an oath he jerked the car into gear made a screeching uturn in the wooded lane jammed the accelerator to the floor and bored through the ranks of frozen trees making for the forests edge you gotta be anywhere schneider he growled nein you wanna be temporarily seconded to my command jawohl herr oberst jesus christ rose snorted will you cut out that kraut lingo makes me nervous you sound like youre in a goddamn john wayne movie he glanced suspiciously at the german and on the wrong side schneider choked off an acid reply to the germans astonishment rose snatched up a radiotelephone and began transmitting en clair schneider couldnt believe it hundreds of listening devices constantly sampled the ether over berlin and fed the intercepted transmissions into tape recorders in every sector of the city roses call would be heard by at least a hundred people before morning yet he seemed unconcernedclary he shouted whos this came the sleepy reply wake up son colonel clary weve got a loose fish tonight you copy that schneider heard deep breathing he imagined the stunned sergeant wakened from a dead sleep to crazy code words coming from his telephone roger that sir clary mumbled loose fish is the fish still in the boat probable negative on that clary the fish is out repeat out of the boat copy thats a roge sir schneider looked bewildered eta camp ten minutes rose snapped copy that sir im outta here out rose pushed the speed limit all the way through the grunewald the american certainly knew his way around schneider reflected despite the labyrinth of icy lanes winding through the forest he burst out of the trees less than a mile from us army headquarters russians he muttered idiots i beg your pardon colonel the russians schneider the goddamn russkies reds commies whatever what about them schneider bit his lip he had almost called the american colonel sir ill tell you what about them rose grumbled if those sons of bitches have kidnapped my man and taken him over the wall thats a goddamn act of war thats what and theyre gonna find out who really runs this burg thats what schneider shifted uncomfortably in his seat and that is the us army by god the german gave a hollow laugh cut out that american imperialist lingo would you colonel it makes me nervous rose wasnt laughing am the natterman cabin wolfshurg frg professor wake up hauer prodded the old man professor natterman moaned then his eyes twitched open and his right arm shot outward karl he shouted hans grabbed his outstretched hand professor its hans were at your fathers house the old mans eyes focused at last he pulled his hand free yes karl is dead im afraid so said hauer he leaned overthe sofa where natterman lay and held up something shiny in his left hand what do you make of this professor natterman took the object and examined it briefly its a gold krugerrand standard unit of currency in south africa is it common the professor shrugged thousands of germans own millions of them i should think on paper of course is the coin common i wouldnt think so where did you get it hans picked it up outside standing watch natterman sat up my god what is it the man who attacked me i remember now i recognized his accent it was afrikaans afrikaans what do you make of that natterman pursed his lips i dont know that manthe afrikanerarne here to steal something but i dont believe he knew exactly what he was after until he actually saw the papers he didnt seem to believe it even then an errand boy that was my impression what time is it hans a little after two am two dont let me fall asleep again is the telephone working yes hauer replied but we havent learned anything he had tried in vain to reach josef steuben at abschnitt and at steubens home hed got only the men hed sent to protect steubens family no sign of his friend the apartments empty hans said anxiously ilse is all right natterman assured him you must believe that even if someone has taken her its you they want they need her alive to draw you they believe you will bring them what they seek hans nodded theyre right nattermans eyes grew wide have you lost your senses the spandau papers are much too important to be surrendered to anyone like that hans glared balefully at the old man i dont give a damn about those papers professor youd better understand that now id give them to the devil himself to have ilse here with us now his eyes narrowed suspiciously where are the papers natterman looked hunted theyre in the bathroom he said ill get them hauer kept silent his brain was spinning bruderschaft der phoenix the gold krugerrand and the afrikaner accentlike the calls from prefect funk to pretoriahad dropped into place like two more tumblers in the lock that protected phoenix from the outside world but what did south africa have to do with germany what did pretoria share with berlin hauer was still puzzing over this when the klaxon ring of the old telephone in the bedroom shattered his concentration both he and hans raced to the phone its ilse hans cried grabbing for the receiver hauer caught his wrist in a grip of steel if it is ill give the phone straight to you he lifted the receiver as the raucous bell clanged for the third time two hundred and forty kilometers away locked in an interrogation room of abschnitt prefect wilhelm funk nervously eyed a technician who sat before three marantz pmd tape recorders each tape deck was wired directly into the transmitter of funks telephone two contained recordings of ilse apfels voice recorded at gunpoint reading a script authorrd by pieter smuts the afrikaner known to funk by the code name guardian the third deck maintained a constant level of background noise to mask the oni off switching of the primary machines praying that the elaborate deception would work funk began his performance i wish to speak to sergeant hans apfel he hissed trying to mask his distinctive growl i know you you bastard said hauer funk abandoned all pretense i know you too hauer fucking traitor its sippenhaft for you just like your friend steuben hauer closed his eyes trying in vain to steel himself against the anguish he had sent a man to his death he had made a widow and orphans if apfel isnt on the phone in ten seconds funk warned i disconnect beginning now ten nine eight hans snatched the proffered phone this is sergeant apfel where is my wife do not speak sergeant in a moment your wife will read a prepared statement after ilse hans shouted ilse one more outburst like that and this conversation will be terminated after your wife finishes reading you may ask questions but keep them simple shes a bit under the weather hans swallowed hard hans listen to me he clenched the phone with all his strength ilses usually musical voice quavered with fear andconfusion but he knew the sound like his own breathing he clapped his hand to his forehead in relief then balled it into a fist as the torment went on the men who are holding me require only one thing in exchange for my freedomthe papers you discovered at spandau the papers belong to them you have illegally stolen their property restitution is all that they seek i do not know where i am if you follow the instructions you are given exactly we will be reunited if you deviate from these instructions in any way they will kill me these men possess a machine which can detect whether photocopies of a document have been made if copies have already been made important them now and bring all copies to the rendezvous if you deny that copies have been made but their machine proves otherwise i will be shot follow every order exactly they at this point ilses voice broke she sobbed and spoke at the same time i saw them kill a man hans a policeman they killed him right in front of me they cut his throat in berlin the technician stopped the first tape machine ilses sobs seemed to fade into the familiar hiss of a poor longdistance connection hans could restrain himself no longer ilse they can have whatever they want tell them the papers anything just tell me where to bring them have any copies of the papers been made funk asked hans turned to professor natterman who had appeared in the bedroom door did you make any copies of the papers natterman saw a mental image of his xerox machine flashing in his darkened office but he banished it from his mind no he said looking straight into hanss eyes i didnt have enough time there are no copies said hans his eyes still on the old man noted said funk now listen carefully to your instructions write them down error or delay will not be tolerated hans snatched a pen and notepad from hauer who had anticipated the need and procured the items from professor nattermans book satchel across the top of the pad hauer had scrawled stay calm agree to everything they ask drive to franlkfurt tomorrow morning funk began there you will board the first availableflight to johannesburg south africa your final destination is pretoria its forty miles north of johannesburg but shuttle buses run constantly hans scribbled as fast as he could your wife informs us that you have no passport but this will not be a problem if you use the south african airways counter do you have that south african airways hans said breathlessly your flight leaves at two pm once in pretoria check into the burgerspark hotel any taxi driver can take you to it a suite will be reserved for you at eight pm you will be contacted and issued instructions as to how to exchange the papers for your wife funks voice went cold if you are not in your room at the burgerspark hotel by eight pm on the day after tomorrowwith the spandau papersyour wife will die that is all sergeant wait my questions there was a long silence two questions funk said finally hans swallowed liebchen are you all right he stammered not knowing what else to say in berlin funk held up his index finger the technician pressed the play button on machine yes came ilses quavering reply have they hurt you in any way this time funk raised two fingers no ilse seemed to answer dont be afraid hans implored trying to keep his voice steady no matter what im going to get you back that is all sergeant funk said sharply dont hang up pleaseplease let me speak to her again im going to do everything you ask while hans pleaded funk held up two fingers his assistant fastforwarded to a preset location on tape and depressed play one last time ilses voice burned down the wires cracking with emotion her words were an anguished cry of hope and despair captured during the session at the point of luhrs walther she had screamed them after seeing josef steuben murdered believing that she would be killed herself when her taped statement was completed luhr had added it to the programme himselfthe perfect diabolical touch oh god hans she wailed we did it im going to have a baby she broke into sobs again hanss mouth went dry for a moment he stood speechless his face a graven image of horror then he howled from the depths of his soul you fucking swine im coming for her if shes harmed youll die like pigs under the knife so help me god funk grinned pleased by the suffering of the young man who had caused him so much trouble tell hauer he growled tell him to remember sippenhaft the line went dead with shaking hands hans set the receiver back in its cradle and turned to natterman they have her he said hoarsely and they want the spandau papers where are they professor hans natterman said uncomfortably you cant make such a decision in a fit of anger you must take time to think hanss eyes had glazed his mouth worked silently just give me the papers he said finally with a desolate sigh the old historian dug the foil packet from his trouser pocket and turned it slowly in his hand they killed another policeman hans said in a robotic voice ilse said they cut his throat right in front of her hauers big hands were balled into fists hans reached out to natterman for the papers but as he did a simple terrible realization struck him the men who had kidnapped ilse were the same men who had gouged the star of david into erhard weisss chest with a screwdriver his stomach clenched in agony never until this moment had he known true fear hauers lips had begun to tremble his jaw muscles flexed furiously wilhelm funk is a dead man he vowed i swear that by steubens children im afraid that wont solve your problem natterman observed backing up a little hans please youve got to try to think this thing through rationally what do these men want you to do hans stared unseeing at the old man a single vision floated behind his eyes a searing memory of a berlin dawn two years before a kidnapped girl lithe and blond like ilse the daughter of a bremerhaven shipping magnate theyd fished her out of the havel in the gray morning light her naked body bloated and lifeless her sightless eyes wide her pubic hair matted with river slime the kidnappers had thrown her alive into the river with her hands tied behind her the thought that ilse could end up like the wretched girl hans hadnt eaten a full meal for almost twenty hours but his stomach came up anyway he bolted for the door tripped over the dead afrikaner and fell retching on the floor hauer tensed himself against the smell hoping hans would feel better after relieving his nausea he didnt he rose slowly wiped his mouth on the back of his sleeve and stepped toward natterman his hand outstretched natterman looked down at the foil packet backed away a little hauer edged closer he had seen the flash of hysteria behind hanss eyes and he knew that at this moment hans was capable of anything he had moved just in time give me those papers hans screamed he lunged at the professor with both hands extended his eyes white with fury hauer hesitated timing his blow as hanss head surged past he fired off a right jab that caught him on the point of the chin spinning him round hauer grabbed him as he fell easing him stomachdown onto the floor before natterman could speak hauer had handcuffed hans and sat him up against the bedroom wall he went mad cried natterman his eyes wide hed have killed me for those papers do you blame him hauer asked breathing heavily he touched hanss bruised chin softly hauer felt a strange tightening in his throat hell come to in a minute he said and he coughed to cover the catch in his voice just lay the papers on his lap you wont have to worry after that natterman obeyed but he looked unconvinced where did you get those handcuffs i always keep them with me theyre the most underrated tool in the police arsenal hauer looked natterman dead in the eye now id like you to leave me alone with my son please the professor retreated into the bedroom without a word chapter fifteen am soviet sector east berlin ddr harry richardson woke to the sound of men shouting his head still throbbed from the russians pistol blow most of the duct tape had been removed from his body but his hands and mouth were still bound unsure of the position of his captors he kept his eyes closed he soon realized that the voices were coming from an adjacent room there seemed to be three men arguing possibly four he opened his eyes nothing then he discerned a thin horizontal line of dim lightbeneath a door he supposed he recognized none of the voices but they all spoke russian one man seemed to be having a great deal of difficulty speaking it he cant stay here any longer said the man with a heavy german accent not an american and certainly not this one i know him hes one of roses agents relax goltz said a russian voice this is the east isnt it ostthe heart of friendly territory what can happen goltz hariy recognized the name axel goltz east german stasi if you consider east berlin friendly territory goltz said you should spend a day on the street here the people hate us even more than they hate you you and your stasi sisters have been letting things slide for too long over here rykov said with contempt you dont have the balls for anything rougher than blackmail you are a fool goltz said with surprising venom i command herein this house at leastand i say the american goes take him to moscow if you wish just get him out of berlin there are too many sharp eyes here for him to stay invisible rykov thought harry finally making the connection rykov was the russian captain from klauss house suddenly the nights events came rushing back to him klauss suicide the silenced bullets thwacking into the wall beside the door the argument between the young kgb officers about what to do with hima door hzid slammed in the next room the squabble ended instantly where is the american asked a gruff voice in the next room comrade colonel hes unconscious bring him in behind the wall harry tensed colonel he thought which colonel but as soon as he asked the question he knew the answer who but ivan kosovthe colonel hed seen early this morning at abschnitt a bright vertical bar of light stabbed his eyes wake up major harry got to his knees then made an effort to stand rykov helped him you hit me anyway you bastard harry muttered nothing personal just easier rykov seemed to be having difficulty walking when harrys eyes sought the floor for balance he spied a bloody tear below the knee of rykovs trousers his souvenir from the checkpoint crossing harry looked up as he passed into the next room and he immediately recognized four of the five men who awaited him the gruffvoiced colonel was kosov he lounged in a comfortable chair opposite a portable television between kosov and a door that harry hoped led to the street stood a hardlooking young man dressed from head to toe in black axel goltz the stasi agent sat behind a deal table next to andrei ivanov the corporal from klauss house goltz had restless eyes and dark hair cropped close against his skull the major needs a chair said kosov misha the blackclad russian moved lithely to the table lifted one of the armless wooden chairs and placed it opposite kosov rykov shoved harry into the chair then ripped the tape from his mouth the sudden pain brought tears to his eyes but passed quickly he held out his hands to misha who looked questioningly at kosov no rykov objected he doesnt need his hands one gentleman to another said harry his eyes on kosov kosov chuckled then nodded to misha who broug it out his stiletto and cut through the sticky mess like tissue paper rykov laid a hand on the skorpion machine pistol in his belt now that youre comfortable said kosov in heavily accented english what have you to tell me what do you want to know what you were doing at klaus seeckts house routine debriefing harry said offhandedly twice monthly hes lying rykov snapped in russian he almost broke down the door trying to get in kosov looked to corporal ivanov for corroboration hes right andrei admitted grudgingly nothing routine about it the major also speaks excellent russian you see major kosov said theres no point in trying to deceive me i regret that my men brought you here at all of course i asked for a german policeman i got back an american major an unfortunate accident but now that the mistake has been made i intend to use the opportunity to ask you a few questions you would do the same i think harry shrugged i simply wish to know the details of your relationship with klaus seeckt then i can make arrangements for your safe return to west berlin harry almost laughed mistake or not the russians had kidnapped him to return him now would be admitting it and they wouldnt do that even if colonel rose had known he was going to klauss housewhich rose hadnthe would have no way of knowing harry had been taken into the ddr he might eventually suspect it but by then the chances of getting harry back would beslim and if the russians moved him any father east the odds fell to zero this situation required desperate measures shock tactics looking straight at kosov harry crossed his legs and began to speak flawless aristocratic russian youd better write this down kosov if you bungle this chairman zemenek will have you back in the fifth chief directorate so fast you wont have time to pack your shorts youll be chasing filthy tatars for the rest of your life kosov started both at the perfection of richardsons russian and the reference to his old job what do you know about me major he asked warily only whats necessary which isnt much im afraid ivan leonidovich kosov born moscow entered service excelled at repression in the provincesnotably azerbaijanfor the second chief directorate that and your fatherinlaws influence got you transferred to directorate k in stationed yugoslavia a little more competent than the average kman you obtained a posting to the east berlin rezidentura in where youve performed uately for the past ten years leave us kosov told his men axel goltz spoke up angrily but colonel now bellowed kosov only misha remains when the others had left the room kosov said your russian is excellent major you have a good memory so what you think i dont know as much about you harry looked over at the predatory misha standing motionless in the shadows no colonel i dont there is a gap in your consciousness shall we say kosov grunted what kind of gap the fact that we occasionally work for the same team broadly speaking i went to klaus seeckts house tonight to deliver a message come now major i would know if you had any connection with kgb harry snorted you think youre made aware of everything that happens in berlin perhaps you are a fool kosov the russian paled as he held up a hand to restrain misha you speak confidently for a man facing death he said softly i thought you were sending me bapk to west berlin kosov grimaced tell me do you have any proof of this fantastic story the rich american who secretly serves the workers paradise harry played out a little more bait i assume you fare miliar with the twelfth department of your directorate kosov nodded almost imperceptibly my contact is yuri borodin klaus seeckt was one of our conduits kosov blinked what can this fiction profit you major an extra hour of confusion you are going to moscow regardless of what you say here and its there your fate will be decided kosov sounded confident but harry had seen the doubt flicker into his eyes at the mention of the twelfth department the twelfth department was an elite branch of the kgban allstar team recruited from veterans of other kgb departments who had proved themselves expert at moving in international society developed under yuri andropov the twelfth department had more autonomy than any other branch of the service its agents were allowed to pursue their chosen quarry anywhere in the world harrys personal history of wealth and privilege made him an excellent target for a man like yuri borodin plus he had seen borodin in the company of klaus seeckt he thought his desperate story might stand up to perhaps an hours scrutiny tell me about this mysterious message major said kosov my god thought harry hes buying it sorry colonel he said gravely the message is for borodin alone you had better tell me something kosov warned or i may see fit to let misha persuade you hes most eager to do so harry gave a sardonic smile thats about what id expect from an old second directorate thug kosov came up out of his chair he moved very fast for a big man for a moment harry thought he had carried things too far but the russian sat down again albeit slowly harry didnt want to push kosov over the edgenly up to it im waiting kosov rasped here goes harry thought in the past two minutes he had pieced together the most plausible story he could from the meager facts he possessed about the spandau case play out the bait wait for the strike i can tell you this much colonel he said us military intelligence is fully aware of the content of the papers found at spandau prison while your moronic thugs were kidnapping me our state department was considering a request from the british government to turn over an abstract of those papers to mi my message for borodin concerns those papers and if you dont appreciate the sensitivity of that issue its your misfortune so why dont you get off your fat ass and verify my story before you sabotage what remains of your lessthanillustrious career it was a shot in the dark but it struck home kosov stood up and studied harry an interesting story major tell me how is our oneeyed friend these days harry felt a jolt of confusion kosov had blind sighted him oneeyed friend did kosov mean yuri borodin as far as harry knew borodin had two perfectly good eyes harry racked his memory for a oneeyed man but all he could come up with was a black kid from baltimore whod lost both his eyes to shrapnel in the dmz jesus i dont quite get you colonel he said lamely kosov smiled well then major how about the spandau papers did they mention any names several hess for one naturally any others none id care to mention harry said tersely feeling the noose closing around him ill mention a few then the russian grinned tell me if you recognize any chernov frolov kosov waited no how about zinoviev just the house wine thanks harry thought crazily he felt cold sweat heading on the back of his neck russian names what the hell could they have to do with spandau well major zinoviev harry whispered kosov blanched rykov the three agents rushed back into the room like hungry dobermans kosov seized his overcoat from a rack by the door and issued orders while he pulled it on hold the major here until ireturn from headquarters i need to call moscow and i want a line the stasi cant tap but herr oberst axel goltz objected venting his anxiety at last we cant keep an american here if rose finds out the reaction could be very severe why stop whining kosov snapped act like a german for gods sake you can manage without me for an hour misha the blackclad killer whipped open the door kosov hurried through and crunched down the snowy drive his silent footpad on his heels the door banged shut harry sat completely still he couldnt quite believe that his desperate ploy had worked one brief glance through the open door had told him what he wanted to knowthat the room they now occupied stood at ground level not on the tenth floor of some human warehouse in pankow quickly he mapped the room in his mind andrei and goltz by the deal table a sofa with a broken spine against the far wall a large curtained window at right angles to the sofa kosovs empty chair facing him one door leading to the room where he had been held earlier and anotherguarded by rykovleading outside the three agents glowered at each other as if they had been arguing in the other room you fellows find a lot to talk about back there harry asked in russian his tone insulting andrei scowled but rykov only smiled and leaned against the outside door resting his injured leg suddenly axel goltz spoke up what is kosov doing comrades when the russians didnt respond goltz scratched thoughtfully behind his right ear what did the major tell him that weakened his resolve relax said rykov we have everything under control goltzs nostrils flared under control you dont even know whats going on i know this man richardson hes a skilled agent i cant believe kosov fell for his tricks the colonel knows what hes doing rykov said evenly he curled his lip in distaste stop scratching your head goltz you look like a mangy old hound the east german flushed its a wound he said he cocked his head to the side exposing a small white bandage behind his ear a skinhead threw a brick in a riot four stitches to close it rykov snorted with contempt probably a jew theyll revenge themselves on you germans yet goltz ground his teeth furiously what tricks of mine were you referringto harry cut in perhaps you like kosov are unaware of certain important facts find another fool major goltz snapped be glad im not in charge of you harry kept smiling but inside he shivered he had always believed the stasi far superior to the kgb in all areas of intelligence work and he was glad to see goltz in the minority tonight rykov tacitly admined this with his next question what would you do with him goltz if you were in command kill him simplest for all parties concerned harry felt a tremor of fear youre a cold one rykov observed goltz shrugged what about his intelligence value the stasi man pulled a wry face i dont think he knows a damned thing about spandau he might drug him senseless then but hes got to disappear goltz is right harry agreed leave it to the germans to come up with the most efficient solution what the hell does that mean andrei asked from the table now were getting somewhere harry thought just what it seems to mean corporal that ever since the second world war the east germans have run rings around their russian masters goltz bowed his head slightly acknowledging a selfevident truth andrei flushed axid rose from the table pay no attention to him andrei rkov said hes only trying to provoke us thats right corporal harry taunted follow your captains example i insult him and what does he do lies back and takes it like a good russian andrei charged from the table harry darted out of the chair and sidestepped him now now corporal i advise you to treat me with discretion when kosov returns hell enlighten you as to my privileged status within your organization my god goltz cried hes insufferable he insults your homeland to your face then tellsyou that he secretly serves it are you complete fools its kosovs responsibility rykov said slowly hell be back soon the russian captain squinted at harry and while we wait major richardson is going to tell us exactly what was found at spandau last night harry caught a sudden furtive alertness in axel goltzs eyes i just might do that captain he d lightly his eye on the but german goltz stiffet tell you what harry went on get me something to drink and ill tell you boys part of a very interesting story axel goltz had compressed his muscles like steel springs harry sensed it like a hunter senses his dog straining to break cover he rechecked everyones position goltz stood by the table rykov still blocked the door but andrei stood only a single step from harrys chair his eyes smoldering he had to be moved ill take scotch if you have it harry said get him a vodka andrei rykov ordered thank you god harry flexed his calf muscles s th andrei started to obey his captain but after two step e resentment hed been nursing since the argument at klauss house finally surfaced he stopped and turned back to his commander get it yourself he said deflandyrykov went pale at this public challenge to his authority he stood erect and laid a hand on the machine pistol in his belt you mutinous bastard he said stepping forward harrys heart pounded jesus this is it andrei now stood five feet away from him facing rykov in fury its now or neverthen harry saw something so unexpected that it froze him in his chair axel goltz silently brought a heckler koch psp pistol out of his jacket and aimed it not at harry but at dmitri rykovs astonished face back against the wall you russian bastard he shouted throw your gun on the floor andrei whirled then froze rykov dropped his skorpion on the floor have you gone mad he asked an incredulous smile on his face goltz grinned scornfully are you surprised my little russian puppies surprised that a german is about to blow your puny brains out you crazy fucking german said rykov still unbelieving youre a dead man no matter what you do now kosov will hunt you down that demon misha will slice your throat like a bratwurst goltz spoke over his shoulder stand up major you and i are going to take a short ride together youre about to find out what a real interrogation is like agennan interrogation you wont get away with this rykov said uselessly goltz laughed coldly of course i will corporal ivanov has already reasoned out my alibi i left here to attend to other business you two quarreled and major richardson managed to kill you both and escape with two idiots like you kosov will be the first to believe it but why asked rykov fascinated by goltzs apparently suicidal impulse do you work for the americans im afraid he doesnt harry thought with a sinking head raising his chin proudly goltz spoke his next words in german if i die he said softly i die for germany for phoenix his voice dropped still lower der tag kommt the day approaches harry echoed softly what the hell at that moment corporal andrei ivanov chose to die a soldiers death with no weapon but his hands he charged a man who was pointing a semiautomatic pistol at him stunned by this display of courage goltz hesitated for a splitinstant then fired andrei took a round in the chest but he kept coming rooted to his chair harry watched the doomed charge with hypnotic fascination goltzs third bullet killed the russian but the corporals furious momentum bowled the stasi agent over backward shaken to the core harry wrenched his mind back to reality he knew he couldnt beat a bullet to the door with a cry he hurled himself from the chair and crashed headlong through the window trailing the curtains after him into the darkness axel goltz heaved andreis bleeding body off him and wmmbled to his feet rykov was nowhere to be seen cursing goltz darted to the window and hit a switch that flooded the courtyard with light he saw only a sparkling jigsawof shattered glass taking three steps back he rushed the jagged window and leaped through he tumbled across the glasscovered bricks in an expert parachutists roll and came to his feet at a run the glass cut him badly but he uttered no sound as he disappeared into the darkness after harry am the naherman cabin near wollsbiirg frg stop tying to change my mind hans shouted he lashed out with his cuffed hands missing hauers face by inches hauer didnt flinch they sat opposite each other on the cabin floor hans with his back set against the wan the foil packet containing the spandau papers in his lap behind hanss eyes swirled a thousand currents of rage and tension listen hauer pressed youre reacting just like every relative of every kidnap victim ive ever seen no one wants police involvedtheyll try anything to get their loved one back anything but the right thing you know better hans you know how many kidnap victims we get back alive ninety percent of hostages are dead before the ransom call ever comes youve already been lucicy you can get ilse back but youre going to have to take her hans glowered at the floor statistics meant nothing to him now all he could see was the nightmare image of the girl dredged from the havel leached gray by the oily river hauer watched him silently for the fifteen minutes since hans regained consciousness hauer had tried in vain to convince him that ilses only chance lay in rescue in his mind there was no other option bitter experience had taught him that the real hostages in a kidnapping were the family members left behind not the victim in years hauer had seen them all the shattered mothers who served coffee to the police in zombielike traces of sedation the raging fathers who refused to sleep until they collapsed from exhaustion the wives who could not stop crying or who could not cry at all and the husbands like hans who toughed it out in stoic silence until helplessness and despair finally unmanned them hans had to be saved from himself hauer watched as despite the handcuffs hans worked open the foil packet containing the spandau papers hans examined the first pagethe scrawled german that switched to carefully blocked latinmd then apparently satisfied that natterman had not tried to steal the precious ransom tie closed the packet and stuffed it into his trouser pocket he refused to meet hauers eyes keeping his own focused on the handcuffs hauer stood up he st to speak again to marshal the reasons hans should set aside his fear and do what he himself would do but as he stared he began to see with different eyes he saw that his son though like himself in many ways was profoundly different in others hans was not yet thirty still young enough that he defined himself more by his job and his friends than by his inner self and with the family situation he hada mother he despised and a father he had hated until tonighthans probably drew more emotional sustenance from his wife than he would ever understand in the span of eight hours he had seen his job unmasked as a travesty his friend brutally murdered and his wife torn from his side little wonder hauer reflected that he lacked the resolve to punch through the blinding red wall of emotion and act hauer had seen this type of paralysis before and inexperience was not always the root of it hanss internal compass ww that of so many germans gravitated toward a magnetic norththe gilded scaffolding of official authority with that mffolding shattered and himself branded a fugitive he was a man adrift hauer felt no such confusion his internal compass pointed to the true nordi of his spirit he had lost his illusions very young and through the trials of finding his way in the world alone he had learned to exalt the essence not the trappings of his work he took a most ungerman approach to his skill as a marksman in unexpected moments he found himself viewing the world through his rifle scopenot in a limited but a profoundly focused way all existence compressed into the tube of polished lenses the smallest movement magnified a hundredfold melding him with the target a thousand yards away the sixinch red paper circle the tawny fur beneath the stags shoulder the pale forehead of a man when he led menin the army on the gsg firing range in the streetsof berlinhe led not by virtue of his rank but by example in situations like this one cut off from command the fire inside hauer burned all the brighter spurring him to action driving him toward resolution as he watched hans now he felt an awful powerlessness what hans needed was a new allegiance a fixed star that the spinning needle in his soul could lock bnto if hauer could not provide that if he could not lead the son who had returned to him like a prodigal then he would truly have failed as a father as all that he had believed himself to be he started suddenly professor natterman was speaking your father is right the old man was saying give in to nazis and they crush you exterminate you we cant surrender the papers weve got to take ilse back nazis hans groaned youre both crazy crazy old men what does that have to do with getting ilse back with today its ancient history youre right hauer said quickly he squatted dow his haunches his face a foot from hanss own forget all that crap what matters is ilse but unless you force yourself to look at this objectively hans your emotion is going to kill her you have never faced this thing you are facing now youve seen brutality and youve seen death but you have never faced pure evil that is what you are facing now call it nazism or phoenix or whatever you want its all the same it is a thing as mindless and as ravenous as a cancer it perceives only what it wants obstacles to getting what it wants and threats to its existence right now it wants those papers the papers are a dream you have them ilse has read them so both of you are also threats killing her killing youthis is less than nothing remember weiss hans think of steuben i tried to kid myself about it but steuben was a dead man the moment i saved your life hans flinched at that already he blamed himself for weiss and for so much more he looked up into his fathers face pleading silently for him to stop but hauer would not if you get on that plane with those papers you will never return to germany phoenixs men can kill you on the plane in the airport anywhere the south african police can murder you in jail they do it all the time if we have der bonderschaft in our department what do they have diere the moment phoenix has the papers you will die youll die youll never see your wife again youll never see me again hans scrambled to his feet he slipped past hauer to the shattered bedroom window and rested his cuffed hands on a knifeedge of glass even in the bitter cold he was sweating haners words had pierced the fog of dread that surrounded him yet the rush of nightmare images would not stop they rifpped through him like a ragged strip of film unspoofing from his heart catching in his flashing behind his eyes he tried to speak to express the confusion he felt but his voice broke tears pooled in his eyes as he stared out into the frozen forest hauer couldnt see hanss face but he heard the sob and imew that his words had had their effect he stood up slowly and took something from his pocket a key he walked to the window removed the cuffs from hanss wrists and put them in his pocket i dont think you understand he said i want you to take the papers to south africa natterman cleared his throat surely you cant mean that captain hauer snapped his head around and gave the old man a withering glare i mean to use the spandau diary to draw the kidnappers into the open to force them to expose ilse hans threw up his hands but what can you do then you dont have one of your gsg teamsno twentyman unit with stateoftheart weapons and communications hauer spoke with coldblooded confidence you know what i can do hans youre all the team i need and me natterman put in hauer ignored him he had no intention of taking the professor to south africa but now was not the time to tell him that hans walked a few steps away from hauer it was almost impossible to argue with the man when he brought the power of his personality to bear yet hans feared so much more than ilses deadi he sensed her terror like a snake twisted around his spine not terror for herself but for the child she was carrying of course he remembered her doctors appointment now hed fallen asleep after the spandau detail and missed it but why hadnt she told him about the baby when he got home yet he knew the answer to that too because he had come home acting like a total lunatic a moneycrazed bastard and hadnt she tried in spite ofhim he could still hear her voice ive got a secret too and then the phone call from funks man jiirgen luhr and then weiss and steuben and ilse look i dont have a passport he said sharply the kidnappers were right about that the only way i can get to south africa is by the route theyve set up i can have a forger here in three hours hauer said quickly im not giving those bastards a shot at you on the plane damn it they said any deviation from the instructions and theyd kill her sensing hanss growing resolve hauer pressed down his exasperation hans there are no absolutes in these situations youre like a doctor who must operate on his own wife she has terminal cancer shes going to die unless you go in and cut out the tumor but there are risks the knife ml things you up the scalpel then you hear a voice in your ear saying hey you give me what i want and ill make this woman as healthy as the day she was born hauer shook his head its a fucking lie hans that voice is the devil and he doesnt play by your rules he feels no obligation its your call but no matter how badly you want to believe that voice theirs only one option surgery hanss cheek twitched involuntarily he searched the depths of his fathers eyes but he saw neither subterfuge nor hope of gainnly the indomitable will of a man ready to die in a quest he had made his own and from somewhere deep within himself from a place he never knew existed a voice edged with steel rose into his throat ill do it chapter sixteen am soviet sector east berlin ddr harry picked himself up out of the shattered glass and sprinted for the courtyard wall he heard no shooting yet but that didnt reassure him the rough stone wall was high without breaking stride he planted his right shoe three feet up the face of the wall and leaped his fingers dug into the rough ledge he pulled with all his strength both feet pedaling against the stone and scrambled over the top he found himself in a narrow walking space between two houses dashing down the dark corridor he paused where it opened onto a narrow street he saw no street signs nor any other landmarks he knew unsure of where to run he flattened his back against the wall outside the alleys mouth locked his hands together in a deadly double fist and waited axel goltz was fast intelligent and welltrained but his desperation made him careless he came barreling down the narrow alley at top speed and rather than pause at its mouth as harry had done he leaned into his sprint blindly pursuing the man he thought to be at least a block ahead of him by now harrys locked fists struck the east german in the center of the forehead and skidded down the right side of his head goltz went down like an ox under the slaughterhouse hammer harry heard the metallic ring of a gun hitting the concrete but he saw no gun goltz must have fallen on it the stasi agent lay motionless on his stomach as harry stared down he caught the dark glint of metal protruding from beneath goltzs waist cautiously he leaned down and snatched up the pistol goltz didnt move seeing no one else on the street harry decided to question him he held the pistol to goltzs head with his left hand and probed beneath the jaw with his right there was a pulseweak but steady as harry opened his mouth to speak he caught sight of the strange spot behind goltzs right ear hariys blow had torn the bandage away he expected to see stitches but ins he saw a perfectly round moon of white flesh shining under the streetlight marked at the center by what looked like a spot of blood leaning closer he saw what it wasa small tattoo a tattoo of an eye a single blood red eye inked into the scalp by a very talented needle it reminded him of the eye on the pyramid on the back of a onedollar bill but only a little this eye was less defined somehow yet more piercing more mystical as harry stared axel goltz flicked his head up from the pavement like a slingshot and cracked him across the bridge of the nose the next thing harry saw through stinging tears was the east german on his feet moving forward with a gleaming knife extended in his right hand harry goltzs pistol without thinking the explosion of the unsilenced weapon reverberated through the empty streets like a cannon shot the bullet blew goltz off his feet he landed on his back in the street sucking for air a tiny hole in his chest a gaping hole in his back harry knelt quickly beside him and said into his ear why did you shoot the russian why wideeyed in shock goltz made a gurgling noise in his throat harry lifted him roughly by his shirt front what is phoenix he asked sharply goltz what is phoenixt the german couldnt speak a froth of blood spilled over his lower lip harry racked his memory for the stasi mans rank lieutenant was ist phoenix herr leutnant he barked in the voice of a sergeant major a faint smile touched the corners of goltzs mouth der tag kommt he croaked for the jews for the world he sighed once then went limp ham heard sirens in the distance damn he cursed he dropped goltz to the concrete and forced his head to the side the blood red eye stared upward harry didnt know what the mark meant but he knew that it was somehow important goltz had obviously been hiding it from rykov and his men harry saw no reason to let them find it now he greg iles laid the pistol barrel against the germans skull muzzle against the tattoo he pulled against the trigger then stopped without pausing to think he jammed the pistol into his belt and pried the knife from goltzs clenched fist he tried to grasp the bald circle of goltzs scalp between his thumb and forefinger but it was impossible there was no hair to pull and the skin was stretched too tightly around the skull ignoring the wailing sirens harry braced his knee firmly against the right side of the stasi mans head he grasped the hair at the lower edge of the shiny circle and tugged up a little hummock of flesh then he jabbed the knifepoint into the scalp beneath the tattoo deep into the fascia goltzs body jerked when the point struck bonefrom reflex harry hoped but then the bleeding started little pulsing waves that shimmered blackred beneath the streetlight goltz was unconscious but alive gritting his teeth together harry levered the knife blade up using the point as the fulcrum and worked his left thumb under the raised scalp this accomplished it took only a few seconds of sawing to excise the halfdollarsized swatch of skin that bore the tattoo the sirens were much closer now harry stood and shoved the fragment of scalp deep into his trouser pocket then he sprinted toward the nearest intersection wiping the blood from his hands as he ran there were street signs at the intersection but he didnt recognize the names with no better option he began running toward the brightest lights he could see he soon saw a sign he knew rosenthaler strasse high in the sky to his left hovered the shining observation sphere of the great femsehturm the foot television tower that rises needlelike from the alexanderplatz to dominate both east and west berlin using the tower as point zero harry visualized east berlin from the air estimating distances and comparing the times it would take him to reach different destinations twelve blocks to the west stood the british embassy harry knew the ambassador but he also knew that his chances of getting through the gate unmolested were nil if either goltz or rykov had reached a telephone the friendly embassies would be covered already twenty blocks to the east was a french sdece safehouse where harry knew he could find refuge but the shortest route to it lay through one of the busiest sections of east berlin even at night it would be risky harry started walking he crossed two deserted corners then passed a row of yellow phone boxes where an illkempt young man stood shouting into a telephone on impulse harry turned and walked back to the phone boxes he took hold of the boys jacket with one hand and broke the connection with the other hey the boy snapped arschloch let go coins harry demanded pointing to the phone pragen i fick dich in knie the german cursed harry grabbed the tangled mane of blond hair and twisted until the boys eyeball rested against the telephones coin slot pragen he hissed snarling the youth pulled thirty pfennig from his jacket and dropped the jangling coins onto the sidewalk harry jerked him out of the phone box and shoved him down the street beat it he growled haue ah the boy backed off cursing then turned and shuffled on harry dialed an east berlin number from memory and waited he could still hear the siren but fainter british embassy said a sleepy ferrile voice after a dozen rings i have an urgent message for ambassador brougham harry said breathlessly the code is trafalgar am i being recorded yes sir the crisis code had worked itsmagic harry paused remembering colonel roses warning not to tell the british anything about the spandau case he understood the caution but under these circumstances he might be captured and silenced long before he got through to colonel rose are you there ir asked the englishwoman message to god harry said usingroses nickname zinoviev repeat zinoviev break phoenix repeat phoenix break message to ambassador brougham this is major harry richardson us army i was abducted repeat abducted into east berlin tonight i have escaped and im on my way to your embassy for asylum harry heard a hiccup of astonishment im on foot and i should be there in about seven minutes get those gates open harry slammed down the phone and looked westward to ward the british embassy then he started east toward the safehouse am kgo headquarters soviot sedor berlin ddh ivan kosov sat thoughtfully in his swissmade office chair and gazed at a fourbyfiveinch file photograph of harry richardson it was a telephoto shot long and grainy but the expression on the americans face looked as cocksure as it had when he picked the name zinoviev from the three kosov had tossed out kosov muttered an oath and slid the photo aside now he looked into the piercing eyes of rudolf hess this picture was an eightbyten sharp and clear of the deputy famr during his prime the heavybrewed aryan face radiated authority and selfassurance beneath this photo lay a smaller shot of hess as a first world war pilot his eyes looked younger brighter somehowunfreighted with the knowledge of immeasurable death and destruction kosov had stared at these photos of hess for years wontiering why moscow was still obsessed with the old nazis mission they had proof that prisoner number seven was an impostorr so kosov had heard from several dzerzhinsky square oldtimers that he trusted yet if centre had such proof why didnt they expose him long ago theyre waiting the oldtimers said waiting for what corroboration they said was zinoviev that corroboration whoever zinoviev was was there really some hidden purpose in hesss flight or was this simply one more conspiracy theory vawned in the murky corridors of moscow centre kosov had the feeling he was about to find out at last the computers had tracked yuri borodin to london kosov had sent a query straight on to the embassy and while he waited for the reply hed ordered a printout of harry richardsons file kosov envied the freedom borodin enjoyed twelfth department agents for all practical purposes stationed themselves a far cry from the deskbound life kosov had led for the past decade suddenly kosovs printer began to chatter not bad he thought borodin must have been at the embassy when the message came through he read the reply as his printer spat a it out thankful that the days when he had to decode his own messages were long past to kosov am gmt london in response to queryyes i know agent in question no i have no relationship with him other than adversarial subject is valuable resource hold him there until i arrive eta tomorrow canceitoday am borodin kosov slammed a horny hand down on his desk the american had lied after all but while this knowledge delighted kosov borodins intention to come to berlin did not ive caught the golden goose he said bitterly and this prima donna wants to come take the credit well see about that while kosov grumbled his printer began to chatter again what emerged this time was not a message but a digital facsimile photograph a study in grays and black it showed four uniformed young men in their early twenties standing shoulder to shoulder against the famous borovitsky gate of the kremlin kosov didnt recognize the uniforms but the young men were obviously officers a handpenciled arrow pointed to the face of the second man from the left the photo was very grainy but kosov recognized the hardness in the eyes and around the mouth of that face those eyes have seen much death he thought at the bottom of the photo was a handwritten caption v v zinoviev awarded okhrana captaincy beneath the phototypedwere the words message follows by courierzemenek kosov felt a thrill of triumph here was the mysterious zinoviev at last and sent to him by the chairman himself yet kosovs triumph was tempered by puzzlement and uneasiness zinoviev an officer of the okhrana what in gods name could the okhrana have to do with this case it was a ghost from an even more distant past than rudolf hess the okhrana was the tsars dreaded secret police forcethe most ruthless enemy the communists had ever known kosov scratched his grizzled head with a sharp sense of frustration he realized what was eating at him without quite knowing it he had been expecting zinoviev to turn out to be the mysterious oneeyed man it only made sense for years hed had a name with no face to go with it and a oneeyed man without a name why couldnt they be one and the same maybe they are he thought suddenly staring at the photo again the hardfaced young officer in the photo had two living eyesof that kosov had no doubt they stared out from the picture like smoldering lumps of coal you are very young here little tiger kosov thought plenty of time yet to lose an eye especially in yourjob eh most okhrana officers had lost more than their eyes after tsar nicholas was overthrown telephone comrade colonel interrupted a secretary urgent startled out of his reverie kosov snatched up the receiver when he heard captain rykov eiplain what had happened at the stasi safehouse he felt the blood leave his head in a rush my god he muttered my god get back here any way you can you idiot kosov slammed down the phone and charged into the communications room close off the western embassies he shouted use our own peopleno east germans several astonished young faces appeared at the doors the fugitive is an american army major he said more slowly his voice barely under control hes out of uniform and he speaks perfect russian probably perfect german too if hes apprehended i want him brought here immediately kosov ground his teeth furiously any east german who attempts to get close to him is to be shot that is a direct order shoot any east german who interferes i want the full staff here in twenty minutes and get me the chief of the stasi on the phone now sagging against a desk kosov tried to ignore the pounding in his head it seemed inconceivablethat axel goltz had been working for the americans the man was practically a nazi why would he turn on his russian masters especially since he could have no doubt that his action would be suicidal kosov sighed hopelessly he could do little else until his department heads arrived slowly he walked back into his office closed the door and sat at his desk borodin will throw me to the dogs for this he lamented but not before i strain axel goltz through a razorwire sieve shoving the grainy photograph of zinoviev out of his way he swallowed four aspirin without water pressed his forehead to the cold desktop and waited for the phone to ring am the natterman cabin near woifsburg frg the forger arrived two hours after hauers call professor nattermans explosion occurred two hours after that hauer and hans had buried the dead caretaker and his afrikaner killer in the snow behind the cabin while natterman stripped the bloody bedclothes and scrubbed away the blood from the cabins interior the only remaining signs of trouble were the shattered windows and door and the jaguar wrapped around the plane tree out front hauers forger was astute enough to ignore all these signs immensely fat and normally jovial hermann rascher appeered to be in mortal dread of hauer he lost no time in setting up his equipment a white screen and chair placed in front of the shattered window and an assortment of chemicals laid out in the bathroom quickly converted the bedroom into a small photographic studio consistent with his plan of keeping natterman in the dark until the last minute hauer instructed the forger to shoot a passport picture of the professor as if he too were to be given false papers but this ruse went for nothing despite hauers injunction against discussing their plans natterman badgered him every moment that the forger spent in his temporary darkroom before rascher arrived hauer had probed the professor for his speculations on what the vital secret of the spandau papers might be but natterman had refused to be drawn out now though natterman was vigorously attempting to convince hauer it would be foolish to bait a rescue trap with the authentic papers the kidnappers have obviously never seen the papers he insisted so it would be impossible for them to know they were being fooled captain i simply cannot agree to any plan which needlessly risks losing such an important artifact hauer had had enough he walked to the bedroom door to make sure the forger was closed inside the bathroom then he turned back to natterman you dont have to agree professor he said evenly because youre not coming to south africa natterman looked as if someone had emptied a bedpan in his face too stunned to speak he looked to hans for support but found none hauer kept the initiative youre wounded you cant move faster than a slow walk and youre over seventy for gods sake too angry to marshal logical arguments natterman raged like a thwarted child you cant keep me out of this you you fascist while he ranted on hans walked to the window and tried to shut out the argument the snow was falling again he shivered realizing that somewhere out there beyond the trees beyond the road and the pristine german fields beyond the alps beyond a great sea and a vast dark continent ilse waited frightened and alone with a hollow coldness in his chest he wondered again about her last anguished cry could she really be pregnant at last or had the kidnappers somehow twisted that desperate maternal hope out of her to use as extra leverage i e he banished the thought from his mind that snake could eat its tail forever and his sanity with it it had no bearing at all on the rescue plan he would keep that secret to himself whatever had passed between him and his father in the last few hours hauer had no claim on that knowledge yet hans listen to thisi the professor shrieked hauer said it himself the police only get ten percent of hostages back alive remember munich hans the seventytwo olympics it was hauer and his stortntwpers who opened up on the arabs while the hostages were tied inside the helicopters the jews were blown to bits have you forgotten that two days ago you hated this man he deserted you and your mother now you trust him to bring our ilse back alivet at the mention of munich a strange stillness came over hauer it was as if a ghost had touched him with icy fingers his gray eyes turned opaque as they fixed on natterman his voice went cold and flat i didnt see you on airfield that day natteman started to reply but when he recognized the glacial coldness in hauers eyes the sound died in his throat im sorry he whispered i shouldnt have said that but you dont understand captain the key to this situation isnt guns and tactics its the spandau papers and you cant even read them were not dealing with arab terrorists or crazed students herewere dealing with the legacy of adolf hitler the key to this whole mystery is in the and i am the only man who can unravel it hauer sighed professor why dont you admit that the reason you want so badly to come is that you cant bear to let those papers out of your sight for one moment liar natterman exploded you didnt argue against forcible rescue until i said i wasnt including you in the plan do you deny that how dare you spittle flew from the old mans lips you fool youre not qualified to handle this alone you think youre chasing a neonazi group called phoenix then how do you explain the tattooed eye the phoenix is a bird rising from the flames not an eye phoenix is the greek name of the egyptian god bennu the tattooed eye is also egyptianits the guarding eye the allseeing eye the eye of god from the egyptian book of the dead explain that to me captain hauer shrugged the nazis used all kinds of rituals and mythology yes but teutonic and arthurian mythology almost exclusively so how do you explain the egyptian symbols hauer remained silent while he digested nattermans revelations professor he said finally if you care about your granddaughter you will write down everything you just told me and you will stay by the telephone so that you can provide us with any other information we need but i can go with you natterman insisted i can keep up enough hans cried turning from the window he stabbed a finger at natterman my decisions made were taking ilse back and my father is in command from this point forward natterman opened his mouth to continue but the corpulent forger flung open the bedroom door and waddled into the room all done he announced excellent work if i do say so myself natterman stared at hauer in silent fury then he stormed into the bedroom and slammed the door the forger held the fruits of his labor beneath the overhead light for hauers inspection the passport bore two excellent frontal shots of hans and hauer taken against the screen in the bedroom both wore fashionable jackets provided by the forger and looked every inch wealthy business m greg iles men at hermanns suggestion hauer had shaved his mustache it was the first time he had seen himself without it in twenty years he looked ten years younger with an artists eye hermann had quickly noted the resemblance between hans and hauer and had suggested they travel as father and son that way hed said they would only have to remember one surnameweber they are good hauer agreed the best youll find east of brussels hermann assured him youre lucky germans dont need visas for south africa i didnt have one to work from start the car hans hauer commanded hans was gone in an instant hauer picked up the passports and slipped them into his coat pocket arent you forgetting something he said to the forger hermann made a painful grimace it was bad enough being forced to work for itee but to be robbed the mind simply boggled the consequences of refusal however were unthinkable eight years ago hauer had sent the forger to berlins moabit prison where he had endured six years of living hell upon release he had resettled in hamburg to escape hauers prying eyes but it hadnt worked hauer had kept abreast of his current activities and hed made it painfully clear tonight that one phone call to hamburg could put hermann right back into prison for another stretch what the hell hermann rationalized ten thousand marks isnt too high a price forfreedom he could make back the money on just four passports he walked to the sofa reached into his leather camera bag and brought out a stuffed manila envelope after counting the banknotes hauer slipped them into his pocket nice doing business with you again hermann he said now i want you to wait for me right here he slipped into the bedroom and closed the door professor natterman sat fuming on the strip mattress holding his hand against his bandaged nose professor said hauer here is where we make our peace im going to south africa to bring back your granddaughter i could simply walk out of here but i realize that would be stupid you know things that could help me the question is will you natterman said nothing hauer went on anyway he needed the professors information but he also wanted to leave the old man some dignity i dont trust that forger he said i need an hours head start on him i want yo make sure he stays here at least that long once hes gone shut the cabin take your things and drive that jaguar back to berlin the car belongs to a man nwned ochs heres his card that cars shot to pieces natterman protested you shot it hauer reminded him just get it back to him hes a jew hell understand after youve delivered the car stock up on enough food to last a week then get hold of any research materials youll need to answer questions about prisoner number seventhe egyptian god bennu south africa and anything else you think might be relevant ten hours from now i want you by your office telephone continuously sleep by it ive got to know i can count on you outside the borrowed audi rumbled to life with a last look at natterman hauer left the old man sitting on the bed he glared at the forger as he passed through the front room dont get anxious and try to leave too soon hermann the forgers eyes bulged hauer turned behind him stood professor natterman the doublebarreled mannlicher in his hands hauer offered his hand auf wiedersen professor be careful eh after a moments hesitation the old historian took hauers hand and squeezed hard you bring my granddaughter back captain you have my word and you bring back those papers hauer nodded once then he ducked out of the cabin natterman heard a car door slam then the roar of the audi as it raced up the access road hermann rascher stared at the old man mystified by the scene he had just witnessed you know professor he said theres really no reason for us to hang around here while natterman jabbed the shotgun into the fat mans belly sit down swine hermann sat aal us army headquarters west berlin colonel rose stared into the expectant faces of sergeant clary and detective schneider clary nodded once indicating that the tape reels were turning rose spoke into the telephone this is colonel rose go ahead colonel this is blueblood calling repeat blueblood rose gasped its harry where the hell are you dont say anything sir

filled his lenox shot glass and poured the whiskey down his throat feeling his eyes water when it hit bottom friggin rudolf hess he muttered and zinoviev who the hell is zinoviev i beg your pardon colonel schneider asked who are you talking about nobody rose mumbled some commie sonofabitch he could not have been further from the truth a m mi headquarters charles street london england the door to sir neville shaws office shook with the force of wilsons knock one moment your lordship shaw said into the telephone what is it wilson the deputy director stuck his head into the office its that woman he sniffed meaning swallow she said shed wait one more minute and then shes leavin i tell her i wont be a moment wilson sighed with exasperation and withdrew im sorry your lordship shaw apologized where were we your career replied a deep voice with a vintage oxbridge accent shaw was briefly reminded of alec guinnessit is felt neville in some quarters that you have bungled this whole affair from the beginning it was nearly a year ago that some of us suggested that you act to prevent just this sort of mess sir neville bridled if theyd torn the bloody prison down last year the very same thing would have happened i couldnt control what the man wrote for gods sake this riposte was met with riosty silence yes the voice said finally well what about the african end of the problemt its being taken care of two or days at the most a lot could happen in thine days neville we want every loose end snipped every erased its being done shaw insisted are there any complications we should know aboutt shaw thought of jonas stern and of swallow waiting just outside his door no he lied keep us posted then the caller rang off shaw exhaled a great blast of air and began to massage his temples with his fingertips he badly needed sleep he had spent five of the past six hours on the telephone across london in places like the india club the house of lords and the allengland lawn tennis and croquet clud across britain in the ramshackle palaces and crumbling stone castle outposts of the aristocracyprivileged men and women both young and old were gathering in quiet councils like ripples spreading outward from the epicenter of buckingham palace waves of apprehension rolled through this most rarefied level of society and all shaw reflected because one little stone had dropped far away in the atrophied heart of berlin slowly but surely those frightened men and women were bringing a great deal of pressure to bear on sir neville shaw for shaw like his predecessors before him was not only the possessor but also the protector of their dark secret most of the calls had been like the previous onea bit of carrot bags of stick shaw was about to rise and go to his liquor cabinet for a medicinal glenfiddich when his office door opened and wilson ushered in the woman codenamed swallow sir neville was stunned the woman standing before him looked nothing like the photo in the file hed been studying ah miss gordon isnt it he stammered as wilson withdrew from the office swallow did not respond im told you insisted on seeing me personally he tried again mind telling me why still swallow held her silence she obviously felt the burden of explanation lay on the man who had called for her services thoroughly discomfited shay looked down at the file the woman in the photo looked like a grandmother a bluerinsed clubwoman who spent her sundays baking biscuits for the church the woman who stood before him now looked like well shaw had never quite seen the analogue that would describe her swallow had iron gray hair cropped lose against her skull perfect for wearing wigs she carried none of the excess fat that weighted most women her age and there shaw paused for looking at swallow now he couldnt quite get his mind round the fact that she had been in the war shed been practically a child of course but it was downright eerie the file put her at sixtyone but she looked nearer fifty as he stared the scent of perfume wafted to him this single acknowledgment of femininity surprised him he couldnt name the fragrance but it smelled expensive and vaguely french to be honest shaw mused he might have been attracted to swallow if it wasnt for what he knew about her no he decided even if hed imown nothing of her fiendish work her eyes would have put him off they were like stones dull flat stones not that they communicated intellectual dullnessquite the contrary they were rather like slate lids on a blast furnace protecting those outside from the fierce hatred that burned behind them that hatred had probably served swallow well through the years shaw reflected for by trade she was an assassin yes well he began again did wilson tell you this regards jonas stern swallow nodded soberly what id like is for you to follow him see what hes up to his last known location was berlin but hes probably on the move hes traveling under his own name which seems odd so he must not feel hes in any danger swallow smiled at that as soon as we pick him up well put you onto him we think hes trying to get hold of something something that wed prefer the jews didnt get hold of understood perfectly said swallow she had after all done her part against the zionist terrorists of palestine shaw cleared his throat yes well what kind of payment would you want would twenty thousand pounds cover it swallows eyes hooded over at this it struck shaw just then that from swallows perspective they had come to the point of the meeting what i want she said in a toneless voice is jonas stern when your little operation is over i want a free hand with him shaw had no illusions as to what this meant swallow wanted official permission to kill an israeli citizen he knew the answer to his next question but he asked it anyway what was it exactly that stern did to you killed my brother she replied in a voice that could have come from a corpse that was quite some time ago wasnt it shaw commented and every year since my brother has lain in his grave the furnace heat behind swallows eyes flashed at the edges they scarcely found enough of him to bury bloody jews shaw nodded with appropriate solemnity yes well your condition is accepted he drummed his fingers on his desk tell me whats your feeling about stern as an agent hes the best i ever saw if he wasnt hed have been dead long ago hes got the instincts of a bloody clairvoyant any ideas on his motive why he would leave israel now swallow considered this to protect it she said at length israel is his weakness he must believe the country is in imminent danger i see is israel in danger not that im aware of shaw replied thoughtfully not any more than usual as swallow stood thinking shaw noticed that she stood with a vaguely military bearingnot tensely but with a relaxed kind of readiness rather like some special forces types he had known they had all been men of course is there anything else then she asked shaw flipped through the files on his desk with exaggerated casualness there is as a matter of fact another job a small one domestic job actually i thought you might take care of it for us but its a rush job it must be done by tonight swallows eyes narrowed in suspicion who is it chap named burton michael burton retired lives in a cottage outside haslemere in surrey raises orchids i believe im afraid he knows too much for his own good sir neville cleared his throat again there is one possible complication hes only fortyeight retired special air service at this swallow seemed to withdraw into herself for consultation with whatever demon sustained her startlingly youthful appearance at length she asked does he have any family divorced theres a brother why do you ask is he sas also shaw shook his head regular army but hes out of the country permanently he lost his citizenship papers some years ago for mercenary work he wont be a problem would you want it to look like an accident can you run up an accident in haslemere by tonight swallow made a sound in her throat that shaw heard as a dry chuckle i doubt it sas men dont have accidents like that as a rule theyre trained not to they can drive swim run shoot i dont care how its done then shaw flared just do it whats your price a satisfied smile touched the corners of swallows mouth she liked to see bureaucrats squirm my price is protection from the israelis after stern is dead christ shaw exploded we cant babysit you forever you kill stern at your own risk swallows eyes turned opaque dont play coy with me little knight your hands are bloody too by lulling stern im only doing what you want done you picked me because you lmew if he had to be liquidated you could blame his death on my vendetta she raised her chin deflandy if you try the israelis will certainly get me but not before i kill you shaw drew back unconsciously ill kill your sas man for you she went on but youll cover for me on stern otherwisei might warn this mr burton instead condition accepted shaw snapped now get out all communication from this point forward will be through cutouts no further contact between you and this office swallow made a mock curtsey and backed out of the room that witch should have been codenamed medusa shaw thought angrily she makes my b skin crawl when he closed swallows file his eyes fell on the hess dossier lying open beneath it he sighed heavily there lay the dreaded file like a modern domesday book a lexicon of heroism and treason the highest and lowest expression of the english soul and looking at it shaws anger anger that had been building for a very long timefinally boiled to the surface for if the truth were told hewould prefer to turn swallow loose on the smug quislings and their moribund broods who for decades had cowered behind the shield of his service he had no part in their crimes or their guilt and he felt no pity for them or their honor but what of england he did have a stake in her honor he had been only a child during the war but in those heady years after hitler was crushed and all the years since he had allowed himself to feel a part of the grand legendwhat one british historian called the churchillian myththat in the early desperate days of the war england all alone had stood united uncompromising and unconquerable against the nazis and had thus saved western civilization from the hun and the bolshevik but that shaw had learned to his eternal sadness was not quite the truth then the truth be damned he thought bitterly he understood the protective urge of the aristocrats england had given the world so much she deserved a little moral charity part myth though churchills history might be the craven machinations of a few spineless lords or god forbid a fool of a prince could not be allowed to tarnish it if a treacherous shadow dogged the house of windsor should it also stain the legacies of plantagenet and tudor and hanover and what of the good people in the war the women who fought the fires in the blitz the callow lads whose shattered spitfires practically clogged the channel in the kids who crouched under the buzz bombs and the vs the martyred population of coventry as he poured himself a large whiskey shaw recalled the famous quote churchill spoke after the battle of britain but he twisted it to his own secret knowledge never in the field of human conflict have so many nearly lost so much because of so few shaw hated them hated them all appeasers knights without courage nobles without nobility because of them good men had died and more were soon to follow the man swallow would kill tonight had but done his duty it was the familiar chorus of english history the good men had died while the scoundrels prospered treason doth never prosper whats the reason shaw muttered quoting the old epigram for if it prosper none dare call it treason yet in the midst of his furious meditation shaw felt a glimmer of satisfaction because if all his machiavellian stratagems failed and the temple came tumbling down around his ears the judases would finally be unmasked and the most heroic chapter in the history of his noble ser would be brought to light at last shaw drained his scotch and fell instantly asleep with his head on his desk blotter chapter seventeen am tho nifrmb cabin near wollsbarg frg hermann the forger was gone after forty nerveracking minutes under the gaze of professor nattermans shotgun the bearish hamburger had gathered up his equipment and scampered out of the cabin without a word the professor sat in his chair contemplating the nights events as the dawn filtered through the shattered cabin door he had never felt so impotent in his life his lifelong friend had been murdered the spandau papers had been taken from him his granddaughter had been kidnapped and he had been unable to prevent any of it from happening and now the two men who proposed to stop the madness had refused his help cradling the mannlicher under one arm he picked up his book satchel and walked out of the cabin without looking back his suitcase lay in the slushy rut where the audi had been parked in their haste hans and hauer had not even taken the time to bring it into the cabin the shotriddled jaguar waited behind the trunk of the old plane tree natterman walked over and looked inside to make sure the keys were still in the ignition tossing his satchel into the passenger seat he retrieved his suitcase then wriggled into the car and turned the key in spite of the damage the engine roared responsively he left the jaguar idling and clumped through the snow to the rear of the cabin in the shade of a tall cedar a juryrigged crucifix marked the shallow grave of karl riemeck with bowed head natterman laid the shotgun against the cross and softly spoke a few lines from heine over his friend then he shuffled back to the rumbling jaguar jammed it into first gear and sped up the access road a the morning sun had already transformed the twisted iz into a morass of slush and mud that threw the speeding car from one bank to another as it approached the main road two curves away from the intersection the professor saw a black log lying across the lane when he swerved to avoid it the jaguar skidded out of control and slammed nose first into some saplings it rebounded from their springlike trunks and coughed into silence he staggered out of the car and cautiously approached the log just as he bent to drag it out of the lane he heard a crack in the trees behind him ke he wondered no he stumbled back thinking he would get the mannlicher from the car then he remembered dropping it at karls grave with panic knotting inside his chest he scrambled toward the jag planning to drive around or even over the log to get to the main road he had one leg inside the car when a voice froze him motionless herr professor natterman whirled but saw nothing herr professor may i speak with you for a moment again where had the voice come from the brush on the opposite side of the road the trees further on natterman tried to calm himself might a neighbor have come out to investigate last nights shots in the light of morning these days even country people left such things to the police backing against the jaguar he called whos out there what do you want only to speak with you the voice replied i mean you no harm come out then why do you hide yourselp a tall darkskinned man stepped noiselessly from the trees twenty meters up the road one has to be careful he said and then he smiled i wouldnt want to wind up like your afrikaner friend natterman stared fearftilly at the stranger he felt he knew the man from somewhere suddenly he had it youre the man from the train he cried stern the israeli smiled you have an excellent memory professor my god did you follow me here natterman took a step back toward the jaguar are you in league with the afrikaner i yes i followed you here no im not in league with the afiikaner im here to help you professor natterman pointed a finger at the israeli what happened to your british accent stern chuckled it comes it goes you must have been here last nigh why didnt you help me i did help you i stopped that altikaner from going back inside the cabin and killing you by the time id finished dealing with him your polizei friends had arrived why didnt you come forward then for all i knew professor you had come here specifically to meet that afrikaner the same holds true for your friends i needed certain assurances about your motives youre mad natterman declared who the devil are you stern seemed to search for words call me a concerned citizen he said finally im retired but i keep myself wellinformed in the area that youve stumbled into with such dire consequences for yourself and your family and what area is that the security of the state of israel what natterman gaped are you a nazihunter youre not a historian stern laughed again professional jealousy professor dont worry im a historian of sorts but not like you youve studied history all your lifei have lived it natterman scowled and what have you accomplished my arrogant friend not enough im afraid what do you want from me everything you know about the document that sergeant apfel discovered in the ruins of spandeiu prison natterman paled buthow do you know stern glanced at his watch professor i havent been more than five hundred meters from those papers since they were discovered i know the britishand the russians are searching like mad for them i know about hauer apfel and your granddaughter i know you made a copy of the papers in your office at the free university which you mailed to a friend for safekeeping i know that hauer and apfel have taken away the six pages which were not stolen by the rikaner i know stop cried natterman where are the other three pages inmy pocket our afrikaner friend was kind enough to give them to me after a little friendly persuasion natterman shivered realizing that stern meant torture but ambition overpowered his fear give them back to me he demanded theyre mine stern smiled i hope you havent deluded yourself into believing that these papers belong to no single man now professor id like to ask you some questions natterman recoiled why should i tell you anything because you have no choice thats what everyone keeps telling me natterman grumbled i assure you professor if id wanted the papers i could have taken them any time in the last sixteen hours natterman felt a flash of anger but something told him stern was telling the truth the same instinct told him that to resist the israeli would be pointless that this man who had materialized out of the snow like a ghost would get the information he wanted one way or another all right he said grudgingly prisoner number seven stern said brusquely the papers prove he was not hess i believe they do the old historian said warily where was the double substituted hess picked up the double in denmark they flew to britain together the double was part of the plan all along hess bailed out the moment they reached the scottish coast over a place called holy island stern digested this quickly and his mission the double didnt know hesss mission only his own after hess bailed out the double was to fly on toward dungavel castle and await some sort of radio signal from hess if he received it he was to parachute down and impersonate hess for as long as he could sterns eyes narrowed and if he didnt receive the signal natterman smiled wryly he was to fly out to sea take cyanide and ditch the plane standard ss procedure stern smiled cynically nazi melodrama few occidentals have the nerve or the fanatical loyalty required to sacrifice themselves in cold blood the israelis eyes moved restlessly as he pieced the rest of the story together so when the double turned back and jumped he was disobeying orders he went ahead and impersonated hess as if he had received the signal and the british believed him natterman listened to these deductions in silence or perhaps they didnt believe him stern mused it doesnt really matter what matters is this who did the real hess fly there to see and why in gods name should anyone in south africa give a damn about it now that you know what the papers say said natterman what do you intend to do i told you professor my interest is not in the hess case sterns hand slipped into his trouser pocket fingered something there long before the death of prisoner number seven i had reason to investigate spandau my mmon had nothing to do with hesseverything to do with the safety of israel but until number sevens death gaining access to spandau was virtually impossible stern paused apparently conducting some debate with himself tell me professor he said suddenly does the spandau diary mention weapons or scientific materials of any type natterman blinked in confusion weapons herr stern the spandau diary has nothing whatsoever to do with any kind of weapons are you positive absolutely what is it suddenly first hauer badgers me about reunification now you ask me about weapon reunification stern asked sharply oh its nonsense natterman said these papers deal only with the hess case they are going to expose those who share responsibility for the scars on germanys national pridesterns suspicious face hardened im afraid theres new infection festering beneath those old scars he saidd coldly what the devil do you mean professor i dont care if youre after academic fame or if you want to ease germanys national guilt the israeli waved away nattermans protests i care about the past only insofar as it impacts the present nw the future the people who are after these papers are worried about a lot more than history books i tried to interrogate that afrikaner protect som professor he had the crazy eyes did you notice with only one arm he fought like a tiger and before he died he screamed something very startling at me it was in afrikaanswhich i dont speakbut i knew enough dutch to translate it roughly it was death to israel death to zion stern paused he didnt even know i was jewish natterman looked thoughtful he said something similar to me in the cabin he called me a jew maggot i believe stern raised an eyebrow you dont find that curious why should a south african have some fixation on jews or on israel i never considered it until now stern glanced back toward the main road as the drone of a heavy truck filled the woods tell me he said are hauer and apfel flying directly to south africa nattermans eyes grew wide you know their destination answer me natterman held out but a moment more yes he blurted my granddaughter is being held prisoner there the kidnappers instructed hans by phone to leave today from frankfurt with the spandau papers as ransom yes but hauer has some kind of rescue plan up his sleeve stern looked off into the dark forest frozen limbs cracked in the slowly rising sun icicles stretched earthward reaching it one drop at a time the diary is incomplete now he murmured who is aware of that no one nanerman confessed only you and i stern turned and eyed the professor appraisingly that is good for us but very dangerous for your granddaughter tell me what kind of man is this captain hauer tough very tough and the boy angry frightened to death untested stern nodded one thing has puzzled me from the beginning professor why has captain hauera man nearing retirement a man whose own personnel file shows him to be a member of a neofascist police organizationsacrificed his pension and possibly his life to help this apparently innocent young sergeant natterman smiled at the irony hauer is hanss father its a complicated family matter very few people know about it stern took a deep satisfying breath as if this last bit of information had completed some circle in his mind you must tell me who you are natterman demanded are you a spy are you really an israeli to the professors amazement stern turned suddenly on his heel and without a word marched down the lane toward the main road where are you going natterman cried south africa professor get that log out of the road if you want to come nattermans jaw dropped in astonishment but i have no in an hour you shall stern caued then he disappeared amnd the curve as the huffing professor wresded the rotted tree trunk over a snowdrift at the lanes edge he heard the sound of an approaching engine seconds later a big blue mercedes rounded the curve from the direction of the main road and stopped beside him at the wheel sat jonas stern in the backseat laid out and trussed like a christmas turkey hermann the forger jerked his head back and forth in impotent rage get in said stern i thought this fellow might come in handy so i invited him to stay for a while too surprised to speak natterman climbed into the car and stared back at hermann as they drove back to the cabin is the cabin phone still working stern asked natterman nodded ive quite a few calls to make but soon we shall be on a plane bound for israel and from there south africa why israel why not fly straight to south africa stern skidded to a stop before the battered cabin we have some packages to pick up now untie that fool while i get his equipment i have much to arrange before we can be on our way like a dazed recruit of eighteen the old historian followed the israelis orders a little afraid but grateful to be part of the chase at last pm sonnonalloo checkpoint american sedor west berlin harry richardson walked slowly toward the barrier post on the eastern side of the berlin wall in spite of kosovs assurances to colonel rose harry still halfexpected to be arrested at the checkpoint he walked quickly past the fmt german documentscontrol booth then stopped as instructed at the currencycheck station glancing right he saw two pale faces peering out of the warmly lit observation window one hovered above the red shoulder boards of a kgb colonel ivan kosov the other angrier face belonged to captain dmitri rykov a bad week altogether for the young chekist harry thought he tipped his head at rykov then walked on the gray sky had darkened harry could just make out the us army ford waiting on the american side of the wall parked beyond the harsh glow of the checkpoint area motor running beside the ford a restless line of cars and lorries waited to pass through the blocked checkpoint fifty yards closer the door to the west berlin customs booth opened suddenly and a young border policeman stepped out behind him emerged colonel rose wearing a long olivedrab greatcoat then came two men wearing civilian clothes and handcuffs followed by sergeant clary who carried a colt in his right hand harry heard footsteps behind him then felt kosovs hand grip his upper arm twenty seconds later seven men stood awkwardly around the whitepainted line that marked the absolute boundary between east and west berlinfive on the american side two on the soviet tonight protocols were few with a nod kosov signaled the two handcuffed soviet illegals to step over the line as they did he released his grip on harrys arm harry stepped across the line he breathed a heartfelt sigh of relief when clary clapped him on the back in welcome kosov looked at rose i commend your nerve in negotiating this exchange colonel your pragmatic style is somewhat surprising in an american next time however rose turned and marched away without a word sergeant clary and the border policeman followed him before harry could turn however kosov reached out and caught hold of his arm axel goltz is dead he growled does that bother you what bothers me is that i dont understand why he did what he did since you killed him i doubt very much that he worked for you and given that i must begin to take seriously the nationalistic drivel he spouted off before he shot corporal ivanov he mentioned something called phoenix i believe have you heard of this harry shrugged sure its about a hundred miles south of tucson isnt it kosov smiled coldly have it your way major i would prefer that our two services collaborate on the hess case all my country wants is for the truth to be exposed to the world when germany begins to stir even traditional enemies must join forces someone should have told stalin that in harry observed guten abend colonel he turned and jogged to the waiting ford while kosov fumed rykov emerged from the customs booth trailed noiselessly by a lean figure dressed from head to toe in black misha kosov muttered his voice hoarse with fury the young killer pricked up his ears like a hungry panther i think its time you paid a visit to the whore who showed us such disrespect show her that we keep our promises misha nodded and then with a swiftness that astonished rykov he melted into the gray dusk of the sonnenallee what now colonel asked rykov we wait kosov replied still staring after the americans im expecting a visitor fifty meters away harry climbed into the army ford and found a bearish man wearing a hat and civilian clothes waiting in the backseat he looked familiar but rose made no introductions sergeant clary swept across west berlin with the subtlety of a fire truck harry let his head fall back on the seat intending to savor his newfound freedom but rose gave him no respite the colonel heaved a beefy forearm back over the passenger seat and grinned okay harry what did you find out over there harry answered with his eyes closed i found out that whatever is in those spandau papers is important enough for a stasi agent to kill a kgb officer over it axel goltz said rose did you kill him he didnt leave me any choice the colonel nodded our east german sources said kosov went berserk when he found out he couldnt interrogate goltz he arrested every ranking stasi officer he could lay his hands on harry shook his head colonel goltz was no more afraid of kosov than a rabid dog would have been he acted as if he expected heinz guderians tanks to roll out of the black forest any minute and chase the russians right out of germany itd take more than that rose muttered every t tank in the ddr is on the move theyre running civilian vehicles right off the roads someone in moscow has decided that the germans need a lesson in humility maybe they do harry said softly did you pick up anything on the names i gave you zinoviev or phoenix yes and no rose shared a glance with the unidentified passenger in the backseat in the office harry harry nodded slowly okay in the silence that followed it became impossible for harry to ignore the man on the seat beside him finally rose acknowledged the stranger harry meet detective julius schneider of the berlin kriminalpolizei hes gonna be working with us for a while hes the guy who saved your ass says he knows you a pleasure detective harry shook schneiders bearlike paw i thought you looked familiar i owe you a very tall it is not necessary said the german okay okay rose grumbled lets adjourn this mutual admiration society and get up to my office the car had arrived in clay allee the thoroughly american boulevard named for the first us commandant of west berlin while sergeant clary returned the ford to the motor pool rose schneider and richardson made their way to the fourth floor rose took a seat behind his huge desk poured whiskeys all around and waited for clary to take up his post outride the door h opened the discussion so whats the big secret guys whos comrade zinoviev he isnt lenins zinoviev is he rose gave schneider a sidelong glance hy harry we dont know exactly who zinoviev is or was we dont know if hes dead or alive but i can guarantee you that comrade wasnt his preferred manner of address harry drummed his fingers impatiently christ tell me something rose took a pull from his wild turkey our computers didnt have squat on zinoviev harry zero i was tempted to put in a coded request to langleyyou know can we run a name through your sacred database blah blah but i never liked using those guys to me its kind of like going to the mafia theyre a little too greasy for my taste so what i ended up doing was calling an old buddy of mine stateside programs computers for the fbi he ran it through their setup for me and you wouldnt believe what their machine spit out surprise me rose smiled knowing that for once he would vv zinoviev was a captain in the okhrana ring any bells harry looked bewildered the tsars secret police give the boy an apple rose quipped the okhrana were the worlds original anticommunists they make joe mccarthy and his pals look like a pack of church ladies the question is what could a hitman for tsar nicholas possibly have in common with rudolf hess well harry reflected for one thing the okhrana carried out massive pogroms against the jews in russia both rose and schneider looked stunned look colonel said harry youre way ahead of me on this why dont you just back up and give me the readers digest version okay my fbi buddy punches zinoviev into the bureau computers right well up comes a file it gives the okhrana reference zinovievs date of birth but no death date it says he disappeared from sight in which was the year hess flew to scotland harry finished right well in zinovievs file was a codehcowhich im told stands for hardcopy only there was also a crossindex to another file hess you got it so my buddy goes for the hess file right and what does he find a bunch of crap you can get from encyclopaedia britannica but he also finds a notation showing a special addendum to hesss file with what the bureau calls a j classification want to guess what the j is for harrys face showed disbelief no way rose smiled thinly old j fdgar himself and j files cannot be accessed by anyone except the director christ what does the fbi have to do with rudolf hesst youre not gonna believe this harry remember the big soviet defections of the sixties and seventies nosenko penkovsky and the rest the cia handled their debriefings right naturally but if youll recall the fbi wasnt always limited to operations within the continental us during world war two hoover couldnt stand seeing bill donovans oss get all the glory and the resultaside from a lot of political headbuttingwas that the bureau got involved in some pretty big espionage cases soafter the cia finished debriefing those big defectors the fbi got themselves a little taste they were given a very limited brief of course questions to be confined to kgb recruitment methods on us soil et cetera harry nodded slowly however when the fbi got their shot at these defectors they took the chance to clean up some unfinished business they had quite a few unsolved cases from the war years and hoover had left instructions that they be pursued whenever possible one of those cases happened to involve british collaboration with the naziseg the flight of rudolf hess harry whistled long and low the fbi questioning turned up a shitload of information but as you might imagine the bureau wasnt anxious to reveal to the cia how far outside their brief they had strayed anything that couldnt te confirmed by collateral evidence was buried in the basement of a file warehouse hardcopy only get it apparently zinovidv fell into that category roses eyes shone with excitement those files have been sitting in that warehouse for twentyfive years my contact thinks our query is the first dung to turn up zinovievs name since it went to disk jesus what kind of access do we haver hesss file is out of the question a team of mit hackers couldnt break into a j file in a month rose suppressed a satisfied smile zinoviev on the other hand we may get my buddy is constantly updating the bureau files and it seems hes got legitimate access to the warehouse where the hardcopy only stuff is hes probably digging through zinovievs file right now harry looked skeptical colonel you realize that there may be nothing on zinoviev in that warehouse if zinoviev is crossindexed to hess his real file probably has a j classification too well find out soon enough rose concluded lets get to the heart of this messthe spandau papers harry glanced over at schneider i assume the berlin police have them not exactly said rose two berlin police officers have them rose consulted a file on his desk hans apfel sergeant age twentyseven dieter hauer captain age fiftyfive schneider here thinks one of these two must have stumbled over the papers while they were guarding the prison he says this guy hauers a real piece of workcounterterror training the works and he must be right not only have these two escaped the city theyve escaped germany they flew out of frankfurt two hours ago what how do you know that while schneider listened in silence rose summarized his actions after receiving harrys call rose had wanted to storm abschnitt with guns blazing but schneider had persuaded him to pursue a more discreet course the colonels compromise had been a city wide communications blanket of west berlin conducted by the army signal corps under the reserve powers held by the allies since the second world war assets nominally dedicated to the soviet target were reassigned to cover all police communications traffic entering or leaving berlin rose was grinning as he revealed his b ou h six hours ago it paid off harry we intercepted a call from the wolfsburg police to west berlin police hq a traffic unit stopped a man for speeding and reckless driving and because theyd received reports of shooting in the forest to the south the night before they made a routine search of the car they hit the jackpot the driver was a forger from hamburg right away the guy starts screaming how hes just been blackmailed into manufacturing false passports for two west berlin cops claimed he knew hauer personally and he described apfel to a t did he have any idea where they were headed f asked rose grinned that everpopular vacation spot the republic of south africa traveling as father and son the forger also made passports for two older guys who were with hauer and apfel but traveling separately he didnt know their true identities or their destination but he gave us the names and numbers on all four fake passports great who else knows that if our luck is holding almost nobody i called the berlin police presidium and used every authority short of the president to block the relay of that information to abschnitt i also let them know in no uncertain terms that id know if they tried harry sat in silence for nearly a full minute south africa he said finally is there anything that connects any of whats happened to south africa in any wayt as a matter of fact there is my little hightech offensive included pulling the telephone toll records of certain west berlin police facilities we found several calls from the police presidium going out to different numbers in south africa some of those calls were made from the office of the prefect himself holy shit do you have names to go with the numbers i should have them within twentyfour hours for once i happen to have an exotic contacta major in the south african secret service thats not soon enough colonel thats as soon as we can get it major and thats if were lucky harry stood youve got to get me down there colonel whatevers going down its going to happen there rose shook his head i cant send you harry why not you heard me thats not our turf of even close we cant prove that this thing endangers can also were not too popular down there right now in case you havent noticed not since sanctions were put in effect and half our industry pulled out of armys not going to let me send you down from here just because the soviets are interested they kidnapped me for christs sake theres something big going on colonel i can feel it the reason you cant find out anything about this phoenix is that it isnt based here it must be in south africa this isnt just some legacy from the past cant you feel it i feel it detective schneider said softly rose drained his second whiskey stood and laid his stubby hands flat on the desktop i feel it too harry but my hands are tied ive got half of bonn and all of berlin breathing down my neck to prevent any kind of international incident officially i cant do a thing harry stared curiously at rose he sensed some implied communication but he couldnt quite pin it down suddenly the answer came clear as ice water grant me two weeks leave colonel he said ive got it coming rose grinned that you do major that you do can you get me a military flight negative but its probably a fifteenhour flight by commercial carrier eleven on lufthansa rose corrected fourteen via south african air thats still too long youre lucky to get a flight at all harry most airlines only fly there once a week your flight leaves frankfurt at two pm tomorrow harry shook his head in exasperation then grinned in spite of himself by the time i get there i want some names tied to those telephone numbers youll have em abruptly rose slammed an open hand down on his desk his face showed puzzlement exhaustion frustration goddamnit harry what the hell is going on do the russians really care that much about something that happened fifty years ago harry looked thoughtful i know what you mean gorbachev has a hell of a lot bigger things on his plate than fiftyyearold mysteries i wouldnt think the truth about hess would help glasnost any the russian memory is long schneider said gravely and gorbachev has limited influence over kgb harry glanced at the german maybe but were missing the forest here were not talking ancient history the berlin police wouldnt give two shits about something like that were talking about a tie between the pasthesss past spandau phoenix and the present the here and now maybe zinoviev is connection whatever the connection is said rose ive got a feeling its pretty goddamn dirty i dont have to tell you how many friggin nazis our own government shielded from justice harry looked hard at both men for a few moments then he reached into his pocket drew something out and tossed it on rosesdesk the fragment of goltzs scalp landed upsidedown with a plop like a wet scab black flecks of blood stained the file on roses desk the colonel reached out to pick it up then jerked back his hand in disgust what the fuck is that goltz harry explained that was a shaved spot a little above and behind his right ear turn it over colonel rose looked up at harry with an expression that suggested he might be wondering if harry kept a vietcong ear necklace in his dresser at home i didnt have a camera harry muttered rose took a ballpoint pen from a stand and flicked the shriveled swatch of skin over revealing the tattoo it bore he made no sound as he studied it but schneider sucked in his breath so sharply that both men turned to him youve seen this mark before rose asked the german nodded yes its hard to detect once the hair grows back in the mark is invisible harry looked curiously at the german what the hells it mean rose demanded schneider shrugged certain members of a semisecret political group wear that mark the group is called der bruderschaftthe brotherhood quite a few policemen belong to it i dont know what the tattoo means i always thought it was just a badge of membership now and then youll see a policeman with a bandage behind his ear they always make some excuse but after a while you realize what it is sounds like some kind of friggin cult thing rose declared is it like the aryan brotherhood in the states harry shook his head the aryan brotherhood is made up of convicts not police theyre cop killers how many berlin cops have this mark a dozen a hundred more than a hundred schneider said thoughtfully but i never realized that it extended into the ddr thats very disturbing youre goddamn right it is rose agreed detective harry said softly do all members of der bniderschaft have the tattoo or just a select few a few who might belong to some truly secret group for instance like phoenix you mean mused schneider no i dont think all the members have the tattoo rose was staring strangely at schneider when harry realized why he couldnt help staring himself the big german scowled back at them no i dont have a tattoo under my hair he growled and the first man who asks to look is going to spend the night in the hospital when rose looked as if he might ask harry stood quickly thanks again for saving my life detective if you fellows dont mind im going to crash until takeoff time tomorrow rose finally shifted his attention to harry just remember he warned youll be going in blind down there what i told you about the british still holds no contact at all not even with your personal connections no ones above being manipulated by his governmentespecially ministers and lords not even me said harry and smiled wryly you worried about james bond catching up with me coloneit no im worried about some goddamn george smiley type a fat little guy with glasses whos five steps ahead of us already somebody who knows all about whatever happened back in germany in harry ruminated on this for a moment by the way colonel ivan kosov told me hed like to collaborate on the hess case when hell freezes over rose muttered well get to the bottom of this well ourselves harry grinned thats what i told him youd say schneider stood and offered his prodigious hand gluck haben major danke harry replied get the hell out of here rose bellowed ill brief you before you fly out harry sauntered out returning clarys sharp salute as he passed through the outer office what do you think rose asked when harry had gone i think i should go with him schneider said blun well you cant i need you here youve got a lot do before you get any rest mister such as such as helping me rout out the scum thats holed up in that police station schneider smiled coldly gut but first i want you to get over to that police sergeants apartment kpfel right talk to the guys wife we shouldve covered it hours ago but i couldnt spare you schneider stepped to the door and pulled on his heavy wool overcoat and schneider yes colonel sorry about that tattoo business im on edge if you stumble into trouble dont play hero okay i know you dont like americans messing around in your backyard but solos no way to fly on something like this you get me schneider nodded but as his broad back disappeared through the office door rose wondered how sincere the gesture really was chapter eighteen pm soviot sector ebt berlin odr in a black bmw parked two blocks from the redandwhite border posts of the sonnenallee checkpoint colonel ivan kosov sat in silent rage while a man in a twothousand dollar savile row suit berated him for blatant incompetence the man was yuri borodin himself a colonel and one of the brightest stars of the twelfth department of the first chief directorate of the kgb kosov hated everything about borodinhis undisguised arrogance his handtailored clothing his aristocratic family background and manner of speech his meteoric rise to high rankeverything it made the situation all the more difficult to bear so you think your men can handle a simple surveillance job borodin asked coldly da kosov grunted borodin looked out of the car window distractedly im afraid i do not share your faith major richardson will go to us army headquarters for debriefing then hell move wherever he goes that is where the missing polizei officers and your spandau papers are if indeed papers are what the young german found if it is papers id bet my career that the americans have them already i hope you do thought kosov what makes you think the americans have caught themhe asked and what makes you think major fiichardson was even working on the spandau case when my men captured him borodin switched to an upperclass english accent instinct old boy he said primly kosov wrinkled his lip in disgust you sound like an oxford professor with a pipe stuck up his ass and how would you know what an oxford professor sounds like borodin needled im just practicing the kings english comrade ill probably be needing it in the next few days someone tapped on the smokedglass window on the drivers side of the bmw kosov cranked down the window captain dmitri rykov stuck his head into the window theyve taken him to us headquarters rykov informed them eyeing borodin with curiosity ill be off then borodin said lightly where are you going asked kosov to pick up major richardson when he leaves army headquarters you dont really think i trust your chaps to stay on him do you no offense intended of course but how will you get there borodin smiled in this car of course but this is my personal car kosov exploded now now comrade borodin said relax this car belongs to the people doesnt it i need a carthis ones available youll get it back eventually now out of the car i must be on my way koso hauled himself out of the vehicle and slammed the v d door behind him borodin didnt even notice he roared up to the checkpoint not the slightest bit nervous about his false papers borodin was twelfth department and twelfth department always got the best dmitri rykov stared dumbfounded at his superior he had never seen ivan kosov allow someone to run roughshod over him like that who was that man colonel kosov stared after his receding bmw someone you will get to know very well in the next few days dmitri he turned to rykov you still have your travel papers yes comrade colonel good i want you to cross into the american sector and go to us army headquarters there you will find the man you just saw steal my bmw youre to follow him and report his every movement back to me do you have any credit cards rykov nodded with enthusiasmamerican express gold card kosov scowled captain rykov i am authorizing you to spend whatever is necessary to follow that man wherever he goes yes sir anywhere in the world kosov added rykovs chest swelled as he absorbed the import of kosovs words this had to be something big something that could make a career his name said kosov quietly is yuri borodin hes a colonel in the twelfth department rykov paled do you wish me to find someone else captain rykov cleared his throat nyet comrade colonel dmitri rykov is your man then get your ass over to the checkpoint and find out what cover borodin used to cross ill call a car for you kosov laid a hand on rykovs shoulder keep your eyes open for someone named zinoviev hes either a very old man or a very dead one call me as often as you can ill have more information on borodin for you thank you comrade colonel and dmitri about that tattoo the eye on goltzshead kosov lowered his voice it is the symbol of a oneeyed man i dont know his name but whoever he is hes at the center of this case the americans dont know anything about him and i dont think borodin does either so if you happen to meet a man with one eyea glass eye or even a patchyou are to call me immediately if you even hear of a oneeyed man involved with this case you call me rykov looked confused but he nodded now go ignoring his bruised leg rykov sprinted after the bmw kosov lit a camel cigarette and took a deep drag he held in the acrid smoke for a long time before he exhaled he felt better now much better when he smiled the expression made him look even uglier than he was pm ldtzenstrasse ivan kosovs blackclad assassin padded softy into ilses apartment building and slipped into the stairwell he was looking forward to paying back the german whore who had taunted him yesterday and he knew a hundred ways to extract his pound of flesh he only hoped that the old tarts young companion would be home with her she could prove very entertaining before she died it never ceased to amaze misha how cooperative women became after only the briefest acquaintance with his knife three floors above him eva beers leaned toward her bathroom mirror and pulled a stained bandage away from her cheek the laceration looked considerably worse than it had twelve hours before the skin hung slack in spite of her best attempts to smile or grimace last night when she had first got back to her apartment shed discovered that the lower half of her left cheek did not seem to be moving normally it disturbed her but she put the problem down to shock eva had been in her share of bar brawls and drawing on this experience she did a fair job of patching the deep gash inflicted by the young russian but now she worried the bleeding had long since stopped but the stubborn flesh to the left of her mouth still hung lifeless like that of a stroke victim replacing the bandage she decided to ignore kosovs warning and seek proper medical assistance she slipped on a housecoat and walked out to the front room of her modest apartment to check on ernst the tough old cabbie lay snoring on the sofa he had taken a bad beating and needed a doctor almost as badly as eva did she leaned over him listening to his irregular breaths his bruised and battered face made her furious again she had expected the russians to come back for her as soon as they realized she had lied about ilse but they hadnt lucky for them too she thought because for the remainder of last night and most of today some of her heavily built friends from her ratskeller days had hung around the apartment just in case the russians showed up an hour ago eva had thanked them and sent them on their way glad that no further trouble had visited kissing ernst lightly on his forehead she went back to her bedroom and pulled the door shut in her bureau drawer she found the number of an old general practitioner who not so long ago had run a quiet practice catering to smugglers addicts and young girls in trouble i hope hes still in business she thought she had no patience with emergency roomstoo many forms to fill out too many questions to answer she left the doctors number on the bureau and went into the bathroom to make up her face in the hallway outside the apartment misha inserted anethin tool into the door lock and picked it with ease eva had carelessly left the bolt unshot when her friends left but she had fastened the chain misha put his deceptively narrow shoulder against the door and leaned into it hard yanidng the chains anchorplate from the dooamb the noise of the screws pulling loose was minimal but enough to make the sleeping cabbie shift on the sofa mishas ears detected the rustle and after his eyes adjusted to the darkness he discerned the supine form he crossed the room silently and stared down bruises and a badly blackened eye distorted ernsts face but misha recognized the old man who had fought so tenaciously outside his taxi on the previous night as misha stared ernsts eyes flut open with the dreadful clarity of nightmares the old cabbie recognized the russian above him he opened his mouth to scream a warning to eva but misha snatched a threadbare pillow from the couch and slammed it over ernsts contorted face pressing down with all his strength in the bathroom eva heard nothing the battle being fought in her front room was desperate but soundless just when misha felt the old mans struggles begin to subside a hand shot upward and locked around his throat in a maniacal death grip the russian struggled to hold the smothering pillow in place not believing the old mans strength the bony fingers clutching his throat seemed to be probing for some hollow place where they could gain sufficient purchase to crush his windpipe misha had had enough the pillow had seemed a good idea at first but it was obviously too slow for this old lion fighting to breathe he held the illow in place with his right hand and drew his stiletto from its ankle sheath with his left a veteran of the streets ernst the cabbie knew what the snick of spring and steel meant but he rould fight no harder than he was already he felt the cold blade pierce his chest just below the sternum misha expertly twisted the blade across the midline marking the passage of the aorta the old man felt ice turn to fire he jerked spasmodically then his wrinkled hands slipped from mishasthroat i the russian gulped in huge lungfuls of air and shook his head to clear it he had not expected this battle then suddenly as the pillow slipped from the old mans livid face ernst somehow summoned a last measure of energy and cried outnot loudly but it was enough misha looked see evas bedroom door slam shut and hear the click of the bolt shooting home cursing he scrambled around the rooms baseboards until he found the telephone line running from the bedroom he severed the black wire two seconds after eva picked up the receiver in her roomsheathing his knife with a grin he charged the bedwom door the bolt did not give he stepped back and examined the door it had a heavy frame with two solid planks crossing with ur thinner sheets of in the middle but it was paneled with an above wood aiming at a spot on the upper right p eljust the knobmisha kicked hard splintering the brittle wooda second kick opened the hole he wanted he thrust his left hand through the jagged opening groping for the bolt with the sure eye of a seamstress eva drove the point of a brass letter opener through the back of the russians ex hand the shriek from the other side of the door did not even sound human mishas spasming hand jerked back through the splintered door panel taidng the letter opener with it devils whore he screamed wrenching the blade from his punctured hand youre dead eva did not own a gun and she was now truly terrified her attacker launched his body repeatedly against the door wwarning in animal rage still the bolt refused to give then suddenly the bloody hand reappeared through the hole and probed for the bolt the circular wound in its center made eva think of the hand of c st hyste c ly she hri ri al screamed some part of a childhood prayer and smashed a chair down on the bloody fingers the crack of bones made her shudder but it renewed her hope for survival unbelievably the hand tried for the bolt again again eva brought the chair down this time on the wrist misha howled like a madman enraged beyond feeling pain he withdrew his shattered hand backed up and took a flying kick at the spot where he judged the bolt to be this time the door crashed open with of terror streaming down her bandaged face eva backed toward the bedroom wall holding the small wooden chair in front of her like a lion tamer when she collided with her cluttered vanity table she felt her bladder let go she froze there transfixed by the predatory gleam in the russians eyes then he moved toward her breaking the spell eva swung the little chair in desperation but he parried it easily laughing he snatched the chair from her and tossed it aside the killing fever was on him now he closed on the shivering woman his bloodslickened knife dancing like a cobras head moaning in mortal terror eva lunged blindly hoping somehow to get past the russian she had no chance misha expertly channeled her momentum downward and pinned her against the floor his boot planted solidly between her shoulder blades he snatched her hair and jerked her head back pressing the knife blade to her throat his fractured bones seared with agony but he thought he could hold the blade steady long enough to drag it across the stubborn womans throat he dangled the bright blade before her rolling eyes you know whose blood that is woman he rasped in russian go on you bastard she screamed do it misha pressed the blade against her throat trying for a firmer grip with his wounded hand suddenly a roar like that of a black forest bear filled the room misha looked up in surprise a huge form blocked out the light as it charged toward him it was schneider the big detective had just gotten off the elevator and started toward ilses flat when he heard misha kick down the bedroom door he raced toward the noise saw ernsts bloodsoaked corpse on the sofa bed and continued his headlong charge into the bedroom misha flung his arm up and tried to hold his knife steady but schneiders momentum bowled him over like a child he tumbled back against the vanity and landed in a sitting position dazed he transferred his knife to his good hand and got up onto his knees schneider backed off slightly crouching in a classic knife fighters stance eva scrambled unsteadily to her feet and stood a fewfeet behind him run she shouted heres the door behind you get out schneider ordered ill call the police eva cried searching hysterically for her useless phone dont call anyone schneider snapped go downstairs having regained some of his faculties misha rose into a low crouch and moved out from the vanity smiling n you should have brought a knife he taunted in gerrnanschneider snatched a sheet from the bed and twisted it quickly around his left arm as he had been taught to do against an attacking dog he circled carefully waiting for the russians lunge he knew it would come soon with a cry misha feinted left then struck hard driving the point of the knife upward toward the gerfnans huge chest more like a mongoose than a bear schneider parried the outstretched blade with his sheetwrapped arm and darted out of danger in the same movement he rammed his mammoth right fist into mishas eye socket as the russians body followed his knife thrust the blow felled kosovs assassin like a rotted oak when misha regained consciousness four minutes later his right eye had swollen shut a distant voice in his brain told him that he would soon have his vision back but the voice was wrong schneiders impacting fist had so suddenly increased the pressure inside the russians eyeball that it literally exploded at its weakest pointin mishas case around the optic nervescrambling the delicate contents into jelly with his good eye misha saw the big german speaking into a telephone beyond an open door he heard the name rose but it meant nothing to him a disheveled blond woman with a white bandage on her face imelt over a sofa weeping softly misha tried to rise but found that his feet were tightly bound with telephone wire his hands too were tied that was really unnecessary he thought distantly since his mangled left hand and wrist had swollen to twice normal size he heard the big man speak angrily into the phone then slam it down schneider strode through the splintered bedroom door and looked down youve got some friends coming to see you he said then he walked back to the womanand lid a comforting hand on her shoulder the next thilig misha would remember was four men in white medical coats lifting him onto a stretcher he felt strangely comforted by this until he spied the olivedrab of american army uniforms beneath the when he tried to rise a strong hand pressed him firmly back onto the stretcher the hand belonged to sergeant clary mishas short violent career was over just over a mile to the east of eva beerss apartment captain dmitri rykov sprinted up to a phone box and punched in the number of kgb headquarters in east berlin he got an answer after two rings is colonel kosov back yet he asked breathlessly no who is this rykov shut up and listen tell kosov that borodin followed major richardson to his apartmentnot just to it but into it im outside now but im going back up the buildings in wilmersdorf about three blocks north of the fehrbelliner platz zahringerstrasse i think its a really expensive building kosov can trace it sixth floor have you got that i think so replied a nervous voice but would you repeat it on tape i just got the recorder rolling christ rykov repeated his message for the tape then he dashed back into the lobby of harry richardsons apartment building pm hasiomere surrey england swallow arrived at michael burtons tileroofed cottage just as it started to rain she climbed out of the ford fiesta which shed rented at gatwick airport and puttered up the walk carrying a bright blue umbrella in her other arm was a clipboard and a large tin cupthe bona fides of a charity worker she rang the bell but there was no answer seeing no lights in the windows she went round back and there she spied the yellowlit hothouse that burton had constructed from secondhand lumber and thick sheets of clear painters plastic the hothouse glowed like an island of summer in the chilly dusk swallow walked right up to it and finding the door open stepped inside it was incongruous somehow the tall rangy excommando standing among the fragile orchids the artificial warmth of the hothouse after the bracing evening air humidifying heaters hummed somewhere out of sight rain pattered on the plastic above their heads the cloying scent of orchids masked even swallows distinctive perfume burton looked up suddenly startled but he relaxed when he realized that his visitor was a woman a village matron by the look of her probably colleeting for the orphans or something he watched her shake off her umbrella and lean it against a twobyfour stud what can i do for you he asked in a kindly voice swallow had meant to shoot him through her handbag but when her hand went into her purse the exsas man perceived what almost no one else would an involuntary narrowing of the eyes a slight tensing of the arm that suggested a shooting posture swallow was too far away for burton to attack herwhieh his training told him to doso he spun away toward the doublelayered plastic wall of the hothouse he snatched up a sharp spade in his right hand as swallow fired hitting him in the shoulder he dropped behind the line of a planting table slashed open the plastic wall with the spade and plunged through it into the yard swallow darted to the opening and knelt in a textbook shooting stance preparing to fire again as burton fled across the lawn but burton did not flee having judged it too long a mn over open ground the excommando stabbed the spade back through the plastic missing swallows throat by inches stunned she aimed at his blurred silhouette and shot him again this time in the chest the impact blew burton backward onto the glistening turf swallow stepped through the rent in the plastic wall and stood over him he was gasping and she could hear the pitiful wheeze of a sucking chest wound the last words michael burton spoke were not the names of his exwife his children his mother or his brother in the gathering dusk he raised his head choked out hess then he fell back and gurgled shaw you bloody bastard but only swallow was there to hear him four seconds later she shot him in the forehead turned and walked calmly back across the lawn toward the cottage leaving burton lying in the rain with potting soil on his fingers andthe smell of orchids seeping out of the little hothouse like a soul as she drove back toward gatwickwhere she had a seat reserved on the next flight to tel avivt struck swallow why sir neville shaw had wanted michael burton dead no doubt it had been burton who four weeks ago had slipped over the wall of spandau prison during the american watch month stuffed a forged suicide note into rudolf hesss pocket and strangled him with an electrical cord but swallow had no interest in this unless at some future date it might give her leverage over shaw to her the man who murdered rudolf hess was merely a way station on the road that led to jonas stern chapter nineteen pv zahringerstrasse west berlin julius schneider wished hed taken the stairs the elevator war an old hydraulic model slower than walking when the doors finally opened he hurried into the green carpeted hallway and toward the corner that led to apartment e number colonel rose had given him over the phone the colonel had said littleno more than a choked command to appear at this address as soon as humanly possiblewhen schneider rounded the corner he saw sergeant clary standing guard outside the door to apartment clarys right hand rested on the butt of the in his belt his taut face revealed nothing schneider remembered the young man only an hour before at eva beerss flat grinning with satisfaction at taking a kgb killer into custody clary looked like he couldnt grin now if he wanted to inside sir he said as schneider approached danke the german replied and passed through the door even if the corpse had not been lying in the foyer schneider would have felt the presence of death in the apartment he smelled gunpowder and burmt flesh the overheated air hung with that foul stillness that schneider had long ago learned to breathe only shallowly when exposed to it too much of that reek could poison a mans soul but the corpse was there lying on its stomach a small bullet holeprobably an entrance woundstained a dark spot between the shoulder blades without hesitation schneider rolled the body over dmitri rykov stared up with sightless eyes well said a strained voice schneider looked up at colonel godfrey rose the american had an unlit cigar clamped between his teeth his face was gray and haggard isnt he the russian from the sonnenallee checkpoint schneider asked yeah clary got a telephoto shot of him standing outside the customs booth schneider nodded is this why you called me here rose shook his head then turned and disappeared down a short dark hallway the german followed the familiar weight of mortality in his belly when he saw what awaited in the bedroom a cold dread began to seep outward from his heart harry richardson sat wideeyed in a wooden chair facing the bedroom door he was naked the chair sat in a pool of blood thin nylon ropes bound harrys arms and legs to the chair a pair of navy blue dress socks had been stuffed into his mouth schneider immediately noticed the cluster of small red circular marks on richardsons chest cigarette burns schneider had worked his share of child abuse cases just below the burns three lateral slashes trisected the abdomen not deep but bloody and probably unbearably painful but the head was the worst carved into harry richardsons high forehead was a jagged red swastika rivulets of sticky blood streaked down from the arms of the broken cross into harrys open eyes across his lips schneider had to remind himself to start breathing again what happened he asked in german colonel rose stood in the far corner of the room his legs slightly apart planted as firmly as trees in the earth he held his arms folded across his chest you tell me he said his voice distant almost nonhuman thats why i called you goddamn it schneider muttered why havent you closed his eyes youre the homicide detective i wanted you to see the crime scene before we touched him maybe youll see something i dont schneider looked around the room it had been torn to pieces by someone who knew how to conduct a rapid search what about your people roses eyes narrowed you said you wanted to help me schneider heres your chance the german squinted at rose then shook his big head slowly colonel a homicide investigation is a team proce i need fingerprint men photographers forensic technicians i dont care about all that crap rose retorted i could have hightech coming out the wazoo if i wanted it im interested in your gut your trieb remember with a surreal sense of dislocation schneider walked a slow circle around the room keeping his eyes on richardsons naked body all the time he noted several facts at oncethe obvious but schneider was a great mistruster of the obvious too often plain facts concealed more subtle truths the cause of death seemed plain enough a bullet hole in the back of the neck small caliber fired into the fragile bones of the cervical spine an execution that harry had resisted death was also plain his skin had been burned by the ropes that held him fast schneiders eyes found harrys lifeless gray orbs just once and he looked away quickly there was nothing to be found there but the frozen moment of stunned horrormore animal than humanthat schneider had seen more times than any man should last came the messageif message it was drawn in the pool of blood beneath harrys right foot like a childs fingerpainting was a small but clear capital b harrys right great toe was stainedscarlet like a blunt pen dipped in a well of blood after the b came a curved line that could have been the start of another letterperhaps a lowercase rebut in the midst of forming it harry must have been shot for a tangential line arced sharply outward as if the foot drawing it had been flung wide in spasm schneider crouched and examined the first letter there was no mistaking it it was a b or nothing with a long last look at the second letter the big german stood carefully closed harrys eyelids and walked back to the front room the air was breathable there roses marching feet echoed behind him what do you make of it rose asked dead russian dead american schneider replied none of my business im making it your business who do you think did it someone in a hurry im not in the mood for games schneider the german took a huge breath exhaled all right someone broke in here surprised richardson tortured him for information and was surprised by the russian in the front the russian tried to run the killer shot him in the back after getting his informationr not getting itthe killer executed richardson and left schneider sighed how did you find out about it anonymous call guy had a british accent clary and i hauled ass over here found harry and sealed the place off schneider digested this in silence what about that swastika rose asked schneider shrugged a bullet in the neck is a dachaustyle execution rose pointed out ssstyle they do it the same way in lubyanka yeah rose muttered so you dont think its the germans not phoenix or the brotherhood or whatever neonazi wackos harry pissed off when he killed goltz why would germans do dais schneider asked even der bruderschaft or if they did why would they leave a swastika why not the red eye why leave anything at all they would know you americans would go mad with rage how could that help them if you implemented onefourth of your reserve powers berlin would become beirut why this why that rose grumbled why would the fucking stasi kill a kgb officer and bring the whole weight of the kgb down on their heads nothing makes sense since yesterday schneider maybe they want us to crack down on berlin maybe they think that would spark big protests against continued occupation rose rubbed his forehead anxiously the scary thing is i cant do a damned thing about this five minutes before that anonymous call i received an order to cease and desist all investigations pertaining to spandau prison or rudolf hess a faint smile touched the corners of schneiders lips who gave you that order colonel it came from on high my friend what we call echelons beyond reality if you ask me washingtons covering for the goddamn brits you mean the letters on the floor damn right harry was obviously trying to tell us who did this and it seems to me that b and r are the first two letters of british schneider sucked in his breath colonel im not sure that second letter is an r it could be a c or even an o if it is an r richardson could have been trying to wr bruderschaftthe brotherhood phoenix maybe rose admitted but you just told me you didnt think germans did it make up your mind will you he paused in thought no that swastika is just too goddamn obvious this case revolves around spandau and hess weve got a dead russian and a dead american in my book that leaves the brits not the germans schneider raised an eyebrow an anonymous caller using a british accent is just as obvious as that swastika also we cant discount the possibility that the murderer himself drew those letters in the blood to mislead us the german sighed uncomfortably colonel is it possible that men from your own government could have done this is rose looked up sharply schneider ive been in this mans army all my life but if i believed what you just suggested id take this story straight to the fucking new york times schneider believed him so what are you going to do if your own people wont help you on the hess case youre stuck you ought to know me better than that by now rose countered he lifted an arm and pointed back down the hall i liked that man back there he said soffly he served his country in war and he served it in what the politicians like to call peace roses cheek twitched with the intensity of his anger whoever did that to himbrit german whoeverhe and his bosses are going to pay like they never dreamed in all their worthless goddamn lives i wont rest until they do just then clary knocked twice quickly on the door then opened it schneiders mouth fell open silhouetted in harry richardsons apartment door was the stocky trenchcoated figure of colonel ivan kosov the russian took two steps into the foyer and bent over the body of dmitri rykov when he looked up schneider saw points of black fire flickering in his eyes fury crackled off him like static electricity stunned schneider turned to rose for an explanation i called him rose confessed if my own people wont help me by god ill take help where i can find it schneider peered into roses eyes why am i really here colonel he asked quietly and then suddenly he knewrose had been forbidden to pursue the spandau case using his own men so he had called schneider here to pick up the torch harry richardson had dropped it made scfineider angry that the american thought he needed cheap theatrics to motivate him he had wanted to go to south africa with richardson all along funk luhr goltz these men were minions corrupt servants of an insidious power creeping into germany from without stopping them would be a temporary victory at best whoever they served was the true enemy to unite officers of the stasi and the polizeisworn enemieswould take a truly monstrous power and to kill a monster schneider knew you cut off its head not its hand with a glance back at kosovs kneeling figure he caught rose by the arrn and pulled him back into the room where harrys corpse sat baking in the dry heat ill go to south ahica colonel he growled but i dont like being manipulated you should have sent me in the first place you want to find two german cops send a german cop schneider jerked his thumb toward the front room but i report to you not him understood i trust you alone not your government not kosov not his government just you agreed detective rose pulled harrys airplane ticket from his pocket and handed it to the german from now on all expenses will be paid out of my personal bank account he lowered his voice your flight leaves at two pm tomorrow ill brief you just before you leave now if you dont mind i need to talk a little shop with my new russian friend schneider turned ivan kosov stood motionless in the bedroom door his eyes riveted on harry richardsons mutilated head he made no sound schneider stuffed the plane ticket into his coat pocket and moved toward the door at the last moment kosov stepped aside schneider paused looked back at harry then looked into the russians eyes lohg enough for kosov to read the message there i hate russians as much as you hate germans it said i blinded your little black assassin and i havent ruled you out as a suspect in this either schneider walked on he understood colonel roses motives this was a marriage of expediency nothing more politics as ever made strange bedfellows rose didnt trust his russian counterpart any more than schneider did but the two professionals had much in common theyre like a pair of fathers grieving over murdered sons schneider thought as he trudged down the stairs a pair of very dangerous fathers kosov had looked even angrier than rose if that was possible schneider only hoped the two men realized what they and hewere up against eighteen hours ago harry richardson had practically scalped a stasi agent in an east berlin street tonight he was slated for a closedcasket funeral the man who had done that to him schneider reflected was a man to be taken very seriously indeed six floors below harrys apartment yuri borodin smiled with satisfaction his plan had worked after all ten minutes ago hed been furious richardson hadnt had the spandau papersas borodin had thought he mightand he had refused to discuss the two german policemen even under torture borodin hadnt intended to kill richardson but the american had made him angry and then kosovs bumbling footpad had blundered in during the interrogation borodin had shot rykov from reflex without even knowing who he was that had sealed richardsons fate borodin couldnt very well leave anyone alive to reveal what he had done even a twelfth department man could not kill a fellow kgb officer with impunity yet in the midst of adversity inspiration had struck before leaving harrys apartment borodin had planted two microtransmittersne in the front room one in the bedroom then hed made an anonymous telephone call to colonel rose the harvest had been bountiful now he knew not only the location of the two german policemen but also the identity of roses emissary to south africa the burly kripo detective would lead him straight to hauer and apfel and ultimately to the spandau papers and if that wasnt enough he was now listening to kosov and rose hatch a renegade operation that could smash both their careers the only oversight borodinconceded to himself had been the writing on the floor the american had sneaked that past him richardson had been trying to write borodin of course but a bullet through his spinal cord had apparently turned his o into something like an r the anglophobic rose had already misread the one clue that could help him though and ivan kosov wasnt likely to disabuse him of his fantasies as schneider emerged from the front entrance of harrys building yuri borodin laughed aloud even in the dog days of glasnost his job was sometimes more fun than work pm lufthanso flight corsican airspace dieter hauer looked down at the shiny wrinkled ball of aluminum foil in his hand it had taken four minutes of his best pickpocket technique to remove the spandau papers from hanss trousers but he had finally done it hans sat in the airplane seat next to him sleeping fitfully hauer removed the foil wrapping the thin sheets as if it concealed an archaeological treasure despite all that had happened he had yet to actually see the papers the first page looked just as hans had described it a paragraph written in german followed by a stream of unintelligible gibberish hauer scanned the german but learned nothing new sighing he pulled the bottom page from the stack and looked for the signature there it was number my god he thought to have been in prison so long that you didnt even use your name if the poor bastard remembered it at all on the last page hauer saw the carefully drawn eye it looked exactly like those hed seen tattooed on at least a dozen scalps whoever wrote the spandau papers he decided had obviously been visited at least once by someone with more than hair behind his right ear hauer didnt realize that three of the pages were blank until he began arranging them to repack them in the foil he rubbed his eyes vigorously unwilling to accept what he saw but the truth was i plain to see three pages bore no ink at all the paper wasnt even the same his first impulse was to shake hans awake and demand to know what he had done with the missing pages yet as soon as he raised his hand hauer realized what had happened the substituted sheets told the story professor natterman had lied the old man had held back after all hed kept some of the pages for himself hauer cringed as he recalled natterman slipping into the bathroom before laying the foil acket on hanss lap p greedy bastard he thought furiously with yourfamilys lives at stake pulling the bottom page out again hauer stared with grim frustration angrily he read the final note in german the last bit caught his eye phoenix wields my precious daughter like a sword of fire if only they knew am i even a dim memory to my angel no better that she never knows i have lived a life of madness but in the face of death i found courage better that she never knows those words resonated in hauers mind better that you dont know either he thought looking at hanss sleeping face youll find out soon enough hanss lank blond hair hung down across eyelids that quivered in troubled sleep carefully hauer refolded the aluminum foil around the pages and slipped them back into hanss pocket and what will you do he wondered when you finally learn that your grandfatherinlaw has condemned your wife to death for without the spandau papers to trade to the kidnappers intact hauer knew the chance of bringing ilse out of africa alive dropped by at least percent how could that bastard do that to his ownflesh and blood and then hauer knew the old man had not stolen the missing pageshed lost them lost them to the afrikaner who attacked him and the afrikaner had lost them to whoever had attacked him that was why natterman had frantically searched the carcass that hans dragked into the cabin hed been looking for the missing pages and he had found nothing my god hauer thought feeling acid flood his stomach someone else has those pages as the dc roared south toward the bottom of the un world hauer wondered who could possibly have nattermans cabin before he and hans funks men ilse had obviously been forced to give the cabin telephone number to her kidnappers had she also given them the cabins location how early had she been captured who else was hunting for the papers now hauer had seen some rather englishlooking young men hovering around the ticket dhans had slipped counters at frankfurt airport but he an by them on the strength of their false passports if hauer had only knownreally knownwho had the missing pages he might have felt less like a shepherd leading a lamb to the slaughter but he didnt know and as he closed his eyes to the sound of the roaring turbines one word cycled endlessly through his mind who pm emotorway frankfurt frg jonas stern took his eyes from the motorway long enough to glare at natterman in the passenger seat were going to israel to pick up some packages and thats all ill bloody say about it but what kind of packages youll find out soon enough but you were on the phone for hours natterman persisted you wasted a whole day klap kop in vant stern snapped in yiddish so the messiah comes a day later you dont order these packages like a pizza pie professor you told me yourself that the rendezvous with the kidnappers isnt until tomorrow night well make pretoria in plenty of time natterman sulked in his seat why were you talking to an air force general stern exploded you were listening to my calls only one natterman lied i just want to know whats going on wheres the harm in that youll know all you need to know stern said scowling when you need to know it not before if youd put your precious career aside for a moment and tell me all you know about hesss mission i might see fit to reciprocate natterman put an agespotted hand to his mouth and bit his thumbnail he looked like a gold prospector deciding whether or not to reveal the location of his big strike to a stranger whose help he needs with sudden gravity he reached across the seat and took hold of sterns arm ill tell you what i think about hesss mission he said excitedly i think rudolf hess is still alive stern turned and caught nattermans eye then he looked back at the wide motorway he chuckled softly i know you do professor and i wish it were so easy but you watch too many movies then you dont think hess is alive natterman asked incredulously stern grinned sure hes set up housekeeping with martin bormann and josef mengele amelia earhart is the housemaid and elvis presley provides the dinner entertainment natterman ignored the levity then youre really not hunting hess he said suspiciously stern shook his head i told you professor im no nazihunter im more of a gamekeeper and the preserve i protect is israel hess is alive natterman insisted i know he is its completely conceivable his double died only four weeks ago and the medical care at spandau was atrocious nattennan folded his arms defiantly rudolf hess is alive and im going to find him stern grunted skeptically since youre not hunting him natterman said in a superior tone i suppose i can tell you how i know hes alive enlighten me master stern said with mock gravity natterman scowled laugh if you like ill bet you dont laugh at this remember the tattooed eye that i showed you on the afrikaners head thats the constant in this whole mess the one unifying symbol the spandau papers said the eye was the key and the fascist members of the berlin police have the eye tattooed on their scalps beneath the hair hauer told me so but what hauer doesnt know stern is what that symbol means i do its an egyptian symbolthe allseeing eye the guarding eye of god natterman nodded knowingly hauer also told me that the police fascists protect something or someone called phoenix are you familiar with the phoenix stern of course its the mythological bird of flames that rises from its own ashes every five hundred years very good now phoenix is a greek word but the greeks did not invent the phoenix myth phoenix is but the greek name of the egyptian god bennuthe bird who rises from the ashes of its own destruction do you see what i see said stern irritably is a history professor who has lost touch with reality natterman cackled thats because youre blind stern blind like all the rest blind to history i told hauer that the key to this mystery lay in the past but the arrogant fool didnt believe me what in gods name are you babbling about egypt stern egypt dont you see all these mystical signs and symbols they lead ultimately to one man rudolf hess how stern snapped because natterman explained rudolf hess was born and raised in egypt he went to school in alexandria until he was fourteen years old stern sat in stunned silence thats true he murmured finally i remember now natterman was nodding with nervous energy im going to find him stern im going to deliver that nazi bastard into the modern world it will be the academic coup of the century take it easy professor i think youre letting your imagination run away with you that eye could mean any number of things and the name phoenix has been used to name everything from cities to cars to condoms youre stretching logic too far so hess was raised in egypt i presume he attended a german school there and he was still only a boy when he emigrated to germany he did attend a german school natterman admitted but fourteen is not so young and childhood impressions are often the most vivid of our lives the treasures and mysteries of egypts past would have fascinated any european boy no stern i dont think im stretching logic its simple deductive reasoning stern looked thoughtful think what you wish professor i will say this im not so sure hesss original mission is over yethe smiledi just dont think hesr is running it natterman looked anxious what do you mean i mean that hess flew to britain to arrange an anglogerman peace i accept that as fact whatever delusions hess may have had the strongest correction the only real foundation for such a peace was the widespread belief in england that germany represented the last and strongest possible barrier against an expansionistminded russia against communism thats freshman history said natteirinan whats your point my point is that things may not be so different now the soviet union is disintegrating professor the heart of the military colossus is economic chaos the great warrior is starving inside his armor russias provinces and satellites seethe with resentment and sedition one day not so long from now professor the soviet union could explode and and im not the only fool who knows that im saying it that some people may still believe that germany represents the best natural barrier against russia the unstable colossus germany as a barrier to russia stern smiled coldly not germany as you know it but a germany reunited reunited and armed with nuclear weapons its own nuclear weapons no natterman breathed that cant be true if we germans wanted nuclear weapons we could have developed them ourselves long ago we invented the ballistic missile for gods sake stern snorted its no more fantastic than your fairy tale about rudolf hess hess is alive natterman insisted i know it sterns face hardened whether he is or he isnt professor i dont want you mentioning his name in front of anyone from this moment forward you understand no one not friends not family fantasies like yours can produce hysterical responses in some people but not in you natterman said eyeing the israeli closely since you think hess is alive professor stern said gamely tell me this if hess survived his mission to england why didnt he return to germany to his beloved fuhrer natterman opened his mouth to speak then realized that he did not have an answer i wont know that until i know what hesss real mission was he said until we find hess himself stern swung onto the access road for frankfurtmain international airport professor he said we are after two different things youre obsessed with the past i fight in the present but the hess case links us were on a road we cannot see and at the end of it i fear lies something as evil as human beings can devise i believe that the danger that exists now came out of the past but i cant rip away the curtain of time and see what illbegotten proposition rudolf hess carried to england fortyseven years ago stern flicked his lights and passed a slowmoving bmw so you know what i think i think maybe having a german history professor along with me is the next best thing even if he is an ambitious closemouthed goyim who thinks hes simon wiesenthal stern swung the car into the ticketingchfckin lane when he had parked natterman climbed out and looked at him across the cars roof i just hope youre not condemning my granddaughter to death by making this stupid side nip to israel he growled stern bunched his coat collar higher around his neck this mystery has waited half a century to be solved professor it can wait one more day he turned and hurried into the terminal i wonder natterman asked himself walking toward the huge glass doors i wonder if it can the plan nazi he is insane he is the dove of peice he is messiah he is hitlers prince he is the one ckan honest man theyve got he is the worst assassin of the la he has a mission to preserve mankind hes nonohouc he was a b he has been dotty since the age of ten but all the dine was top of hitlers men hess the deputy fuhrer by ap herbert after hess parhuted into england chapter twenty january the berghot the bavarian alps rudolf hess stood alone before the great picture window of adolf hitlers alpine headquarters and waited for his fuhrer hess was a big man with an addetes bodybroad across the shoulders and even at fortyseven narrow through the waistyet hitlers window dwarfed him like all things designed by or for the fuhrer it was the largest in the world silhouetted against its olympian panorama hess looked like a tiny extra in the corner of a movie screen deep in the valley below him the village of berchtesgaden slept peacefully beyond it the magnificent untersberg rose skyward covered with fresh january snow far to the north hess could just see the rooftops of salzburg he could understand why the fuhrer retreated to this mountain eyrie when the pressures of the war became too onerous this was one of those times as hess stared out at the mountain a stabbing pain pierced his stomach he bent double clenching his abdomen with his heavymuscled forearms until the agony abated he had endured these attacks for three weeks now each in stoic silence for he knew it was no organic toxin that caused the pain but anxietya terrible withering apprehension the firstattack had struck him on december less than twelve hours after hitler issued his secret directive number in that order the fuhrer had commanded that all preparations for plan barbarossathe fullscale invasion of soviet russiabe completed by may of this year hess regarded directive as insanity and he was not alone some of the wehrmachts most gifted generals felt the same hess felt no moral qualms about betraying stalin or attacking russia if a few million russians had to die to create new living space for germans so be it but to attempt the invasion now while england remained unbeaten in the west madness hess had a single hope if peace with england could somehow be secured before barbarossa was launched suicidal tragedy might yet be averted just six months ago hitler had offered peace to the british from the floor of the reichstag and winston churchill had immediately answered with a resounding no yet that had not discouraged hess with the help of professor karl haushofer a family friend he had sent a subrosa letter to england proposing a secret meeting in lisbon between himself and douglas hamilton the premier duke of scotland the subject to be discussed anglogerman peace the duke of hamilton was renowned as the first man to fly over mount everest and hess liked the idea of dealing with a fellow flyer he himself had won the dangerous air race around the zugspitze germanys highest peak hess had met hamilton briefly at the olympics in berlin and the dashing young duke had seemed just the type of fellow who could shortcircuit the tedious process of diplomacy and bring churchill to his senses yet three months had passed since the peace letter began its circuitous journey to england and still hess had received no answer for the first few weeks he hadnt worried too much hitler had given tacit consent to the peace feeler and gratefully he hadnt seemed too disappointed when the effort did not immediately pan out even as weeks turned to monthswhile hess grew more agitated with each passing dayhitler seemed unconcerned then on december hess to his horror discovered the reason for the fuhrers uncharacteristic patience hitler meant to invade russia whether peace with england had been secured or not from that day forward hess had prayed despqrately that an answer from the duke of hamilton might still arrivethat peace negotiations could still be arranged he hoped that he had been summoned to the berghof today to discuss that very event wiping the sweat from his brow he took another long look out at the great mountain across the valley legend told that the emperor charlemagne slept beneath the untersberg that one day he would rise up to restore the lost glory of the german empire hess had often boasted that adolf hitler was the fulfillment of that prophecy now he was not so sure no man was more faithful to the fuhrer than he but lately he had begun to think back to the old days to the great war hess had been hitlers company commander then and young hitler only a dispatch runner one more mustardgassed soldier betrayed by the jewish financiers hess caught his breath as another stab of agony twisted his stomach he shut his eyes against the pain yet even as he did a horrifying vision filled his mind he saw the frozen limitless steppes of russia stretching away before him league after league drenched in blood german blood when the pain finally eased he pressed his sweaty palms to the great sheet of glass fingers outspread and looked out at the untersberg in silent invocation if ever there was a time for you to rise emperor it is now what the fuhrer plans was beyond even napoleon and i fear that without some miracle the task he set us is too greatrudi adolf hitler called across the richly appointed salon come here let me see you w he felt a jolt of aswhen hess turned from the windo tonishment the effusive welcome had not surprised him hitler often complained that his senior staff did not visit the berghof frequently enough but his clothes hess was startled speechless for some time now hitler had worn dark business suits during the day and dressed with particular severity around the time of military conferences but todaywith a major war conference scheduled in a matter of hourshe looked just as he had during the early thirties wearing a blue linen sport jacket white shirt and a yellow tie to top it all off hitler strode forward and clapped hess on the back then led him away from the window ive had historic news today rudi he said his voice quavering with excitement prophetic news hess braced himself for whatever revelation might follow this ominous preface what has happened my fuhrer all in good time hitler said cryptically tell me how are your training flights progressing two a week since hess shrugged ive managed one or october good good anyone taking an unusual interest in your activities thought he had seen the fuhrer wink for a moment hess but he banished the thought i dont believe so not goring or himmler hess frowned not directly no hitlers eyes flickered indirectly well hess looked thoughtful last fall himmler lent me his personal masseur to see if he could relieve my stomach pains felix kersten kersten yes he was a bit more inquisitive than i thought proper at the time is he one of himmlers spies notorious hitler cackled hess was perplexed he had not seen the fuhrer in such a mood since compiegne after the french surrender he watched hitler clasp his hands behind his bluejacketed back then pace across the room and stop before a magnificent titian nude i have a destination for you rudi hitler said to the painting at last would you like to guess it hess felt a tightening in his chest he had played these games before and he knew hitler would say nothing more until he had guessed at least twice lisbon he tried impatiently no switzerland no hess could hear the laughter in hitlers voice this really was intolerable even from the fuhrer just as hess started to say something he might regret hitler turned to him with an expression that could freeze molten steel england he said softly hess thought he had misheard i beg your pardon my fuhrert england hitler enunciated his eyes flashing with a sudden surge of elation hess understood weve had an answer from the duke of hamilton professor haushofers letter has done it hitler waved his hand irritably nono rudi dont be silly haushofer and his son are merely decoysdiversions meant to confuse british intelligence hess opened his mouth to protest but no words came out i know haushofer is an old friend of yours but his dilettante son is a member of the german resistance for gods sake but for you id have had him shot months ago hess was dumbfounded to hear that all his peace efforts to date had been in vain was bad enough but the revelation that his old friends son was a traitor it was beyond belief hrer there is no and the duke of hamilton my ffi chance that he might still help us n is as loyal an enhitler snorted the duke of hamilton englishman as you could find rudi of course that doesnt mean the duke cant prove useful there england hess murmured trying to will away another stomach cramp would my visit be in an official capacity of coursenot hitler scoffed that kind of playacting i leave to blusterers like ribbentrop your mission will be all substance rudi a master stroke of statesmanship hess stood silently for some moments do you do you mean that you have a plan to secure peace from the british be th isfaction that is exactly what hitler amed wi selfsat i mean fate has answered us in our hour of need peace and rudi and russia is within our with britain is at h grasp apropos of nothing hitler launched into a critical assessthe russian steppes haries xiis campaigns on ment of c ru ut mussolinis arrothen segued ah ptly into a harangue abo gant nephew ciano from years of practice hess managed to look attentive while ignoring the entire monologue his mind was filled by an image of himself flying hellforleather over the english channel on an errand to see god only knew what englishmen finally his anxiety got the better of him and quite out of character he interrupted hitler you wish me to fly to london my fuhrer on yet hitler rep im not sure of the exact destinati lied ignoring the interruption but certainly not london my god theyd throw you in the tower before you got a chance to speak to anyone undoubtedly hess agreed asy ri what is it hitler frowned you seem une well england i mean its not neutral were still at war if i were to be captured there the results could be catastrophic hess saw hitlers face darken as it always did at the slightest hint of opposition im not worried for myself of course he said quickly but with all that i know the russian invasion barbarossa ks hitler snapped but there im well aware of the ris is no alternative rudi we must have peace with england now no matter what the cost i have considered every option i even thought of sending your double in your place he hasnt done anything but sit on his backside in denmark since we trained him hess felt a jolt of surprise he had almost forgotten he had a double the fuhrer obviously had not but it would never work hitler declared the english will be looking for a trick and they know you too well a simple check for your war wounds would unmask any impostor hitler chuckled im afraid youre almost as famous now as i am old friend and thats what makes you perfect for this mission hess cleared his throat what exactly is the mission my fuhrer hitler began pacing out the room the operation will be called mordred but for the time being the less you know the better i only tell you your destination now because i must know you can reach england on the given night whatever ning or navigational practice you need to ensure success on such a flight you must do it hitler stopped pacing and looked into hesss deepset eyes can you fly alone to england rudi alone in the darkness hess nodded crisply absolutely my fuhrer hitler nodded do you have any parachute training hesss eyes widened no hitler clucked his tongue i thought not you probably wont need it anyway im told the duke of hamilton has a landing strip right beside his castle hess felt more confused than ever but you said that the duke of hamilton was a loyal en lishman hitler smiled enigmatically that is quite irrelevant his eyes twinkled do you remember the scarlet pimpernel rudi hesss heavy black eyebrows bunched in puzzlement i i believe you showed the film here atthe berghof didnt you thats right just last year the pimpernel was the daring english nobleman who made fools of the french during the reign of terror what has that to do with me hitlers eyes flashed with wicked glee everything rudi you know i have always admired the english they are fellow aryans they are great empirebuilders as we germans are buthitler stabbed a stiff finger into the airthey have allowed themselves to be deluded by churchill dangerously deluded look what happened when i spared their pathetic expeditionary force at dunkirk i halted guderians tanks blamed the british escape on goring and the luftwaffehitlers face reddened in angerand then churchill had the nerve to call dunkirk a british victory the english people must be freed from the influence of that warmonger cross his broad chest utterly adrift hess folded his arms a but this pimpernel business my fuhrer how does it relate to me dont you see rudi youre my scarlet pimernel hess stepped back in disbelief hitler nodded excitedly yes you are the exact opposite of what you appear to be since the war heated up everyone has written you off as merely a loyal bureaucrat who wastes his time on party administration all my officers think ive forgotten you hitler shook his head bitterly how can they have forgotten rudi from the beginning you fought beside me took wounds meant for me and now you will be the man who receives my most sacred charge the responsibility of the most sensitive mission in the history of the reich together we shall prove yet again what fools they all are hitlers eyes went cold in such times as these rudi we learn who our real friends are im afraid that some of our oldest and most trusted comrades may have decided that the time has come to explore alternatives to the road i have chosen for germany they seem to think my decision to invade at russia is a symptom of madness imbeciles to imagine that thirst neutral iadolf hitlerwould invade russia wi out f izing england th th hess looked guiltily at e floor for the past mon he had subscribed to the very same heresy yet the fuhrer had obviously had his own peace plan in the works all along of course it was only natural that the fuhrer should inspire powerful allies in england so many questions thundered in hesss brain that he could not decide which to ask first before he could say anything however hitler transfixed him with a zealots stare and began to speak with quiet conviction every man has his hour rudi his time upon the worlds stage your hour has come some menmen like myselfplay their part in public like stars flashing across the sky others must play their part in shadow it is to such a role i call you now take heed old friend there are traitors all around us from the moment you leave this room you will be in mortal danger but you are a soldier rudi the embodiment of the true nazi i do not exaggerate when i say that the very future of the reich rests upon your success hess felt his chest swell with burning pride he did not yet understand his role in operation mordred but if the fuhrer was ready to gamble the future of the reich on him he was ready to lay down his life without question what german could do less hess started when after a perfunctory knock reichleiter martin bortnann marched loudly into the salon general halder has arrived my fuhrer he announced as a courtesy hitler waited for hess to dismiss bormann the thickset unctuous bonnann was hesss deputy after all dismissed hess barked bonnann saluted and backed reluctantly out of the salon hess felt better immediately lately he spent most of his time in his munich office and he had reluctantly come to depend more and more on bormann for satisfying the daily whims of the fuhrer bonnann was an able assistant but he possessed many traits hess detested he was cruel and merciless to his subordinates yet fawning and obsequious to his superiors no one liked him muchxcept hitlerbut everyone respected his proximity to the epicenter of power a good man hitler said with some embarrassment but its not like having you around rudi not like the old days remember landsberg for a moment hess thought back to the months in landsberg prison where he had edited the manuscript of mein kampf while hitler dictated it hes had done his best to force the fevered ideas into intelligible progressions of words in those days he had been the apple of the fuhrers eye it seemed a thousand years ago now or it had until five minutes ago i remember he said softly hitler crossed to the fireplace reached up to the mantel and took down a long manila envelope he tapped it against the palm of his left hand on this envelope rudi is written the name of the man i have chosen to help you carry your mission hitler extended the envelope hess accepted it and held it at belt level while he read the large blocked letters reinhard heydrich obergruppenfohrer sd hitler had written the words himself hess recognized the hand from the endless nights in landsberg he also recognized the name heydrich was commander of the feared sdthe counter intelligence arm of the ssand secondincommand toss reichsfiihrer himmler hess halfrecalled an unpleasant story he had once heard about heydricha man so ruthless that even the brutal ss had christened him the blond beastbut the fuhrers voice broke his train of thought himmler is to know nothing of this he said heydrich keeps an office in the prinzalbrechtstrasse but youre not to deliver it there deliver it hess said incredulously hitler was pacing again faster now he spoke as if dictating to one of his secretaries as soon as you get back to munich wire heydrich that you must see him on a matter of reich security include the word mordredthis will prevent him from informing himmler heydrich spends a good deal of time at the sd offices in the wilheimstrasse deliver it therenot prinzalbrechtstrasse you can log the trip as another training flight make some small talk for a half hour then return to munich hitler pursed his lips you will have no further contact with heydrich rudi but rest assured he will be working with you besides myself he will be your only ally hitler paused by the door his fingers on the handle any questions hess cleared his throat only one my fuhrer one question was more than hitler liked but he forced himself to smile what is it when do i leave for england hitler let his hand drop and walked back to hess he reached up laid a hand on the powerful shoulder and gazed into hesss earnest eyes from the filthy trenches of france he said softly we have risen up and conquered all europe we have avenged the outrage of versailles now we stand poised to invade russia itself russia itself hitler paused his eyes burning such a step is not to be taken without an awareness of destiny rudi on what day did we begin our glorious westward march to the channel mystified hess groped for the date the tenth of may yes and what day is our eastward invasionbarbarossato begin may fifteenth hess replied more confidently recalling the date from directive no our tanks will roll on the fifteenth but the invasion of soviet russia be ins with your mission rudi on the tenth of may one year to the day after we marched on france just as before hess felt a wild thrill of foreboding a tangible sense of destiny as if fate herself had materialized in the room it is all preordained hitler cried flinging his arms toward the ceiling his mesmerizing voice filled the salon brimming with the conviction of a prophet on the tenth of may you will secure our western flank and on the fifteenth we shall wipe the plague of communism from the planet by christmas of this year greater germany will extend from the english channel to the ural mountains and it will be settled by pure german stock hesss ears roared with excitement only slowly did he become aware of an insistent knocking at the door it might have been going on for a full minute he slipped the manila envelope into his coat pocket as hitler opened the door it was bormann again but this time hesss deputy hesitated in the doorway hitter smoothed his black forelock and looked into hesss eyes you will take care of that today rudi immediately excuse me my fuhrer bonnann interrupted general halder is waiting let him wait hitler bellowed escort the deputy fuhrer to his car bonnann heil hitler bormann clicked his jackboots together turned and marched down the hall im going up to change clothes rudi hitler said softly i cannot let my generals see me like this theyll think they can run right over me in the conference hitler looked embarrassed by the confidence hess grinned and waved him out it had been good to see the old hitler for a few the old spring jacket and tie could not revoke a the steps they had taken in the intervening years t se steps were written in blood and fire and they could only be erased by more of the same bormann waited like a dachshund at the end of the hall hess felt a new and powerful sense of purpose in his tread as he followed his deputy out of the berghof how are the children martin he asked just now hess could not have cared less but since bormann had seen fit to name his offspring after hess and his wife he felt obliged to ask rudi is strong as a bull bonnann bragged over his shoulder and ilse is the very flower of german womanhood hess smiled wanly outside bormann held open the door of hesss brown mercedes hess sensed a kind of animal exultance in him now that the interloperhesswas leaving unreasonably irritated he cranked his mercedes and goosed the pedal a few times the engine roared responsively is there anything i can do for you herr reichminister bormann asked hess considered ordering his deputy to call ahead and have his messerchmitt readied then thoukht better of it he shifted into first gear all the while looking hard into bormanns eyes he could see the arrogance lurking just behind the peasant face bormann wore power clumsily like all men unaccustomed to it but the little rat was learning by all reports he was setting himself up as lord of obersalzburg strengthening his position by acting as sole conduit between hitler and the outside world one of hesss secretaries had actually heard frau goebbels whisper that bormanns star had eclipsed hesss in the nazi firmament i see you still havent finished the construction up here martin hess said breezily he waved his hand toward a halffinished concrete bunker the fuhrers needs expand every day bormann said proudly i can barely keep up with the demand but i do my best hess forced a smile there is something you can do for me if you get the time anything said bormann with a nod of false obeisance with a casual motion hess reached out of the car and caught bormann by the collar one flex of his thickly muscled arm brought the shocked reichsleiter to his knees in the snow hess could feel the softness in bonnann the boorish strength dissipated by alcohol and gluttony bormanns piggish eyes bulged in terror never hess said harshly never forget who you are bormann you are my deputy and as long as i live that is all you will ever be hess roared away leaving his stunned subordinate kneeling in the noon snowmelt he skidded to a stop at the inner perimeter gate how long to call munich he barked at a surprised ss private we have a direct line herr reichministert hess reeled off the number of his office telephone and the message herr reichminister hess said nothing to the sentry he seemed lost in a world of his own but the ss man was not about to rush the deputy fuhrer of the reich hesss brain was spinning all the dark misgivings of the past few months were lifting from his mind like bad dreams at the coming of dawn the road to moscow would soon be open and he was the man adolf hitler had chosen to open it yet the vision hess saw now was no epic scene of conquest not german legions crossing their russian rubicon he saw a very small section of a shadowy munich street in it was on that street and a hundred others like it that the seeds of the nazi party had battled the communist gangs for control of postwar germany it was to that street that a young rudolf hess had returned one afternoon to find that a communist gang had reached his local group headquarters ahead of him hess had hidden and watched in horror as heavily armed red guard ruffians loaded twenty of his friends into a panel truck later that night the communists shot all of hesss comrades loyal germans to a man a captured communist later claimed the reds had lined the prisoners up and slof them one by one among all the communist crimes hess vowed this was the one for which he would exact revenge in russian bloodherr reichminister the sentry asked tentatively what hess looked up oh the message to karlheinz pintsch have my messerschmitt fully fueled and ready for a roundtrip flight to berlin i want ninehundredliter drop tanks fitted and filled got that jawohl herr reichminister hess kicked the mercedes into gear and raced down winding mountain road as fast as the snow would allow i ma god he thought with exhi aration i am the n who will seal the peace with england and open the road to moscow with reinhard heydrichs help hess remembered uneasily he touched the envelope in his coat pocket with a shiver he suddenly recalled the story he had heard about heydrich apparently the blond beastafter an exhausting night of drinking and whoringhad caught sight of his own reflection in a lavatory mirror wild eyed and sweating scum then he had screamed at last ive got you whipped out his pistol and emptied it through the glass hess felt a cold chill of presentiment but he quickly shook it off one could not pick ones allies in the war against the bolshevik and the jew sometimes it took a beast to slay a beast if the fuhrer trusted heydrich there was nothing more to be said hess had other things to worry about a night flight to britain for example englishmen who had survived the hell of hermann gorings terror bombing would not mince words if hess landed alone and unprotected in their country they would do their talking with bullets and thats fine hess thought ive faced bullets before i can do it again the mere thought of his destination brought a strange quickening to his blood england chapter twentyone january the bavarian alps obergruppenfiihrer reinhard heydrich reich commissar for the consolidation of german tock and chief of the sd landed at ainring airport near berchtesgaden just two hours after rudolf hess delivered hitlers unexpected message to berlin like hess heydrich piloted himself and upon landing he commandeered a convertible porsche from a local gestapo sergeant the sergeant professed great pleasure at being able to help the obergruppenfiihrer but inside he felt only despair he knew that even if the beautiful car were returned a burnedout wreck he could say nothing men who angered reinhard heydrich had been known to disappear without a trace the open porsche rocketed along the blackedout highway halfsliding around curves made deadly by a sudden winter shower heydrich drove stonefaced despite the brittle drops that stung his skin and eyes the frigid wind would have driven any normal man to groan in pain but the young obergruppenfiihrer prided himself on his ability to control his human weaknesses the fact that he was quite mad aided him considerably in this task unlike most of hitlers chieftains heydrich seemed the incarnation of the mythical aryan superman tall and blond blueeyed spare and muscular of framehe carried himself with the selfassurance of a crown prince a jarring amalgam of opposites heydrich put every man he met off balance a worldclass fencer he had been asked to join the german olympic team yet tales of his homosexual conquests were whispered in ss barracks throughout the reich he was an accomplished violinist who not only brought tears to the eyes of his audiences but sometimes cried himself during particularly beautiful passages yet his sadistic rampages through eastern europe would eventually cause czech partisans to christen him the butcher of prague and british intelligence to order his assassination and the most telling paradox of all reinhard heydrichthe man who had vowed to eliminate the strain of jewry from the worldhad jewish blood flowing through his veins at the outer gate of obersalzburg the ss guards eyed the approaching porsche with suspicion when they recognized its driver however they snapped to attention and waved heydrich through the sentries at the inner gate displayed the same deference and he soon reached the summit of the mountain the berghof appeared to be under siege most of the high command had arrived during the afternoon long black staff cars overflowed the parking lot and encircled the rear of the house heydrich picked a path through the cars made his way around to the front of the house and opened the door without knocking an ss sergeant of the liebstandarte adolf hitler had been posted in the entry hall to meet him after a curt salute the sergeant whisked heydrich up the stairs to the bedrooms and indicated the door he wished the sd chief to enter youre to wait here herr obergruppenftihrer by order of the fuhrer heydrich looked mystified am i not to attend the conference downstairs nein herr obergruppenflihrer reichleiter borrnann instructed me to have you meet the fuhrer in the teahouse but i just received word that he wont have time for the walk we could drive heydrich suggested the fuhrer never drives to the teahouse the sergeant seemed to think this explanation sufficient heydrich dismissed him and reached for the bedroom door handle then paused as another door opened farther down the hall a blond woman leaned furtively out heydrich registered an ample bosom beneath a rather plain face before she ducked back inside only after entering the small bedroom designated for his meeting with the fuhrer did he realize that the woman he had just seen must be eva braun with an extreme sense of discomfort heydrich put the incident out of his mind the fuhrer in a carnal entanglement with a peasant girl preposterous out of habit heydrich surveyed the berghof grounds from the small bedroom window he saw ss guards and dogs silhouetted against the snow at regular intervals all over the compound nodding with satisfaction he sat stiffly on the edge of a narrow bed an hourpassed when he next heard footsteps in the hall he knew they belonged to the fuhrer standing deliberately he straightened his silverbordered collar and faced the door as it opened he cried heil hitler and gave a whipcrack nazi salute adolf hitler stood blinking in the doorway he looked like a man suddenly pulled into a quiet alcove from a beer hall where a violent brawl was in progress heydrich he mumbled my fuhrer we havent much time i have to get back to my generals theyve taken a break for food with sudden ffitler s into the room and walked to the window food he cried pounding his right fist into his palm they think i am a fool heydrich adolf hitler my god if i had listened to my generals we would never even have crossed into the rhineland and now that we stand ready to begin the greatest land invasion the world has ever seen they counsel me to be cautious hitler whirled evangelical fire burning in his eyes would caution have won us poland heydrich no my fuhrer would it have won us france no then how can it win us russia spittle flew from hitlers quivering lips it cannot my fuhrer exactly you should hear them halder jodl even guderians reports sound like the whining of an old woman they speak as if we have allies we have none for hours the fools have gone dyer and over the north african situation the situation is clear on january third the british captured thirtyeight thousand lwian soldiers at sidi barram did you know that thats more prisoners than the british had soldiers the italians are swine heydrich declared watching mtler wind up again what does africa matter i ask you all my generals proudly display mein kampf on their mantelpieces i dont believe one of the idiots has read it russia is the key to el erything when russia falls japan will be free to attack the united states and with roosevelts attention turned there churchill will be forced to sue for peace its so simple a child could see it hitlers left eye twitched angrily perhaps i should place my armies under the command of the hitler youth heydrich said nothing to this remarkable suggestion hitler smoothed his unruly forelock then clasped his hands behind him and said do you know what my prussian peacocks are afraid of heydrich swallowed england my fuhrer c my own words back at me as if i pre isely they throw did not write them myself germany should never again become embroiled in a twofront war never will i fight a twofront war enough england lies prostrate beneath our bombs yet my sniveling generals call her a western front a front when we turn east heydrich the cowards will learn what a front truly is heydrich suppressed a sadistic grin hitler squared his shoulders directive twentyone commands that all preparations for plan barbarossa be completed by may fifteenth of this year do you know why so that we may defeat the communists before winter sets in exactly and why this year heydrich because stalin is arming russia even faster than i am arming germany the purge of thirtyseven slowed him down considerably yes but he has a new program in placea total reorganizationr will be too late all that we have if we wait another yea it accomplished will be dust do you understand perfectly my fuhrer i believe you do and that is why you are here hitler carefully read his watch holding it close to his face because of his poor vision i have no intention of fighting on two fronts heydrich but can i trust my spineless generals with my plans he waved his hand impatiently my brilliant generals imbeciles every one england doesnt want warno matter what your agents tell you heydrich i know withstanding aerial bombardment is one thingfighting a land war is another the english people will do almost anything to keep from sending their sons to die at another somme or ypres believe me heydrich i was there no the only obstacle to an aryan peace is winston churchill churchill and his warmongering cronies do you agree absolutely my fuhrer tell me hitler said in a confiding tone what do you thinkof our chances of making peace with the british heydrich tried to guess which answer hitler wanted today the fuhrer did not tolerate equivocation it had to be one absolute or the other as things now stand he ventured carefully we have no chance whatsoever hitlers eyes sparkled you seem certain yet i suspect that some of your superiors might disagree with you heydrich fit his chest tighten hitlers voice cut like a blade what do you know herr obergruppenfiihrer of attempts by my officers to make clandestine contact with the british heydrich felt the tingle of opportunity in his palms may i speak frankly my fuhrer you had better my fuhrer so far despite exhaustive efforts i have not uncovered any proof of treason around you however i am aware of efforts on the part of certain individuals to make clandestine contact with british citizens in various neutral countries ive taken the liberty of compiling dossiers on the activities of each for your review hitler frowned disdainfully the haushofers for instance karl and albrecht yes said heydrich surprised by hitlers knowledge you know of their communications with hess heydrich nodded warily goring surely you dont suspect the reichsmarschall hitler dismissed his shock with a wave of the hand who knows the air war over the channel came close to breaking him goring hasnt the stamina for wars of attrition he was trained for aerial dogfightingnothing else but what of my question how do you rate the chances of gaining peace by clandestine means heydrich licked his thin lips as long as churchill rules in london my fuhrer england will fight us hitler nodded and the result england will be crushed no hitler said softly there will be no war with england heydrich waited for some evidence to back up this mistic assertion there will be no war with england because soon winston churchill will no longer sit at the head of the british government heydrichs pulse quickened does that statement surprise you heydrich t shouldnt because you are the man who is going to ensure that my prediction becomes fact it took all of heydrichs selfcontrol to hold his facial muscles in check renwve churchillfrom the government it was too fantastic let me ask you another question herr obergruppenftihrer you consider yourself a good judge of men what do you think of the duke of windsor heydrich chose his words carefully as you know my fuhrer i handled security on the occasion when the duke secretly met with reichminister hess in lisbon during my limited time with the duke i developed an impression of a weak selfcentered man hebehaved like a spoiled child having voluntarily relinquished the throne of england he would like nothing better than to sit upon it again if only so that his american wife can be called her royal highness windsor imagines that he would do anything to anain this end when in fact he would probably do everything short of what is required hitler smiled you are indeed a good judge of men but none of that matters in the slightest it is the royal blood that matters heydrich the blood the english pretend to abhor my racial policies they revile me at every turn yet in the final analysis they revere the blood just as we do hitler tugged anxiously at his forelock how would you rate windsor as a friend to germany there can be no doubt of his sympathies my fuhrer from an intdllectual standpoint he s the ost rightthinking englishman in the empire his actions in france proved that knowingly or not he accelerated our invasion timetable by at least a week but may i ask my fuhrer why this is relevant the english constitution forbids an abdicated king from ever resuming the throne even should he wish to dont worry about the english constitution hitler snapped contemptuously if the english people recalled windsor would he accept undoubtedly he said as much to hess in lisbon well the people are going to recall him heydrich and soon heydrich blinked if king george were to die suddenly hitler postulated what would happen there are two possibilities either his eldest daughter elizabeth would assume the thronea highly dubious prospect considering that england is engaged in a lifeanddeath struggler the english people would remember the duke of windsor their onceadored prince of wales and uncrowned king who now wastes his notinconsiderable gifts as crown governor of the bahamas which alternative do you think they would choose heydrich which would you choose an emptyheaded child or the strong hand of a man trained to rule how important will windsors romantic follies seem in the face of englands greatest peril heydrich shifted uncomfortably i im not sure the english view these things as we do my fuhrer rubbish and what does it matter windsor would only be the window dressing the real power of england is in downing street that is where the change must be made heydrich sensed that hitler had finally come to the point of this meeting but how is this change to be made my fuhrert he asked softly hitlers eyes flickered ruthlessly heydrich as all acts of war must be on the tenth of may winston churchill is going to die and with him king george the sixth when that happens britain will hold its breath headless for a few moments of history and through that brief window we shall snatch the prize we wantpeace in the west then russia will be ours for the taking and guderians panzers will roll heydrich cracked his boot heels together and stood rigid before his master have you been struck dumbt hitler asked his very posture a challenge no my fuhrer its simply that the scope and genius of your concept have shocked me hitler nodded i understand few men think as i do with a mind unfettered by the restraints of socalled civilized spandau phdenix war such a concept is ludicrous a blatant contradictior terms but im sure youre wondering exactly how deaths of these two men will gain us peace from the english heydrich nodded though he was actually wondering how the deaths of those men could be accomplished its quite simple hitler explained when the new prime minister takes churchills place his government will be mine or at least sympathetic to my ideas dont look so surprised like haushofer and others i too know of certain englishmen who want peace however the men i speak of are then of deeds not words they understand my true aims that my primary goal is to expand eastwardnot into britain they know that adolf hitler is the hammer that will crush world communism heydrich stepped back from the raw force of hitlers zeal the british empire was not forged by men who whined at the sight of a little blood heydrich the english understand that to create one must first destroy that out of death comes life hitler wiped his brow so you see heydrich did see he saw that hitlerfrom machiavellian genius or sheer desperationhad decided to extend the tactics of terror which had served him so well during the partys early expansion into the realm of international policy heydrich also saw that this decision would immeasurably raise his value to hitler visavis purely military officers where another man might recognize imminent disaster heydrich saw opportunity hands together be so hitler concluded bringing his ginning now you will devote all your energies to devising a method by which winston churchill and george the sixth can be liquidated three limits must define your plan first your mission cannot be accomplished in such a way as to incriminate germany or the national socialist party second you will conduct all inquiries involved in your tlanning in in such a way that neither reichsfiihrer hi mler admiral canaris nor any other member of the high command becomes aware of your mission and finally the mission must be carried out on the tenth of maythe glorious anniversary of our historic westward invasion heydrich blanched the fuhrer had just placed restrictions on the operation that would make success all but impossible even if a bolt of lightning were to strike down churchill and the king in trafalgar square accusing fingers would still point to germany yet despite this grim truth heydrich elected to keep silent he had seen what happened to men who protested to adolf hitler that his orders were impossible am i to understand my fuhrer that i am to assassinate these men hitler exploded were you not listening the thought of making winston churchill a martyr turns my stomach but alive he hounds me like the devil incarnate i want him dead the king too heydrichs mind reeled at the implications of this order if what the fuhrer said about nazi sympathizers in england was true the plan could actually work but what were the odds of that the terror bombin of london and other population centers had hardened britains will to adamant the reports of all his agents confirmed this could there really still be englishmen who feared stalin more than they feared hitler men to whom profits meant more than national honor men to whom a guarantee of safety from adolf mtler was worth more than a prewar deutschemark do not think i labor under any illusions hitler said almost telepathically the english have no love for me or for things german but they understand me heydrich i represent absolute power concentrated in the head of the state and the english respect that their industlialists and nobles fear stalin and his hordes far more than my policies communismpower seized by millions of fanatical workers who cannot wait to tear down the ivied walls of traditionthat is like the plague to the english the black death come again a sharp knock on the bedroom door halted hitler in midstream martin bormann opened the door and stood there stubbornly ignoring heydrich you asked me to inform you when the generals finished their dinner my fuhrer so i did bormann thank you dismissed bormann reluctantly closed the door hitler folded his arms and peered closely at heydrich do you foresee difficulties herr obergruppenftihrer none my fuhrer heydrich replied automatically hitler raised his chin and smiled that is why i selected you for this mission the word impossible is one you never learned if my generals had the same attitude we would be in moscow by now heydrich inclined his head briefly i am going you give you a name heydrich you will never repeat it you will never write it down this is t e englishman you may contact if there is vital information you cannot obtain by any other means churchills likely whereabouts such matters as that his name is robert stanton lord granville heydrich ejaculated he reddened i apologize for the interruption my fuhrer but but he is the last man you would have guessed to betray his king hitler smiled wickedly that is good just remember you will never use his namenly his code name lord granville is mordred while heydrichs brain raced hitler said ill go downstairs first you follow in a few minutes i dont want my generals to know of our meeting on the eleventh of may i shall present them with afait accompli just as i did with my pact with stalin that should stiffen their resolve when they cross into russia it should indeed my fuhrer the operation must take place on the tenth of may heydrich other wheels are already in motion when your plan is ready call bormann and say the word mordred hell set up another meeting hitler reached for the door handle then paused by the way about those files you have compiled on potential traitors is hess among them heydrich nodded solemnly burn his file the moment i return to berlin my fuhrer hitler saluted smartly guten abend herr obergruppenfiihrer the closing door in heydrichs heil hitler died against spite of his pounding heart he resumed his crosslegged position on the edge of the bed he sat absolfately still and before five minutes passed his throbbing pulse had returned to a point of equilibrium that most men of eighteen would be hard put to equal at rest he stood deliberately passed a slim hand over his blond hair and walked into the hallhalfway down the stairs he heard a ftirtive noise behind him eva braun again bener to let it pass he thought but he could not his predatory instincts were too strong with the stealth of a leopard heydrich turned and crept back up the stairs he arrived on the second floor just in time to see the roundshouldered back of martin bormann disappear into the bedroom opposite the one eva braun had leaned out of heydrich heard the shallow tinkle of girlish laughter and as the door closed he glimpsed a swatch of unclad flesh for a moment he stood still then most as if pulled against his will he moved up close against the door he heard the laughter again like cheap crystal first teasing then hysterical it had a lilt of drunkenness in it then a sharp cry of pain pierced the door drythroated heydrich tried to swallow he heard another cry then a deeper animal sound began to punctuate the brittle protests of the woman heydrich felt his organ move then stiffen a nerve tic intermittently closed his left eye grinding his teeth he blocked out the primitive sounds until the spasm ceased the grunts grew regular heydrich no longer heard the woman beads of sweat formed on his brow he opened and closed his right fist in synchrony with the groans coming from behind the door the next sound he heard started the tic again only slaps at firstalmost playful echoing lightlybut the deadened thump of solid blows soon followed heydrich knew that sound as well as any man on earth like an arrhythmic heartbeat it drove him through each hour each new day of conquest the woman was protesting again but her cries were muffled a pillow heydrich thought distantly conflicting emotions struggled for control of his taut body anger revulsion arousal he longed to smash open the door but whether t flay bormann in disgust or to plunder his share of the woman he did not know he did neither he simply stood facing the door his body rigid as a steel beam his brow pouring sweat and listened coupled with his earlier proximity to the fuhrer the stress of this violently erotic encounter pushed him into a kind of trance the sound of the blows deepened the cries grew closer together and heydrich with adolf hitlers voice still echoing in his ears waited for the orgasmic groan that would resolve it all it never came chapter twentytwo two months later reinhard heydrich felt like a god seventy days ago when he first heard hitler impose his operational restrictions on plan mordred heydrich thought his meteoric rise through the nazi rarc assas mate hie by had been stopped dead to find a way to s not only winston churchill but also king george vi to do it on a specific day and without leaving a smoking gun in german hands ridiculous yet een before he landed his fieselerstorch back at berlinstaaken airport on that frozen january night the essential elements of the plan had flashed into his mind as if by divine inspiration the concept was so ingeniously simple that if brought off successfully not only would britain be neu with little more than sporadic smallarms rue but she would become germanys strongest ally it had taken the obergruppenfiihrer sd a further sixtyeight days to determine whether his unprecedented plan could actually be put into operation sixtyeight nerveracking days of frantic intelligence work carried out under the lidless gaze of heinrich himmler a dozen trips taken under false pretenses a hundred agents lied to about the reason for the questions he had asked them a thousand scraps of information gathered from around the globe and funneled through the sieve of the sssd intelligence complex each tiny piece sucked out of the system without the knowledge of the ruthless little tyrant who controlled it now driving back to obersalzburg beneath a cold starlit sky heydrich knew that he was ready the leather briefcase on the seat beside him contained his ticket to the most exclusive club in the world two months ago he had been a mere subalterna loyal centurion charged by his caesar with nailing millions of jews to the iron cross of the reich but nownow the centurion had glimpsed the keys to the palace behind heydrichs glacierblue eyes a seething blast furnace of allconsuming desire firrd his brain only one man alive possessed the kind of power he craved and heydrich was on his way to see that man now with him he carried the plan that would prove his worthiness to hitler beyond doubt and one dayne day very soonthe mantle of dictatorship would pass to him passing through the obersalzburg gates he noted the almost casual attitude of the ss guards desultory fighting on all fronts was taking its toll in efficiency throughout the reich what everyone needs is another good blitzkrieg to wake them up he thought and theyll get one soon enough he reminded himself to give the laggards a good dressing down on his way out he parked in the garage beneath the berghofs enormous picture window and walked around to the front of the house a sergeant of the ss liebstandarte adolf hitler barred the door before heydrichs boot even touched the first step the guard instructed him to turn around when he did he saw the last thing he expected adolf hitler outfitted in a dark suit homburg hat and carrying a walking stick stood silent in the snow watching him arc lights silhouetted hitlers harlequin figure for a moment heydrich felt as if he were watching a newsreel in a darkened theater then the fuhrerfor all the world like charlie chaplins caricature of himturned and bobbed off across the snow the teahouse whispered the ss sergeant heydrich caught up with hitler forty meters from the berghof walking briskly along a deep path cleared through the snow there was just room for two to walk abreast heydrich fell in beside hitler and waited for a cue to begin his report but hitler walked in silenceheydrich heard dogs barking in the distancethe fuhrers german shepherds he guessedbut when hitler stopped and called them they did not come unable to restrain himself any longer heydrich took a deep breath and announced i have finished my report my fuhrer in the teahouse hitler said tersely and set off again mystified heydrich hurried after him another twenty minutes silent marching brought them to their destination the round rustic building where hitler liked to hold court after dinner in contrast to the opulent berghof the teahouse had been furnished for comfort the circular main room was about twentyfive feet across with a round wooden table and easy chairs it reminded most people of cozy country holidays before the shadow of war fell across their lives heydrich did not even notice the blazing fire nothing existed for him in that space save himself and hitlertwo unalloyed souls staring at each other across a gulf of limitless ambition so hitler snapped you have brought me my plan yes my fuhrer heydrich said proudly and it took you only two months two months what were you thinking op heydrich stepped back in surprise did i ask you for the impossible herr obergruppenfiihrer no i asked you to plan two simple murders surely that could not be too difficult for you they tell me you left gregor strassers brains on the wall of a gestapo cell for weeks stunned by hitlers fury heydrich waited in silenceis it in that briefcase hitler asked sharply yes my fuhrer you wrote ii down heydrich nodded uncertainly i am surrounded by fools hitler crossed the room and collapsed into a leather easy chair opposite heydrichwell he said finally report too shocked to do anything else heydrich sat stiffly in one of the easy chairs and emptied the contents of his brief case onto the coffee table his notes clear and concise and a stack of eightbyten photographs held neatly together by a paper clip my fuhrer he began my orders entailed finding a way to remove churchill and george the sixth from power on the tenth of may without leaving any clue that might possibly point to germany while this seems i am aware of the orders i issued you hitler exploded i want to hear your plan not a description of the problem heydrichs notes slipped from his clammy palms standing erect he screwed up his courage and locked his blue eyes onto hitlers black ones accountability he said slowly that my fuhrer is the paramount consideration in this operation even if churchill and the king could be killed without leaving a trace of their killers the finger of accusation would still point to germany more than anyone we have the motiveand in time of war motive is the only consideration to avoid making remember churchill the new rallying cry against us we must accomplish two things first we must leave no german at the scene of the crime secondand most importantwe must provide the british with a culprit they cannot ignore he watched hitler for a reaction but the dictator sat sullenly immobile so he continued who to blame my fuhrer the solution came to me that first night as if screamed in my ears who besides yourself do the english fear most the communists youve said it yourself a thousand times the communists are the enemy of all civilized nations we know the english industrialists share this view the march of bolshevism since has every nation in europe trembling heydrich drew himself to his full height and so my fdhrer the men who assassinate churchill and the king must be communists heydrich sensed a stirring in hitlers eyes a heightening of awareness if communist agents were to assassinate churchill and the king he went on england would explode into panic instead of being united against germany every englishman would begin t fear his own neighborhis own brother communism would become britains new enemyits new satan and what is the source of world communism russia strike back at russia will be the new rallying cry in britain heydrich raised one delicate finger into the air but can they bombed and beaten almost beyond rising england is virtually powerless against a nation so distant and strong but you are not my fuhrer adolf hitler is the most implacable foe communism hasever knownthe whole world knows it your nonaggression pactwith stalin means nothinga temporary alliance of convenience one look at mein kampf will tell the most skeptical briton that your primary aim has always been russia lebensraum expansion eastward into russia over the bodies of the subhuman slavic barbarians hitler opened his mouth to speak but heydrich rolled on caught up in the momentum of his emotions and most important my fuhrer every word every warning ever given by your friends in england will be proved true german will finally be recognized as the last bastion shielding england from the fanatical hordes of the east isnt that what the duke of windsor has argued all along that another war between england and germany can only end in common slavery under the communists while heydrich paused for breath hitler rose slowly to his feet and folded his arms an interesting plan herr obergruppenftihrer he said his voice edged with excitement i myself was thinking along similar lines just the other day but tell me who will commit these murders no russian communist will attempt such a thing without stalin behind him and if a german communist does it we are lost to the english heydrich a german is a german they will not split hairs when they ask america for our blood in revenge ive thought of that my fuhrer heydrich said smoothly his cruel lips cracking into a smile there is but one way that this thing can be accomplishedone way that british fury can be turned away from us and against russia he paused like a magician reluctant to reveal his last best trick the communists who assassinate churchill and the king must be british subjects hitler sat still as stone explain heydrich frowned that is all my fuhrer that is the key the men who carry out the assassinations must be british subjectsof course i mean british communists hitler ground his teeth slowly are you about to tell me herr obergruppenfiihrer that you have devised a way to get stalin to order his english cadres to execute churchill and the king at the time and place of our choosing no my fuhrer i hope not hitler shook his hand in the air its all i can do to keep stalin out of my rumanian oil fields for a while you were making sense now w shall see heydrich squinted with a gamblers concentration what i propose my fuhrer is not really so far from what you just suggested but before i can give you the mechanics i must explain a little recent history i the idea of playing history pupil did not please hitler but he held a fitful silence while heydrich laid the foundations of his plan do you recall the communist takeover of bavaria in my fuhrer specifically munich hitler scowled i fought in it you fool with hess at my side i battled in the streets and hess with only his tattered old uniform for clothing of course my fuhrer heydrich said quickly yes well during the final friekorps assault on the hauptbanhofwhere the communists chose to make their final standwe had a man inside the building we hitler said disparagingly the friekorps my fuhrer i thought the communists in the hauptbanhof were wiped out to a man the real communists were it was a massacre but one friekorps spya loyal young german who provided critical information during the crisismanaged to escape with friekorps help of course his name was heimut steuer and he became known among the communists as the survivor of munich and what has this helmut got to do with your plan everything but these early details are important heydrich smoothed his thinning blond hair after the party began to assert itself in germany under your inspired leadership it was decided in the interests of security to infiltrate informers into the communist cadres of our past and probable future enemiesengland and france the agents were sent into whatever countries their language abilities suited them for it was a primitive program but quite remarkable considering the state of our security services at the time a few men were sent to paris a few to marseilles those who had no second language stayed in germany and a very few were sent to england four went to manchester and leeds to work in the mills three to the mines around newcastle helmut steuer however was a unique case he had a fair grasp of french but his real gift was english hed worked the rhine packets on the english runs for most of his life and spoke the language like a london dockworker with little else but a prayer helmut was sent to london being something of a communist hero after muhich helmut was welcomed into the london cadres with open arms they considered him a great fugitivea celebrity of sorts he worked the docks for a few years always doing his bit for the party selling the daily worker like a good bolshevik but never doing quite enough to bring the british police down on him he wasnt really much use to us at that point but he was ordered to stay he had possibilities heydrich felt himself coming into stride he clearly had the fuhrers attention now n in heimut did something crazy he packed a suitcase and set out for spain with the english communists who went to fight in the international brigades and stmgely enough my fain thats when he became a real owt he drove an ambulance for the republican lo all the while passing information to francos fascists and our condor legion no one knew why he was doing ithe hadnt been ordered tobut i believe that he simply acted out of patriotism he was a loyal german he saw the reich supporting franco so he did what he could from the position he was in an excellent man hitler cried why have i not heard of him before m not sure my famr heydrich said smugly perhaps reichsfiihrer himmler never considered helmuts reports important enough to bring to your attention ridiculous i need men with initiative like the english commandos this heimut sounds like just that type of man he is better than that my fuhrer after the spanish war helmut returned to england in disfavor with the british government but an even greater hero to the british communists it was then that i suggested the idealwhich now makes plan mordred possible hitlers eyes glowed with anticipation i instructed helmut to organize his own group of communist activistand case d isolate them from the local party cadres you know the standard communist procedure they organize small groups called cells which are subordinate to various committees and finally the national party executive anyway helmut did as i asked and out of genius or by accident he hit upon a remarkable ideain short order he welded together a small highly committed group of combat veterans all rabid communists all of whom had been wounded either in the great war or in spain heydrich tilted his narrow head forward can you imagine the value of this group my fuhrer while they appeared to be merely a handful of the thousands of english patriots whod barely survived the great war in reality they were dedicated radicals men so violently disillusioned with their government that they would strike at its foundations whenever they got the chance hitler sat spellbound heydrich breathed harder helmut started small he reported the movements of the british fleet in and out of port estimated factory capacities things like that but i always believed the time would come when his group could do some real damage heydrich held up his arms in admiration in plan mordred my fuhrer you have created the perfect opportunity to exploit their special talents remember these men are combat veterans trained by the british army and this helmut hitler said his voice tremulous you believe he can talk these englishmen into carrying out our will he already has heydrich said exuberantly in small ways of course a bit of sabotage in the munitions factories improper packing of ships in london but with the right cover story hitler silenced heydrich with a stab of his right hand i why havent these men been recalled to duty in the british army i heydrich faltered a little when i said they were wounded my fuhrer i meant it in helmuts signals he refers to his unit as the verwunden brigadethe wounded brigade one of the men has only one leg another has but one hand one man is internally damaged helmut himself has only one eye he lost the other at guemica hitlers mouth fell open what you speak of cripples a oneeyed man leading a rabble of cripples against the british security services how can they possibly do what is necessary to carry out your plan they can do it heydrich said evenly helmut is the most remarkable agent i have ever come across but you i pinpointed the problem with your very first question my fuhrer how do we get helmuts verwunden brigade to assassinate churchill and the king at the place and time of our choosing just as i said heydrichs face assumed a surgeons impassivity as i said before motivation is not a problem these men believe that churchill is dragging the english working class into yet another worldwide slaughter for capitalist greed theyve already proved their sympathies by sabotaging the british war effort albeit in small ways and they certainly have no moral compunction against killing no my fuhrer the problem is one of authority these men idolize helmut but helmut alone simply hasnt the authority to order an action on that arty execuscale not even britains national communist party could order the assassination of a head of statemuch less two an order like that must originateheydrich looked hitler dead in the eyefrom moscow then we are lost hitler bellowed leaping to his feet i told you about my rumanian oil fields how can i possibly persuade stalin to mount an operation like this that crafty old bear would immediately guess our true intent you need not persuade stalin of anything said heydrich ive solved the problem already that is what took me two months my fuhrer solving problems like this but i have the answers with me tonight all of them im tired of this game heydrich get to the point the young sd chieftain nodded slowly my fuhrer do you remember a russian nwned zinovievt hitler knitted his brow the bolshevik leader of no heydrich cracked a reptilian smile a russian as opposite from a bolshevik as any man could be he was captain in the okhrana the tsars secret police hitler tugged at his forelock his eyes darted around die ry here but at heydrich the fire had teahouse looking eve w died but neither man noticed finally hitler sat down again perching on the edge of the leather easy chair proceed he said as trim and hard as a rapier reinhard heydrich stood before the most powerful man on earth and outlined the plan that would place him first in the line of succession to the black throne of the nazi empire with each new revelation his voice rose in excitement and hitler spellbound followed him up the scale and the genius of the concept heydrich exulted with the duill of consummation the beauty of it is that england will not simply be neutralized it will join us in our war against russia think of it paralyzed by grief the british people will cry out to their new leaders for guidance and they will be told by those leadersyour mento do exactly what they so desire to dotake revenge on the godless enemy on russia the cradle of assassins and to do that they must reach out to you barbarossa will become an aryan crusade hitlers facial muscles had seized into an almost catatonic spasm his right hand shook as if from palsy the genius of heydrichs plan had burst into his brain with the brilliance of a dying star all his life hitler had fed upon the intellects of more timid men seizing upon their revolutionary ideas and charging forward without looking back nowgiven heydrichs plan like a gift from heaven itselfhe reveled in the knowledge that he would once again beat all the odds once again prove himself right and all his generals wrong this certainty coursed through his veins like a blast of morphine visions of conquest flashed behind his eyes the kremlin shattered and smoldering in black ashes tall young germans tilling the great fields of the ukraine german ships sailing forth from odessa and archangel i see it hitler cried i see it all now e scurried around the table like a human lightning rod attempting to discharge itself it can work churchill is going to die and the king heydrich added euphorically my fuhrer helmut assures me that it can be done zinoviev is already preparing for the mission my god hitler murmured suddenly mortified how do you communicate with helmut i dont its always been a oneway conduit because of that yes i had to send a man into england with a message what i take full responsibility my fuhrer i felt that this mission was simply too important to risk by using radio communications i trust no one i never even contacted lord granville and what if your messenger had been captured he wasnt and what if he read your message herr obergruppenfiihrer what if he decided to sell it to the highest bidder the message was in code heydrich replied evenly he simply delivered an envelope and returned with a oneword answer ja hitlers voice went shrill withparanoia and you think this courier knows nothing can reveal nothing what if he decides to sell his knowledge now that would be impossible my fuhrer i shot him myself five minutes after he delivered helmuts reply hitler said nothing for a long while putting his hand to his chin he looked out through one of the smallpaned windows near the fireplace outside the snow had begun to fall again remarkable he murmured he took his walking stick from its resting place on the hearth and turned back to heydrich lets return to the berghof we can talk on the way back they walked through the darkness without speaking the crunch of heydrichs boots on the hardpacked snow punctuated their progress across the mountain now and then the howls of german shepherds reverberated across the rocky slope after twenty minutes they reached the parking area hitler fixed heydrich with his dark gaze are you confident that helmuts englishmen can reach their targets herr obergruppenfiihrer can they kill both men on the tenth of may my fuhrer heydrich said confidently any man can be assassinated on any day if one critical condition is satisfied what condition that the assassin be prepared to die in the doing of the deed hitlers eyes narrowed and you believe these englishmen will die for helmut heydrich blinked against the wind no they will die for their lost ideals they will die for their godsleniii and marx for moscow perhaps but most of all they will die believing they have delivered their country from the clutches of ruthless oppressors who have held englands poorand half of the rest of the worldsin slavejy for a very long time they will die to become martyrs remarkable hitler said finally you seem to have considered every possibility heydrich nodded with formal correctness i shall leave you here heydrich is there anything further you require from me yes heydrich answered without hesitation a diversion if you could possibly arrange some type of limited attack on england on may tentha small commando attack on a channel port perhaps a uboat raid near london ive already taken care of that hitler said have no fear your assassins will have all the confusion they need on the night of may tenth i shall unleash the most devastating air attack london has ever known and it will be the last raid against great britain at least until russia has been conquered perhaps then he trailed off his voice soft and ruminative heydrich licked his windburned lips unexpectedly he had discovered the courage to ask the question which had haunted him since the night hitler first gave him his assignment my fuhrer he said tentatively yes with all respect you have not told me much about the political side of the mission to be quite frank it worries me the success of the entire operation hinges on a single factor and that factor is beyond my control what are you talking about my fuhrer again with all respect do you have englishmen ready to assume control of the government when churchill dies when the king is dead my sources indicate that does not concern you hitler jabbed a stiff finger into heydrichs chest you have lord grenvilles name you know all you need to for now just make certain that your cripples carry out their orders hess has the names he will handle the political side of the mission too shocked to be afraid heydrich raised his eyebrows in surprise reichminister hess my fuhrer but i was under the impression that your confidence in him was waning both goring and himmler speak of him a goring and himmler you should spend less time listening to gossip and more time studying how the party rose to the position it now holds hess has done more for me than hitler shook his fist in the air let me tell you something heydrich it took hess just one month to do what you could not do in a year hess rooted out the traitor in our midst and that traitor is your own bosshimmler yesloyal heinrich already he searches for ways to usurp my power and you working right under his nose you could not see it hitlers face suddenly darkened or could you heydrich blanched no my fuhrer i swear to you what can i do to prove my loyalty i shall arrest the reichsfiihrer myself r arr dont be ridiculous hitler soffedwe cannot est the head of the ss for treason no we shall rely on the safety mechanism already in place heydrich wiped his brow with relief his hand was shaking my fuhrer a disturbing thought has occurred to me it concerns the double program if reichsfiihrer himmler is indeed a traitor it is all the more frightening i think you should place all the doubles from the practical school under my direct command what the devil are you talking about heydrich hitler scowled in confusion my fuhrer consider this if god forbid a traitor succeeded in having you assassinated the doubles could be of inestimable value to that traitor in gaining the confidence of the people and the army if the traitor could present a trusted comrade of yoursreichminister hess for examplea true people nazi who would stand at his side like an ally the might well accept the traitors authority himmler is cettainly devious enough to have worked this out this terrifying possibility seemed to shrink hitler in his very clothes i want every double shot immediately he cried such a risk cannot be tolerated heydrich replied very softly my fuhrer perhaps you might reconsider our political doubles represent a tremendous investment of time and resources i believe they will ar with russia you prove invaluable to us in the coming w could remove the danger simply by placing them under my direct command hitlers black eyes bored relentlessly into heydrichs face probing for disloyalty after a full minute of silence he said permission granted then he added for now tar ri i tu an tried heydrich s ed in surp se as hit er med d hu up the frozen path my fuhrer he calledhastening up the slope after him nothing can stop us now failure is not a possibility hitler paused twenty meters from the berghof in a flat pie d voice suddenly drained of anger he said i am ase heydrich when barbarossa is completed i shall not forget you once russias vast lands lie under our control i will need a man of iron to rule hera reichprotector i can trustare you that man heydrich as you command my fuhrer without a word hitler turned and marched up the steps to the berghof heydrich stood motionless in the snow the promise of a reichprotectorship made his heart pound but a darker dread still ate at his confidence in the face of hitlers wrath he had quailed from voicing his deepest doubt about plan mordredhis nagging suspicion that the fuhrers english sympathizerswhoever they might bewere actually i ure germany into a for britain nation any human effort but w it the game had to be played sure that his part ran smoothly from this moment forward heydrich existed almost without sleep without food the fuhrer had extended the light of power to him and he moved through his days like he was sworn to a holy quest his allies in that quest were an embittered russian expatriate and a oneeyed german agent living in the heart of beleaguered london all lived only that a fat english warrior and a shy english king might die in hitlers small study on the second floor of the berghof rudolf hess anxiously awaited his fuhrer dressed in his gray uniform he sat behind a desk littered with architectural plans and sketches most of the sketches were by hitler hess recognized the cramped untutored style the building plans though had been drafted by albert speer stronglined and wellproportioned the great avenue of the fuhrers new berlin stretched across the desk like a blueprint of the future the magnificent imperial palace the triumphal arch that would dwarf the one in parisl seemed the natural fruit of the labor of the new reich a mighty city built to endure for a thousand years or so it seeed on those happier occasions when hess had studied these plans in the past he would never look at them in quite the same way again the party and the reich that he had once viewed as a united forcean unstoppable juggernaut destined for immortalityhe now saw as a fragile alliance of ambitious men held together only by their common fear of adolf hitler since hesss momentous meeting with the fuhrer in january both heinrich himmler and hermann goring had deduced the real reason for hesss training flights at gestapo headquarters in berlin hess had conducted a conversation with reichsfiihrer himmler that could only be described as a war of nerves the smell of treason had hung in the room like cordite as the two men spoke in measured tones hess had realized that himmlers office was in every sense of the word a battlefield in the narrow confines of four walls words became bullets names flashed like tracers and the silences were mined as lethally as the sands around tobruk himmler had claimed that the british would never make peace with hitler but might make peace with germany if he himself sat in the seat of power thenas hesss rage boiled overhimmler had disguised his power grab by claiming it would be a mere strategy to trick the british into making peace hess had not been fooled behind himmlers bland face and pincenez glasses hess had glimpsed a power lust more sickening than the greed of any jew he had left the prinzalbrechtstrasse with no doubt that heinrich himmler was a traitor goring had been very different if the conversation wi only in terms of style himmler had begun his interrogation on an obscure pretext and arrived at his main point only after circumlocuting a veritable maze of halftruths and theolike the fighter nes goring charged in with guns blazing ace he was in substance however gorings assessment of the british position had been remarkably close to himmlersno peace with germany ever unlike himmler though the corpulent luftwaffe chief had not suggested treason hess recalled gorings last words with grudging admiration if the fuhrer wants to invade russia now it is our duty to stand by him to the end whether the reward be ambrosia or cyanide its war now hess war to the bloody end yet gorings opinion of germanys future had been plain to see he had pronounced hesss intended peace mission to england suicidal then declared that if hitifr attacked russia before finishing britain all was lost hess thanked god that nded on the iihrer was in good health if the future depe men like himmler and goring the fatherland was indeed lost rudi said a soft voice e doorway of the hess turned quickly silhouetted in the study adolf hitler stood watching him intently hess tried to read the black eyes but they were as ever inscrutable regarding hess from the door hitler felt a strange almost paternal sadness hesss broad shoulders strong jaw and high aryan forehead fanned the flames of pride in his breast the resolute eyes looked back at him with a frankness that seemed to say i am ready for anything command and i shall obey but was hess ready for anything was he ready for plan mordred explaining the operational details of the mission would be easy hess would admire the plan for its boldness and intricacy technical details fascinated him but the restmy fuhrer hess said abruptly i am curious about something its been two weeks since i informed you of reichsfiihrer himmlers seditious conversation yet nothing seems to have been done are you delaying punishment for some reason hitler smiled wanly remember the old proverb rudi better the devil you know than the one you dont but himmler could betray you at any moment hitler sighed sooner or later rudi he will probably try it is a delicate balancing act i perform it has en from the beginning its the same for ill men of power churchill stalin mussolini rooseveltno one is immune himmlers ss is powerful old friend too powerful to alienate or ignore but it is also corrupt himmler fears heydrichhis subordinateyet he thinks because heydrich has a little jewish blood he can be controlled by blackmail hitlers eyes flickered like black stars dont worry rudi i have my own controls over reichsfiihrer himmler his personal adjutant happens to be heydrichs man and heydrich is my man one word from me night or day and himmler dies but for the presentwhile he is usefulhe lives hess looked unconvinced i expected it to be goring hitler confided i always thought him weaker than himmler hess nodded i must confess that i thoughti hoped the same thing i never liked goring hes a braggart and a libertine but he is also loyal for the time being at least youre so straightforward old friend hitler thought perhaps that is why i trust you heydrich explained it all so well made it seem so easy and mechanical but in truth it isnt the english fanatics who will die afterfiring bullets into the brains of their leaders mean nothing they are ma chines like tanks or rockets but you hess are the closest thing to a friend i have left how can i explain to you that the same rules which apply to five communist fanatics also apply to you yet somehow i must for england must be neutralized churchill must die and contrary to what heydrich boasts failure is always a possibility in the eventgod forbidthat something does go wrong my personal envoy and confidant cannot be captured on british soil for in your head you carry the secrets of barbarossaif the impossible happensif the fanatics miss their targets if they lose their nerve if theyre caught if the mission is blown and the great gamble is all for nothingmy messenger will i have to die you hess will have to die and quite simply there will be no one there to kill you no reinhard heydrichno steelyeyed ss officer sworn to shoot without question at my order you will have to do it yourself can you do that i wonder you once proclaimed to a multitude that i adolf hitler was germanywill you die for germany old friend will you die for me with his right hand on hesss powerful shoulder hitler looked deeply into the bright worshipful eyes rudi he said softly there are two possibilities one hour later rudolf hess rose and marched to the door of the study he turned and placed his right fist against his heart my fuhrer he said to die for germany is no more than we ask of any soldier in the most extreme circumstance i shall sacrifice myself with an unfaltering heart my only regret is for my wife and son hess paused for a moment too full of emotion to speak yes he said at leng even they would understanddeutschland fiber alles these words are our creed hess took a deep breath and squared his shoulders do not let this trouble you my fuhrer we were never meant to fight the english and this is the solution fate has provided us you adolf hitler were sent by god to free the world from the scourge of the bolshevik and the jew i believe that with all my heart if my death were to bring our goal one day closer my life would not have been wasted but i shall not fail hess nodded solemnly i await your final orders hell hitler aliment the hitler felt a numbing jolt of profound lull sight of rudolf hess tall and resolute his hardmuscled right arm extended in the nazi salute moved him almost to tears this man born to wear the german uniform possessed a devotion far deeper than loyalty deeper than patriotism as hess turned and marched through the study door adolf hitler his hands resting on the plans for the worlds youngest imperial city realized that he had not asked the ultimate sacrifice of his deputy or his friendbut his disciple b k two th af d if the jew conquers the nations of this world his crown will become the funeral wreath of humanity and once again this janet empty of mankind will move p rough the ether as it did thousands of years ago eternal nature inexorably revenges the transgressions of her laws therefore i believe today that i am acting in the sense of the almighty creator by warding off the jews i am fighting for the lords work adolf hitler mein kampf chapter twentythree am lufthansa flight south african airspace the german airliner shuddered against the increased drag of descent hans apfel took a deep breath and gripped the armrests tighter the announcement bell rang attention ladies and gentlemen said a male voice this is your captain speaking we are now beginning our descent into jan smuts international airport we expect to arrive on schedule the temperature is seventyeight degrees fahrenheit in johannesburg theres been no rain for two weeks and none expected soon we hope you enjoy your stay in south africa and we appreciate your flying lufthansa danke schdn nice change hauer remarked what said hans the weather what its summer here hans no snow weve hardly had a break for three weeks in berlin oh sorry i was thinking about the exchange have you settled on the plan yet hauer nodded with our limited resources theres really only one option weve got to find some place thats really open but with plenty of concealment for me an empty football stadium would be ideal i can hide in the standsthe high groundwhile you make the exchange on the field youll have two jobs the first is acting acting hauer nodded youre going to be holding a grenade and youve got to act like youll blow everyone to hell if they dont hand ilse over as soon as they touch the papers i wont have to act hans said im afraid you will it wont be a live grenade we wont have access to one well buy an empty one at an army surplus shop the grenade is just a prop to speed things along we want ilse in your hands ten seconds after you hand the papers over and my second job running as soon as you get ilse youll start walking toward preplanned cover the kidnappers will have no intention of letting you escape alive of course when you hear the first shots you run like hell whats your job hauer made a pistol with his thumb and forefinger suppressing fire the second you get ilse clear of my line of fire i start knocking people down the first shot you hear will be mine ill take out the men on the field plus anyone they may have covering the exchange location hans studied hauers face can you do that i wont lie to you two snipers would be better but im still one of the best rifle shotsin germany i can do it hans stared out of the small window at the stars hanging in the african darkness have you used this plan before hauer smiled faintly ive seen it used ten years ago i saw terrorists use it successfully against the cologne police oh the lufthansa jet leaned sixtyfive degrees to starboard banking for final approach hans gripped the armrests of his seat and stared straight ahead hauer watched him silently wishing he could reassure his son more at least he had spared hans what he himself knew that the terrorists who had used his hostageexchange plan had escaped the cologne football stadium only to be blown to pieces in a train station an hour later escaping an exchange point with ilse might not be too difficult escaping from south africa was another thing altogether hauer laid his callused hand over hanss and squeezed tightly well get her boy he said softly hans looked over at his father fils jaw resolute im ready but theres something i cant get out of my mind who cut the throat of that afrikaner who attacked professor nattennan why did he do it and where did he go did he just disappear hauers face darkened he knew exactly why the unknown killer had cut the afrikaners throat and if hans opened the foil packet in his inside coat pocket he would know too the killer had escaped with three pages of the spandau diary at hauers orders the packet had remained hidden for the duration of the flight but sooner or later hans would have to be told the truth otherwise he would find it out for himself hans he said ive got a feeling we may meet our elusive killer sooner than you think il am el al flight over tai aviv israel the elal flew a lazy racetrack pattern over bengurion eet airport at a comfortable twentyeight thousand f one of a dozen tiny blips on the emerald airtraffic screens belowan equipment malfunction on an eastern whisperedt on runway had caused a delay and until the men who monitored the skies over tel aviv granted clearance professor natterman and his reticent jewish companion would have to wait in the sky along with two hundred and seventy other impatient travelers what are these mysterious things we need to pick up natterman asked weapons explosives ess we will need weapstern looked out at the darkn them in south ons he murmured but well have to get africa not israel i arranged it all from your cabin natterman tried without success to ignore the acid stomach he had developed during the flight from hamburg combined with the stinging pain radiating from his ripped pected delay almost nostril the indigestion made the unex unbearable do you think theyve arrived in pretoria yet he asked stern looked at his watch if they took the first flight out of frankfurt they should be landing in johannesburg right about now god help them stern grunted skeptically ive been thinking about what you told me back in frankfurt natterman said about that lord granville character the one who owns the corporation called phoenix ag if granville is english and his company is based in south africa why did you come to berlin at all thats a good question professor but the answer is complicated and for now at least private if youre not going to tell me anything natterman grumbled why did you bring me along in the first place a man like you doesnt do things without a very good reason thats true professor stern said i brought you with me for two reasons one is that you may be able to provide historical information that might help me i know youre bursting at the seams to tell me your theories about rudolf hess and there is some of it i need to hear but first let me explain how this is going to work you want information about what i think is going on in south africa fair enough but you are going to have to earn it you will answer my questions about the hess case now then i will decide how much information to give you in return if you tell me things i do not already know ill reward you in kind but this is the only time we will discuss rudolf hess do you agree natterman sat without speaking for nearly a minute then he cleared his throat and said what do you want to know tell me about hess and the british was there a pronazi clique high in the british government in natterman folded his hands together on his lap its very complicated stern i think i can stay with you herr einstein all right then yes there was a group of nazi appeasersvery highly placedwho wanted to make a deal with hitler thats been proved or at least its being proved by an oxford academic the question is was that group sincere do you follow me stern were the members of this group english fascists who loved the swastika or simply war profiteers out for all the gold they could get were they paranoid anticommunists who wanted peace at any price so that hitler would be free to crush russia or d heres the rubwere they patriotic englishmen leading hitler by the nose until it was too late for him to invade england do you see my point about complexity stern waved his hand and if they were genuinely pronazi natterman went on were they truly operating in secret or was british intelligerice aware of them all along after all what better stalling ploy could mi have come up with than to a real traitors to lead hitler onletting him think he could neutralize england without an invasionuntil he could no longer wait to attack russia remember these traitors werent the class of people one likes to arrest for treasonwere talking about the backbone of british government and industry what if mi decided to use these blueblooded turncoats while they could and then slap them on their noble wrists when it was all over are you with me stern im ahead of you professor what if the top officers of british intelligenceexpecting a few closet reds from oxfordwere virulent anticommunists brothersinspirit with your alleged aristocratic prohitler clique what if for strictly pragmatic reasons british intelligence wanted to do a deal with hitler thereby freeing him to crush stalin or british intelligence could have been ordered to explore such a deal in that case the impetus to make peace with hitler would have originated at the highest level of british government and i mean the very top excluding churchill of course but including the monarchy stern winked at natterman are you with me professor natterman gave him a black look you should have been a historian damn you youve struck the main pillar of my thesisthe duke of windsor british intelligence has been helping to conceal windsors shadowy past for years all records of the dukes wartime activities are sealed forever by order of her majestys government yet in spite of that theres a growing body of hard evidence linking windsor to the nazis its almost certain that in the duke met hess secretly in lisbon to try to reach an acconunodation with hitler that would put him back on the throne windsor was the archetype of the privileged russophobic jewhating british admirer of hitler and im sure youre aware of the fact that many informed sources believe british intelligence murdered number seven in spandau last month yes but i have my doubts about that im not sure that in this day and age the british would kill over the reputation of the royal family its tarnished enough already if windsor were merely the tip of an iceberg natterman mused they might many historians believe that lord halifax the british foreign secretary during the war and possibly as many as forty ranking members of parliament continued to try to make a deal with hitler long after churchill declared we shall never surrender i doubt if the most revered families in england would care to have their names linked to adolf hitler after all these years and no englishman in his right mind wants churchills their finest hour myth stained think about it stern neville chamberlain is excoriated today and he was merely an appeaser men who sought to accommodate hitler after the battle of britain would be branded collaborators natterman looked thoughtful you know id be surprised if some of those noble english family trees havent spread quite a few branches into south africa branches stern muttered its roots im interested in professor and not the roots of the past either i mean the roots of conspiracy in the present the here and now thats where the threat to israel is nattermans eyelids lowered in meditation i dont know about any threat to israel he said but i think ive earned some information stern the israeli shook his head slowly professor what you have told me thus far is available in libraries i want your analysis amaze me with the fruits of your years of scholarship natterman looked up at stern his lips pale with anger if you know so much why dont you finish this conversation alone when stern didnt respond natterman said all right ill give you something but youd better be prepared to pay me back in kind ask and it shall be given professor thats the new testament stern you were saying natterman actually blushed as he whispered his next words what i am about to tell you stern i learned by by rather dubious means sterns eyes flickered interest as i told you several historians are currently working on the hess mystery two of them are at oxford university you may not know this stern but history is a very competitive field in the top rank anyway and it pays to know all you can about your competition are you telling me that you have your own spies professor a spandau phoenix natterman averted his eyes i prefer to call them g friends the israeli chuckled naturally one of these friends said natterman managed to get a very close look at the hess research going on at oxford it seems that theres a very mysterious fellow who figures in the hess case a heretofore unheard of fellow who seems to have done some particularly nasty mischief on the night of may tenth in the oxford draft papers he is referred to as helmut but another german in england on helmut stern sat up that night natterman smiled cagily the oxford draft research indicates that however i belive that helmut is simply a code namea device that the oxford historians are using to mask this persons real identity never in my own research have i found anyone named helmut associated with the hess case in any way youre not telling me you think helmut is a code name for the real hess natterman smiled triumphantly in the oxford papers helmut is referred to as having had one particularly distinguishing characteristic stern i think it will interest you well he had only one eye stern looked surprised then thoughtful that might tie in with our tattoo he allowed but i shouldnt think youd be too happy about it since rudolf hess had two perfectly good eyes natterman raised a long forefinger he did as of may tenth but if hess survived that nightas i believe he didhe had plenty of time left to lose an eye he might even have lost it on the very night of his flight you should be writing movies professor do you know how many men lost eyes in the second world war do you plan to scour all africa for a oneeyed man in the hope he will lead you to your fantasy nazi well see how fanciful i am natterman muttered why couldnt there have been a german named helmut in england on that night in may asked stern there could have been natterman admitted but there wasnt sohave i earned your half of the story yes professor i think you have just one more question though were there any russians involved in the hess case as far as you know russians natterman was silent in hesss original mission none that i know of but ill certainly think about it please do that and please remember our deal when we get on the ground no fairy stories about rudolf hess in front of anyone talk like that can make some jews very upset natterman nodded solemnly attention ladies and gentlemen demanded the loudspeaker please take your seats we have been cleared for approach to bengurion airport a collective sigh of relief went up throughout the plane stern chuckled and touched nattermans sleeve im afraid my contribution to this epic will have to wait for the second leg of our journey natterman studied the israelis tanned angular face you said information was the first reason you brought me with you stern what was the secondt stern looked away from the professor when he looked back his eyes were dark and hara phoenix kidnapped your granddaughter professor you are her closest blood relative that makes you my direct line into phoenix im not sure how yet but i think you might just be my best weapon against them natterman leaned thoughtfully back in his seat as the pilot stretched his holding pattern into a smooth approach and made a flawless landing on the main runway a security gate with metaldetection and xray equipment awaited the deplaning passengers at the end of a long passage but when stern presented his wallet to the senior security officer he and natterman were waved throuph thats no small trick in this ountry natterman said is it stern what exactly did you do for a living before you retired stern didnt answer he was searching the concourse for something or someone he apparently expected to find waiting you must be with the mossad natterman guessed thats it isnt it stern kept watching the crowd i go back a lot further than the mossad professor you should know that yes but its something similar ill bet something c unsavory gadi stern cried suddenly the israeli was moving across the concourse at great speed not running but taking long strides that seemed to swallow distance effortlessly natterman tried to pick out sterns objective but couldnt until he reappeared out of the milling crowd with one arm draped affectionately around a dark young man of about twentyfive professor natterman stern said meet gadi abrams my greatnephew my pleasure herr professor said the young man graciously extending a sunbrowned hand guten abend said natterman turning to stern is this one of the packages we stopped to pick up yes professor one of three two smiling young men appeared from behind gadi abrams they extended darktanned hands to natterman nodded politely then embraced stern as if they hadnt seen the older man for many months aaron said stern yosefthis is professor natterman of the free university of berlin the young men nodded courteously but said nothing both appeared to be about gadis age if not younger and both carried canvas overnight bags stern began walking down the concourse toward a row of expensive restaurants talking quietly to his nephew as he moved natterman tried to keep close enough to the pair to overhear their conversation aaron and yosef padded along behind at a discreet distance stern finally turned into a restaurant styled after a french cafethe only one open at this hour he waved away a bald waiter who started toward them with a sheaf of menus what about the plane gadi he asked in hebrew how long you wont believe this uncle but a fliiht leaves for johannesburg in ninety minutes siz bashert stern breathed it is meant to be nonstop one stopover athens good enough rpri ki ht to you dont seem su sed uncle luc ng into a flig south africa onsuch short notice i couldnt believe it it wasnt luck gadi i called an old friend of mine in the air force and requested a bit of creative rescheduling youre kidding they can do that i really wasnt sure my faith in mankind is renewed gadi laughed infectiously its very good to se you again uncle traveling first class as usual professor natterman could contain himself no longer as far as he was concerned the conversation had taken a sudden turn into outer space stern he interrupted would you please tell me why we are sitting here in this godforsaken airport while my granddaughter is in mortal danger in south africa stern switched back to german professor your manners leave quite a bit to be desired however i do appreciate your motive in ninety minutes we board an el al flight to johannesburg from whence we shall begin our search for your granddaughter we are only one day behind hauer and apfel and we know the time and location of their rendezvous with the kidnappers the burgerspark hotel at eight tomorrow night remember and remember this also that our interests happen to coincide is for you a lucky twist of fate for me that remains to be seen the israelis words infuriated natterman but since he imew stern could simply abandon him in the airport he decided to remain silent now said stern i suggest we all have something to eat i expect everyone to sleep during the flight once we land in south africa we wont have much time for it he summoned the waiter with a flick of his eyes everyone took one of the flimsy paper menus cheer up professor stern said you and gadi should have quite a lot to talk about he took his degree in history just last year really said natterman he looks more like a soldier than a scholar to me gadi stiffened you have a good eye professor stern said gending his nephew with a quick glance you may prove to be more of an asset than i thought four tables away sat an expensively dressed woman with bluerinsed hair she looked dun for her agewhich could have been anywhere between fifty and sixtyand she was obviously not an israeli a louis vuitton handbag lay or table beside it stood a glass of orange juice when the waiter inquired if the woman would like to order some food she politely declined her voice was pitched low but the waiter thought it very pleasant in the babel of the mideast there was nothing like a crisp british accent to tickle the ear when the woman smiled the waiter thought the smile was for him but he was wrong it was for jonas stern swallow had acquired her target am jon smuts airpoll johannesbarg the taxi was a small clappedout ford it stood out sharply from the short line of rovers and mazdas which were mostly new and owned by the same two taxi companies hauer chose a taxi over the shuttle bus because he wanted speed and privacy the fortymile taxi ride to pretoria would be outrageously expensive but money was the least of their worries he chose the old ford because he wanted a driver with some characteran entrepreneur english the driver asked with a strong indian accent swiss hauer replied the driver switched to a strange but fluent german oddly enough the teutonic consonants did not prevent the dark ypung man from speaking with the singsong inflection of his native country and where do you wish to go he crooned you speak german hauer said surprised most happily yes taught to me by a cousin on my mothers side his father was a houseboy to the german ambassador in new delhi he knew the language well and i picked it up quite easily when they moved back to calcutta i pick up all languages easily a wonderful aid in my humble profession hans sank back into the fords rear seat and listened to the indians spiel luxuriating in the stability of the automobile listen hauer said breaking the indians flow we need to get to pretoria my son and i are stockbrokers weve come to south africa to do a little business but also to have a little fun you understand most certainly sir said the driver sensing the possibility of a generous tip for this reason wed like you to take us to a somewhat cheaper establishment than you might expecta fleabag one might say i understand perfectly sir the driver assured him appraising hauer in the rearview mirror then drive said hauer and keep your eyes on the road the ford jumped to life and joined the stream of taxis moving out of the airport like a line of beetles salil is my name the indian sang out at your service hauer said nothing sir salil tried again what is it i believe i understand your requirements perfectly but might i suggest that for gentlemen such as yourselves a fleabagas you so accurately call itmight be just the type of place where you are most quickly noticed why not one of the higherpriced hotels if you have the money of course you would blend right in and no one would think of asking questions privacy is at a premium in such places hauer considered this any suggestions he asked liking the idea better the more he thought about it the burgerspark is an excellent hotel hans jumped as if struck physically where else hauer asked quickly the flfotea hof is also a fine hotel sir salil glanced furtively at his rearview mirror the protea hof it is while the taxi sped northward hauer peered out at the ultramodern skyline of johannesburg the city of gold dozens of brightly lit skyscrapers towered above a dense network of elevated freeways compared to this futuristic metropolis west berlin looked like a sooty handmedown south africa looked nothing like what hauer had expected already he sensed the change in altitude the huge expanses of space around him sir salil said catching hauers eye in the rearview mirror yes would you be interested to know that someone is following us hauer clutched hanss shoulder to keep him from turning any idea who it might be he asked calmly yes sir i believe they are british agents theyve been with us since the airport hauer heard a sharp intake of breath as hans slid down in his seat and how would you know that he asked i saw many british agents in india salil explained ive seen that car at the airport many times before the young man driving it though i have not hauer rubbed his stubbled chin thoughtfully hans tried to turn around but hauer restrained him ive changed my mind driver he said well check into the burgerspark after all very good sir hans opened his mouth to protest but hauer whispered theres already a room there in your name we might as well let the kidnappers think youre really staying there driver yes sir could you lose that car after we check into the burgerspark id make it worth your trouble certainly sir the indian replied foreseeing a very good tip indeed you are in most excellent hands the taxi climbed from the airport road onto the northbound side of highway the left side of the road hauer noticed as in englandwhere a few lorries rumbled languidly toward pretoria hauer wondered what he and hans would find in the capital city had ilse apfel really been brought there or did she still wait somewhere back in snowbound berlin was she still alive the professional in hauer doubted it but some deeper part of him still held out hope for hanss sake he supposed he flattened his palm against the taxis window and felt the heat strange this sudden change of seasons he thought but he liked it he felt good and he knew he would feel even better once hed met the enemy face to face thirty minutes to pretoria sir salil sang out no hurry hauer lied watching hans carefully no hurry at all chapter twentyfour am the northern transvaal the republic of south africa ilse awakened slowly like a diver fighting to the surface of a deep black lake finally aware she found herself in a bed tucked beneath cotton bedcovers she was naked tacky residue from the tape that had bound her on the jet made the sheets stick to her skin she tried to remember how she had lost her clothes but could not her eyes darted around the room the bedroom was sparsely but expensively furnished an antique bureau a chair an end table and the bed no windows just two doorsone halfopen and leading to a bathroom the other closed no telephone nothing offered any clue as to where she was or what lay beyond the four walls wrapping the blanket tight around her she climbed out of the bed and tried the closed door it was locked a moment later she found the note it lay on the teak bureau weighted by a silver hand mirror written in german on a small white card were the words frau apfel welcome to horn house please make yourself presentable all will be made clear at dinner alfred horn when ilse saw her face reflected in the hand mirror she put a quivering finger to her cheek her fine blond hair hung in lank dirty strands and her usually luminous eyes looked gray and opaque beneath swollen lids the shock of seeing herself in such a state drove her into the adjoining bathroom standing before a long mirror she dropped the blanket from her shoulders and saw the welts left by the tape her neck wrists and ankles bore the angry red marks sudden panic wriggled in her chest gooseflesh rose like quills on her arms and thighs there were other marks too deep blue bruises mottling her breasts and thighs they reminded ilse of the times when she and hans had made love mo rougmy except this was different somehow she looked as though she had been fighting someone had she oh god she thought wildly suddenly remembering the lieutenant the arrogant animal who had exposed himself to her on the plane he had drugged her ilse remembered the needle lancing into her immobilized arm the possibility that she had been raped while unconscious hit her in a hot nauseous wave barely able to keep her balance she stumbled into the shower and cranked on the hot water until it early scalded she scrubbed her skin raw while the steaming spray obliterated her tears where was she she had been airborne for a long time she knew that her entire body ached she felt as though she had slept thirty hours or more she vaguely remembered the plane touching downa jarring bump followed by murmured voices she did not understandbut it had lifted off again and shed slipped back into a black void rather than feel the hot water drain away slowly ilse shut it off altogether and let the frigid spray shock her back to reality she screamed once twice but endured the icy torrent until her head pounded from the cold shutting it off at last she wrapped one towel around her waist and used another to dry her hair in the bureau drawer she found some lotion which she applied liberally to her swollen wrists and ankles the air in the bedroom felt strangely warm she let the towel fall and reached for her clothes then with a start remembered that she had none as she bent to retrieve her towel she caught her reflection in a dressing mirror straightening up she stared at her belly drawn taut and flat from lack of food with her forefinger she traced a line from her pubic triangle to her navel how long she wondered how long before you begin to show little one a sftwge serenity slowly warmed ilses heart in spite of the desperate situation she felt a powerful conviction that she had but one obligation nowto survive not for herself but for her child and with this realization came a resolution no matter what horrors or indig nines she might face in the next hours or days she would not act in any way that might cause her harm not even she wanted to die because harm done to her would be harm done to her baby and that was simply unacceptable she still felt nauseated which was surprising because so far she had not experienced any morning sickness then with a shiver she again recalled the needle on the plane oh no she thought dizzily her mouth suddenly dry could the drug have hurt my baby without warning the bedroom door banged open ilse froze in terror looming in the doorway stood a black woman who appeared to be at least six feet tall she could have been thirty or sixty her ebony skin was smooth but her deep eyes glowed like ancient onyx stones madam will dress she said in stilted german she stepped forward and set a soft bundle on the edge of the bed ilse recognized the bundle as her clothes they had been washed and neatly folded where am i she asked what day is this madam will dress please the woman repeated in a deep resonant voice she pointed to the small end table by the bed it is nearly three of the clock i come in one quarter of the hour dinner then before ilse could speak again the giant black woman f slipped out and shut the door ilse sprang forward but the doorknob would not turn alone again she fought back another wave of tears and reached for her clothes alfred horn sat in his wheelchair in the study his hunched back to a low fire he watched his afrikaner security chief put down a red telephone well pieter linah says frau apfel is awake now sir she slept so long horn said worriedly i dont mind waiting dinner of course even until three in the morning but it seems very odd pieter smuts sighed wearily sir do you really think you have time to dally with this young girl pieter pieter horn admonished its much more than that i dont expect you to understand but its been years since i dined with a real german and a frau at me this indulgence smuts looked unconvinced what is she like pieter tell me shes quite young early twenties id guess and bea tiful i must admit tall and slender with fair skin her hair blond eyes smuts hesitated for an instant i didnt see her eyes sir she was unconscious when she arrived unconscious horn asked sharplyim afraid so but i instructed that no drugs of any kind be used yes sir im afraid frau apfel arrived in rather poor condition sir she had bruises about her legs and torso i ordered the doctor to examine her she wasnt sexually molested but he thinks the police lieutenant who accompanied her from berlin probably used an intravenous barbiturate to quiet her quivering with rage horn wheeled around to face the fire can no one follow orders he screeched where is the swine smuts heard the old man wheezing as if unable to get enou h oxygen hqs in one of the basement cells sir do you have a particular punishment in mind horn did not reply but when he finally turned back around his distorted face had regained its composure all in good time he mumbled help me pieter smuts moved behind the wheelchair but the old man shook his head impatiently no come around front beg your pardon sir help me up horn demanded up sir do it smuts bent slightly and with slim but powerful arms drew the old man bodily out of the chair are you sure sir he absolutely horn croaked trying to subdue the pain in ruined leg joints the jungfrau will see me as a natural n before she sees me as an invalid even after these it two years pieter i still cant accept it that once a mfior athlete should be reduced to this its obscene it comes to all of us sir smuts commiserated thats no comfort none at all is dinner ready when you are sir horns dun legs trembled lets go then take my arm sir only to the hallway pieter then im on my own smuts nodded he knew the old man was in great pain but he also knew that if alfred horn meant to walk to the dining room under his own power nothing would stop him seated in the huge dining room ilse tried desperately to conceal the panic that knotted her stomach she sensed the presence of the tall black woman behind her watching fighting the urge to turn she concentrated on the spectacular table she had never seen such splendor gathered in one place before hutschenreuther china rimmed with eighteenkarat gold fine lead crystal from dresden antique silver from augsburg the fact that each piece was of german manufacture reassured her on the plane she had worried that her captors might take her out of the country now she felt hans could not be too far away as she stared up into a sparkling chandelier alfied horn appeared in the doorway and strode with slow dignity to the head of the table guten abend frau apfel he said inclining his whitehaired head with courtly grace ilses heart leaped the moment she saw the frail old man she knew that he had the power to free her in spite of horns advanced age his gaze burned with an intensity ilse had seen in very few men during her life she stamd to her feet but the strong hands of the bantu woman pressed her firmly back into her seat struggling to silence the screams of his arthrific knees alfred horn seated himself please he said do me the honor of sharing my table before we discuss any details of this awkward situation there will be no chains or rubber hoses here you might even find this to be an enjoyable evening if you but allow yourself to sit pieter smuts took the nearest chair to horns left allow me to introduce myself the old man said i am alfred horn master of this house the man across the table from you is my security chief pieter smuts horn frowned at a large wooden clock hanging over the buffet to his right and any moment now he added we should be joined by a young man wh a sudden flurry of footsteps in the hall heralded the arrival of the tardy guest a young man who hurried in and took the seat next to ilse without a word he looked to be about hanss age perhaps a couple of years older his ne was short and thick his head a size too largeindeed all is features seemed a little oversizedand his sandy hair though freshly combed was wet beneath his sunburned nose ilse noticed something she saw all too often at parties in berlin the gleam of clear mucus that often betrayed the recent use of cocaine youre late horn complained sorry said the young man without a trace of apology theres a late rerun of the open on the telly he appraised ilse with undisguised relish whos this little plum alfred frau apfel said horn annoyed may i introduce lord grenville hes english if you havent surmised that already how do you do milady the young man asked too courteously and offered his hand ilse ignored it keeping her eyes fixed on the whitehaired man at the head of the table horns eyes twinkled frau apfel is not favorably impressed he observed noticing ilses look of uneasiness he softened his tone linahthe bantu woman behind youremains only to bring us anything we require from the kitchen ask for whatever you like ilse swallowed do you mean im free to leave if i wish horn looked uncomfortable not exactly no but you do have the run of the house and groundswith certain restrictions i think youll find that out here on the veld there isnt much of anywhere to go not without an airplane in any case while ilse pondered the word veld horn began to eat his salad linah lifted the covers off large dishes of splitpea soup red cabbage and dark pumpernickel breadall classic german fare a huge roast ham sat at centertable but horn ignored it he talked between healthy bites f the cabbage acting more like a patriarch presiding over a gathering of distant relatives than a kidnapper toying with his hostage you know he said his mouth full ive tried to adapt myself to african cuisineif one ventures to call it suchbut it simply doesnt compare to german food robust enough of course but terribly bland pieter loves the stuff but then he was raised on it africa fighting the urge to bolt from the table ilse remembered her vow to behave as unprovocatively as possible so youre originally from germany then she stammered yes horn replied im something of an expatriate do you go back often horn stiffened for an instant then resumed eating no he said finally never my god she thought her face hot africa no wonder it feels so warm here as horn glanced around the table ilse realized that only one of the old mans eyes moved the other remained fixed in whatever direction horns head faced as she stared she noticed faint scarring around the eye stippled skin shaped in a rough fivepointed star with a chill she forced herself to look away but not before horn caught her staring he smiled understandingly an old battle wound he explained lord granville forked a huge slab of ham onto his plate and what does a beautiful woman like you do in the rhineland he asked grinning i believe the young lady works for a brokerage firm horn interjected suddenly the double doors behind horn bumped open a young black man entered with a wheeled cart and took away the used dishes a servant girl followed with another cart that bore an antique russian samovar filled with steaming tea she poured a brimming cup for horn smuts granville and ilse declined i suppose youre wondering exactly where you are horn said you are now in the republic of south africa and unless you neither watch television nor read the newspapers im sure you know where that is ilse clutched the tablecloth as her stomach rolled as a matter of fact she said hoarsely my company maintained close ties with a south african firm before we ceased speculation in the rand you know something about our country then smuts asked a little what one sees on the news paints a pretty bleak picture for some smuts said not half as bad as they make out though i think what pieter means horn said smoothly is that racial problems in any society are always more complex than they appear to an outsider look at the asian question the white russians must soon face in twenty years the soviet union will be over forty percent islam think of it look at america for all their bluster about equality the americans have seen abuses as bad as those anywhere in south africa frau apfel prejudice does not wear a mask and no one will forgive us for that because south africa admits something that the rest of the world would prefer to hide the world hates us do you think thats an excuse were not looking for excuses smuts muttered simply an observation horn said glaring at smuts isnt this bloody marvelous lord granville crowed two germans and a bloody afrikaner debating the finer points of race relations its really too much he poured himself a second brandy from a bottle he had claimed as his own you think englands any better smuts snapped all youve ever seen of it is public schools and polo fields you pieter horn cut in he turned to ilse herr smuts is what the americans call a selfmade man my dear he views the aristocracy as something of an obsolete class thats one view i sympathize with the afrikaner inclined his head respectfully his smoking gaze still on the englishman actually said horn even the south africans shrink from truly effective measures in the race question effective measures statesponsored sterilization my dear its the only answer we cant expect kaffirs or mohammedan savages to regulate their own breeding habits one might as well expect the same of cattle no the government health services should simply sterilize each black female after the birth of her first child an entire spectrum of problems would disappear within a single generation while ilse stared in astonishment horn signaled to the stonefaced linah who brought him a thick upmann cigar clipped and ready to light he did so without asking if anyone minded took several puffs then exhaled the smoke in deep blue clouds that wafted gently above the table well he said finally im sure you have many questions ill try to answer what i can ilse had not even touched her salad now she set her quivering hands flat on the table and took a deep breath why am i here she asked softly quite simply horn replied because of your husband im afraid your hans stumbled upon a document that belonged to a man i knew wella document he should have turned over to the proper authorities but did not pieter decided that the most expeditious method of recovering the property was through you that is why you are here as soon as your husband arrives the matter will be resolved ilse felt a flutter of hope hans is coming here horn glanced at his watch he should be on his way now does he know im safe smuts answered he heard the tape you made ilse shivered recalling the gun held to her head by the wildeyed lieutenant luhr horn blew a smoke ring i assure you that such unpleasantness will not be repeated the man who drugged you on the plane is now in a cell a hundred meters beneath your feet horn smiled now if i may id like to ask your opinion of the document your husband discovered in spandau prison ilse studied her hands what about it it looked like a hoax to me things like that have come up a dozen times since the war please horn interrupted his tone harder do not try my patience your discussion with prefect funk indicated that you well understood the importance of the papers i only thought that they might be dangerous i knew that because hans found them in spandau theyd probably been written by a war criminal because of that excuse me frau apfel horns gingle eye settled on ilses face how would you define that termwar criminal im curious ilse swallowed well i suppose it means someone who has departed from the laws of morality so radically that it shocks the civilized world even in time of war horn smiled sadly very articulate my dear but completely incorrect a war criminal is merely a powerful man on the side that was caesar a war criminal by your definition by mine no was alexander was stalin in arshal zhukovs red army raped murdered and looted its way across germany was zhukov a war criminal no but hitler of course the antichrist you see the label means nothing in absolute terms its simply a relative description thats not true what the nazis did in the concentration camps maintained the german war economy and furthered medical science for the entire world horn finished of course there were excessesthats human nature but does anyone ever mention the advances that were made you dont believe that nothing justifies such cruelty horn shook his head i can see that the zionists have kept a firm grip on our countrys schools since the war denazification he snorted my god you sound just like an israeli schoolchild can you be so blind in the allied air forces attacked dresdenan open cityand killed german civilians mostly women and children president truman obliterated two japanese cities that is not criminal then why is hiding the spandau diary so important to you ilse challenged why not let it be known and publicly argue your case whatever it is horn looked at the table because some chapters of history are best left closed the case of rudolf hess has had a startling longlived effect on relations between england germany and russia its in the best interest of all concerned to let sleeping dogs lie but thats what i dont understand what does it matter what happened fifty years ago nations have very long memories horn said what happened to rudolf hess ilse suddenly asked the real hess he died horn said in resistencia paraguay in i knew him well and he died a bitter man less than two years after his beloved fuhrer beloved ilse echoed horrified but the man in spandauwho was he no one horn said anyone the poor fool was part of a failed gambit in foreign policy thats all but the result of that failure was that he had to remain in prisons hess for the rest of his life that is all in the past unfortunately your husband reopened this sticky little case and now it must be closed again for me it is a small annoyance but one cannot ignore details for want of a nail for want of a nail ilse said thoughtfully the kingdom was lost what is the kingdom in this case horn smiled my company of course phoenix ag ilse looked thoughtful i dont recall seeing that name listed on any stock exchange im sure you dont its a private holding company if i were to furnish you with a list of my worldwide subsidiaries however im sure you would recognize quite a few smuts smiled at horns understatement ilse was genuinely curious so youre multinational then how big are you two three hundred million in revenues the young englishman snickered three hundred million in assets horn corrected softly ilse stared incredulous but that would put your revenues at over a billion dollars there was silence until horn gracefully resumed the conversation i see you have a keen interest in business why dont we excuse pieter and lord granville you and i can continue our discussion without boring them gentlemen but i find this discussion extremely interesting the englishman protested nevertheless horn said icily how about some billiards smuts the englishman asked gamely trying to preserve some illusion of free will horns stare commanded the reluctant afrikaner to accept the invitation dont suppose id mind taking a few rand off you smuts said chuckling he had a brittle laugh like a man who finds humor only at others expense he gave horn a shallow bow as they went out that man seems quite devoted to you ilse observed herr smuts is my chief of security his loyalty is absolute are you in danger horn smiled a man in my position makes enemies frau apfel suddenly ilses eyes glistened with moisture the plea she had pressed down deep in her heart welled up into her throat at last sir please isnt there some way that you could give my husband he meant no harm if you only ew him you would see frau apfel control yourself we will not discuss the matter again until your husband arrives at that time i shall decide what is to be donenot before is that clear ilse wiped her eyes with her linen napkin yes yes im sorry theres no need to be sorry women are at the mercy of their emotions its their biological flaw if it werent for that regrettable fact who knows what they might have aceomplished throughout history ilse remained silent she saw nothing to be gained by antagonizing her captor further frau apfel horn said the reason i excused the others was to invite you to attend a business meeting with me tomorrow evening rhe gentlemen im meeting have a rather medieval attitude toward your sex im afraid so you would have to pose as my secretary but im certain you would find the negotiations extremely interesting horn raised his chin it will be the first meeting of its kind in history it sounds bminus ilse said trying to regain her composure let us say momentous instead its only business after all im sure the experience would prove invaluable to a young woman who plans a career in the world of finance in spite of her perilous situationr perhaps because of itilse accepted the invitation linah horn called the tall bantu woman appeared instantly escort frau apfel to the billiards room ilse rose to go and frau apfel horn said would you ask pieter to join me when he has finished his game ilse nodded you wont see me until tomorrow afternoon possibly not until tomorrow evening pieter will show you around the estate in the morning certain rooms are locked but you have the run of the house and grounds otherwise please refrain from using the telephone until the matter of the papers has been resolved with the touch of a button horn wheeled his chair around the table may i see your hand puzzled ilse slowly extended her hand before she knew what was happening the wizened old man had bent his head and lightly kissed it she felt a sudden chill but whether from physical revulsion or some deeper fear she could not tell i apologize for the young englishmans rudeness horn said i shouldnt tolerate it but his grandfather and i worked together during the war horn smiled wistfully his grandfather was a very special man and i feel some responsibility for his their gute nacht my dear the tall bantu housekeeper took ilses elbow and led her into the hall where she let ilse take the lead ilse had the feeling that the womans arm was but a fraction of an inch behind her own ready to seize her if necessary the long hall opened into a large gallery which in turn gave onto two more beyond each great room joined by means of a wide arch ilse gasped as far as she could see the walls were lined with paintings she knew a little about art but the works she saw in the first room required no training to appreciate the strokes of the great masters speak to a part of the psyche deeper than thought and these were no reproductions each canvas glowed with immanent passion ilses eyes danced from painting to painting in wonder my god she murmured where are we linah caught hold of ilses arm and tugged her along like an awestruck child even the marble floors bore their share of the treasure classical sculptures some over twelve feet high rose like marble ghosts from pedestals in the center of each room ilse noticed that no work in any of the rooms seemed modern nothing had the asymmetrical distortions of picasso the geometric puzzles of mondrian or the radically commonplace ugliness of the sculpture so common in berlin office parks everything was soft romantic inwardpulling had she not been so stunned she might have noticed that all the oh ets dartpgyptian and greek sculpture paintings from holland belgium and francehad come from countries plundered behind the merciless boot of the wehrmacht during the thirties and forties but she didnt notice she simply stared until the dazzling exhibition ended and she found herself in the dark woodpaneled billiards room where pieter smuts and the young englishman had finished their second game well take your bloody winnings lord gren snapped dont mind if i do smuts retorted grinning he pocketed the crisp fiftypound note that the englishman handed over as casually as a wrinkled fiver herr smuts ilse said herr horn wishes you to join him the afrikaners smile faded as he hurried into the hallway up for a game friiulein the englishman asked tilting his cue toward ilse its frau ilse corrected coldly and id prefer to return to my room as linah turned to lead her out ilse got the impression that thebantu woman approved of her decision not to remain but as she followed the housekeeper out she felt a light touch on her arm why not stay a moment whispered the englishman it might do wonders for your husbands health ilse froze without even thinking she told linah that shed changed her mind she would play one game before she retired the tall bantu eyed the englishman warily through the door i watch for madam in the hall she said you come soon soon ilse promised closing the door what do you know about my husband she asked pointedly not so fast fraulein the englishman racked the balls for another game why dont you try being friendly since were the only two civilized people in this godforsaken place what do you mean what do you think i mean couldnt ygu tell at dinner theyre mad as hatters both of them im almost mad myself from listening to them im also the only chance you have of getting yourself and your husband out of here alive break ilse took a cue from the wall walked to the table and opened the game by sinking the one and the five she didnt know what to make of the arrogant englishman she suspected this was a trick to extract information from her yet a voice deep inside her said to try to use this manto try anything that might help her escape how did you come to be here she asked i assume you werent kidnapped like me the englishman chuckled not exactly but i wouldnt be averse to leaving i can tell you that for some years now herr horn and i have been involved in a very profitable business arrangement until recently its been mostly from a distance alfred knew my grandfatherwilliam stanton lord granvillebefore the war im afraid my character runs a bit differently than my grandfathers though my primary interest is making money along with certain other distractions herr horn is not interested in money not for its own sake no hes very political fancies himself a bloody messiah if you want to know he and my grandfather did something big in england during the war though neither of them ever told me what alfred has some kind of political agenda that dictates every move he makes all very hushhush and very silly if you ask me does he ask you the englishman tried an extravagant bank shot and muffed it no he said he doesnt lord granville ilse mused is that a real title yes actually i really am a lord my name is robert stanton lord granville call me robert if you like what about the other man the afrikaner smuts hes a commoner a real bastard stanton chuckled a real common bastard thats him hes horns chief of security i dont like him but i stay clear of him you know hed like to cut my throat some dark night why doesnt he alfred protects me or he has up till now at any rate but my protectors patience wears thin ilse pocketed the three nine and fifteen before missing the seven in the side pocket very nice frdulein stanton eyed ilses hips yes im getting the feeling that dear alfreds use for me is rapidly coming to an end and i dont fancy waiting for the axe to fall exactly what business are you and herr horn mt stanton sank the twelve with a crack importexport ix what drugs and money of course lots of pretty pounds pharmaceutical drugst stanton laughed the odd lot now and then but we generally handle drugs in their more elementary state morphine base poppies ether coca paste narcotics are the basis of herr horns empire no no hes ninety percent legitimate now but our little joint venture provides him with quite a bit of untraceable cash thats a valuable commodity in the business world as you probably know rarer and rarer these days i see dont think legitimate carries any great moral weight though alfred brokers chemicals to iraq for weapons conventional arms to the third world nuclear and computer technology to half a dozen maniac governmentsit makes the narcotics business look like a bloody jumble sale so what exactly do you want from me ilse asked warily stanton stepped close to her i want to know what the old mans planning he whispered something big is in the works and i think hes going to let you io on it the old birds got the idea youre some kind of avatar of teutonic womanhood hes mad about you no ilse said quickly fighting a strong feeling that stantons words were true youre wrong spare me fraulein i can see it ilse moved to leave but stanton barred the door if you find out anything he said you come see me i can help you ilse tried to pass but stanton remained in front of her if you dont he warned neither you nor your husband will get out of this house alive i guarantee it ilse stopped trying to pass and looked into stantons eyes what do you mean nothing at all love but you think about it do you really believe that oneeyed madman brought you all the way here just to send you smiling back to germany five thousand bloody miles ilse shook her head in denial come on frdulein youre no fool stanton caught ilses shoulders and drew her tight against him ill tell you something else for free he said heavily alfreds got the right idea but hes much too old for you he pressed his mouth hard against hers ilse twisted her head away roughly let go of me let me go stanton groped for her breasts truly frightened now ilse caught his arms and tried to push him away just as he got one hand free and raised it to strike someone flung open the door tall and menacing the bantu housekeeper fixed her impenous gaze on the englishman time for bed madam she said in a dangerous voice yesyes thank you linah ilse stammered bloody wog said stanton you ought to keep out of where youre not wanted im going to talk to master about you her face unchanging linah pulled the door shut and led ilse to her bedroom thank you ilse said again linah looked deep into her eyes careful with the english madam she said in her deep voice he is spoilt and does not understand no ilse listened hopefully as linah shut the door but the lock clicked fast back in the dining room alfr horn addressed smuts liked a general briefing his adjutant before a battle the airstrip extension one hundred feet to go sir they finished the southeast end at dusk it should set up fine by tomorrow night is the basement secure tight as a zulu drum what about the conference room video cameras we must have a record of this meeting our fallback plan depends on it all four cameras loaded and in position sir any questions for me pieter what about the policeman in the basement lieutenant luhr horns face hardened hes fine where he is until after the meeting and the girl im quite taken with her pieter ive asked her to sit in tomorrow night as my secretary what no arguments horn said ive decided but the arabs wont stand for a woman there horn smiled what can they say i am the only man who possesses the commodity they want they certainly cant afford to make trouble about a secretary smuts shook his head what about stanton hes getting insufferable i agree said horn but you should have known his grandfather pieter a visionary its a good thing hes not around to see his their smuts grunted in agreement let robert take this last delivery pieter two million rand in gold bullion is worth waiting for i think then hes yours smuts grinned a deathshead less than twentyfour hours now horn intoned the wheels are in motion he looked up take me to the study pieter i want to sit by the fire should i get the chair no i feel strongtonight i walk like a man a man among men sir smuts said reverently thank you pieter the last of a breed its true together the two menone ancient the other in his midfortiesset out upon the long journey to the study where the old one would await the dawn with bright unsleeping eyes chapter twentyfive g am horn house the northern transvaal ilse had no warning of the horror to come she had awakened several times during the night but the periods of sleep had been mercifully dreamless when her door opened she expected to find the tall bantu housekeeper waiting behind it instead she saw pieter smuts horns afrikaner security chief smutss smile did not quite reach his eyes im here to give you the threepenny tour he announced thats not really necessary ilse said uneasily im sure i can find my way around smuts sighed with enough resignation to indicate he would remain in the doorway as long as he had to after closing the door and dressing ilse allowed herself to be led out of the room and down the long corridor the lanky afrikaner towered above her again she felt like a child being led through a museum smuts delivered his information in a monotone horn house he said stands in one of the most isolated regions of south africathe northeast corner of the northern transvaal boer country the nearest town is giyani to the west and the nearest landmark to the east is the kruger national park not many roads up here to speak of point taken ilse thought bitterly the estate itself is one of a kind as youll see when you get outside the residential compound encompasses twelve thousand square feet of living space weve got an indoor swimming pool a gymnasium an art gallery an astronomical observatory and something quite unusual for a private dwellinga hospital because of herr horns advanced age he suffers from a number of chronic conditions but here he is able to obtain optimum health care at all times the medical complex is at the end of this hall we have a resident cardiologist on duty at all times my god ilse said genuinely shocked the cost of maintaining this unit out on the veld like this would bankrupt a small town smuts boasted but for herr horn ah here we are they had come to a door with no knob brass letters on its face read krankenhaus smuts pushed open the door after you he said the astringent smell of alcohol and disinfectant wrinkled ilses nose she found herself in a large examining room replete with all the paraphernalia of modern medicine blood chemis machines centrifuges autoclaves and various instruments lined the shining countertops two doors were set in the opposite wall smuts led her to the one marked icu behind it was a fully equipped intensive care facility cardiac monitor screens a defibrillator cart a ventilator and two cylinders of oxygen waited beside an electric hospital bed ilse wondered if horn was in poorer health than he appeared very impressive she said not knowing what else to say smuts nodded curtly and led her out closing the door softly behind them the other door was marked only with a warning symbolthree inverted yellow triangles inside a circle of black smuts opened the door and stepped inside motioning for ilse to follow irhis is our xray unit he said its state of the art but im afraid our cardiologist has to do double duty as a radiographer hes not too happy about that as you might the moment ilse stepped across the threshold someone seized her violently from behind pinning her arms to her sides before she could scream smuts stuffed a handkerchief into her mouth the unseen attacker lifted her off her feet then heaved her high and dropped her heavily onto a hard surface an ugly sweating black face appeared above her powerful hands crushed her flailing arms against the cold formica while smuts worked at something she could not see primal terror gripped her even without seeing the thick leather belts that now bound her to the table lase registered and identified the sensation restraining straps she thought wildly white light speared into her brain from above be still smuts shouted be still ilse drew in all the breath she could and tried to scream but the bunched handkerchief in her mouth choked her effort to an anguished groan her throat felt near to bursting the man panting above her was so black he looked blue he buckled a thick strap across ilses chest then forced her right cheek flat against the table and fastened another strap across her head all she could see now was a huge lead shield pieter smutss hard angular face floated inside a thick bubble window set in its middle ilse struggled to rise but the heavybuckled straps held her motionless when she tried to shift even slightly the straps scoured her flesh like sandpaper as she lay there chest heaving smuts stepped around the lead shield from his right hand a long cable dropped to the floor and snaked around the shield to the xray machine with his left hand smuts reached up and took hold of a hammerheadshaped mechanism suspended above ilses head the xray tube painted a metallic orange it hovered above ilse like an alien being a deadly thing that moved silently on tracks and cables smuts raised the housing to its highest position then he returned to safety behind the lead shield two seconds later every muscle in ilses body constricted in terror a deep electrical surge a subsonic roar shuddered through the table lasting three full seconds before h cease with a sharp clang ilses mouth went dry her from head beaded with sweat just as she realized what the sound signaled it came again the heartstopping buzz of electricity converted into a barrage of irradiated particles and fired through her body like invisible bullets lfer teeth ground furiously as she fought the leather straps the hide scraped her flesh raw again the awful sound came ilse heard herself screaming the voice tiny and shrill and meaningless inside her head what have i done what do you want without a single word from smuts she had made the mental leap from resistance to abject servitude she sought only to know what i was required of her and she would comply yet still the machine fired deeper than sound she sensed a vibration barely within the realm of human perception the vibration of accelerated electrons focused into a beam that even when guided by healing hands poured deadly poison into living cells the sound came again and again until finally in a silence made deeper by ilses utter despair smuts stepped around the shield the cable trigger in his hand and began to speak frau apfel he said i dont believe in messing aboutnot where my job is concerned you have certain information i need andyou are going to provide it ilse tried to nod beneath the head strap during the past several minutes i have exposed you to the maximum allowable threeyear dosage of radiation for a nuclear plant worker in an hour or so you will probably experience some nausea and vomiting but let us hope that is all you must endure far worse outcomes are still possible blindness burns other things smuts held a finger in ilses face what happens next frau apfel is up to you le ilse stared with wild eyes the afrikaner crouched and laid the cable trigger on the floor then he stood loosened a bolt on the housing above ilse an d lowered the hammerhead banel to a position six inches above her abdomen he tightened the bolt again locking it in place frau apfel i ain going to remove the gag now and you will cooperate fully i have focused the xray beam on the approximate area of yottr ovaries radiation has an enhanced effect on such cellsells that are still dividing as it were exposure in this region could seriously jeopardize your chances of ever having children smuts grinned are you ready to talk ilses eyes widened in horror her baby she began to shiver uncontrollably her urinary sphincter let go flooding both her dress and the table smuts drew back from the pungent smell as he reached for the handkerchief gag tears welled up in ilses eyes and streamed down onto the table r listen said the afrikaner his voice slightly softer as of this moment you are still all right only if you refuse to answer will you be injured the dosage you have received so far would only be excessive for a woman alredy pregnant ilses body convulsed against the straps she fought like gn animal expending every ounce of her remaining strength smutswho had used this interrogation technique on many previous occasionscould not recall anyone resisting so fiercely once the prospect of escape had been offered one never knew who the tough ones would be he reflected when ilse finally went limp he loosened the strap at her head and carefully removed the gag now he said i need to know some things about your husband can you hear me ilses eyes opened slowly she focused on smutss face good your husband did not take the plane he was instructed to take to johannesburg nor has he checked into the hotel he was ordered to stay in by the terms of the agreement he has already forfeited your life why would he do that doesnt he want to save you ilse closed her eyes more tears dribbled out when she opened her eyes again smuts was shaking the cable trigger in her face does your husband have any jewish blood in his family ilse shook her head her eyes blank in despair smuts stepped momentarily out of her field of vision then reappeared with a damp rag he squeezed a few drops of water into her mouth now he said no jewish blood no ilse coughed what about friends does he have any jewish friends has hans ever been to israel ilse shook her head youre sure what about england or anywhere else in britain what is your husbands connection with captain dieter hauer ilse hesitated frfriend she rasped it was difficult to concentrate hard enough to lie but she sensed that to reveal hanss blood relationship to hauer might somehow be dangerous are you aware that captain hauer works with the german counterterror unit gsg ilse silently mouthed the word no undoubtedly your husband is smuts clucked his tongue thoughtfully i want you to tell me about the spandau papers did your husband show them to anyone before you gave them to your grandfather ilse shook her head again do you understand these questions she nodded think carefully frau apfel think about the names you saw in the spandau papers did you see the name al horn you didnt recognize the name when herr horn introduced himself last night you were staring at his eyehis artificial eye why were you so interested in that did you come here expecting to find a man with one eye i couldnt help staring what names were in the spandau papers ilses voice cracked as she spoke hess of course hitler hermann goring reinhard heydrich i think smuts nodded did you see the name zinoviev he asked softly its a russian name ilse thought a momen shook her head helmut did you see that name smuts shook the trigger in her face did you no frau apfel he said coldly if youre thinking of informing herr horn of what happened here this morning i tell you now to abandon the idea whatever his reaction might be i assure you that itis within my power to have you back on this table before anything could be done to me do you understand oh god ilse wailed her voice choking into a sob you bastard youve hurt my baby youve killed my baby smutss eyes widened you are pregnant now you know that i said so on the tape ilse squeezed her swollen eyes shut in anguish she did not feel smuts unbuckling the leather straps only when she felt herself lifted from the table did she look again the afrikaner carried her over to the lead shield then behind it to where the tall rectangular xray machine stood with its glowing dials and meters look he said angrily look here iis tanned hand pointed to a scalloped black knob this displays mamilliamperes its the measure of radiation he moved his bind to another dial ws is kvelovolts its the measure of power driving the tube look woman ilse looked both dials were set at zero she coughed and rubbed her eyes fighting down waves of nausea do you understand smuts asked i never heard the tape you made but it doesnt matter you have received no radiation you are all right your child is unhurt ilse looked into the afrikaners eyes for deception but saw none why she stammered i protect herr horn frau apfel at any cost i had to know that you would tell the truth and you did didnt you ilse nodded wiping her face on her blouse good now get back to your room and clean yourself up herr horn is not to see you like this his eyes fixed ilse with frightening intensity but you remember what that table felt like when herr horn asks you to do something you do it no matter how crazy it might sound especially at tonights meeting remember your child frau apfel i can have you back on that table any time i decide any time unable to restrain herself any longer ilse clenched her stomach with both hands double over and vomited on the afrikaners boots shaking with rage smuts stormed out and went in search of his zulu driver leaving ilse coughing on the floor he could not believe he had to put up with such outrages perhaps after tonights business had been concluded horn would see that the best policy was to kill the girl and be done with it the husband could be killed as soon as he turned over the spandau papers and the berlin police could take care of the girls grandfather at their leisure things were so simple if people would only focus on the facts as smuts passed through the spectacular gallery rooms he tried in vain to ignore the stench rising from his boots am tempelhof airpoil american sector west berlin crg detective julius schneider climbed out of the iroquois helicopter gunship and shook his head in wonder colonel rose bundled to the eyeballs in a goosedown parka stood on the tarmac beside a drab army ford sergeant clary waited faithfully at the wheel roses face was clean shaven but his eyes were red and swollen he waved schneider into the ford pressing his hat to his head to keep the icy wind from blowing it off the big german ran to the car and climbed in rose skipped the formalities the shit has hit the fan schneider remember my fbi guy the one who was going to get that zinoviev file for us schneider nodded well he got it he fedexed a copy to me at ninethirty this morning rose shook his head ten minutes later he was arrested on charge of espionage his computer query on zinoviev apparently rang some kind of warning bell at langley and that set the dogs on him i guess the fbi computers arent as secure as the bureau likes to think they are what was in this zinoviev file schneider asked we wont know till tomorrow when i get the file if i get the file if the fbi knows he shipped it they can probably stop it before it gets here if it does get here ive got ivan kosov waiting to doublecheck what he can in the kgb files schneider scowled why do you need kosov when my buddy called he told me a little about the zinoviev file schneider he said the file claims that the united states britain and the russians have all known for years that prisoner number seven was not rudolf hess schneiders eyes narrowed i asked him why ifthat was true the russians had kept quiet about it all these years you know what he told me he said it didnt matter what the russians knew about hess because in winston churchill blackmailed stalin into silence schneider looked bewildered what do you mean blackmailed him with what rose shrugged my guy said it had to do with zinovievs part in hesss mission but that it was too complicated to explain on the phone he said i wouldnt believe it when i saw it but that the russians were the good guys in this mess i told him i would believe it and that i thought the brits were still neckdeep in some kind of stinking coverup roses eyes flickered he told me i might be right schneider but i guess well have to wait for our copy of the zinoviev file to find out where is your new partner now schneider asked rose hooked his thumb toward tempelhofs observation deck eighty meters away above the rail schneider saw a solitary figure wearing a hat and a raincoat the only person braving the cold of the deck there he is rose said a week ago id have considered it sacrilege to bring that bastard to the home of the berlin airlift today i trust him more than some of my own people schneider looked skeptical why are you here now to give you a little tactical update my friend one hour ago prefect funk arrested one of your brother officers on espionage charges seems this guy was passing secret information to the british government scheisse rose nodded in disgust you should regard everything we knew as of this morningincluding the names on hauer and apfels false assportsas blown to the brits if you get anywhere near those cops schneider you keep your eyes peeled for british spools rose looked out the window at an f fighter parked in a concrete revetment twenty meters away one more thing he said kosov told me to tell you to watch your back he wouldnt tell me why i think hes in the same spot i am schneider he doesnt know who to trust he wants to help me but hes being muzzled from above i think hes waiting for some kind of clearance to come clean with me schneider grunted it wasnt easy for a german to see any russian in a positive light dont trust him too much colonel he said kosov would sacrifice you without a thought you worry about your own ass rose advised kosovs got enough to do without yanking my chain moscow went nuts when they found out about axel goltzs mutiny the kgb is interrogating every stasi agent in berlin trying to figure out whats going on if they crack this phoenix thing theyll be lining those tattooed bastards up against the wall by the dozen and passing out blindfolds and cigarettes rose punched a stiff forefinger into schneiders barrel chest if you find hauer and apfel you bring em back here with the papers hauers probably the only guy who can straighten this mess out now and those spandau papers are the only thing that could buy my ass out of the sling oh yeah one more thing if you happen to find the guy who killed harry richardsonrose smacked the car window with the meaty end of his fistyou have my permission to gut and skin the son of a bitch briefing concluded detective schneider smiled coldly auf wiedersehen herr oberst he climbed out of the ford and clambered into the waiting gunship he was still miles from frankfurt airport and thirteen airhours away from south africa plenty of time left to figure out how he was going to find hauer and plenty of time to figure out what he was going to say when he did the questions he could not get out of his mind were the ones rose had barely touched on what was phoenix reany was it a secret subsect of der bruderschaft if so if it was a neofascist group that had penetrated both the police and political hierarchies schneider feared not only for his police department but for germany itself the primary goal of all neonazis was german reunification it was easy there enough to see that a premature grab for that goal could suit in catastrophe for the country russia might be flirting with glasnost and perestroika but faced with the specter of two fascistled germanys pressing for reunification the nation that had lost twenty million citizens to hitlers armies might respond with unimaginable force and fury kosovs warning to coionel rose about watching his back brought schneider back to more immediate concernswho besides kosov even knew that he was involved in the phoenix case schneider remembered harry richardsons mutilated corpse baking in the overheated apartment did kosov know the animal who had killed him schneider thought of the mysterious b written in richardsons bloodhad kosov been able to read its significance if so why couldnt he give rose a name to go with his warning could harry richardson have been killed by a russian only an hour after kosov released him at the wall schneider knew colonel rose saw the british as the villains in this case but he suspected it was somehow more complicated than that as a homicide detective he had found that percent of all the simplest mysteries could be solved by reasoning out explanation for any event but this mysteryhe had felt from the beginningfell into the percent category ain international airport am frankfort twelfth department agent yuri borodin sat eating a wienerschnitzel in the large restaurant overlooking the main runway of flughafen frankfurt every two minutes a huge jet would swoop down from left to right across the giant picture window and settle silently onto the tarmac borodin had seen everything from japan airlines s to aeroflot airliners to us air force cs to the right of borodins wienerschnitzel lay a red file a half inch thick it contained a concise summation of the kgb file on rudolf hess a multivolume collection of data amassed over fifty years a courier from moscow had delivered the file to borodin at the frankfurt airport sheraton thirty minutes ago borodin had scanned its contents with only desultory interest the file described a convoluted plot to kill the british heads of state during world war two a plot involving highranking british nazi sympathizers the british royal family and a british communist cadre manipulated by a tsarist russian named zinoviev and a young german agent named helmut steuer it told of the kgbs certainty that spandaus prisoner number seven was not rudolf hess but his wartime double and of that doubles murder just five weeks ago kgb chairman zemenek stated his belief that the killing had been done by an assassin paid by sir neville shaw of britains mi borodin admired the nerve and resourcefulness shown by vasili zinoviev and helmut steuer but the rest of the story essentially bored him except for the part about the blackmail when borodin saw how churchill had forced joseph stalin to keep silent about the hess affair he had come instantly alert because he saw then how important the recently discovered spandau papers could be to kgb chairman zemenek the spandau papers could conceivably clear the way for the kremlin to tell the world what it knew about british collaboration with the nazis during the war and thus force them to share responsibility for the holocaust borodin also saw that if he were the man who recovered those papers his already advanced career would take a critical leap forward he had only one problem at the end of the hess file he had found a message inserted by the chairman of the kgb it said borodin general secretary gorbachev currently exploring possibility of collaborating with us state department regarding joint disclosure of the truth about hesss mission do nothing to antagonize any us operatives you may encounter in pursuit of the spandau papers british operatives fair game zemenek yuri borodin wiped his mouth with his napkin shoved his empty plate aside and pulled the file to him he reread chairman zemeneks note at this point he reflected another agent in his position might have trouble digesting the meal since less than eighteen hours ago he had tortured and executed an american army intelligence major but borodin wasnt worried the hess file had told him one thing if he returned to moscow with the spandau papers no one would ask whom he had killed to get them he glanced at his watch the next flight to south africa took off in just under four hours borodin chuckled the big germankripo detective had not arrived from berlin yet but he would with predictable german punctuality and then he would lead yuri borodin to the spandau papers like an elephant leading a lion to water chapter twentysix n rsgo ll am el al flight zoirea al co the deadliest woman in the world stepped out of the forward lavatory of the looking like a grandmother on holiday a role she assumed with ease swallows stylish outfit reflected modest wealth her hair shone with the almostblue tint unique to elderly ladies still courting their vanity and she smelled of body powder and a very expensive vintage perfumean alluring concoction called claire de lune she carefully made her way up the firstclass aisle then just as she passed jonas stern she stumbled she cried out in yiddisha nice touchand landed directly beside sterns seat gadi abrams whod been sitting in the seat across the aisle leaped up and helped her to her feet thank you young man she said weakly her face flushed with embarrassment im afraid im not used to airplanes stern glanced up had he met the womans eyes he might have seen the danger he might even have recognized her by the dark fire that burned there but he might not have the road that had led swallow to this airplane was a long and tortuous one in any case he did not meet her eyes he glanced over at professor natterman who slept noisily beside him then went back to reading his el al magazine this flight seems as though it will never end swahow complained ltls a long one gadi agreed how much longer do you think about five hours swallow sighed its worth it in spite of everything my granddaughter just turned eighteen months old and ive yi to see her she lives in johannesburgt gadi inquired politely no pietersburg its far to the north i think gadi nodded are you all right now yes but id better sit down thank you again swallow slowly made her way to her seat one of three near the spiral staircase leading up to the s cocktail lounge after situating a small pillow behind her head she pulled a romance novel from her handbag glancing up for a moment she caught gadi staring the israelis were professionalsshe had to admit that though jonas stern sat only four rows behind her his three young escorts had surrounded him in a protective triangle and with stern in an aisle seat no one meaning harm to his slumbering companion could get to him without going through all four israelis firstan impossible task stern himself however was a different matter swallow could have taken him as she passed only moments ago in a way she had while gadi helped her up she had pressed an adhesivebarked microtransmitter against the underside of sterns seat everything the israelis said during the remainder of the flight would be pickd up by a tiny receiver in the fleshtoned hearing aid she wore in her right ear the unit whistled for a few seconds as she dialed in the frequency but she could clearly hear professor natterman snoring in his seat by the window this is captain lev ronen announced a disembodied voice with the accent of a sabra or nativeborn israeli as a point of interest we are now crossing the equator and about four hundred miles to our left is lake victoria africas largest lake and the source of the nile im sure our firsttime travelers will be glad to know that as we cross into the southern hemisphere the seasons are reversed that means were flying into summer we should arrive in johannesburg on schedule at pm south african time and we hope everyone is having a pleasant flight gadi abrams leaned across the aisle toward stern also about four hundred miles to our left he said mocking the if lo rth captains o icious tone is entebbe site of the july u rescue ofover a hundred israelis from the hands of international terrorists his tone changed to indignation youd think theyd mention it at least we are on el al for gods sake stern gave a dismissive wave of his hand old news gadi besides you never know whos flying el al we dont want to offend the paying customers four rows ahead swallow smiled with satisfaction the conversation had come in loud and clear over her receiver im surprised at the number of passengers gadi remarked since you arranged the flight privately i didnt expect any stern chuckled softly i arranged this flight thirty hours ago general avigur said he would get me to south africa he didnt say he ouldnt tly to defray the cost any way he could i dont like it two passengers are always air marshals stern reminded him leave the security to them for once and go to sleep it might be your only chance for a while youre not sleeping stern reclined his plush seat and closed his eyes good night gadi pulled a wry face and glanced around the first class cabin the bluehaired grandmother was the only other passenger up here that meant the air marshals had to be in tourist he considered walking the length of the plane once more to try to pick them out but decided against it stern was right he needed rest the old woman was certainly no threat reclining his seat gadi closed his eyes and like professional soldiers everywhere dropped off to sleep only moments after making the decision to do so his last mental picture was of himself helping the old grandmother to her feet his good deed for the day as the grandmother pretended to concentrate on the novel in her lap a new voice mumbled in her receiver professor natterman had awakened what time is it he asked groggily almost lunchtime stern answered halfasleep already how do you feel i feel like getting some answers is how i feel natterman grumbled i think its time you told me your half of the story stern opened his eyes and turned irritably toward the professor but the large white bandage over nattermans lacerated nose kept him civil he jerked his head toward gad reminding the professor of their agreement not to discuss anything about rudolf hess what do you want to know professor everything what about this phoenix ag why did you come to berlin in the first place i want to know why ilse was taken to south africa whats the significance of that stern looked over at gadi ive thought a lot about that he murmured and im sorry to disappoint you but your nazi angle doesnt fit here at least not in the way you think the afrikaners are white supremacists of course but thats no secret they fought against hitler during the war and damned valiantly and in spite of their prejudice against blacks theyve got a pretty good record on jews they allowed a great deal of jewish immigration during the war which is more than a lot of countries did what about the present day what are their ties with germany stern shook his head limited during the past several years south africa has quiedy developed extremely close relations with another country in a very similar geopolitical situation that country is not west germany however but israel it doesnt sound like were flying ifito a nest of neonazis does it no natterman agreed but you obviously have some suspicions about south africa and germany where is the fox in the henhouse south africas nuclear program the darkest corner of this dark country does south africa actually possess nuclear weapons ive heard it speculated in the news but never confirmed stern smiled wryly oh i can confirm it for you in an american vela satellite detected a distinctive double flash off the south african coast in the south atlantic that flash was the result of a joint nuclear test carried out by south africa and israel how do you know that because for all practical purposes professor israel gave south africa the bomb nuclear weapons are one of the main pillars of the israelisouth africa relationship what it was an inevitable partnership israel developed its first bomb in but we had several limitations we couldnt test our weapons without being detected south africa had vast deserts and two oceans we needed raw uranium and other strategic minerals south africa had extensive reserves south africa also had a great deal of ready cash but the main tie was psychological emotional as the world closed ranks against apartheid south africa grew ever more isolated before long it was an international pariah surrounded by hostile enemies the siege mentality was a natural reaction and we in israel are the masters of that particular neurosis but how do you know all this stern the israeli looked at natterman for a long time you asked me before if i worked for the mossad professor right now i am exactly what i told you in the beginning a retiree but i have done a bit of work for several government agencies shin beth and the mossad yes but my longest service was with an agency called lakam have you heard of it natterman shook his head lakam is israels nuclear security force not in the sense of operating the weapons but in protecting them lakam safeguarded israels nuclear program from inception to completion thats why i know so much about the south african program and is this lakam work what led you to berlin to spandau not exactly what led me to spandau was a chain of facts a very fragile chain with four links that spans three decades the first link wag a warning notean anonymous cryptic note written in cyrillic handwriting and delivered to israel in it warned of terrible danger to israel and spoke of the fire of annageddon this note claimed that the secret of this danger could be found in spandau that of course was a very broad hint did the writer mean spandau the city spandau the prison what two days later the sixday war broke out and the note was dismissed as a warning of the egyptian attack probably written by a russian with a conscience stern rubbed his temples now ump ahead to the early s i was working for lakam by then and we in the agency became aware that certain german scientistsformer third reich physicistswere working in the rocketry section of south africas nuclear program this by itself was not unusual after all it was german scientists who built the bombs for america and russia but when you c sider that the prime minister of south africa in the year of the secret israelisouth african nuclear testwas john vorster a man who had supported the nazis during world war two it takes on a rather different significance now lets jump ahead again to the s it was then through contacts in the mossad that i became aware of a neofascist police organization called bruderschaft der phoenix headquartered in west berlin phoenix natterman exclaimed hurry stern tell me again this by itself was not of great import it took the fourth and final link to join the others in my mind just three weeks ago the israeli foreign ministry received a typed warning from an anonymous source the writer obviously knew of the secret israelisouth african nuclear partnership and stated that he had personal knowledge that there were some in the south african defense establishment who had anything but israels best interests at heart the writer claimed he believed that israel might actually be in danger of a nuclear attack and that the best line of inquiry for us to pursue was with a south african defense contractor called phoenix ag natterman caught his breath after several moments he said forgive me stern but theres something i dont understand here you told me you were retired this situation seems serious enough that israel would be making a significant effort to investigate it sterns smile carried the bitterness of a lifetimes disillusionment you would think that wouldnt you but some people dont see it that way professor south africa is israels nuclear partner remember no one in jerusalem wants to upset that status quo the israelisouth african special relationship is so close that as we speak a secret contingency plan exists to remove south africas entire stockpile of nuclear weapons to israel in the event that the blacks appear likely to overthrow the government nattermans eyes grew wide my god this is all so unbelievable why would israel sup orta repressive even genocidal state like south afiica the israeli people probably wouldnt professor but decisions guiding israels nuclear program were never voted on in the knesset israels nuclear policy is formed by a very few men who happen to hold the key positions in the government stern sighed and some men will do anything in the name of survival for some jews the holocaust justifies any act to prevent a repetition of history even a preemptive holocaust perpetrated by jews stern reached beneath his seat withdrew an orange from his leather bag and slowly began to peel it professor how much do you know about israels resistance to the british during the mandate and world war two natterman shrugged i know about the haganah what about the zionist terrorist groups the stern gang and the irgun yes some which did you fight with that is unimportant now what matters is that prior to world war two both groups violently resisted the british occupation of palestine but when the war broke out the two groups split the irgun supported the british rightly believing that israel could never be born in a world under hitler but the stern gang believed that driving out the british was more important than defeating the nazis nattermans eyes widened in disbelief the stern gang actually sent delegations to meet with representatives of hitlers reich and mussolinis italy they actually promised to fight for the influence of germany and italy in the middle east if hitler and mussolini would agree to allow jews to leave their countries and also guarantee the safety of israel after the war madness natterman breathed what fools could have believed that a guarantee from adolf hitler was worth anything stern shook his head in disgust one of those fools was yitzhak shamir the prime minister of israel natterman sat in stunned silence shamir was a zionist terrorist wasnt he the stern gang my god and that said stern brings us the the present to the new lakam i left the agency seven years ago at that time it was a model intelligence organization but under shamir lakam has grown completely out of control up until two years ago they actually ran a spy against the united states jonathan pollard gave lakam information on us weapons systems satellite capabilities even nuclear targeting datathe most sensitive intelligence in america and do you know what shamir did with this tanned face paled with fury sent it to moscow that bastard risked the lifegiving support of america to prove that israel could not be told what to do by anyone even the united states does lakam know about the phoenix ag warning stern answered with bitter sarcasm the current chief of lakam feels that the phoenix warning was fabricated by someone who wants to start us on a destructive mole hunt lakam is pursuing the warning but very slowly like a man walking on ice there are constructive discussions going on between jerusalem and pretoria the only reason i found out about the phoenix warning at all was that an old friend at lakam felt that the warning was not being taken seriously enough stern smiled mischievously that is the main reason i went first to west berlin rather than south africato stay out of lakams way but there were other reasons the name of the companyphoenix agreminded me of bruderschaft der phoenix in berlin and when an old friend happened to mention that spandau prison was being torn down only two weeks after the warning arrived the timing seemed impossibly coincidental all i could think of was the fire of armageddon note that had mentioned spandau spandau as a city had always been too large to investigate of course and while hessexcuse me hesss doublewas being held in spandau prison it was one of the most closely guarded buildings in the world but when i heard it was to be knocked into pieces well it was enough to get me on a plane to berlin but how are all these things connected natterman asked where is the direct link between south africa and germany stern pursed his lips i dont think there is one professor i think the link runs through englandthe british governed south africa until remember theyre a minority now but a powerful one take phoenix agits a defense contractor based in south africa but the majority stockholder is a young englishman named robert stanton lord granville his father and grandfather owned the company before him granville professor natterman shook his forefinger excitedly thats why you brought me with you you think this nuclear danger to israel could somehow be connected to the hess case to the english conspirators keep your voice down stern glanced across the aisle to make sure gadi was still asleep lakam traced the paper used for the phoenix ag warning to an english mill lord grenvilles family has owned and operated the corporation since but it still doesnt add up britain has always been antisemitic but what motive could englishmen have to support fascist groups now captain hauer mentioned german reunification to you could these englishmen stand to make great profits if germany reunifies or could they have been blackmailed all these years by germans who knew their dark secret germans who had secret ends of their own natterman was shaking his head i keep coming back to the past stern consider our highly placed clique of nazi sympathizers in the wartime parliament i would imagine they had quite a bit of old boy control over british policy visavis palestine wouldnt you think about it in britain promised the jews a national home in palestine yet while england drifted into war with hitlerthe man who had vowed to externinate world jewrythe british government used military force to prevent every european jew it could from reaching safety in palestinethe country britain had already promised them was that rational policy who really made those decisions could those antisemitic feelings still be thriving in some families in britain sterns face burned red with anger professor i cant even think about those days without feeling rage toward the british natterman was staring at stern with strange intensity tell me he said softly were you part of the stern gang is that how you know all this or were you irgun sterns eyes bored in on natterman neither professor a very long time agobefore lakami helped found the haganah stern glanced past natterman to the small windowsquare of cerulean sky in the winter of i emigrated with my mother to palestine my father refused to leave our homeland which happened to be germany despite my youth i did a bit of everything for the haganah fougt arabs procured illegal arms set up radio links across the arabian peninsula smuggled in jews from europebut mostly i fought the british the israelis face hardened but i was no terrorist haganah was a moral army pr sor the moment israel declared nationhood we emerged as her legitimate defense forces ive never believed in senseless violence to achieve political ends i saw too many men start out as patriots and end up as criminals sterns eyes misted with some halfforgotten emotion terror is a tempting tool in war professor the easiest shortterm solution is always to lash outto murder i know i tried it once he sighed deeply but an eye for an eye is no road map to a better world in her seat near the staircase swallow clenched her trembling hands jonas sterns voicehis hypocritical zionist voicehad hurled her back into the past back to palestine swallow knew all about jonas sterns flirtation with revenge and she had a very different opinion about the merits of the concept she could no longer even think coherently about her pain her clearest memory was of her time as a mathematics prodigy studying at cambridge her time as ann gordon she still remerhbered the stunned expressions of the dons as she soared through the nether reaches of theoretical calculus at age ixteen when the war broke out british intelligence had snatched her up with the rest of the savants and whisked her into cryptography her parents lived in london but her two brothers were stationed abroad the elder an raf bombardier on malta the youngeranns fraternal twina military policeman in palestine ann and her twin brother andrew had been inseparable as children and they had danced with joy when fate landed them both in the same theater of the war the family had a splendid warright up until the end in both of anns parents were killed by one of the last vrockets to fall on london then her elder brother was shot down over germany and lynched by civilians while the warrenss looked on that left only ann decoding german signals in a stifling shed intel aviv and andrew caught in the escalating violence between jews arabs and the british in palestine with the rest of the family dead the twins had grown closer than ever they even shared a small apartment in the poor quarter of tel avivuntil the night andrew was blown into small pieces as he sat on a toilet in the british police barracks his brutal death finally shattered anns enghsh stoicism during the long desolate months of anguish her grief slowly metamorphosed into a dark implacable fury the war with germany ended but she had found a new war to fight with methodical fanaticism she set to work finding out who had killed her twin brother it didnt take long the bomb that killed andrew had been a zionist reprisal attack revenge for some filthy jews who had died in a british deportation camp and the name of the young firebrand who had planned and carried out that reprisal jonas stern it had taken ann just two hours to learn everything the local authorities knew about stern he had apparently helped the british quite a bit during the war but before and since the young zionist had killed enough englishmen to earn an unofficial bounty of a thousand pounds on his head ann gordon didnt give a damn about the bounty all she cared about was avenging her dead brother the next day she volunteered for the operations side of british intelligence and they accepted her she was brilliant tough and best of all an orphan after rigorous training in england they christened her swallow and put her to work as an assassin the trouble was she had no say in her choice of assignments she spent year after year luring ira gunmen arab terrorists african communists antibritish mercenaries and other hard cases to their doom instead of hunting down the zionist demon from her past in all the years swallow worked for british intelligence not once did she manage to get within striking range of jonas stern to her everlasting fury the young zionist fanatic had evolved into a singularly gifted field agent and long before swallow was pensioned off stern himself had retired to a fortified haven in the negev desert apparently never to emerge twice since then swallow had attempted to breach the defenses of sterns desert refuge she had drawn jewish blood on both occasions but she had failed to reach her hated target after that the mossad had learned her identity and warned her off for swallow crossinginto the holy land meant certain death and so she had returned to england and waited until yesterday yesterday like a call from olympus sir neville shaws summons had come something had drawn jonas stern out of israel at last out of his sanctuary swallows eyes popped open as professor nattermans voice crackled in her ear receiver breaking her reverie cant you see it stern he said forcefully somehow for some unknown reason the past and present are coming toward some mysterious meeting point a kin o completion its like the bible the sins of the fathers yes or as the buddhists teach karma the old professor raised a crooked finger and shook it slowly you still think my suspicions about rudolf hess are unfounded if ghosts like yitzhak shamir can survive to haunt the present so can hess i tell you stern the man is alive stern closed a strong hand over nattermans upraised finger hard enough to cause pain it infuriated the professor but it shut him up stern leaned back in his seat and sighed i do wonder sometimes who is pulling the strings of this invisible cabal is it lord granville the young englishman is it some madman some wouldbe aryan messiah is it another ghost from the past your helmut perhaps natterman fixed the israeli with a penetrating gaze jonas he said gravely using sterns first name for the first time what will you do if if we find that i am right if we find living men who bear direct responsibility for the holocaust will you kill them stern ran a hand through his thinning hair if we were to find such men alive he said quietly i would take them back to israel take them to israel for a public trial that is the only end from which justice can come natterman scratched at his gray wisp of beard youre a strong man jonas it takes great strength to show restraint im not that strong stern murmured if i couldnt get them back to israel i would kill them without hesitation glancing across the aisle for the first time in several minutes stern saw that his three young companions had awakened they were listening wideeyed like children around a campfire the haganah years stern had spoken of resonated like myths in the hearts of the young sabres and they stared at him like a hero of another age beyond that they now knew something about their mission they yere to be given the chance of a lifetimethe chance to strike back through the pages of historyto punish men who had never been justly punishedmen who had tried to make the state of israel a stillborn nation sterns commandos were lean and hard in body and spirit and from that moment on they were as soldiers in a holy war four rows ahead of them another soldier also awaited her chance to strike as the el al jetliner soared southward through the glorious vault of sky the woman codenamed swallow reveled in the knowledge that she could destroy jonas stern right now stern had the least part of the spandau diary but what did she care for papers if she killed stern here of course she would die she thought of sir neville shaw the nerveless director general of mi she certainly felt no loyalty to that old serpent shaw and men like him had used her ruthlessly throughout her career wielding her like a razorsharp sword all the while ignoring her quest for private justice but what of england that hazy increasingly obsolete concept in spite of her coldness swallow had always possessed a strong rather maudlin streak of patriotism was preserving british honor worth deferring her sweet revenge for one more day professor natterman had spoken of ghosts from the past swallow knew that once she unmasked herselftoday tomorrow whenevershe would be one ghost that jonas stern would be very surprised to see chapter twentyseven am protori more than fifty knives of all types gleamed inside the brightly lit display case hauer leaned over until his nose touched the glass this immediately drew the attention of a nearby salesman a freckled redhaired man of about any particular style youre looking for sir he asked in a british accent are you looking for a souvenir or might you be doing some hunting with it good point hauer said in english could be doing some hunting still we dont want anythingtoo big quality thats the thing of course sir i believe ive got just what you need when the young man moved down the row of display cases hans leaned close to hauer what about a gun he whispered hauer didnt reply this was their fifth stop of the day and he was beginning to feel overexposed after checking into the burgerspark hotel and changing their deutsche marks for rand they had slipped out the rear entrance of the hotel and into their taxi they clung to the amuests of the ford while salil made short work of their british tall car the loquacious indian had shepherded them around the city while they purchased several changes of clothes and enough food to last two days without leaving whatever hotel room they finally settled into salil had also recommended the large sporting goods store here you are sir the salesman said proudly holding out a sleek sixinch knife for hauers inspection e hauer took the weapon and turned it in the light h halted it in his palm feeling the balance the knife had a plain varnished handlenot nearly so ornate as the engraved showpieces glinting in the display casebut hauers approval was evident i see you know your knives sir said the salesman made in west gennany that was solingen steel finest in the world hauer flicked the knife back and forth with practiced ease well take two the salesmans smile broadened already these two tourists had purchased an expensive hunting rifle scope and a nikon camera with minitripod and handheld light meter i notice your accent sir he said with a sidelong glance at hans german are you swiss hauer said quickly ah the salesman realized he had asked the wrong question ill just wrap these for you after another long look at hans he disappeared through a narrow doorway behind the counter why does he keep staring at you hauer muttered is he queer he thinks im a goddamn tennis star after a moment hauer nodded with reliel what about guns hans asked again the rendezvousis tonight eight oclock hans if the kidnappers are smartand so far they have beentheyll just sniff you out tonight you didnt take the plane they told you to that will put them off balance for all they know a hundred interpol agents are going to descend on the burgerspark hotel tonight no theyll either send a drone or telephone you with further instructions my guess is theyll call hans looked far from satisfied id feel a lot better if i had a pistol and there are dozens right in that case true hauer acknowledged but i dont see any silencers do you we cant go around pretoria firing off pistols our badges are worthless here plus i dont want to subject our papers to even a cursory background check while hans sulked hauer glanced around the store all right he said resignedly you see that rack over there he pointed across the store to a large display of hunting bows hans nodded go over and tell that salesman you want the smallest crossbow he has with a seventypound draw and six of i sharpest bolts he has hauer pulled a wad of bills from his trousers pocket and peeled off four hundred rand still looking longingly at the gun case hans took the money here you are gentlemen the salesman had reappeared in the doorway with a small brownwrapped parcel that comes to ah he trailed off looking past hauer hauer turned and followed his gaze the salesman was staring at hans who now stood with his hands on his hips scrutinizing a rack of expensive tennis racquets with an experts disdainftil eye the salesman cleared his throat could i show you something else er sir hans continued to stare silently at the racquets the salesman reached out timidly and touched hauers sleeve pardon me sir but isnt he slowly hans turned to the salesman and smiled the confiding slightly embarrassed smile celebrities use when they would prefer that no one make a fuss over them could i possibly see a few racquetshe asked estusas preferably the no the salesman almost tripped over his feet in his haste to get around the counter why certainly sir i am at your complete disposal he blushed im a terrific fan you know we have just the racquet you want and im positive that a very agreeable discount could be arranged as the gushing salesman led his prize across the store hans looked back over his shoulder and glared pointedly at hauer then at the gun case talking all the way normally my racquets are supplied directly from the factory he explained but the stupid airline put my bag aboard the wrong plane stunned by hanss boldness hauer took ie look around the store for surveillance cameras slipped quickly behind the gun case dropped to his knees and went to work on the lock when hans stepped out of the store twenty minutes later he saw hauer waiting for him at the end of the block surrounded by shopping bags stuffing a large oblong parcel under his arm he jogged awkwardly up the street dont tell me said hauer you bought the tennis racquet the crossbow hans muttered i wasnt sure you could break into the gun case hauer opened his jacket slightly the handgrips of two gleaming black pistols jutted from his waistband walthers matched pair a child could have sprung the lock on that case he closed his jacket and laughed softly that was pretty good acting in there boris you almost had me convinced lets just get the hell out of here hans snapped i had to sign six autographs before they let me out of the store at that moment salil pulled his taxi smoothly up to the curb your carriage awaits said hauer he reached down and picked up the boxed rifle scope and camera and loaded them into the trunk of the indians ford lets go shoot some pictures am mi headquatlers charles street london england sir neville shaw had not slept in his office for quite some timenot since the falklands war his deputy had reminded him but now he lay sound asleep on a squeaky cot he had ordered brought to his office early this morning when deputy director wilson came barging into the office without even a perfunctory knock shaw came up off the cot like he had as a child during the blitz what in gods name is it he bellowed world war three wilson was breathless its swallow sir shes picked up stern shaw pounded his fist on his thigh by god i knew that woman could do it she boarded his plane at bengurion theyre airborne now and stern is definitely headed for south africa not only did swallow overhear stern say that he had part of the spandau papers but she also heard him discussing the involvement of the duke of windsor in the hess affair good christ discussing it with whom a german his professor hes a relative of one of the tory berlin policemen who found the spandau papers swallow thinks stern plans to use him to make contact with he and apfelshe called from the aircraft telephone she u a verbal code from the nineteen sixties sir it took a crypto team two hours to dig the cipher key out of the basement shaw left his cot and walked toward his desk with swallow on his tail sterns as good as dead we can count on getting whatever portion of the papers hes carrying wilson looked uncomfortable if swallow does kill stern sir do you think the fact that shes retired is enough to shield us from an israeli protest protest what do we care about one scruffy yid you can bet stern asked for it somewhere up the line the zionist terrorists in palestine were a damned sight mo re ruthless than your palestinian today wilson a damned sight shaw rubbed his hands together anxiously south africa he murmured how in blazes did that old fox figure that out wilson looked puzzled im not sure what you mean but swallow overheard stern discussing the wife of sergeant apfel frau apfel seems to have been kidnapped by someone in south africa who is demanding the spandau papers as ransom for a moment shaw seethed to have lost his breath wheres my bloody ship wilson ship sir wilson reddened oh yes lloyds list has the mv casilda bound for tanzania however i managed to get hold of some american satellite photos which show her anchored in the mozambique channel off madagascar there are two helicopters lashed to her decks thank god shaw said under his breath sir neville wilson said softly does that freighter have something to do with the spandau affair better if you dont know just yet wilson if all this blows up in my face youll be able to swear you never knew a bloody thing for gods sak wilson looked distraught e neville at least let me help you shaw pursed his lips thoughtfully all right man if you really want to help ive got something thats just your line of country name it there are some files i need if this thing goes sour well want them shredded and burned in a hurry shaw picked up a pen and scrawled three names on a sheet of notepaper might be a bit sticky but youve done this kind of thing before he handed over the paper wilson read the names hess rudolf steuer helmut zinoviev v v and where are these files sir the public records office shaw watched wilson closely although technically theyre foreign office files there is also a hess file in the war office but its sealed until i dont think anyone could get at that wilson swallowed hard you mean you want me to steal files from the foreign office be thankful its only paper man there are much dirtier jobs involved in this case wilson met shaws steady gaze wont the missing files be noticed probably shaw reached into a drawer and withdrew a thick dogeared file thats why i m giving you this he handed the folder across to wilson its also a hess file but its been amended the zinoviev and steuer files simply have to disappear but you can fill the hess gap with that it was prepared in the early seventies after we were forcedby statute to reveal certain information on hess it was our insurance against the day some hothead like neil kinnock started pressing for radical disclosures i think it will serve very well in this situation shaw sighed contentedly now pour us a glenfiddich eh wilson you look like you need one l pm room the protea hof hotat pretoria hauer looked forlornly around the hotel room he had steeled himself for an explosion that never came perhaps hans was simply too exhausted to get upset and then perhaps it was something else his reaction did not fit the stimulus and that bothered hauer the fact that three pages of the spandau diary were missing clearly reduced the chances of getting ilse back alive yet when hauer had revealed that the pages were missing hans hadnt said a word fris eyes had widened in disbelief hed rubbed his temples seen to sag a little but he had not shouted at hauer for pilfer the papers on the plane or blasted professor natterman for his cowardice or tried to attack hauer as he had done to the professor at the cabin hed simply stood up and walked into the bathroom hauer could hear water running in the sink now he unboxed the nikon n camera with macromicro lens that he had bought at the sporting goods store then he set up the special tripod he had bought to facilitate the time exposures less than a foot high the squat instrument had short splayed legs and fully pivoting head it reminded him of a robot from a s science fiction movie he set it up on the table near the window and opened the drapes then he mounted the nikon hans he called to the bathroom i need the papers thirty seconds later hans emerged from the bathroom with the crinkled foil packet containing the spandau papers he handed it to hauer without a word cover the door hauer said if anyone knows where we are now is the time theyll hit us instead of drawing the walther from his waistband hans leaned over and picked up the crossbow held bought hauer gingerly unwrapped the foil while hans loaded a stubby razorsharp bolt im going to bracket the fstops he said ill shoot at the widest aperture flash at oneeth of a second then progressively longer exposures until wereach two full seconds just to make sure hans said nothing i know youre still worried about the pictures but ilse said the kidnappers could detect whether photocopies of the papers had been made this is no different than looking at the papers weve got no choice hans were going to have to trade the original spandau papers for ilse this is our fallback besides to crack phoenix in berlin ivere going to need a copy of the papers plus the evidence in the fire safe at steubens house hauer worked his way through the exposures for the first pageseven shots altogetherthen carefully set it aside hans handed over the second page hauer repeated the procedure the first roll of film ran out halfway through page four while hauer reloaded the nikon he heard hans whisper damn that old man hauer kept working while he talked it isnt the professors fault hans that blond afrikaner got them and whoever killed him got the papers the professor should have told us about the missing pages but you know why he didnt he couldnt bring himself to admit hed lost them he knew youd go crazy and to no avail we couldnt have done anything about it anyway hans sat silently listen said hauer natterman was stupid to put these blank sheets in with the papers it made the missing pages twice as obvious when we make the exchange well use only the six matching pages the kidnappers wont know the difference hanss opinion of this theory was painfully clear on his face you know better than that he said softly they have ilse and she knows exactly what i found she can describe it down to the hanss mouth stopped moving phoenix would torture her to find those things out stop talking like that hauer snapped ilses smart shell tell them what they want without a fight look hans all we need is ilse in the open and ten seconds to get her clear the kidnappers wont have more than ten seconds to examine the papers thats the situation i intend to arrange anything else is unacceptable ten seconds is enough time to count pages hans observed hauer sighed heavily at the cabin you said you trusted me hans now youve got to prove it weve got the leverage here not them they know theyll never get the papers back if they kill ilse the moment they make contact we set out our terms for the exchange they have to accept them and once they accept our terms weve got them hans met hauers eyes but do we have ilse hauer picked the last diary page up off the bed shot his last seven exposures then removed the film from the camera he folded the spandau papers into quarters then eighths then he wrapped the aluminum foil tightly about them again im going to find a lab that can process the film in an hour or two he said slipping the cartridges into his pocket i want you to sleep while im gone youve been up for thirtysix hours and ive been up longer than that airplane sleep doesnt count the burgerspark rendezvous is at e tonight call the desk and set a wakeup call for seventhirty hans looked up stonily you expect me to steep now just shut off the light and breathe deeply you wont last five minutes you should see your eyes right now they look like theyre bleeding working his jaw muscles steadily hans finally said shouldnt i keep the papers here hauer considered this hans had held the papers until now theyre safer on the move he said suddenly he slipped the packet into his trouser pocket and headed for the door get some sleep ill see you when we wake up outside the hotel the sun burned down without mercy hauer wished hed thought to bring a hat moving watchidly through the treelined streets he tried to gauge their chances of success tonight would be their first and possibly only chance to turn the tables on the men who held ilse the men behind phoenix and with no backup to rely on every move could be their last hauer needed time to think and most critical now he needed sleep maybe worse than he ever had in his life he could feel the sun sapping his energy by the minute he paused in the shade of a purpleblossomed jacaranda tree he leaned against its trunk folded his arms and waited for a taxi none passed he did not know that in south africa taxis may not legally cruise for business but must wait in ranks at designated locations struggling to keep his eyes open he wondered if hans might be right would the kidnappers make their main move at the burgerspark tonight would they risk showing themselves this early in the game he didnt think so but this wasnt berlin maybe on their own territory the bastards would act with impunity maybe he should find a place to hide the papers before the rendezvous maybet i ax a red madza driven by an enterprising soul made an illegal uturn and screeched up to hauers shade tree for a moment hauer thought the driver was salil the talkative indian but it was only his exhausted mind playing tricks on him a tanned afrikaner leaned out of the window where to mate he asked in english i need some film developed hauer replied fast how fast yesterday got money all i need right said the driver get in then chapter twentyeight i pm horn house northern transvaal rsa seated in his motorized wheelchair on the north lawn alfred horn chewed an upmann cigar while robert stanton lord granville paced nervously around him gulping from an enormous bloody mary for an hour the young englishman had been ranting about corporate expansion the corporation he referred to was the illegal and wholly invisible one which carried on the lucrative drug and currencysmuggling operations he had administered for alfred horn for the past eight years the old man had sat silent during most of the tirade he was curious but not about increasing his illegal profits he was curious about stanton himself today the young noblemans voice had the semblance of its usual brashness but something in it did not quite ring true he was drunk and horn intended to give him as much rope as he would take i dont even know why im trying he lamented do you realize how much money we have lost in the past three days alfred over two million pounds two million and i have no idea why you shut down our entire european operation without a word of explanation to whom do i owe explanations horn rasped well to no one of course but alfredcertain people might get angry if we dont resume operations very soon we have commitments a faint smile touched horns lips yes he said softly im curious robert this gold that is scheduled to anive day after tomorrow why is it coming by ship normally those deliveries are made by air this question surprised stanton but he recovered quickly the final leg will still be made by air he said by helicopter i dont know why alfred perhaps the currency export restrictions were tightened at colombias airports perhaps it was easier to take the gold out by ship who knows indeed horn glanced at the thin face of pieter smuts tell me robert do you miss england youve been with us a month now stanton took a huge swallow of his bloody mary glad to be away from the bloody place its winter there isnt it though i must admit id like to get down to joburg for a weekend not much female companionship to choose from here i dont have the fancy for dark meat smuts has i suppose its an acquired taste stanton grinned theres always the pretty new fraulein of course our own aryan princess horns solitary eye burned into stantons face you will keep your distance from frau apfel robert he said sharply is that absolutely clear wouldnt dream of it old boy not my type at all the young englishman tried to look nonchalant but he could not remain cool under the smoking gaze of horns security chief would you mind terribly not doing that smuts he said irritably gives me the galloping creeps smuts continued to stare like a wolf at the edge of a dying fire after several moments horn said it wont be long now robert and everything will be back to normal i have some business to take care of first that is all its a matter of security security stanton thought contemptuously in two days youre going to find out about bloody security he slipped on a pair of wayfarer sunglasses to hide his eyes while he considered his remarkable position three months ago two very powerful people had decided they wanted alfred horn dead one was a ruthless colombian drug baron who wanted access to phoenixs european drug markets his motivegreedstanton clearly understood the other was a rather terrifying gentleman from london named sir neville shaw stanton knew nothing about his motive all he knew was that both shaw and the colombian had asked him to assassinate alfred horn with his own hands stanton had refused of course he didnt want to murder the old man horn had made him richsomething his worthless title had never done but the terrible pressure to kill the old man had not relented the colombian had threatened stantons life a threat stanton could afford to ignore as long as he lived under horns protection sir neville shaw had also begun with threats ill bury your title under a mountain of dirt and blood hed said stanton had laughed he didnt give two shits about his title even as a child he had sensed that the name granville was held in quiet profound contempt among most of the british peerage that was one reason hed turned to the life he had and also why upon his fathers death he had accepted the aid and protection of alfred horn but then shaw had changed tactics kill horn hed said and the crown will allow you to keep the companies you own and operate under horns supervision stanton had paused atthat because the time was long past for alfred horn to pass on his empire to a younger man for five years stanton had been the majority stockholder of phoenix ag yet not one decision regarding the administration of the giant conglomerate had been made by him his father had played a similar role before him but his father had been allowed to make decisionshis father had been trusted robert was a mere figurehead almost a joke yes the time for change had come yet stanton could not do the dirty work himself even if he succeeded in killing horn pieter smuts would tear him limb from bloody limb no the old man would have to be killed in such a way that smuts and his security force died with him stanton had pondered this problem for a week after which time he had hit upon a rather brilliant plan he would simply bring together the two parties who shared a common goal on a day trip to london he had communicated his plan to shaw then left the devious mi chief to work out the details thus the present plan thus the ship all that remained now was the execution drunk already are you smuts goaded in his flat voice for once stanton looked the afrikaner dead in the eye just thinking he said you should try it sometime old sport ilse apfel stood on a gentle swell of grass and stared across the vast highveld she had fled horn house after the nightmare in the xray room running as far and as fast as she could no one had stopped her but linah had followed at a respectful distance pausing whenever ilse did keeping pace like a distant shadow after ilses panic had carried her nearly two miles from the house shed calmed smoothed out a place in the rough grass to rest alfred horn had spoken the truth at dinner si on this empty plateau there was simply nowhere to not without a map a gun and a good supply far to her left scrawny humped cattle grazed beyond them a pair of reddish horses pranced in the sun a black haze hung low in the distance touching the brown horizo though ilse did not know it the black smoke rose from the coalfueled cookstoves of a small native kraal or village such smoke marked most native dwellings from capetown to the bantustan of venda in winter it was worse then the dark palls hung perpetually over the settlements blocking out the sun in south africa electricity is a selectively p vided commodity ilse looked down at the sunbaked earth what hope had she here so far from germany what chance did her childm have hans was on his way here now if horn could be believed and from smutss questions in the xray session shorn thought there was a chance hanss father might be coming too she hoped so even from hanss rare comments about dieter hauer ilse had gleaned that he was a highly respected even feared police officer but what could he do against men like pieter smuts again jiirgen luhr who had slashed a helpless policeman before her eyes she thought of alfred horn lord grenville was right about one thingthe old man had taken to her ilse had enough experience with men to recognize infatuation and horn had definitely fallen for her and here she realized his infatuation might be the key to very survival and to her childs survival she wonder what madness the old man had planned for tonight from what stanton had told her of horns business dealings meetings could augur no good for anyone still she c not very well refuse to attendnot if she wanted ate herself further with horn and she might le thing that could help her escape pulling a long blade of grass from the ground and started back toward the house she had wandered afield than shed thought linah was no longer in sig before ilse had covered fifty meters she confronted thing she had not seen on her way out a shimmering stretch of hot asphalt running off through the grass and scrub a her heart quickened with hope then she saw the plane three hundred meters to her right on a round asphalt runway horns sleek leara ilse sighed hopelessly and continued west a long rise she caught sight of horn house about away she gasped fleeing the house earlier she had not looked back but now she saw the whole estate laid out before her like a postcard photograph stark and stunning in its originality she had never seen anything like it not in magazines not even on television horn housea building kat from inside gave the impression of a classical manor med with ornate rooms and endless hallwayswas actually an equilateral triangle a triad of vast legs surrounded a central tower that rose like a castle keep above the three outer legs crowning this tower was aglittering copperplated dome the observatory ilse remembered hexagonal turrets ked each vertex of the great triangle she half expected to see archers rise up from behind the tessellated parapets with a sudden shiver she realized that horn house was exactly what it appeared to bea fortress on the seemingly ureless plain the massive citadel stood ofi a hill set in center of a shallow circular bowl created by gradually rig slopes on all its sides anyone approaching it would have to cross this naked expanse of ground beneath the gaze of the central tower ilse pressed down her apprehension and set off across the asphalt using the observatory dome as her homeward beacon she was quickly brought up short by a deep dry gully she d crossing a shallow defile earlier but nothing s she must have crossed it at another point on her from the house easing herself down over the rim carefully into the dusty ravine smuts had christened this dry creek bed the wash and it served as the first barrier in an impregnable security screen which the afrikaner had constructed around his masters isolated redoubt if ilse had known what lay been her and horn house she would have hunkered down he wash and refused to take another step the afrikaner used all his experience to turn the grassy bowl between the wash and his masters fortress into a killing zone from which no intruder could escape alive every square meter of the circular depression was protected by claymore mines explosive devices containing hundreds of steel balls that when remotely detonated blasted outward at an angle and cut any living creature to pieces in a millisecond concrete bunkers each armed with an m machine gun studded the inner lip of the huge bowl each was connected to the central tower by a network of underground tunnels providing a secure means of directing fire and reinforcing the bunkers in the event of casualties but the linchpin of horn houses defenses was the observatory the nerve center of the entire security complex the great copper dome housed closedcircuit television monitors radar screens satellite communications gear and the pride of smutss arsenala painstakingly machined copy of the american vulcan minigun a rotary cannon capable of pouring armorpiercing rounds per minute down onto the open ground surrounding horn house none of these precautions was visible of course pieter smuts knew his job the claymore minesdesigned to be spiked onto the ground surfacehad been waterproofed and hidden beneath small mounds of earth the bunkers had sheets of sunscorched sod laid over their outward faces even the vulcan gun slept silently behind the retractable lllescope cover of the observatory waiting to be aimed not at the heavens but at the earth oblivious to the matrix of death that surrounded her ilse fought her way up and overthe far rim of the wash brushed herself off and continued toward the still distant house with a soft buzz alfred horn turned his wheelchair away from his security chief and gazed across the veld ilse had just topped the rim of the bowl to the northeast with her blond hair dancing in the sun she looked as carefree as a jungfrau picnicking in the grunewald without taking his eyes from her horn asked is the helicopter available pieter yes sir horn watched ilse make her way across the long shallow depression and climb the hill to the house it took several minutes when ilse spied the ahikaner she started to avoid the table but horn motioned her over she stepped tentatively up to his wheelchair is there any news of my husband she asked diffidently not yet my dear but there soon will be im sure horin turned to smuts pieter have one of the office girls order some clothes for frau apfel they can fly them out in the helicopter and make sure theres something conservative he cast a surreptitious glance at lord granville for tonight the young englishman stared into his drink take frau apfel with you pieter horn suggested she can provide her sizes he turned to ilse with a smile would you my dear ilse hesitated a moment then she silently followed smuts she didnt know what to make of alfred horns eccentricities but she remembered the afrikaners warning against disobeying him she would do anything to keep her unborn child off the torture table that waited in the xray roomhom watched her walk into the house a look of rapture on his face stanton observed him with growing disgust the oldfools past it he thought theres no stopping things now you never learned the natural law alfred you pass the torrh to the young or you die as stanton drained the dregs of his bloody mary he made a silent toast to sir neville shaw pm mozambique channel indian ocean sixtyfive miles off the wooded coastline of southern mozambique the mv casilda hove to in the milewide stretch of water that separates the old portuguese colony from the island of madagascar a mediumsized freighter of panamanian registry her holds were full of denim fabric bound for dares salaam on the tanzanian coast to the north after unloading this cargo casilda would sail to beira the great railhead and port on the mozambique coast where she would take on a consignment of asbestos bound for uruguay but just now she had other business strapped to the aft deck of the freighter like giant insects pinned to a display board were two bell jetranger hi helicopters scheduled for delivery to renamo the antimarxist guerrillas in mozambique although the choppers would eventually be delivered to their official buyers they had a job to do firsta slight detour to take supplied by a very wealthy gentleman in south america the jetrangers were configured as commercial aircraftwith the papers required for legal transfer all in orderbut a military man might i e quick to notice that they could be easily modified for combat duty in a pinch the sunblistered man who surveyed the two helos from the shadow of the wheelhouse awning was just such a man an englishman and the only white man on the entire ship his name was alan burton during the entire fiveweek voyage burton had watched over the helicopters as if they were his own in the next two days he would have to entrust his life to them and as he did not particularly trust any of the men he would be working with he felt that the most he could do was be sure of the choppers they were his lifeline his way inhis way out casilda had been lucky so far at no port of call had any customs officials conducted more than a cursory search of her holds if they had they would almost certainly have discovered the two large crates secreted in the stacks of bolted denim which contained a rather amateurish assortment of assault rifles ammunition and grenades they might even have discovered the special cargo hidden in alan burtons cabin but the englishman doubted it he had hidden the mortar tube well in spite of this luck burton was angry the man who had contracted for his services had led him to believe that his companions on this mission would know what they were about they did not burton was the only man in the entire unit who knew this part of africa and excepting the pilots he was the only professional of the lot the cubans were all right but there were only two of themthe pilots the sloppiness of the colombians was appalling burton considered them a rabbleno better than d bandits from his first contact with them serious doubts about the mission had begun to eat at his confidence he lit a gauloise and cursed the luck that had forced him to work under these circumstances the company stank but what could he do he wasnt complaining about the moneythe colombian paid cash on the barrel head and lots of it the cuban pilots were getting six thousand in flight pay plus salary and burtons bonus was twice that but he had not taken this assignment for the money he had taken it for the deal the deal was a mysterious and wondrous arrangement of a kind he had never before hearda solemn pact between a government and an exiled mercenary the price to be paid was not money but a treasure that only one government in the world could pay burton didnt like to think about the deal too much for fear it would evaporate like every other precious hope in his life only in a few unguarded moments on the foredeck at dawn watching the sea had he caught himself thinking of green hills of an old stone cottage the smell of hothouse orchids and sharing a pint with a man much like himself at those times he would angrily push the visions from his mind he had enough to worry about he worried what would happen if the cubans discovered what lay inside one of the elongated boxes labelled rpg two million rand in gold was enough money to tempt even a man of burtons high professional standards and he doubted the cuban pilots had any such pretensions strangelythe colombians didnt worry him on that score they would know enou h about the price i of betraying their master to keep clear of such temptations but their lack of combat experience did worry him hed heard them boasting about violent shootouts in and around medellfn but such hooliganism hardly qualified them to face the kind of opposition they were likely to meet in africa theyll find out soon enough he thought bitterly burton expected a message today relaying the latest situation from the target there was supposedly an informer in side the targetan englishman no lesswhich burton found very interesting at least he isnt a bloody colombian he thought burton hoped the strike order would come today he was ready to get off the goddamn ship as he smoked beneath the blue wheelhouse awning a thin deeply tanned man emerged from a hatch in the afterdeck and walked over to the helicopters it was one of the cuban pilotsa brighteyed youngster named diazchecking the moorings of the choppers spying burton he made an ok signal with his thumb and forefinger then disappeared back down the hatch burton flipped his gauloise over the side rail and walked out to the helicopters maybe a few of them know what theyre about after all he thought maybe chapter twentynine pm horn house the northern transvaal the learjet appeared low in the east a fiery arrow hurtling down the vast african sky the dying sun glittered on the metalskinned apparition as it settled onto the freshly laid asphalt runway it taxied to the short apron then turned slowly until it faced back up the strip shimmering like a bird of prey next to horns helicopter a khakicolored range rover uundled out to meet the plane pieter smuts dressed impeccably as a major of the south african reserve stepped from the drivers seat he stood at attention waiting for the lears short staircase to drop to the tarmac he noticed that the aircraft bore no corporate or national insignia only numbers painted across the gracefully swept tail fin when the jets door finally opened two darkskinned arabs stepped out each carried an automatic weapon that from where smuts stood appeared to be the israeli uzi hats off to the competition he thought dryly the bodyguards made a great show of checking the area for potential threats then one of them barked some arabic through the open hatchway smuts marched smartly toward the bottom of the staircase four arabs filed out of the aircraft and down the steps two wore flowing robes and sandals two wore western business suits smuts greeted the shorter of the two robed arabs mr prime minister yes greetings mr smuts sir pieter smuts at your service if you gentlemen will follow me into the vehicle please the taller of the two robed arabsa man with pie black eyes and a desert chieftains mustachesurveyed the vast expanse of grass and scrub around them then smiled this is not so different from our own country he said the other arabs laughed and nodded now he said let us go to meet the man we have come to see smuts led them to the rover when they reached the main entrance of horn house all the servantsmedical staff excludedstood outside awaiting their arrival this favorably impressed the arabs who walked disdainfully past the whiteclad line and into the great marble reception hall almost immediately a low whirnng sound drew their attention to the far side of the highceilinged room a section of the wall slid swiftly back revealing alfied horn sitting in his wheelchair inside a twometer wide cubicle on his gaunt body the black suit and tie he wore gave him a rather funereal air but something else about him had changed the artificial eye was gone tonight horn wore a black eyepatch in its place combined with the wheelchair the eyepatch gave the wizened old man the quiet dignity of a battlescarred war veteran guten abend gentlemen he rasped would you join me in the elevator please the elevator horn occupied led down to a basement complex one hundred meters below the house only from this basement could one reach a second elevator that led up into the observatory tower of horn house when it became obvious that only four could fit comfortably into the elevator with the wheelchair he ordered smuts to wait with the arab bodyguards well see you in a few minutes sir smuts said by the time the afrikaners party arrived at the secondfloor conference room horn and his arab guests were already seated around a great round table of polished rhodesian teak a large aluminum briefcase lay closed on the table before one of the businesssuited arabs linah had brought up chilled perrier prime minister jalloud turned to the door and softly addressed one of the bodyguards malahim we feel quite secure in herr horns care we wish you to wait downstairs for us the housekeeper will give you refreshments the bodyguard melted away from the door smuts closed the door locked it then stood at attention beside it herr horn prime minister jalloud said uncomfortably our esteemed leader has asked us to obtain your pennission to make a video recording of this negotiation so that he may witness what transpires here tonight he understands if you prefer not to have your face recorded but in that case he asks if we might make an audio recording instead the room hung in tense silence alfred horn laughed silently he had four video cameras recording the meeting already you have video equipment in that case he asked yes jalloud replied worned that he might already have overstepped the bounds of propriety set it up then by all means in negotiations of this magnitude it is necessary to have an accurate record an audible sigh of relief went up in the conference room at the snap of jallouds fingers an arah opened the aluminum case and busied himself with a camcorder and tripod i have a request of my own gentlemen horn said i too keep records of meetings but im oldfashioned do you mind if my personal secretary takes notes certainly not jalloud replied courteously horn pressed a button in a few seconds the door opened to reveal a stunning young blonde wearing a severely cut blue skirt and blouse ironically the two arabs who affected western dress seemed most shocked by ilses sudden appearance as you can see gentlemen said horn my secretary is a woman is that a problem there were some uncomfortable glances but jalloud ended any discussion before it could begin if you wish it herr horn it is so let us begin ilse took a seat behind horn crossed her legs and held a notepad ready to take down anything horn might instruct her to she ignored the arabs completely her attention on horns eyepatch jalloud said herr horn allow me to introduce my companions to my right is major ilyas karami senior military adviser to our esteemed leader he is understandably out of uniform the tall mustached arab wearing robes stood and nodded solemnly to my left jalloud continued is dr hamid sabri our nuclear physicist do not let his youth mislead you in ou country he is the preeminent expert in his field a bookish young man wearing a business suit stood and bowed his head and finally jalloud concluded all jumah my personal interpreter he speaks excellent german and humbly waits to serve you excellent horn said in german until now they had all spoken a very uncomfortableenglish and i the robed arab said proudly am abdul salam jalloud prime minister of my country of course horn said do you mind if i smoke instantly the arabs brought out packs of american cigarettes and lit up horn accepted an upmann cigar from smutss pocket supply as smuts lit the cigar horn noticed a rectangular swatch of color emblazoned on major karamis gold lighter a solid field of bluegreenthe flag of libya a military man to his bones horn thought the homeland is never far from his mind a quick glance at smuts told horn that his security chief had also noticed the lighter perhaps you gentlemen should begin by stating your requirements horn suggested that should give us a clear idea of where we stand jailoud yielded the floor to dr sabri the physicist the bespectacled young libyan spoke soft precise arabic jumah the interpreter translated whenever he paused for breath what we need dr sabri began is fissile material either highly enriched uranium u or plutonium pu we need as much of either isotope as you can supply both if possible at the very least we need fifteen kilograms of uranium or five kilograms of plutonium by highly enriched i mean uranium enriched to at least eighty percent purity anything less is useless to us we also need triggersither lens or krytron typesand sculpted steel support tubes he paused nervously these are our requirements he concluded and resumed his seat when the interpreters voice faded there was silence in the room the libyans watching horn closely failed to notice the shock whiten ilses face as she realized the implications of the young scientists words she had not seen the libyan flag emblazoned on major karamis lighter and even if she had she wouldnt have recognized it but she knew enough science to understand that these men were discussing atomic weapons it took all of her willpower to remain seated and silent she watched the remainder of the meeting through a gauzy haze of unreality like someone who has stumbled onto the scene of a bloody traffic accident alfred horn however watched the libyans as affably as if he were negotiating the price of arabian horses prime minister jalloud finally broke the silence we are prepared to pay any reasonable price for these items herr horn in the currency of your choice of course dinars dollars pounds marks ecus rand even gold bullion the question is are these items available at any price do you actually have access to them alfred horn smiled this was the moment he had been waiting fornot for weeks or months or years but for decades for a lifetime he could barely suppress the excitement he felt on the threshold of realizing his lifes work gentlemen he said softly allow me to be frank the libyans nodded and leaned forward ilse held her breath praying she would awaken from the nightmare pieter smuts remained impassive as ever his gray eyes glued to his masters face for over a decade said horn your leader has sought to obtain nuclear weapons he has attempted to develop a manufacturing capability in your home country and also to purchase weapons readymade from other nations the first avenue proved impossible students from your country arent even allowed to study nuclear physics in the great universities of the world and the second option while theoretically possible has proved to be an embarrassing circus of bribery scandal and hoaxes the chinese sent you packing in seventynine india backed out of a proposed deal and refused to fulfill her obligations to you even after you cut oil shipments to new delhi by one million tons belgium yielded to us pressure and brazil has refused to give any valuable assistance in spite of the fact that you sold them massive amounts of arms in eightytwo the arabs tensed in fury but horn continued reeling off his grocers list of libyan misadventures in a voice that was its own arbiter of truth finally prime minister jalloud white with indignation rose from his chair we did not come here to be insulted sir if you have nothing but words for us there are other suppliers like edwin wilson horn countered and his grubby belgian compatriot armand donnay the uranium they offered you mightisay mighthave been worth using as noseweights for jets but i doubt it yourr lucky you had young sabri to recognize wilsons proposition as garbage the young physicist nodded modestly but major karami said perhaps we planned to irradiate their uranium at our tajoura reactor to produce plutonium for a weapon of our own dr sabris sarcastic expression instantly undercut this feeble attempt to save face gentlemen horn said soothingly i did not bring you here to insult you i merely state these facts so that the true basis of our negotiations will be plain and so that you will understand the necessity of paying the price i ask the mention of money placated the arabs somewhat it suggested that the man in the wheelchairwhatever his opinion of themmight actually have access to the materials they had come to purchase and that was all that mattered go on said jalloud taking his seat againhere is the situation as i see it said horn as we speak the world does not even perceive libya as a nuclear threshold country your requirements however paint a significantly different picture the need for highly enriched triggers and sculpted tubes tells me that you are uranium building your own weapon and that you have probably already obtained all the necessary components other than those you seek from me your request for an absolute minimum of fifteen kilograms of u or five kilograms of plutonium suggests that you have procured tamperreflector technology and are trying to build the smallest bomb you canpossibly even a portable weapon am i correct no one disputed him horn turned directly into the lens of the softly humming video camera that had been forgotten by everyone in the room but him i propose something quite different he said solemnly i am offering you an aircraftdeliverable nuclear weapon with a fortykiloton yield completely assembled with fissionable core ready for detonation in that moment the air in the conference room seemed to turn to water although the arabs knew their leader would not view the videotape for many hours yet they also knew that the words spoken by the old man in the wheelchair were for him alone their presence had become irrelevant horn spoke softly to the humming camera i can offer you a weapon of the implosion or the gunassembly type and subject to certain conditions i can continue to provide these weapons at the rate of one every forty days major karamis black eyes glittered as he fumbled for another cigarette at length jalloud asked softly are you serious sir horns single burning eye was answer enough major karami regained his composure first and what is the price of this great gift he asked warily there are only so many billions of diners in our treasury not a single piece of gold do i desire horn rasped what then jalloud asked puzzled oil my price herr prime minister is control i will provide you with a single weapon you will not stockpile it and wait for more weapons you will use itand against a target specified by me horn raised a spindly finger only then will more weapons be provided thats ridiculous major karami exploded why not use it yourself we have our own targets and well use our weapons as we see fit your price is too high one moment ilyas jalloud cautioned what is your target of preference herr horn thank you for asking horn said softly it so happens that the target i want destroyed coincides with the one your leader has unsuccessfully tried for years to destroythe state of israel to be exact tel aviv ilse let out a short gasp from her chair behind horn tel aviv karami exclaimed unbelieving he turned to jalloud does he speak the truth do you the prime minister asked tel aviv horn murmured i want the jews wiped from the face of the earth as do we jalloud retorted but what good is one weapon to us if we have to wait forty days for another we will be annihilated the zionists have two hundred nuclear bombs horn smiled yes they do but think for a moment i assume you do not want palestine rendered permanently unin habitable you merely wish the jews pushed into the sea yes tel aviv is the first step on the road to reclaiming jerusalem if skillfully managed your attack could even be made to appear as an israeli nuclear accident major karami seemed to be debating with himself herr horn he said hesitantly israels air defenses are the toughest in the world even with the best of luck it would be difficult to guarantee that a single plane carrying this warhead could get through to tel aviv and even if it did we would have no chance to mask our responsibility for the attack horn saw that admitting this weakness had cost the libyan major dearly i appreciate your frankness he said if you would prefer i could arrange to deliver a slightly smaller warheada thirtykiloton yieldthat could be fitted with a timer and concealed inside a large crate it would not be nearly as compact as the american sadmthe famous suitcase bombbut it could fit easily inside a small truck prime minister jalloud started to speak but major karami restrained him i believe we can do business he said hoarsely trying to maintain some semblance of composure are there any other restrictions time horn replied i want tel aviv destroyed within ten days stunned major karami sat back in his chair horns words coursed through his veins like a powerful narcotic after endless years of cowering beneath the zionist nuclear threat libya would finally possess the means to strike back karami clenched and unclenched his fists in anticipation of wielding the deadliest sword ever to fall into muslim hands theti he went still how do we know that you actually have access to such weapons he asked he was almost afraid to hear the answerafraid that his heady dreams of conquest would disappear like smoke from a tent fire horn smiled because i have one in the basement complex of this house ready for dr sabris inspection if you gentlemen will follow me gasps went up around the table the arabs began shaking each others hands and talking rapidly among themselves the interpreter did not even attempt to translate the effusive congratulations that filled the room s in the corner behind horn ilses face had gone slack after luhrs drugs and the horror in the xray room witnessing this nightmarish conclave had pushed her over the edge of endurance as the libyans filed out of the room behind horns motorized chair she slid awkwardly to the floor tiny beads of cold sweat sparkling on her bloodless forehead pm burgerspark hotel pretoria in a small room on the fourth floor of the burgerspark hotel jonas stern reviewed his interception plan with his men gadi abrams lounged on one of the hotel beds professor natterman sat in a chair by the window wearing a bulky bulletproof vest beneath his tweed jacket stern himself sat on the bed opposite gadi yosef shamir stood in the lobby four floors below listening through a handheld radio thirty minutes until the rendezvous stern said wheres aaron just then they heard a key in the door the young commando stepped in the elevator control box is in the basement he said i can stop the elevator wherever you want it stern nodded what about the radio aaron frowned and pulled a small walkietalkie from his pocket i could hear you but theres static and you were only on the fourth floor with eight floors between us im not so sure well check it when we get up there stern consulted a drawing he had made on a piece of hotel stationery all right here it is ive taken a second room on the eighth floor of this hotel the closest i could get to suite ithe room where sergeant apfel is registeredwas its down the hall past the elevators and around the corner gadi and i will be in that room yosef will be watching the lobby aaron will be in the basement professor natterman will wait here stern tugged at the flesh beneath his chin before we intercept hauer and apfel i intend to let the kidnappers make contact in whatever way they choose i suspect that they will call suite and instruct our german friends to meet them at a different place if they attempt to seize or kill the germans however we will intervene stern looked over into the corner there in a large open suitcase lay the fruits of onle of the telephone calls he had made from nattermans wolfsburg cabin a jewish arms dealer of sterns long acquaintance had had the suitcase ready when stern arrived at his johannesburg home this afternoon in the suitcase lay five shortbarrelled uzi submachine guns four silenced caliber pistols two of five walkietalkies silencers for the uzis and a small hoard of ammunition obviously said stern professor natterman must make our initial contact with the germans of the five of us captain hauer knows only him hauer is likely to shoot anyone else who exposes himself too soon ideally the professor will make the contact by telephone when yosef sees the germans enter the lobby he will radio gadi and me in room gadi has already bugged suite so we will be monitoring what transpires after hauer and apfel get inside after the kidnappers have made their contact we will call professor natterman here professor you will immediately call suite if you reach hauer or apfel you will give the little speech we went over together natterman nodded attentively if you cannot reach thembecause of a busy signal or anything elsewe will go to the backup plan gadi and i will observe the germans as they leave suite if they take the stairs down we will radio you here whereupon you will walk immediately to the stairwell and wait for them stern smiled encouragingly you dont need to run professor the stairwell is less than twenty meters from this room hauer and apfel must cover four floors before they reach you natterman nodded again if they take the elevator down however it gets a bit more complicated in that case gadi will radio aaron in the basement and aaron will stop the elevatorbetween floorshopefully between the fourth and third i will radio youstern pointed his finger at nattermanand tell you to go to the elevator shaft yosef will be here with you he will have come up from the lobby after making certain that hauer and apfel are not being followed he will pry open the elevator doors for you and you will speak to hauer while he is trapped below you hell probably be trying to get out through the roof anyway natterman looked anxious the elevator scenario seems rather complicated its the only way we can insure contact without frightening hauer away or getting killed ourselves why cant i just wait in the lobby for them stern sighed heavily because we would then risk frightening the kidnappers away and the kidnappers professor are the men i came to south africa to get natterman looked glum can your men do all theyre supposed to the timing seems close gadi abrams grinned we are sayaret matkal professor he said proudly this is childs play for us stern shot him a dark look hauer will not be childs play gadi you boys have trained with gsg so i shouldnt have to amplify that captain hauer is an extremely dangerous man dont underestimate sergeant apfel either he is under unimaginable pressure and a man like that is capable of anything gadi nodded yes uncle stern glanced at his watch lets move twenty minutes to the rendezvous and we still need to test the radio reception from the basement as one stern gadi and aaron collected their weapons from the suitcase and moved toward the door good luck professor stern said then they went out as stern moved toward the elevators gadi fell back beside him and whispered i didnt want to alarm anybody uncle but what happened to our body armor stern grimaced another buyer came along and offered more money but why give the professor the one vest we have you should be wearing it stern shook his head natterman may have to stand in the stairwell and wait for hauer and apfel to come running down theres a strong chance hauer kvill fire a reflex shot before he even recognizes the professor thats why he gets the vest in room professor natterman sat with the walkietalkie clenched in his hand it was sticky hot inside the armored vest he wanted to take it off but he reasoned that if stern had given him the only vest they had he probably needed it setting the walkietalkie on the table he stood and stretched his joints ached terribly from all the una tomed exercise he had been on his feet for less than a minute when the door slid open facing the professor stood a woman wearing an expensively cut red skirt a white blouse and a red hat she carried a vuitton handbag in her left hand it took natterman several moments to realize that she also held a gun swallow stepped inside the room and closed the door ivd come for the spandau papers herr professor she said in a crisp low voice her british accent unmistakable would you be so kind as to get them for me i i dont have them natterman stammered stern has them swallow asked sharply stunned by her knowledge natterman said who are you swallows lips drew back exposing her small teeth in a fierce animal glare does jonas stern have the papers with a fools courage professor natterman grabbed for the walkietalkie on the table swallow destroyed it with a threeshot burst from her silenced ingrain machine pistol take off your clothes she ordered every stitch when natterman hesitated swallow jerked the ingrain in his direction do it while natterman pale and shaking removed his clothes swallow began searching the hotel room chapter thirty pn horn house tho northern transvaal deep in the basement complex of horn house alfred horn shepherded his libyan guests through a maze of stainless steel and glass and stone huge ventilator fans thrummed constantly forcing filtered air down from the surface one hundred meters above an intricate network of cooling ducts maintained the siliconfriendly environment required by the formidable array of computers purring against the walls the brittle air also extended the life of the manifold chemicals and weapons stored here the libyans surveyed the labyrinth of tubing hoods and pipes in reverent silence only young dr sabri the sovieteducated physicist found it hard to suppress his enthusiasm as he toured the lab most of the visible hardware had been produced by one or another of the various hightech subsidiaries of phoenix ag but the man who controlled them all was about to reveal a product of very different pedigree horn gradually led the libyans toward the rear of the basement where something resembling a giant industrial refrigerator stood gleaming in the fluorescent light stretching from floor to ceiling and wall to wall the aluminumcoated lead chamber awaited the men like a futuristic crypt three great doors without handles were set in its face pieter horn said softly the tall afrikaner stepped over to an electronic console and flipped a switch an alarm buzzer sounded briefly then with a sucking sound the center door opened a fraction of an inch a sickly orangeyellow light dribbled out of the crack smuts slipped a hand inside and pulled when the door opened completely the libyan physicist gasped go ahead doctor said horn have a look sabri looked shaken you dont store the weapon in halves its quite safe horn assured him the core has been temporarily removed the weapon can be disassembled with the tools beside it you may verify the soundness of the design at your leisure dr sabri stepped gingerly into the storage chamber and tiptoed around the weapon the bluntnosed cylinder stood menacingly on its tail fins like a blasphemous icon painted a gleaming black the bomb bore a single marking emblazoned on one of its fins a rising phoenix the birds head was turned in profile its sharp break screeching its single fierce eye wide its talons enjulfed by red flames sabris left hand caressed the cool metal of the bomb chassis like a womans thigh horn watched the libyans with thinly veiled curiosity prime minister jalloud stood well back from the vault his eyes on the physicist his interpreter did the same major karami stood rigid his black eyes fixed unwaveringly on the upended weapon where is the core he asked hoarsely the fissile material horn replied in this case plutonium lies in a lead vault below ourfeet we must see it im afraid you cant actually see it major not without more safeguards than are available in this room but you can see its effects horn waved his right hand smuts pressed another button on the console instantly a section of the metal floor to the left of the storage chamber whirred out of sight beneath it lay a leadlined vault conraining a wooden pallet stacked with orange fiftyfivegallon drums the plutonium is in those drums jalloud asked instinctively stepping back from the gaping vault theyre lined with concrete horn explained were perfectly safe for a short time anyway look while you can those drums contain enough plutonium to turn the state of israel into a smoking cinder while the arabs made approving noises smuts took a small metal box from a nearby shelf the box had a long cable dangling from it with some type of sensor on the end when horn explained that the machine was a portable radiation detector dr sabri came out of the chamber and followed smuts to the edge of the vault he watched the afrikaner lower the sensor until it hung just above the row of drums most modern radiation detectors emit no sound but smutss geiger counter began to crackle like an untuned radio dial all of the libyans but sabri drew back in terror while the interpreter held both hands protectively over his genitals the physicist leaned over to read the instrument major karami asked how can we be sure the drums contain plutonium horn shrugged i have no motive to deceive you have i asked you for any money you are a rich man kararni pointed out perhaps your only goal is to make our country look foolish in the eyes of the world in the eyes of the zionists silence ilyas prime minister jalloud commanded horn smiled knowingly my intentions regarding the jews are identical to your own major you can be sure of that karami looked skeptical he turned to dr sabri and spoke rapidly in arabic could not spent reactor fuel produce this reaction couldnt the instrument be tampered with to produce any desired reading already protective of his new toy sabri spoke defensively spent fuel alone would not produce the reaction you see major the drums contain plutonium you sound very sure of yourself for an inexperienced young man i am the most experienced man you will find in our country yes yes we know that prime minister jalloud said switching back to english why dont we close the vault now horn nodded smuts pressed the button that hydraulically moved the leadlined cover back into place angered by major karamis skepticism dr sabri returned to the bomb chamber in a few seconds he had the weapon open for inspection his eyes glinted like those of a boy over his first electric train major karami however looked far from satisfied i understand your skepticism major alfred horn said and under the circumstances perhaps you deserve more assurance of my motives than my word alone pieter smuts shifted uneasily if you gentlemen will join dr sabri horn went on i believe i can satisfy all doubts as to my motives regarding the jews major karami stepped quickly into the yellowlit chamber jalloud and his interpreter reluctantly followed him inside where they formed a respectful halfcircle around the bomb smuts leaned down and whispered into horns ear i dont think this is a good idea nonsense horn said he buzzed his wheelchair up to the door of the chamber the time for secrecy is past remove the decal pieter with a sigh of frustration the afrikaner flipped a wall switch flooding the storage chamber with fluorescent white light then he shouldered past the libyans and knelt beside the upended weapon taking a penknife from his pocket he unfolded a short blade and began to scrape lightly beneath the flames of the painted phoenix soon he had pried up a triangle of black polyurethane he put the knife back into his pocket then took the curled edge between his thumb and forefinger and pulled with a gentle steady pressure there was a soft adhesive ripping sound as the black decal tore away from the metal fin prime minister jalloud gasped allah protect us whispered the interpreter dr sabri stared in mute wonder but major karami smiled with wolfish glee for hidden beneath the black polyurethane decal was alfred horns true phoenix designa blood red planet earth clutched in the flaming talons of the phoenix and spanning the red globea curved black swastika karamis sigh of satisfaction told horn that his revelation had produced its desired effect horn smiled it will take the doctor a half hour at least to complete his inspection why dont wego upstairs and wait in more comfortable surroundings smuts will stay until he has finished an an excellent idea jalloud stammered jumah the interpreter stumbled out of the chamber his face ashen he and prime minister jalloud followed horns wheelchair to the elevator at the far end of the basement lab but major karami lingered behind at the elevator jalloud turned and watched him still only halfway to the elevator the stubborn major stood staring back down the length of the lab to the vault where sabriunder the watchful gaze of pieter smutstolled over his deadly prize horn called more questions major karami turned and walked toward the elevator what is behind the other two doors more bombs horns smile faded no i keep only one weapon here theyre too dangerous more dangerous than raw plutonium karami stepped into the elevator horn smiled thinly far more dangerous there is always the chance that some unscrupulous individual or nation might attempt to steal them the elevator closed with a hydraulic hiss im sure this house is well protected karami baited did you see any security on your way in horn asked gamely karamis eardrums registered a painful relief of pressure as the elevator rocketed toward the surface he had already noted the lack of security with great satisfaction no i didnt its there major smuts is the best in his field and what is his field herr horn personal security the old man smiled i believe the english term is asset protection translate karami commanded when the prime ministers interpreter obliged karami said ah was he a soldier then this smuts where did he train horn folded his spotted hands in his lap he served in the south african army as a young man but he has a varied background by the time i found him hed fought all over africa the elevator opened on the ground floor and who trained him in this asset protection as you call it karami asked the south african army i did horn said tersely rolling into the spacious reception hall i with all due respect karanii called who trained you horn sopped his wheelchair and whirled to face the libyan the german army he said quietly the arabs eyelids fell hooding the yellow sclera of his eyes more questions horn challenged fearin a dealbreaking dispute prime minister jalloud stepped between the two men the major has a great curiosity herr horn hes known as a zealous military historian in our country karami ignored him you must have fought in the second world war herr horn were you ss horn spat contemptuously on the marble floor i said the army major not himmlers lapdogs the wehrmacht was my home horn had taken all he intended to from this arrogant bedouin listen to me arab in the mufti of krusalem went to berlin to beg the fuhrers help in destroying the jews of palestine the fuhrer generously armed the arabshorn stabbed a finger t karamiyet still your fathers could not push the jews into the sea i hope you do better this time major karami shook with rage but horn simply turned his wheelchair away and whirred off down a long corridor jalloud shot karami an angry glance fool what are you trying to do just testing the old lions claws jalloud calm yourself calm myself the prime minister caught hold of karamis robe if you wreck this negotiation qaddafi will have your head on a spike and mine with it karami easily pulled his arm free if you had half the cunning of a rug peddler jalloud youd see that this old nazi needs us as much as we need him probably more karami reached out and laid his forefinger lightly on jailouds cheek when our business is done he vowed i will gut that old man forhis insult jalloud stared at karami with horror but the major only smiled hurry the interpreter whispered hes already around the corner let us go my friend karami said pleasantly well see what else our host has to offer us he started down the hall jalloud followed slowly he didnt know exactly what the secondincommand of the libyan peoples army had in mind but he knew already that he didnt like it he also knew that the fanatical impulsive dictator who still held the reins of power in tripoli would probably love it allah protect us he murmured hurrying after the receding figure of karami from ourselves if no one else ilse apfel opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling of her bedroom prison cell how did i get here she wondered as she lay there trying to gather her thoughts a key scratched in the door ilse sat up slowly her eyes on the knob it turned slowly then the door burst open robert stanton stood there wobbling with two crystal goblets in one hand and a bottle of cognac in the other the englishman smiled crookedly guten abend frdulein he bellowed while ilse stared he stepped in closed the door and propped himself haughtily against it get out of my room she said forcefully now now fraulein lets just relax and have a sip of something nice shall we ill scream ilse threatened though she knew it sounded ridiculous wonderfully solid house this stanton said grinning damned near soundproof i should think ilse summoned her coldest voice if you touch me herr horn will make you pay stanton raised an eyebrow the old goats taken quite a fancy to you its true but hes terribly busy just now hobnobbing with the great unwashed he doesnt have time for domestic squabbles so its up to us to have a good time while the business gets done stanton poured two brimming glasses of remy martin vsop spilling as much again on the floor the mention of the arabs brought the earlier meeting back in a rush business ilse echoed youre aware of what hes doing and you call it business arent you an englishman for gods sake the genuine article stanton said with a mock bow i told you my bloods nearly as blue as the queens then why dont you try to stop him stanton shrugged whats the point alfred stopped listening to me long ago although what he thinks he can get from those flearidden arabs i havent the slightest idea poppies i suppose very old hat he certainly cant sell them anythingtheyve got their own sources of supply in the trade havent they rather like trying to sell them oil what now come here and give us a kiss my god ilse whispered you dont even know what hes doing what hes selling stanton lurched forward sloshing cognac onto her blot i dont care if hes selling the bloody crown jewels love im well out of it now and darling you make quite a dish in those natty secretarys clothes makes one quite anxious to see what you look like out of them leering through a haze of alcohol stanton set the bottle on the bedside table drained his glass and smashed it against the door with a flourish ilse struggled to stay calm lord granville she said evenly youre drunk you dont know what youre don herr horn will have you killed if you do this dont you know that stanton laughed raucously thenhis face grew deadly serious i advise you to choose your allies with care he said wagging a finger in her face very soon dear alfred may no longer be in a position to have anyone killed ilse thought swiftly she was afraid but not in the way she had been on the xray table this babbling englishman was no pieter smuts all right then she said i suppose theres nothing i can do as stanton watched fascinated ilse lifted the bottle of rdmy martin and swigged from the mouth of the bottle she let some of the brandy dribble down her chin her eyes fixed on stantons lock the door she said i dont want to be interrupted with an astonished gape stanton turned around and lurched toward the door the halffull bottle of remy martin crashed against the base of his skull like a glass avalanche he staggered and fell to the floor ilse rifled his pockets and found the key hed used to enter her room praying he didnt have access to any others she flung the bedroom door wide dragged his unconscious body into the hall then jumped back into her room and slammed the door she tried to lock it with the key but it didnt seem to fit she cursed as the useless metal bent in the lock either shed taken the wrong key from stanton or the proper key only worked from the outside she thought of opening the door and searching him again but she had lost her nerve her entire body was shaking ilse lurched into the bathroom and locked it with the flimsy door latch please hurry hans she murmured god please hurry pm burgersparkhatel pretoria when hans apfel walked into the lobby of the burgerspark yosef shamir felt his heart thump with excitement hans looked neither left nor right as he walked but marched straight across to the elevators set in the far wall yosef lifted the walkietalkie that connected him to sterns room on the eighth floor apfel has arrived he said hes going for the elevators any sign of hauert asked gadi abrams no should i wait a pause no get up to nattermans room yosef scurried to a second elevator just as he stepped inside he glimpsed the broad back of a man wearing a dark business suit disappear through the fire stairs door i think hauers here he said as the elevator doors closed hes coming up the stairs acknowledged gadi replied get the professor ready to move dieter hauer crashed through the third floor fire door and hit the up elevator button the stairs were taking too long and if anything rough was going to happen in suite he didnt want to be too late or too exhausted to participate after a brief wait he darted into an empty elevator and punched the car whooshed up the remaining floors in seconds it took hauer a moment to get his bearings but within fifteen seconds he was knocking on the door of suite hans opened the door after scrutinizing him through the fisheye peephole see anyone hauer stepped into the suite no but i went through the lobby pretty fast the rooms empty hans informdd him do you think theyll call or send somebody up i think theyll call hauer glanced at his watch in one minute well know for sure gadi abrams adjusted the headphones he was wearing and looked up at jonas stern hauers inside he said stern nodded lets see if anyone shows up the unexpected ring of the telephone in the israelis room startled both gadi and stern gadi asked sharply who t sides our own men knows were here stern tightened his lips no one except maybe the kidnappers he lifted the receiver yes someones trying to hit us shouted a voice in hebrew the professors stark naked yosef stern said yosef whats happened where are you in the professors room just after we left natterman someone came in here looking for the papers a woman i used the phone because she blew the professors radio to pieces hes hysterical stern touched the bulge in his pocket where the three spandau pages lay yosef stay whore you are stay on the line telephone ringing in apfels room gadi said pressing the headphones to his ears yosef stern instructed wait five seconds then start calling suite make certain the professor is ready and keep trying until you get through yosef rang off hans jumped a foot off the bed when the ringing telephone fulfilled hauers prediction hauer glanced at his watch eight pm exactly hans darted between the beds and snatched up the receiver hello sergeant apfel said a male voice yes you know the voortrekker monument what wait yes the big brown thing i saw it as i drove into town be there tomorrow at ten am come alone ten am do you have that the voortrekker monument ten in the morning alone what about my wife will ilse be there you be there if youre not alone she dies the caller broke the connection hans dropped the receiver onto the floor face slack well said hauer what did they sayt hans stood silent for several seconds they want me to meet them tomorrow he said finally at the voortrekker monument hauer nodded excitedly thats a good place for us very public thats where ill lay out our terms for the exchange what time is the rendezvous a strange calm seemed to settle over hans his eyes seemed unfocusd he sat down hard on the bed what time hans hauer repeated softly his eyes straying to the door what time is the rendezvous hans looked up straight into his fathers eyes six he said in a robotic voice six pm at the voortrekker monument down the hall and around the corner gadi abrams shook his fist in triumph the rendezvous is at six he murmured at the voortrekker monument apfels off the line but i didnt hear him hang up gadi pressed the headphones to his dark head no phone ringing come on professor suddenly gadi jumped up and pulled off the headphones the professor cant get through apfel didnt hang up the phone stern forced himself to think clearly his wellplanned operation was unraveling around him snatching up the phone he tried to call yosef and the professor busy he said theyre still trying to reach hauer that means the stairs wont be covered aaron has to stay at the elevator box gadi said quickly youve got to keep trying to reach the professor that leaves me to cover the stairs the young commando picked up his uzi and started for the door he had not heard it open with the mute surprise of a man watching the earth split open at his feet gadi watched a small round fragmentation grenade rolling toward him through the foyer the door slammed shut grenade he shouted while sterna veteran of three desert wars and countless guerilla actionsover behind the far bed gadi abrams proved the boast he had made minutes before about the sayaret matkal commandos with the reflexes of a gifted soccer player he stopped the grenades forward motion with his right foot then kicked it sideways into the bathroom then he hurled himself backward into the space between the two double beds hauer was leaning out of the door down the hall straining his ears for the slightest sound when swallows grenade exploded in the bathroom of room donnerwetter he roared what the hell was that reaching back blindly hauer wrenched hans through the door stay with me he commanded and dont use your gun unless you absolutely have to hauer dragged hans toward the fire stairs away from the explosion they crashed through the metal door at speed careening headlong down concrete steps like teenaged hoodlums as they passed a large redpainted hauer caught hold of hanss jacketand pulled him against the wall he clapped a hand over hanss mouth and listened for any sound of pursuit at first he heard only their own ragged gasps then a slow creak as of someone attempting to silently open a disused fire door echoed through the stairwell when the crash came hauer knew that their pursuer had given up all hope of stealth he shoved hans downward and charged after him they took each flight in two leaps only lightly touching the rails as a guide on the thirdfloor landing hauer grabbed hans and growled a dozen words into his ear then slipped through the fire door while hans continued downward hauer drew his stolen waltherthen he recalled his warning to hans the explosion upstairs would draw all attention to the eighth floor if he fired the unsilenced walther here he would certainly draw some attention to himself with a curse of frustration he slipped the walther back into his pocket and waited four floors above him yosef shamir flung himself down the stairs like a man possessed from the moment hed gotten off the telephone with stern the young commando had been hauling his instincts stern had ordered him to stay put but from what natterman had told him yosef feared that the woman with the machine pistol was now on her way up to find stern leaving natterman to complete the call to the germans on his own yosef had raced upstairs to help gadi and stern he had reached the seventh floorwhen he heard the door just above him crash open he slipped quietly through the seventh floor door just in time to see hauer and hans rush past him down the stairs with a sudden sick feeling yosef realized he was probably the sole remaining link to sterns quarry the young israeli bounded down the fire stairs with no regard for safety his mind only on regaining contact with the germans when the steel edge of the fire door materialized in front of him like a phantom time slowed down yosef twisted his body to avoid the deadly obstacle but he simply couldnt move fast enough the door caught the side of his forehead opening a threeinch gash and dropping him like a stone on the landing hauer threw his weight against the thirdfloor fire door and forced yosefs unconscious body out of the way then knelt to examine him he didnt recognize the face but he hadnt expected to yosefs pockets were empty no wallet no coins no clue to his name or nationality even his clothes had no labels on impulse hauer took hold of yosefs head and lifted it to search for the tattooed eye a scream of agony rebounded up through the stairwell a mans scream then a pistol shot exploded jesus hauer cried he dropped yosefs head on the concrete and raced down the steps after hans as gadi abrams came to his knees and leveled his uzi at the smokefilled foyer the first spray of bullets from swallows ingrain tore into room gadi hit the floor and cursed in fury either the gunman was using a silencer or the grenade had blown out his eardrums beneath the far bed he saw stern speaking into his walkietalkie aaron this is jonas we are pinned down here please respond stern waited while gadi rose up and peppered the door with a burst from his silenced uzi aaron stern tried again please respond he cant hear you gadi shouted too much concrete between him and us weve got to storm our way out uncle were going to lose the germans otherwise its the only way the young commando leapt to his feet feeling a surge of adrenaline unlike any since the war in sinai jonas stern clutched his own uzi rose up and followed his shouting blasting nephewinto the smoke of battle hauer found hans on the garage landing standing silently over a corpse the body was blond and fairskinned and looked about thirtyfive its right hand gripped a pistol i told you not to use your gun i didnt hans shot back then hauer saw the knife the german knife from sporting goods store it was buried to the hilt in the d mans left side ill be damned he said he fell to his knees and searched the dead mans clothes he immediately found a british passportwhich he placed in his own pocketand a wallet from which he removed the money robbery was the most plausible option under the circumstances he glanced quickly behind the dead mans ears for the phoenix tattoo but saw no mark it took a considerable effort to dislodge hanss knife hauer wiped it clean on the corpses jacket then slipped the knife into his belt who is he hans murmured worry about it later lets go as hauer turned and grabbed the door handle he felt motion behind him he turned again then froze hans had snatched up the corpse by the collar and he was screaming screaming in german at the top of his lungs where is she gotidamn you where is my wife gadi and stern burst out of room o to find an empty hallway a strange cloying scent lingered in the air perfume who the hell was that gadi shouted the germans they must be in one of these rooms theyre gone stern called from the door of suite come on together they raced to the elevator as the doors slid shut stern tried again to reach aaron at the elevatorcontrol box aaron he cried forget the elevator try to stop the germans aaron in the concrete basement of the hotel aaron haber heard sterns crackling commands as aaron elevator stop the germans dutifully the young israeli threw the switch that stopped the elevator between the fourth and third floors when the car jolted to a stop stern and gadi stared at each other with ashen faces gadi punched the button to open the door but got no response he tried to pry the doors open with his uzi but they wowdnt budge whirling around in fury he saw no one stern had sat down on the floor of the elevator and leaned against the veneer wall his eyes closed chflds play he said softly isnt that what you said hauer wrenched the rented toyota over to the curb in front of a government sandstone office building he leavt out of the car ran to the left front wheel well and crouched down eight seconds later he was back beside hans holding a heavy paper packet covered with duct tape the packet held the spandau papers and the photos hauer had shot during the afternoon so much for the burgerspark hauer said were not going back to the protea hof either our passports are obviously blown hans rocked back and forth in the passenger seat that explosion sounded like a grenade said hauer who in hell could have thrown it the kidnappers we got out hans muttered thats all that matters we just have to stay alive until the rendezvous tomorrow we need cover said hauer this time we ignore our friendly cabbies advice though this time were going to a real fleabag somewhere we wont need any identification at all hans nodded how do we find that just like we would in berlin hauer let in the clutch and pulled onto princes park straat then turned southwest onto r he slowed at each intersection and peered down the side streets he knew what he wanted garish neon street people liquor advertisements the howl of bar music the universal siren song that draws the lonely and the bored and the hunted to the dark marrow of every city in the world from what hauer had learned already he suspected it would be easier to find such a place in johannesburg than in pretoria but he knew that anonymity could he had anywhere for a price with hans watching the streets fanning north he drove on pm horn house the northern transvaal alfred horn sat beneath the greenish glow of a bankers lamp in his dark study opposite him immersed in shadow pieter smuts awaited his questions theyre gone horn said quietly theyre gone comments smuts glowered from the shadows i dont like major karami i dont trust him i think it was a mistake to show him the plutonium it was a mistake to show him the phoenix mark horn laughed softly is there anyone you do trust pieter myself you no one else you must have a little faith in human greed pieter the arabs want the weapon too desperately to risk losing it through treachery now what of the cobalt case cant be done sir not in ten days horn let out a sigh of exasperation what about using a standard cobalt jacket smuts shrugged it would work but the libyans would reallize what they were dealing with theyd probably reive the jacket before the strike the only way we can fool them is by having the bomb case itself seeded with cobalt and our metallurgists are having serious problems we had ays getting the cobalt itself and the casting is far from pie its the rush sir if we could slow down a bit go back to the original plan out of the question horn snapped i may be dead in twenty days the british are coming for me im certain of that what will the bomb do without the cobalt to be honest sir the shortterm damage will be just as severe without it and with the prevailing winds in israel at is time of year a direct fortykiloton strike on tel aviv ay well take out most of the population of jerusalem with radiation alone horn nodded slowly muts reached out of the shadows and laid four videocases in the pool of light on horns desk there he said efully is the proof of libyan involvement with the ib i must ask again sir why trust the arabs at all my and i can place the weapon intel aviv ourselves and can use a standard cobalt jacket your original goal will be accomplished with half the risk and twice the likelihood of success horn shook his head not half the risk pieter you would be at risk i cannot allow that besides israeli intelligence is very good this must be a genuine arab attack only thatll bring about the outcome i want if the libyans fail you will get your chance but well speak of that no more for now tell me what of our german policeman i made the call myself sergeant apfel took it i think hauer might be with him but it doesnt matter one of my men is meeting apfel tomorrow morning at the voortrekker monument well kill hauer there if he shows up and well have both apfel and the papers here by tomorrow after noon horn toyed with his eyepatch and what has dear lord granville been up to smuts wrinkled his nose in disgust hes spoken to no one outside the house im monitoring all the phones to make sure hes got his eye on sergeant apfels wife though i can tell you that horns face hardened see that he makes no trouble for her ill see he makes no trouble for anyone ever again not yet pieter horn said gently were not sure of anything yet he asked me again if he could go up in the tower horn smiled wryly robert is a good boy pieter but hes mixed up we dont want him to know all ou we smuts snorted have you seen that runny nose i think hes using what hes selling the afrikaner drew a short doubleedged dagger from his belt and light i tell you one false step and ill cut his balls off and feed them to him with parsley horn cackled softly gute nacht pieter smuts stood and sheathed his knife good night sir as the afrikaner passed ilses bedroom he listened at the door he heard nothing had the hall light been on he might have noticed the dark bloodstains on the carpet but it wasnt and he didnt he moved on he had a treat waiting in his room a village girl from giyania virgin if the headman could be believedno more than thirteen and black as coal dust alfred horns aryan princess could sleep the night in peace smuts knew what he liked kajftr girl with the smell of coal smoke still on her when he first came into the bedroom he liked to ask if theyd brought their passes with them sometime ones were so scared they broke down and cried good way to set the tone for the evening chapter thirtyone a m jan smuts airport johanneburg the southafrican airways landed with the dawn asthejettaxieduptothetenninalkripodetectivejulius schneider collected his flight bag from the overhead compartment and prepared to deplane as quickly as possible twelve hours was too long to sit in a seat booked for a dead man schneider edged his bulk into the crush of honeymooners biggame hunters and businessmen jamming the aisle all the while wishing that colonel rose could have managed to get him a military flight he took a deep breath when he finally made it out of the aircraft the anxious passengers and the south african summer heat had combined to produce a singularly unpleasant closeness even at dawn what a change he muttered thinking of the snowdrifts hed left behind at frankfurt he slung his flight bag over his shoulder and headed for customs standing in the long queue schneider looked impatiently at his watch he wanted to get to a telephone as soon as he could if he was lucky he thought he might trace hauers and apfels false passports to a hotel before they got moving for the day he wondered what hauer was doing now schneider did not know hauer personally buthe knew his reputation he figured a lone wolf like hauer would keep an open mind long enough to listen to his arguments about phoenix schneider didnt give a damn about the spandau papers all of roses ranting about them meant little what schneider wanted was to sever all contact between wilhelm funks neonazi fanatics in west berlin and their stasi counterparts in the east and then to drive both phoenix groups back into the dark hole from which they had sprung his instincts told him dieter hauer was the man to help him do that before he contacted hauer however he inten out the local russian situation because no kosov was telling colonel rose the kgb would be here in south africaprobably at the he o p chasing the spandau papers schneider wondered where they would be based the south african government allowed no soviet embassies on its soil he had checked thus the kgb had no legal residency from which to conduct operatioms that complicated things in fact it made him downright nervous and the more he thought about it the surer he became that he would be making a mistake if he talked to hauer before he knew exactly where the russians were he would not have to look far yuri borodin stood four places behind schneider in the sweltering heat the twelfth department agent had easily stayed clear of the german during the flight from frankfurt borodin traveled first class and he had spent the entire flight in the secondstory lounge of the he laughed as detective schneider lumbered through the customs comparing his own spare frame to the germans he saw a mental image of a sleek jaguar following a double decker bus it did not occur to him what was likely to happen if the jaguar hit the bus headon a m bronberrick motel south of pretoria hauer closed the door to the danksmelling motel leaned against a battered veneer desk after much searchinglast night he and hans had finally taken this ratho the n motorway ten miles south of the capital hans sat sullenly on a twin bed fanninl himself with hed found in the mildewed bathroom his knife jammed into his belt his walther lay a few inches from his right hand i found another car said hauer his face slick with sweat a ford from a small firm just what we wanted i dumped the toyota in an underground garage good hans replied without looking up i really think it would be safer if you came along hauer pressed you dont need me to help you calibrate the scope and im not taking any chances on missing the rendezvous but youre not going to the rendezvous hauer said pocketing the keys didnt you realize that this rendezvous is where i use our leverage to turn the tables on the kidnappers if you show up phoenix will assume you have the papers with you theyll simply kidnap you then kill you im going to the voortrekker alone youll keep the papers safe here hans nodded slowly i see but im still not going with you now anything could happen out there you could kill us just by forgetting to drive on the left side of the road where would we be then hauer nodded pensively all right but dont leave this room for anything understand ill be back in three or four hours after i zeroin the scope im going to scout for an exchange location i saw a stadium on the map that looks good ill be back long before six hans forced a smile ill be waiting fasten the chain behind me hans stood to see him out and for gods sake get some sleep would you hauer said ilse wouldnt even recognize you like this as soon as he heard hauers car pull away hans picked up the telephone this is room sixteen he told the desk clerk his voice edgy call me a taxi bitte of course i can pay for it he slammed down the phone and trudged over to the lav the mirror was cracked in a starburst pattern causing reflection to stare back at him like jumbled pieces of a hauer was right he looked as bad as he felt bllodshot eyes sallow cheeks dirty blond hair sticking out in all directions if he didnt sleep soon he would collapse where he stood all night he had lain awake in the stifling heat listening to hauers steady snoring fighting the solitary hours of his imagination from the moment he had learned the spandau diary was incomplete his fears had been working in him tapping in the back of his brain like a dull pick hammer hans turned the cold tap wet a washrag and brought it to his stubbled face the water felt good but it didnt improve his appearance he stuck his head under the tap and soaked his hair then smoothed it as best he could he hadnt planned to lie to hauer about the rendezvous time but when he heard the cold voice on the telephone the driver rolled his eyes and jerked his thumb toward the backseat hans climbed in and the cab screeched away phone last night in the burgerspark suite some deep part him had simply overridden his conscious will he believem the voortrekker monument sits atop a hill miles in hauers abilities if anyone could save ilse by using lo his father could but what if no one could hans had seen miraculous rescues during his short tenure with the police department but he had seen other cases too and the harder he tried to shut those cases out the clearer they becam in his mind throughout the night vaigue images had turned to sean nightmares the dead blond girl from the havel fished out of the muck by a grappling hook two days after the safe police rescue operation anonymous berliners had died by gunfire by stab wounds other ways et weisss gouged and bloody chest he thought of the from the havel the police had used the ransom as bait they always did a halfmillion deutschemarks in ashb the kidnappers had managed to withhold the girl just long enough to escape for hans the lesson was clear no plan was failsafe and no matter how deeply he believed hauers commitment he could not risk seeing ilse pulled from that river or one like it who could predict how d kidnappers would react when hauer tried to turn their operation back against them rational men would probab make a deal but rational men did not tattoo eyes on the scalps or gouge religious symbols into the chests of jews at the veneer desk hans scribbled a note to hauer on the back of a promotional flyer then he picked from the bed and laid it on top of the note the ring of the telephone startled him growled the desk clerk hans took a long last look at his pistol but could not take it where he was going he rea the mildewed mattress and withdre the sp which he had stolen while hauer showered he into his shirt beside the knife he had taped to he stepped out into the glaring sun a blue m idling in the parking lot he walked over to the dow you know the voortrekker monument he english south of central pretoria visible from most parts of the city this duncolored building is the spiritual symbol of the afrikaner nation its domed hall of heroes holds a huge frieze commemorating the great trek of the boer pioneers who fled northward from british colonial rule in hans caught a glimpse of the massive dome as his driver exited the n freeway then swung back under and headed west imb ing the monument hill he realized he would be ten minutes early for his rendezvous min he paid off the cab then moved as instructed to a spot dimctly beneath the frieze in the hall of heroes and studied it like a muslim who has finally reached mecca the tourists shuffling around him were mostly afrikaners with his classic german looks hans thought he probably looked as afrikaner as the rest he was wrong feeling a tap on his shoulder he whirled to see a bantu man of medium heighta zulu actually but hans knew nothing of such distinctionswith a large camera bag slung over his shoulder hans failed to notice the irony of a blackman visiting the monument that memorialized the conquest of his native country the zulu never once glanced up at the frieze he hurried out of the building and down the slope hans scrambling after him a shining blue range rover waited at the base of the hill the zulu indicated that hans should get into the rear seat hans climbed in you have the papers askedthe zulu in broken german hans nodded are you taking me to my wife without a word the zulu started the engine and drove down the hill then swung the range rover onto r and beaded into central pretoria he drove until they intersected the n freeway then climbed into the northbound traffic hans looked blankly out the window as the suburbs gave way to gaudy storefronts liquor stores and finally the government matchboxes of black settlements outside the city hans fingered the knife beneath his shirt the thought of what the kidnappers might do if they realized the diary was incomplete made his bowels squirm but what choice did he have at least by acceding to their demands he had gained a chance to try to explain the missing pages in the middle of some football stadium with a dozen guns sighted on ilse and himself anything could happen suddenly hans felt his throat tighten though he had been ng straight at the back of the zulus head his conscious d had only now registered what his eyes were seeing behind the zulus right earin plain sightwas the ominous design sketched in the spandau papers the eyethe mark of phoenix yet unlike funks men this tribesman wore no tattoo the eye had been branded onto his scalp with a redhot iron the ugly whitishpink keloid scar chilled hanss blood he tared hypnotized by the mark what did it really symbolize follow the eye the spandau papers had charged yet it seemed to hans that the eye was following him how how far do we have to go he stammered trying to keep his anxiety in check the zulu said nothing hans touched the haft of the knife in his shirt obviously the black man didnt intend to reveal anything about the upcoming rendezvous hans forced his eyes away from the scar and concentrated on the road the shimmering highway stretched in a seemingly endless line across the veld toward a destination hans could only pray would reunite him with ilse if the kidnappers were as hard as the land they now passed over he thought their chances of getting out alive were small he caught himself wondering if he should have told hauer the truth about the rendezvous after all maybe hauer could have pulled off the exchange maybe too late now he muttered bine the zulu said sharply vichts hans snapped he tried not to stare at the branded eye as the range rover droned on am horn house the northern transvaal linah had set out a fine brunch in the enclosed garden near the southwest turret of the estate subtropical fruit trees splashed blossoms of color against the high stone walls alfred horn and his security chief sat together drinking coffee and speaking quietly and what of captain hauer the old man asked smuts shrugged i had four men at the voortrekker to kill him but he never showed up could he be following sergeant apfel smuts shook his head he might try but my driver will know if he does well have no problems from hauer horn nodded how long do you expect it will be before we hear something from the arabs three days a week ive already heard horn said casually and took a sip of his coffee qaddafl himself called me an hour ago he has accepted our terms what did i tell you pieter if you want a job done quickly hire a hungry man prime minister jalloud will return tomorrow night with men to transport the weapon tomorrow night smuts exclaimed i had no idea it would be that soon two hours ago i sent half my men back to thentine horn smiled that was a little premature pieter but i shouldnt worry there will be no problems with the libyans and if there were i am confident that youcould protect us from that you have had years to prepare year defenses smuts looked uncertain did qaddafl mention major k smuts nodded suspiciously karami is planning some kind of doublecross im certain of it id better make additional security arrangements horn smiled cagily you might want to make some arrangements before tonight pieter i have the feeling we may need a few extra men smuts squinted curiously at his master but before he could ask for clarification lieutenant jiirgen lahr opened a sliding glass door and marched toward the table horn eyed the tall german suspiciously but smuts waved a greeting guten morgen herr oberleutiiant guten morgen luhr replied clicking his heels together smartly he inclined his head first to horn then smuts sit smuts commanded just a moment horn interjected show me your mark herr oberleutnant instantly luhr moved to the old mans wheelchair and leaned down so that horn could inspect the tiny tattoo behind his ear horn actually licked his finger and rubbed the mark to make sure it was indelible when he was satisfied he gave luhr permission to sit down danke said luhr taking a chair and sitting ramrod straight horn stared at luhr some time before speaking his one flickering eye lingered on the blond hair the hard blue eyes the trim figure and classical features he nodded slowly the young policeman had sparked something in his memory has your stay in our cell taught you some respect for orders luhr had prepared for this sir i drugged frau apfel only for her welfare i assure you she struggled so hard against her bonds that i feared she might injure herself horns single eye glazed like a chip of ice there is no excuse for insubordination a man who disobeys orders is a threat to everyone around him luhr wiped a sheen of perspiration from his forehead but horn went on in a softer tone my security chief seems to think i should give you a second chance he speaks highly of your work in berlin luhr raised his chin proudly frau apfel will be joining us soon herr oberleutnant when she arrives at table you will issue an immediate apology then the matter will be closed clear absolutely luhr said solemnly he had never balked at licking the proper pair of boots while linah poured coffee for luhr the sound of someone talking softly drifted around the corner of the house shortly lord granville appeared wearing dark sunglasses and muttering to himself a huge white square of gauze was taped high on the left side of his head but it did little to conceal the massive purple bruise that extended from behind his ear to his left eye my god smuts exclaimed as the englishman wobbled to the table what have you done now robert horn asked wearily got pissed again literally took a fall in the loo last night that would have killed a bloody wildebeest didnt break the skin though thank god id have bled to death on the spot he pulled a silver flask from his pocket and poured two jiggers of brandy into his coffee king and country he toasted and drained the mixture smuts glared such conduct by anyone else in the old mans presence would be unthinkable yet stanton made it rule robert horn said when will our next payment from the colombians arrive stanton tried in vain to mask his surprise at this question what oh its coming in by ship next week remember brazilian gold this time supposedly its never even seen the inside of a bank horn leaned his head back and smiled his good eye looked past stanton and settled on a fragrant eucalyptus tree and how will our gold get from this mysterious ship to here by helicopter the englishman said frowning now i told you that yesterday pieter smuts looked quizzically at his master yes horn said yes thats right you did everyone looked up at the sound of the garden gate ilse stood there her blond hair uncombed her eyes swollen from lack of sleep guten morgen horn called please join us ilse edged toward the table her wary eyes on stanton with an effort that stunned all present alfred horn struggled from his wheelchair and stood until ifse had seated herself in the wroughtiron chair smuts offered her jiirgen luhr rose immediately to deliver the apology demanded by horn but before he could speak lord granville slid his chair away from the table if the company will excuse me he mumbled my apologies while everyone stared stanton rose and left the garden by way of a glass door leading into the main house inside horn house stanton hurried to alfred horns study and i locked the door he felt surprisingly calm considering what he was about to do he lifted the telephone receiver and dialed a london number that he had committed to memory shaw growled a tired voice this is granville where are you sir neville shaw asked sharply where do you think good christ are you mad shut up and listen stanton snapped feeling his pulse start to race i had to call from here they wont let me go anywhere else look youve got to call it off what he knows im telling you horn knows about casilda i dont know how but he does he cant know he does there was a long pause theres no stopping it now shaw said finally and your information on horns defenses had better turn out to begood granville or youll answer to me dont call again the line went dead stanton felt sweat running down the small of his back the die was cast somewhere off the coast of mozambique a man named burton waited to change his life forever perhaps alfred was merely toying with me stanton thought hopefully smuts had evinced no more suspicion than was usual yet stanton had but one choice in any casehold firm if he could do that for eight hours horns days of power would end and he would be free london would be satisfied and one of the largest conglomerates in the world would become the property of robert stanton lord granville in fact as well as in name for a brief moment stanton worried that ilse might betray his advances of last night but he dismissed the thought if she had intended to do that she would have done it already unlocking the study door he set out for the garden in better spirits than he had been in for some time all he had to do now was find a way into the basement complex before the attack came he had never entered it before but he would today he could hardly wait am mv casilda madagascar channel off mozambique the laden helicopters lifted off the deck of the ship like pregnant birds but they lifted juan diaz the pilot of the lead chopper looked over to see that his compadre flying the second ship had taken off safely he had diaz turned to the tanned englishman sitting in the seat beside him theyre up english where we going alan burton tossed a folded sheet of paper into the cubans lap a mineral suey map of southern africa fl stop mozambique he said just follow the lines on the map sport burton turned and looked back at the two rows of colombians who sat shouldertoshoulder against the cabin walls of the jetranger with their dark faces scruffy beards and bandolier ammunition belts they looked like armed migrant workers sick ones at that the greenish cast of their skin suggested that by leaving the ship they would merely exchange their seasickness for airsickness burton didnt care what they looked like as long as they could cause some commotion he could do the job alone if someone provided a sufficient diversion he was glad the end of the mission had finally arrived not least because they were finally leaving the casilda he didnt care if he never saw another ship in his life im supposed to fly by these goddamn chicken scratches juan diaz complained shaking the map in the englishmans face burton gave the cuban a black lookthats what youre being paid for sport now lets move what about a flight plan diaz asked the two choppers still hovered over the old freighter youre holding it said burton i can show you the landmarks just watch for enemy aircraft the cuban narrowed his eyes how do i know who is the enemy burton grinned its everybody sport simple enough after a grim moment of reflection diaz nudged the stick and as one the two jetrangers moved out over the ocean toward the coastline toward africa am room the stanley house pretoria gadi abrams let the drapes fall closed and turned back to stern still no sign of them uncle no hauer no apfel stern got up from one of the beds and rolled his shoulders he had said little since last nights fiasco at the burgerspark hotel theyre probably holed up in some cheap hotel waiting for the rendezvous at the voortrekker monument professor natterman was pacing out the far end of the room so why are we watching the protea hof he snapped we can always intercept them at six at the voortrekker monument stern replied but i think hauer might return to the protea hof before then natterman snorted with contempt what about that woman he asked are you sure it was the same woman from the plane absolutely gadi said from the description you gave and the perfume i smelled in the hall i have no doubt at all who is she then natterman asked what does she want she wants me said stern what makes you say that gadi broke in nobody knows where you are stern halfsmiled who wants you dead professor natterman asked who doesnt said gadi the syrians want him the libyans the palestinians you name it thats why he has to live where he does stern shot his nephew a warning glance then his face softened i suppose it doesnt matter he said remember the kibbutz i described to you professor my retirement home well its no ordinary kibbutz how do you mean its a special settlement for men like me retired fieldmen men who have prices on their heads gadi grinned uncle jonass head carries the highest price in town stern frowned but gadi said the woman on the plane was european said natterman not arabic precisely said stern and of the european countries only one has agents who might want me dead england natterman asked his eyes alight stern ran his hand across his chin i know who the englishwoman is her name is swallow or it was many years ago but right now she concerns me much less than the big fellow who checked in here this morning i say hes a friend of hauers gadi declared backup from watching hauers room hes right beneath us by the though i dont think he knows it why do you insist hes german stern challenged dont give me that uncle a jew can smell a german cant he no offense professor none taken a german can smell a jew just as well gadi glared at natterman his names schneider which is german enough well know what he is for sure in an hour in any case tel aviv is checking him out by the way they told me hauer was one of the sharpshooters at the munich olympics how did you know that stern halfsmiled i had one of my notorious intuitions when i read his police file we might be able to use that somehow could this schneider be part of phoenix asked yosef shamir the young commando wore a large white bandage around his forehead maybe he threw the grenade last night maybe he was the one who hit me with the door that was hauer stern said firmly who fired the gunshot asked yosef i was only semiconscious in that stairwell but im certain i heard a shot nothing about it in this mornings newspapers gadi said there was no body in the stairwell if our german cops shot at someone they must have missed stern smiled i think it went this way swallows grenade panicked the germans they fled down the stairs apfel in front they ran into trouble apfel panicked and fired his gun i read hauers police file if hed fired his gun he wouldnt have missed ill keep that in mind when we meet him gadi said soberly youre not going to meet him natterman flared hes given you all the slip stern padded slowly over to the hotel window hauer is coming back to the protea hof he declared parting the drapes and staring across at the sevenstory hotel i dont know how i know it but i do one floor below the israelis kripo detective julius schneider held the telephone against his sweating cheek as he sat on the edge of the bed beside him lay his hat half a sandwich and two empty bottles of beer into his ear came the angry drawl of colonel godfrey rose you too proud to take a tip from a russian schneider no colonel kosov gave me the name of the son of a bitch who mutilated harry i think he suspected it all along hes a russian too you believe that names borodin yuri borodin twelfth department kgb according to kosov hes a real hotshot renegade out for glory that type i guess thats what kosov meant about you watching your back schneider made a sound in his throat that was halfway between a growl and a sigh so borodin could have seen me leaving major richardsons apartment he could be following me now could be schneider have you located hauer and apfel yet im watching their hotel room now they arent in it though hmm you decided how youre gonna handle hauer you gonna try to take the papers i dont know yet hauer may have better ideas than i do about crushing phoenix rose was silent for a moment yeah well the russians are getting pretty itchy about phoenix themselves kosov heard that a lowranking stasi agent cracked under torture this morning seems hes a member of something called bruderschaft der phoenix the russians are already talking to the state department about setting up a special interallied commission to deal with the rudolf hess case phoenix and all related affairs sort of an international warren commission a what colonel never mind schneider there was a sibilant rustle of paper in the background you want a quick rundown on yuri borodins file reads like the friggin count of monte cristo please got a pencil the german heaved his bulk back on the bed and closed his eyes im ready pm bronberrick motel south of pretoria the moment hauer saw the note he knew that hans had tricked him he knocked hanss abandoned walther aside and read swiftly im sorry captain ive thought it through and i feel the risks of an armed exchange are just too great i couldnt tell you before but ilse is carrying a child i didnt want to lie about the time of the rendezvous but i knew youd never let me try it this way please dontfollow me ill meet you back here when ive got ilse here the name hans had been signed then scratched through if it goes bad i want you to know i dont blame you for anything in the past we found each other in time your son hans hauer stood rock still as waves of anger and panic swept over him he dug the foil packet from his pocket and ripped it open the negatives he had taken at the protea hof were there but the spandau papers were gone intheir place lay five sheets of crumpled motel stationery hauer tried to breathe calmly hans had struck out on his own to meet the kidnappers he had to accept that it wasnt hard to understand not if the hostage was your wife and she was carrying your child yet hans was his son ilse was his daughterinlaw and the child she was carryinghauer felt a thick lump in his throatthat child was his grandchildhis blood their hauer sat down hard on the bed for the last twenty years he had lived alone resigned to a solitary life yet in the past fortyeight hours he had been given not only a son but a family and now he had lost that family he read the note again your son hans fool he muttered it took him twenty minutes to reach the voortrekker monument all the way he cursed himself for leaving hans alone he had known something like this might happen that hans had been walking an emotional razor edge this morning while zeroingin his rifle scope he had almost packed up the gun and driven straight back to the motel but he hadnt he had finished with the rifle then gone ahead and scouted for an exchange location and hed found one an empty soccer stadium perfect damn hauer saw no sign of hans at the voortrekker monument for an hour he circled the base of the duncolored building on foot but he knew it was hopeless hans was gonemaybe dead already faced with this heartnumbing reality hauer realized he had but one slim chance to save his sons life when the kidnappers realized that the spandau papers were incomplete they would demand answers and when they got them they mightjust might come looking for captain dieter hauer he would make it very easy for them to find him in the ford again he checked his map then he swung east and headed back toward the protea hof hotel he pulled straight up to the mainentrance removed a long leather case from the fords trunk and tipped the doorman to park the car the hunting rifle felt heavy but reassuring against his leg as he strode toward the elevators in a european city the oddly shaped case might have attracted unwelcome attention but in south africa rifles are as common golf clubs their room looked just as theyd left it yesterday in a shaft of light leaking through the drawn drapes hauer saw the clothes and food they had bought still lyfng in crumpled shopping bags on the beds hanss loaded crossbow leaned in the corner space between the near bed and the bathroom wall hauer laid his rifle on the bed then he felt the hairs on his neck stiffen there was someone else in the room he turned very naturally as if unaware of any danger there sitting in the chair by the window a thin shadow silhouetted against the dark drapes hauer jerked his walther from his waistband and dived behind the bed pulling back the slide as he hit the carpet dont be alarmed captain said a deep familiar voice its only me i managed to get here in spite of you hauer thrust his pistol over the top of the mattress put two pounds of pressure on the trigger then slowly lifted his eyes above the edge of the bed sitting in a nanow shaft of light coming through the drapes was professor georg natterman chapter thirtytwo pm the northern transvaal one mile northeast of the village of giyani the zulu pulled the range rover onto the gravel shoulder and climbed out ie hans stayed put the zulu shielded his eyes and stared back own the long highway lean as an impala he looked as if ne were scanning the veld for game herds whenever a car or truck whizzed past he stared into the vehicle as if searching for someone he knew hans was getting angry they had been on the road for hours and they had stopped like this twice before after a quick glance at the zulu hans climbed out of the rover on the shoulder side and looked around back toward pretoria the sun burned down relentlessly shimmering like a layer of oil just above the road to the north however hans saw a vast wall of slate gray clouds beneath the leaden ceiling sheets of rain rolled south toward the rover seeming to qm the night behind in the zulu commanded scampering back into the drivers seat when hans climbed into the backseat he found a thin black arm dangling a long black cloth before his eyes no he said the zulu dropped the blindfold in hanss lap and turned back to the windshield his posture told hans that unless he obeyed the vehicle would not move one inch further toward his wife hans cursed and tied the scarf around his eyes now he muttered move your ass the next thirty minutes felt like a gforce test the zulu swung off of the road immediately and the bonecrashing ride that followed would have totaled a vehicle less sturdy than the range rover hans peeked around the blindfold when he could trying to maintain some rough idea of their progress but taking accurate directional bearings was impossible by the time they finally leveled out his head had taken several vicious knocks and thezulus goal of disorienting him had been well and truly achieved the road surface felt like rock scrabble now but that didnt help hans all he could do was press himself into the rear seat and wait for journeys end thirty minutes later the rover stopped and the zulu ordered him out when hanss feet hit the ground the zulu pushed him against the side of the vehicle and searched him he immediately discovered the knife taped to hanss ribs and ripped it away from the skin he told hans to wait when hans heard receding footsteps he pulled off the blindfold he stood before an enormous building unlike any he had ever seen before he could examine it in any detail however a great teak door opened and a tall blond man stepped out his welltanned arm extended in greeting sergeant apfel he said im pieter smuts i hope the ride wasnt too rough come inside and well see about getting you more comfortable my wife hans said awkwardly holding his ground ive come for my wife of course but inside please everything in good time hans followed the afrikaner into a majestic reception hall and down a long corridorin a culdesac full of shadows they stopped beside two doors smuts turned to him the spandau papers he said softly not until i see my wife hans retorted raising himself to his full heightwhich was about eye level with the afrikaner first things first sergeant that was our agreement when we are satisfied that no copiesexist you will be reunited with your wife hans made no move to comply a brittle edge crept into the afrikaners voice do you intend to break our agreement hans held his breath struggling to cling to the illusion that he had entered horn house with bargaining power it was now painfully clear that he had not he had probably made the worst mistake of his life by coming here he had gone against the advice of the one man who might have been able to help him and now ilse would pay the price for his stupidity smuts saw hanss pain as clearly as if he had burst into tears he opened a door and motioned for hans to enter the small bedroom beyond the papers he repeated like a zombie hans withdrew the tightly folded pages smuts did not even look at them he slipped the wad into his pants like pocket change then nodded curtly ill be back soon he said get some rest but my wife hans cried youve got to take me to her ive done everything you asked not quite everything smuts admonished but enough i think he closed the door solicitously like a welltipped bellman wait hans shouted but the afrikaners footsteps faded into silence hans tried the door but it was locked its out of my hands now he thought hopelessly is that what i wanted all along he wondered how long the procedure to detect photocopying would take he was still wondering that when the countless hours without sleep finally overpowered him he collapsed onto the small bed his mouth moving silently as exhaustion shut down his frazzled brain for the first time since childhood hans apfel fell asleep with a prayer on his lips when the afrikaner jerked him awake ten minutes later hans knew that his desperate gamble had failed smutss eyes burned with feral fire and though he spoke even more quiedy than before violence crackled through his every syllable like static electricity you have made a grave mistake sergeant i will ask you only once your wifes life depends upon your answer where are the three missing pages hans felt as if he had suddenly been sucked high into the stratosphere his ears seemed to stop up he couldnt breathe ii dont understand he said stupidly smuts turned and reached for the doorknob wait hans cried its not my fault i dont have the other pages dieter hauer has them smuts said in a flat voice doesnt he hans gulped in surprise who he asked lamely polizei captain dieter hauer smuts roared the man who helped you escape from berlin what kind of game is the fool hying to play where is he now hans felt suddenly faint phoenix knew everything they had known from the beginning hauer doesnt have the pages i i he said i swear it the pages were stolen in germany smuts grabbed him by the sleeve and jerked him across the room toward the window hans was amazed by the strength in the wiry arm pulling back the curtains smuts waved his arm back and forth across the pane satisfied with what he saw he motioned for hans to step forward puzzled hans put his face to the glass when he saw what waited beyond every muscle in his exhausted body went rigid thirty meters from the window ilse apfel stood facing the house her hands were bound with wire affixed to the wire was a long chain held at the other end by hans zulu driver at the zulus feet lay an old black tire beside him stood lieutenant jiirgen luhr of the west berlin police luhr wore civilian clothes but his tall black boots gleamed in the sun seeing hans in the window luhr smiled and pressed a walther pi against ilses left temple smuts caught hans in a bear hug and held him still ilse hans shouted ilse moved her head slightly as if she had sensed the sound but could not locate its source when luhr jabbed the pistol barrel into her ear hans jumped as if the gun had struck his own head he sucked in a rush of air to shout again but smuts cut him off scream again sergeant and she dies i presume you know that man out there hans had only spoken to jiirgen luhr in person once but he would never forget it luhr had called him in for the polygraph session at abschnitt the call that had started all the madness luhr was the man who had gouged the star of david into erhard weisss chest his presence here five thousand miles from germany compounded hanss sense of dislocation smuts released hans step back from the window he commanded hans didnt move step back when hans refused smuts gave another hand signal the zulu handed the leash chain to luhr then reached down an lifted the tire high into the air as it hung suspended like a black halo over ilses head amber liquid sloshed out of it onto her hair with a sadistic grin the zulu jerked the tire savagely down around ilses torso pinning her arms to her sides smuts spoke from behind hans are you familiar with the necklace sergeant its a local native specialty they fill an old tire with gasoline pin the victims arms to his sides with the tirethus the term necklacethen they set the gasoline afire the results are quite ghastly even to a man of my wide experience a human torch running about blind with rage hans hurled himself backward and hammered his elbow into smutss chest then he whirled lowered his head like a bull and drove the afrikaner back toward the heavy door the sudden attack startled smuts but as the afrikaner backpedaled toward the wood he bucked his knee into hanss ribsan upward blow so sharp and quick that hans did not even realize what had hit him he went down gasping when he looked up smuts was standing across the room arms folded glaring at him let her go hans begged what has she done to you where is captain hauer sergeant hans staggered to his feet and went to the window ilses face had taken on an ashen pallor she had recognized the smell of gasoline and with it the terrible danger she swayed slightly on her feet luhr jabbed his pistol at her behind hans smuts lifted his hand yet again grinning luhr reached into his pocket withdrew a cigarette lighter and flicked it alight he held the flame less than a meter from ilse his arm stretched to its limit in case the gasoline vapor should accidentally ignite dont make me do it sergeant smuts said into hanss ear why give lieutenant luhr the enjoyment at your expense you fucking animal hauers at the hotel which hotel the bronberrick motel now let her go smuts raised his hand once more and luhr his face red with anger and disappointment snapped his cigarette lighter hut the zulu shoved roughly down on the tire until it lropped at ilses feet then he led her away like a dying chicken lets go sergeant said smuts pulling hans toward the door youve got a telephone call to make pm room the protea hot hotel i ought to shoot you hauer growled you senile idiot steady captain professor natterman urged i told you i meant to get here one way or another hauers mind reeled how could he have been so stupid as to leave natterman holding a shotgun on the forger in wolfsburg the professor had probably gotten the false passport names before he and hans had driven a mile from the cabin are you alone hauer asked sharply nattermans eyes flicked to the door please dont overreact captain i was in no position to get here on my own who is with you another old man like me hes a jew hauer whirled around toward the foyer and covered the door with his pistol where is he is hans with you natterman asked where is this jew hauers question was answered by a deep unfamiliar voice i am standing alone in the washroom it said hauer dived into the space between the bed and the bathroom wall clutching his walther to his chest im unarmed captain said the voice shut up stay where you are hauer jabbed his pistol at the professor you too damn you dont move natterman snorted youre being ridiculous captain herr stern is harmless you couldnt stay away could you hauer thought furiously for several seconds all right he called finally you in the toiletwalk out slowly with your hands over your head i wont hesitate to shoot can i put on the light no hauer lay prone in thespace between the beds with only his head and his gun hand exposed when the tall silhouette appeared in the dim foyer hauer trained his walther on the mans head start talking he growled and keep your hands up my name is jonas stern said the tall shadow i assure you that i mean you no hartn captain i suspect that my interest in this case is similar to your own and i would like to discuss it with you who do you work for for myself but to give you a frame of reference my native country is israel stern paused may i switch on the light now the bathroom light thats enough to talk by fluorescent light flickered from the small cubicle the fixture buzzed softly stern stood squarely in the pool of light so that hauer would feel at ease but hauer kept his walther trained on him anyway as the silhouette took on human features hauer noted the tanned angular face with its quick piercing eyes captain hauer said stern would you mind telling me where sergeant apfel is now id rather find out how you arrived on my doorstep sterns eyes met hauers with steady assurance frankly that would be a waste of time suffice to say that i have been involved in this situation since the first night at spandau im sure the most important detail from your perspective is that i have the three missing spandau pages in my possession hauer felt his heart stutter so youre the one you slashed that afrikaners throat like a suckling pig you still havent explained your interest in this matter stern sighed were all concerned for the girl captain lets have that said but i suspect that your interest like mine runs a bit deeper than simple kidnapping to the safety and future of germany perhaps hauer waited i am a jew captain an israeli i believe that the men who want these spandau papers pose a very serious threat to my country they may pose a different but equally perilous danger to democratic germany i have come to root these men out how do you propose to find them with your help hauer shook his head in amazement you expect me to drag the two of you along with me is that what you think stern smiled i do bring certain assets to the game hauer raised a skeptical eyebrow such as superior intelligence experience the professor tells me that you have counterterror training captain that is of limited value under the circumstances were not dealing with the red army faction here this is the big league as the americans say ive fought in the secret world for many years i can keep you from making some very serious mistakes hauer shook his head i dont think your experience offsets your age this is a hostage situation speed and reflexes will be critical stern suppressed his anger if you see this as rely a hostage situation you are fatally mistaken we are at the edge of a web of intrigue spun fifty years ago a web that has grown more complex with each passing year ilse apfel is but a speck of dust trapped inside it stern raised his hand and plucked an imaginary mote from the air every time you take a step toward her captain the entire web shakes the spider knows where you are at every moment and when you finally make your move you will find that it is you who are trapped interesting metaphor said hauer what lesson should i draw from it stern smiled patiently your attention should be fixed upon the spider from the start not the speck of dust eliminate the spider you can plunder the web at your leisure hauer said nothing for a while ill take my chances alone he answered finally ive handled a few spiders in my time sterns jaw muscles tightened youd stand a much better chance with my help hauer raised his walther if information is all you have stern you can give that to me right now in the instant hauers finger hesitated on the trigger stern slipped out of the door he reappeared moments later behind him stood three very fit young men their hard faces and burning eyes told hauer everything he needed to know about their probable areas of expertise these are my other assets captain stern said sayaret matkalisraeli commandos you may have heard of them if youre any judge of men you will recognize their value visavis our particular situation hauer instantly revised his estimate of sterns possible contribution even the elite officers of germanys gsg spoke of the sayaret matkal with respect you he cried suddenly recognizing the bandaged yose shamir from the stairwell of the burgerspark hotel you were following me last night stern quickly interposed himself between hauer and the young israeli yosef was thereat my request he explained i had hoped to meet you at the burgerspark myself captain but unexpected trouble prevented me im only thankful you decided to return here this evening i assume you found another hotel last night after your brush with yosef hauer nodded reluctantly and you returned here because because our distraught young husband decided to lie to me he made contact with the kidnappers on his own stern closed his eyes ohno nattennan groaned why because he realized that any attempt to free ilse by force might well bring about her death i believe that was the same position you took back in germany wasnt it professor also because ilse is regnant nattermans eyes widened is the boy mad stern asked doesnt he know the kidnappers will kill both him and his wife no matter what he does no i dont believe he does he thinks with his heart not his head an often fatal mistake stern said dryly ilse is pregnant natterman murmured hauer walked to the window and opened the drapes van der walt street looked as calm as the kurfijrstendamm on an early sunday morning in the corner of the room aaron haber picked up hanss loaded crossbow and showed it to his fellow commandos an amused smile on his face stern motioned for him to put it down what had you planned to do before we arrived captain stern asked play bait tell the kidnappers you had the missing pages of the spandau diary and try to turn their trap inside out hauer grunted thats about it a dangerous game the only one left not quite said stern youre forgetting something am i really have the missing pages i would think they rate us an invitation to the kidnappers ball wouldnt you hauers lips slowly spread into a smile everyone froze as the telephone rang faded you answer it stern advised hauer darted between the beds and picked up the receiver yes captain hauer kept his eyes on stern where are you he asked through gritted teeth i cant say hans replied im not sure anyway captain ive got to have those missing diary pages i made a mistake in leaving you im sorry but these men really will kill ilse unless they get all the pages theyre insane hauer thought silently but i dont have the pages he said at length still watching stern i know hans said quickly but you can find them youve got to go back to germany to the cabin you can find them captain you must its simple police work not so simple hauer stalled not when im wanted for murder in germany they can fix that hauer sealed the mouthpiece with his palm and whispered to stern phoenix wants the rest of the diary do i tell them i have it stern shook his head vehemently they wont believe that if youd really had the other pages hans would have found a way to steal them before he went to the rendezvous hurry said hauer wondering why he was asking this strange old israeli for answers anyway stern jabbed his finger at professor natterman hes got them tell them the professor followed you and hans to south africa and that he brought the missing pages with him hauer shook his head angrily but he could think of nothing else to say hans im here can the kidnappers hear me yes dont hurt the girl hauer said slowly do you hear me do not hurt the girl her grandfather is here with me and he has what you want al hans gasped a new voice came on the line listen well captain hauer said smuts you will send the old man to the same place as before the voortrekker monument he must be there thirty minutes from now alone with the missing pages after we are satisfied that no copies exist we will release our prisoners if you attempt to follow the vehicle that picks up the professor the driver will shoot him on the spot smutss voice went cold and you will never leave this country alive do you understand ja hauer growled the phone went dead hauer whirled on stern well herr masterspy youve painted us into some damned corner they want the professor to deliver our last bargaining chip to them andif we try to follow theyll kill him now three hostages will die instead of two stern smiled enigmatically captain where is your imagination hauer flushed with anger i try to be practical when lives are at stake as do i stern said calmly but pragmatism alone is never enough you should know that captain it is imagination that wins the day and what miracle does your imagination suggest for this problem a simple one sterns eyes had settled on a bedfuddled professor natterman does your granddaughter carry any pictures of you in her handbag professor natterman looked mystified i i dont believe so well stern said brightly there it is hauers eyes widened in comprehension stern smiled its the perfect solution captain i become the professor hauer was shaking his head but he knew that he had been trapped by a master stern was already disrobing its too risky he objected lets have that jacket professor said stern i must wear something ilse can recognize immediately hauer wanted to argue but he could think of no better plan he watched enviously as the israeli prepared to slip into the very center of his metaphorical spiders web as stern stripped professor natterman leaned over and whispered in his ear remember what we talked about on the plane jonas about the man with one eye about hess stern gently but firmly shoved natterman away naked to the waist he handed his pistol to gadi then turned to hauer and smiled sorry captain he said youre just too young for the job chapter thirtythree pm van der wan straat pretoria yuri borodin wiped his neck and forehead with a silk handkerchief it was beastly hot in the van with the oppressive closeness of impending rain and it stank the vans engine was not running so there was no air conditioning borodin looked up five fleshy faces stared dumbly back at him gorilles thats what borodin called them embassy gorillas they were the kgb muscle available at every russian embassy in the world and everywhere in the world they looked the same offtherack suits pomaded hair big faces big fists and most of them smelled of course there were no russian embassies in south africa but there was an illegal residency in johannesburg and the gorillas from the residency had the same aroma a cloying mix of body odor and aftershave crack a window said borodin the driver did gentlemen captain dieter hauer is in the hotel on my right the protea hof with him are some scruffy fellows who look suspiciously like jews borodin clucked his tongue germans and jews an often explosive combination one of the gorillas chuckled appreciatively ah borodin thought a rudimentary sense of humor across the street in the stanley house he went on we have our restless germqn kripo detective hes big but he shouldnt be much trouble two of you should be enough for him when hes dead leave his id but take his money borodin took a heckler and koch mp submachine gun from a leather attache case the rest of us will take room he singled out the leanest of the gorillas you know the window the lean man lifted a dragunov sniper rifle from his lap and zipped it into a soft case sixth floor he said third window from the left borodin screwed a long silencer onto the muzzle of his mp lets go pm room the protea hof hotel pretoria jonas stern would have verbally crucified gadi and his men for their laxness but had they not been so attuned to sterns absence they might have defended themselves better when the telephone rang everyone turned toward it thinking it was stern hauer turned from the window natterman from one of the beds yosef from the space between the other bed and the bathroom wall and most importantly aaron from the foyer no one heard the key gurning soffly in the door closest to the phone gadi ahams snatched it up and said hello hello uncle jonas in that instant of shared bewilderment a rifle slug shattered the hotel room window missing hauer by a centimeter everyone whirled toward the crashing sound a half second later one of borodins gorillas charged through the foyer and bowled aaron haber over like a child hauer looked wildly his walther lay on the bed six feet away he started to dive for it then thii second gorilla came through the door with his pistol aimed at hauers chest standing open mouthed with the telephone to his ear gadi abrar also was trapped in the newcomers line of fire only yosef shamir moved to counterattack yosef who died he had been toying with hanss crossbow in the narrow slot between the bed and the bath when the russians burst in with lightning speed he dropped the bow drew his silenced and fired three shots in rapid succession as the second gorilla emerged from the foyer and barreled past him all three bullets embedded themselves high in the russians broad back he went down on top of his compadre who was wrestling with aaron on the floor the caliber slugs only slowed the russian giant but that slowness saved his life as yosef stepped forward to finish him off yuri borodin somersaulted through the foyer and shot the young israeli through the throat by the time gadi got his hand on hauers walther borodin was covering the entire room faced with the deadly mp submachine gun hauer gadi and aaron realized the futility of further resistance they slowly raised their hands their eyes locked on yosefs convulsing body it took the young commando forty seconds to die and no one spoke while he did it they had all seen death be ore and knowing that no help would be called sed a solemn silence on both attackers and hostages professor natterman was the first to make a sound chattering why why to everyone and no one at the same time you said borodin pointing his weapon at hauer close the drapes hauer didnt move borodin checked his watch close the drapes within five seconds or you will be shot by my sniper everyone against the window hauer obeyed gadi and aaron backed against the closed drapes and stood beside hauer the gorilla that yosef had shot was straining without success to reach the wounds on his back and moaning like a dying ox borodin ordered the gorilla to take him into the bathroom and see to the wounds then he casually seated himself on the bed nearest hauer natterman sat gibbering on the bed opposite but the immaculately dressed russian took no noticetook out a cigarette and lit it with great deliberation gentlemenhe said in english i have come for the papers found at spandau prison which one of you has them none of us hauer replied in the same language in took a drag from his cigarette he had noticed the accent you are captain hauer i take it hauer nodded who are you borodin smiled revealing a dazzling set o f swiss dental once again captain which of you has the papers how did you find us gadi asked stalling borodin laughed softly a fat kripo detective named schneider lead me right to you i assume hes a friend of yours yes darkened in confusion borodin smiled of course the detective is dead now captain as you will be if you dont give up the papers i told you before we dont have them borodins smile stretched to a grimace he called one of the gorillas back from the bathroom and barked several phrases at him in rapid russian of the captives only aaron haberthe son of a lithuanian jewunderstood the exchange but the color draining from his face told the others all they needed to know the big russian jerked aaron away from the curtained window and kicked his legs out from under him when the young israeli tried to rise the russian locked a thick forearm around his neck and pressed the barrel of a silenced browning mm pistol into his ear the foreplay is over gentlemen borodin said his voice had not risen a single decibel yet it had lost all trace of humanity everyone in the room knew that the russian would not hesitate to order aarons execution yet the young commando made no sound he left his fate entirely in the hands of gadi abrams who had been designated senior officer by stern just before he left to rendezvous with the kidmappers at the risk of sounding melodramatic borodin went on im going to count to five if i do not have the spandau papers when i reach that number my loyal assistant will transform this young mans brain into kosher caviar we dont have them hauer said again borodin counted quickly one two three four stop professor natterman cried surprising everyone in gods name stop listen to me you barbarian hauer is telling the truth hans apfel has the ori inal diary most of it anyway the jew who left here a few minutes ago has the rest my granddaughter has been kidnapped weve come to exchange the papers for her life surely even you can understand that borodin stared at the historian how does that help me old man i need results not excuses there is a copy natterman explained a copy of the papers photographs youre russian correct if you want to expose the truth about rudolf hess thats all you need natterman pointed across the room at hauer he has them im sorry captain those papers mean far more to me than to you but theyre simply not worth this boys life hauer stared at the old man with incredulity this did not sound at all like the fameobsessed professor he had com know borodin raised the mp to hauers face the photographs captain hauer didnt move kill the jew borodin said calmly bastard hauer muttered he jerked the envelope from his hip pocket and tossed it onto the bed borodin held the negatives up to the overhead light examined them briefly then slipped them into his inside coat pocket i assume that none of you know the location of the people to whom your friend is trading the original papers thats right natterman said borodin chuckled i thought not if you did this wonderful little commando unit wouldnt be sitting on its collective ass in a hotel room in spite of the gun at his temple aaron cursed and tried to lash out at the soviet agent borodin stepped aside and called to one of the residency men dmitri leave their weapons but take their ammunition two minutes later borodin stood smirking in the foyer flanked by his gorillas the russian who had not been wounded held a pillowcase weighted with uzi ammunition clips boxes of shells and loose rounds this soiree is over gentlemen borodin said ill take my leave now he accented his farewells with a broad flourish of his hand do svidamya shalom auf wiedersihen borodin burst into laughter then motioned for one of the gorillas to open the door the moment the russian holding the pillowcase turned the doorknob the door burst open and knocked him back ward against his wounded comrade from the window hauer gaped as the back of the wounded mans head exploded the second russian groped at his belt for his pistol but two bullets hit him low in the stomach and severed his spinal cord while borodin backpedaled out of the foyer and spun toward the window hauer and the israelis dropped to the carpet as slugs from his mp peppered the bed and the wall and the ceiling hauer looked up just as two bright red flowers blossomed on borodins shoulders hauer and gadi were on their feet by the time borodins body hit the floor standing in the doorway his shoulders stretching from post to post was a very large man holding a walther pistol in his hand a gray hat was pressed down over his bloody head and a brass gorget plate hung from his neck on it was a capital k the emblem of the berlin kriminalpolizei captain hauer schneider said hauer stepped forward and nodded schneider put his gun in his pocket i need to talk to you gadi abrams crouched over borodin who lay pale and shaking on the carpet he rifled borodins pocket for hauers envelope found it and tossed the negatives to hauer then he leaned down over borodins face where is your sniper he shouted where borodin smiled fuck you jew gadi snatched up a pillow crushed it over borodins face and punched him hard on his wounded shoulder the muffled howl that followed did not soundhuman gadi pulled the pillow away across across the street borodin croaked room the stanley house gadi closed his brown hands around borodins throat and began to squeeze for yosef he said softly detective schneider crossed the room and shouldered gadi off of the russian he crouched down beside him are you yuri borodin he asked tersely are you the man who killed major harry richardson borodin stared up with glassy eyes he saw little chance of leaving this room alive his pale face wrinkled into a sneer the swastika was a nice touch dont you think schneider sighed heavily in his mind he saw the dim overheated bedroom where he and colonel rose had examined harrys mutilated corpse in the close south african heat it wasnt hard to recall i should let you bleed to death he growled fuck you too you stinking german while hauer and the israelis watched in disbelief schneider closed one huge hand around borodins throat and squeezed with the remorseless force of a root cracking concrete schneider did not see hauer signal to gadi or the two israelis approach him from behind the moment borodins legs stopped thrashing the israeli commandos seized him schneider did not struggle not even when gadi took the pistol from his pocket hauer stepped forward and checked the scalp behind both of schneiders ears satisfied he stepped back and motioned for the israelis to release him i dont have the damned tattoo schneider muttered in the awkward silence that followed hauer finally noticed the weak moaning coming from somewhere inside the room he walked around and looked on the floor between the beds professor natterman lay there deathly white both hands clutching his side captain he whispered uncertainly hauer knelt and examined the old man the professor had been lying on the bed when schneider burst in and he had been too slow to seek cover two bullets from borodins final spray had struck him one had nicked the flesh above his left hip the other grazed his left thigh hauer could see that the wounds were superficial but the professor obviously believed he was in danger of dying he raised his quivering arms to hauers collar and pulled him down to his face there really is a copy captain he rasped a copy of the spandau papers hauer pulled himself free of the old mans grasp what did you say tell stern to remember the copy i made in berlin what natterman nodded weakly stern was following me he saw me do it i made a copy of the spandau papers before i ever left berlin for the cabin i mailed it to one of my old teaching assistants for safekeeping kurt rossman if if you get to ilse dont worry about the papers just get ilse out tell stern to get ilse out hauer sat stunned he couldnt believe that through all the warnings against photocopying the spandau papers natterman had risked ilses life by not admitting that he had already done so as he opened his mouth to rebuke the old man aaron haber appeared at his side with a canvas overnight bag the young commando withdrew a kit containing yne xylocaine sutures syringes gauze bandages a bloodpressure indicator morphine and a cornucopia of emergency drugs we came prepared for casualties he said he propped nattermans legs on some pillows to max the flow of blood to his brain hauer stood up and gave his full attention to schneider whats your story detective schneider produced a handkerchief and wiped some blood from his face ive come here to help you captain you are in a great deal of trouble in berlin both you and sergeant apfel are wanted for murder there im no murderer hauer said gruffly i didnt say you were i know all about the spandau papers captain i know about phoenix im working with the americans with colonel rose of the us army thats how i traced you i suppose you want the spandau papers schneider shrugged only if they can help to crush phoenix hauer digested this slowly why did you kill that russian he killed an american intelligence officer named richardson richardson was the man who discovered that phoenix extends into east germany as well as west berlin ive known that for months then why didnt you report it hauer snorted report it phoenix has men in the police department the bnd the west berlin senate the federal government in bonn and all the states if id reported what i knew to the wrong person you and your kripo friends would have been visiting me at the morgue twelve hours later schneider nodded slowly the americans can help you captain colonel rose will help you said this russian here already killed one american officer that kind of help i dont need hauer studied the big german why do you think i should trust you because i saved your life hauer shrugged anyone from phoenix would have killed those russians just as quickly as you did they cant afford to let the russians know what phoenix truly exists for not yet schneider met hauers eyes come back with me to berlin captain help us root out funk and his men colonel rose would like nothing better than to order an assault on abschnitt but his hands are tied his superiors are holding him back because of the hess business and he doesnt have nearly enough evidence against prefect funk you could provide that evidence captain you must trust me i want the same thing you doto clean those scum out of berlin schneider turned his broad hands upward i know you dont know me but you must have known my father max schneider he was a kripo investigator too big like me hauer searched schneiders face for a full minute two rivulets of blood trickled down from the sweatband of schneiders hat behind schneider gadi was moving the dead russians into the bathroom while aaron worked on the professor the professors revelation that he had made a copy of the spandau papers pulsed in the back of hauers brain like a second heartbeat the situation had changed profoundly a copy of the spandau papers combined with the evidence he and steuben had already compiled meant that direct action in berlin might now be possible things were moving too quickly here in south africa hanss betrayal sterns sudden appearance the russian assault schneiders unexpected rescue schneider your father wore a hat like yours hauer said absently you did know him said schneider hauer turned and stared pensively out the window you say youre working with the americans yes colonel godfrey rose of military intelligence can you get him on the phone yes do it pm the voortrokker monument pretoria after fortyfive minutes of lying blindfolded in the backseat of the speeding range rover jonas stern had lost all sense of direction the zulu driver who had met him at the voortrekker monument drove with the windowsdown and stern could smell rain on the wind he had peeked around his blindfold once and it seemed to him that night had fallen early in fact the darkness was caused by the thick ceiling of storm clouds hans had earlier seen rolling in from the north it was part of a front that had blown in from the indian ocean it stretched southward from the mozambique border almost to pretoriastern tensed as the range rover swerved onto a rocky shoulder and shuddered to a stop he heard the drivers door open and close stern pulled off the blindfold and looked around down the highway he saw a small speck of light it shone from the direction they had come yet as he tried to focus on the yellow glimmer it winked out the zulu driver turned to stern the whites of his eyes flashing angrily he jabbed a finger toward the blindfold pulling the black scarf back around his eyes stern heardr thought he heardthe sound of an automobile engine in the distance the zulu clambered back into the range rover and screeched onto the highway accelerating to a ridiculous speed he raced on that way for three or four minutes then he geared down and turned off the highway again when the rover finally stopped he leaped out and ran away stern moved the blindfold enough to see his surroundings the rover had stopped at some type of roadside park a knot of brightly dressed africans lounged around the single building several held liquor bottles in their hands their focus seemed to be a public telephone mounted on a wall one of their number was talking into it stern watched as his zulu driver approached the men rather than slow down the zulu swiped the air with a broad sweep of his arm the tribesmen scattered like frightened children they knew the zulu stern thought the zulu shouted into the telephone for a minute or so bobbing his head up and down like a bird abruptly he ceased this motion and looked back down the highway stern followed his gaze the light was there again but larger nowand it was no longer one light but two hauer stern thought suddenly damn him as the zulu came running back to the rover stern stiffened fearing the bullet that had been promised if anyone followed the pickup vehicle none came the drivers door slammed shut then the rover roared out of the park and accelerated to kilometers per hour over the edge of his blindfold stern saw the zulu checking his rearview mirror every few seconds so hauers still there he thought how the hell did he get past gadi the engine screamed as the zulu pushed the rover to a frightening speed stern wondered if the driver really expected to shake hauer by this simple tactic on a paved highway hauers rented ford could overtake the range rover without much trouble suddenly the zulu savagely twisted the wheel dirow the rover into a twowheeled skid that hurled it down a shallow slope onto the hard rolling veld the vehicle decelerated rapidly but the torturous terrain more than made up for the reduction in speed no conventional automobile could catch them now stern tried to keep his head from slamming into the roof as the rover vaulted humps leaped ditches when the rover finally shuddered to a halt stern collapsed against the door and tried to catch his breath the zulu wrenched the door open jerked stern out and i ripped off the blindfold on all sides stern saw the seemingly limitless veld lit by an eerie blue light filtering through the storm clouds above the first heavy drops of african rain smacked against the roof of the rover then the clouds opened with a crash following the zulus line of sight stern spotted the fastapproaching headlights now jinking wildly up and down as if manipulated by some mad puppeteer the african raised his face to the dark clouds as if beseeching some native god to lift him up and away from his pursuer while stern stared through the rain hypnotized by the dancing headlights a new sound rumbled into his ears at first he thought it was rolling thunder then the engine of the pursuing car but the sound grew nearer much faster than the headlights soon it was a buffeting roar terrifying in intensity when stern finally looked up he saw that the roar had blotted out the sky he crouched beneath the blast of the rotors and shielded his eyes against the whipping rain but the zulu jerked him up and into the gaping maw of the helicopter as it hovered brieflynear the earth as they lifted away from the hurricane below stern heard another sound cutting through the din of the rotorsa higher sound like the rim of a crystal goblet singing then it came to himthe brief whine punctuated by the dull thwackbullets two more slugs punctured the thin aluminum skin of the chopper but miraculously missed the vitals of the machinethe cabling hydraulics and precious rotors the helicopter yawed at a sickening angle as it climbed but the zulu held stern fast far below stern saw the pursuers headlights spinning and shrinking to unreality the chase car had stopped now it merged with the rover a tiny bright speck against the rainswept veld stern thought of hauer of how angry he must be at this unexpected tactic he pictured the furious german kicking the rover or even firing a few slugs into it for good measure he couldnt help but smile but the man below was not kicking the range rover of stupidly firing his pistol into the lifeless steel hulk for the man below was not a man at all but a woman an englishwoman smelling of powder and expensive perfume ciare de lune and if jonas stern had known that he would not have been smiling pm room the protea hof hotel pretoria hauer and schneider sat facing each other across the narrow space between the two double beds hauer held his walther loosely in his hand schneiders hands were empty gadi sat by the window hands clenched around his uzi after piling the dead russians in the bathroom he had gone over to the stanley house to try to capture borodins sniper but the sniper had disappeared professor natterman lay asleep on the bed his thigh and his side wrapped in gauze aaron haber guarded the door there would be no more surprise entries do you believe me now schneider asked hauer had spent five minutes on the phone with colonel rose i believe you he said but not because of what the american said why then your father he was an investigator during the student riots in the sixties back then a lot of police officers would just as soon have shot a student as talked to one your father was different schneider nodded unless the acorn fell a long way from the tree youre not part of phoenix besides why would funk need to send you phoenix must have an army here in south africa will you come back to berlin with me hauer shook his head right now i care about only one thingsaving my sons life after thats done ill remember that i need to care about cleaning funk and his stortntroopers out of berlin but by then it may be too late hauer stood ive got a feeling i may not be coming back from this trip detective so im going to trust you to handle berlin i have to trust you hauer felt every eye in the room upon him here is the situation as i see it the british want to suppress the spandau diary and the hess story with it the americansat least in the pasthave been willing to go along with the british the russians want to expose the papers and force the british to accept partial blame for what the nazis did in the war its political oneupmanship hauer turned his head have i got that right professor succinctly put captain from the russian point of view one would think the spandau papers are a minor consideration compared to the very real danger of phoenix if the russians learn that a secret extremely nationalistic group exists within the police and political hierarchies in both east and west germany a group bent on breaking the ddr away from russia and uniting with west germany a group that has infiltrated the stasi thereis really no telling what they might do what are you saying captain im saying that the russians need to learn about phoenix in the right way of course i didnt tell colonel rose any of this so it will all be up to you you heard professor natterman in berlin there is a photocopy of the spandau papers also in berlinin the house of a dead policeman named josef steubenthere is a fireproof safe in that safe is a years accumulation of evidence of drug crimes against funk and his men but more importantlyhauer paused reluctant to reveal something that a friend had died to protectthere is a list of every member of bruderschaft der phoenix whose name i could learn the list names members on both sides of the wall once the russians know what phoenix is schneider they will give anything for that list the light of admiration dawned in schneiders eyes we want phoenix crushed yet we cant trust our own countrymen to do the job so as painful as it may be we must turn to the allies that means the americans when you get to berlin retrieve the photocopy and the list then bide them then tell colonel rose what you have and what you want at y want is c an american supervision of a german urge of phoenix when the americans agree to that let them present the russians with their own offer i suspect it will run something like this in exchange for continued silence about the hess rwhich is what the british and americans wantthe russians will be given the names of phoenix members in the east they can purge the stasi at their leisure and get the higherups by interrogating the stasi members hauer cracked his knuckles as far as i can see everybody should be happy with that arrangement a strange smile flickered across schneiders face i think youre in the wrong line of work captain you should have been a negotiator i am hauer told him a hostage negotiator i thought you were a sharpshooter hauer sighed sometimes negotiations fail schneider stood id better go colonel rose said theres a plane leaving for cairo in forty minutes and therell be an army jet waiting for me there hauer offered his hand good luck detective schneiders grip was like a bears you come back to berlin captain and bring your son we need more men like you at the door hauer spoke softly its funny schneider i want the same thing phoenix wants a united germany but we all want that schneider cut in but we dont want men like funk running it there is a better germany than that hauer met schneiders eyes well never get them all you know not the ones at the top those bastards never pay schneider laid a hand on the walther in his belt if the courts dont get them captain there are other ways and dont take too long here the local police are going to start discovering corpses soon with that schneider turned and walked away a hatted man whose shoulders stretched half the breadth of the hallway when hauer walked back through the foyer gadi said isnt there something else we can do while we wait hauer shook his head stern is our only chance weve got to wait until he calls us ive got a bad feeling about this gadi confided what if uncle jonas cant find a way to call hauer shrugged then he dies just like hans and ilse perhaps inspired by schneider he touched the grip of his own pistol then we hunt the bastards down and kill themevery one of them gadi exhaled in frustration so we just sit here we sit here how longt as long as it takes i dont like it captain and i dont trust that detective either hauer lay back on the bed and closed his eyes who cares chapter thirtyfour pm mi headquarters charles street london sir neville shaw sat alone in his darkened office clutching the telephone receiver to his ear what do you mean you lost him he asked swallows low voice quavered with barely controlled hysteria someone picked him off a motorway with a helicopter i was too far back to stop it shaw rubbed his forehead this was bad news indeed thank you for informing me he said at length your services have been appreciated but they will no longer be needed what there will be no further contact between you and this office dont give me that you bastard swallow shrieked i want to know where stern went i know you know and you had better tell me shaw straightened up at his desk listen to me very carefully your orders are to stand down stand down as of this moment any further action on your part may disrupt a parallel operation and will thus be considered not insubordination but treason to the crown is that clear swallows laugh was like the cackling of a witch the crown she scoffed listen to me little man i know what kind of operation this is i know you ordered the murder of rudolf hess in spandau and if you dont tell me where stern is now ill blow this story wide open ill kill stern one way or the other and when ive done with him ill come for you now shaw broke the connection the light on his phone went dark seconds later deputy director wilson appeared in his doorway a darker shadow in the dim office what did she want sir neville shaw stared at wilsons anxious face for a long time nothing he said finally sterns mucking about pretoria swallows on his tail why dont you send out for some food old man get enough for yourself its going to be a long night and i want you with me wilson nodded crisply certainly sir neville when wilson had gone shaw consulted his map of southern africa he checked the scale against a line he had drawn from the mozambique channel to a sandcolored blank spot near the kruger park as if in a dream he saw two tiny helicopters flying slowly across the map somewhere along that line parallel operation he thought remembering his words to swallow he hoped alan burton had better luck than swallow did burton was the last chance for the secret to stay hidden shaw took his favorite pipe from the stand on his desk and began rummaging for his tobacco jonas stern must be good indeed to have eluded that shedevil he thought he wondered about swallows death threat as he sucked on the cold pipe stem but he soon put it out of his mind at this point in time a deranged assassin was the least of his worries pm mozambiquelsouth africa border the two helicopters flew in tandem noses dipped for speed as they swept across the coastal plain north of maputo in the seat next to alan burton juan diaz cursed under his breath they had spent half the day in a guerilla camp that looked like an outpost from hell ragged tents pitched in the middle of a desert cannibalized army trucks emaciated black men carrying rusty aks girls of twelve or thirteen stolen from nearby villages and forced into whoredom by the soldiers the dogs had looked healthier than the people who were those bastards asked diaz who had a fair grasp of english the mnr sport burton replied bloody wags fascists to boot youre lucky they didnt know you were a communist diaz spat and muttered something in spanish i didnt like it any more than you juan boy but we had to stop to pay them those fuzzywuzzies are providing our diversion this evening plus it was a good place to lie up that freighter was too exposed diaz leaned out to make sure his sister ship was close behind who are they trying to divert for us english government air forces theres a mozambican base about a hundred miles south of here and a south african one further south ayayay diaz groaned whats based there in mozambique the usual african complement transport craft helos a few outdated fighters but the south africans have it all the cuban crossed himself and dropped the chopper even closer to the plain you didnt think an incursion into south africa would be a stroll on the beach did you suddenly a torrent of what sounded like gibberish to diaz burst out of the african ether and filled the cabin burton leaned forward and began transmitting in a slower broken version of the same language when he finished he replaced the transmitter and settled back into his seat with a trace of a smile on his lips takes me back that does what was that shit portuguese sport language of a lost empire everything still okay the pilot asked nervously bloody marvelous id say burton felt like a different man after the confinement of the ocean voyage he was glad to be back in africa the only complication so far had been the observer that the mnr guerilla chief had foisted on him the observer was a giant black named alberto who carried a frightening arsenal of grenades knives and pistols but when burton thought of the deal he refused to let alberto worry him the guerilla looked like more of a soldier than any of the colombians and if he got in the way burton could always kill him the englishman reckoned there might be a good deal of killing before this mission was done but that was all right england had never seemed closer than it did just now pm horn house the northern transvaal jonas stern waited alone in the vast reception hall of horn house praying that ilse apfel possessed more nerve and presence of mind than her overwrought husband by all rights she should be in worse shape emotionally speaking but something about the way natterman had talked about the girl gave stern hope maybe she had the sand to do it maybeherr professor the voice emanated from a dark hallway to sterns left he turned to see pieter smuts emerge from the shadows thats right said stern putting his full concentration into each syllable of german professor emeritus georg natterman of the free university of berlin who are you smuts smiled bleakly i believe you have something for me professor stern regarded the afrikaner with imperious detachment where is my granddaughter first the papers playing the role of arrogant academic to the hilt stern raised his chin and looked down his nose at smuts ill not give the spandau papers to anyone but the man who can prove they are his rightful property frankly i doubt anyone here can do that the afrikaner grimaced herr professor it is only my employers extreme patience which has kept me from an invisible bell cut smuts off in midsentence one moment he said and disappeared down the hall from which he had come glancing around the grand reception hall stern wondered what madman had constructed this surreal schloss on the highveld he took a couple of tentative steps down the opposite corridor but smutss returning footsteps brought him back almost immediately follow me herr professor the afrikaner said stiffly in the dimly lit library alfred horn sat motionless behind an enormous desk his one good eye focused on the man he believed to be professor georg natterman stern hesitated at the door he had expected to be brought before a young english nobleman named granville not a man twenty years his senior come closer herr professor horn said take a seat ill stand thank you stern said uncertainly he saw little more than a shadow at the desk he tried to determine the shadows nationality by its voice but found it difficult the man spoke german like a native but there were other inflections too as you wish horn said you wanted to see me stern squinted into the gloom slowly the amorphous features of the shadow coalesced into the face of an old man a very old man stern cleared his throat you are the man responsible for my granddaughters abduction im afraid so professor my name is thomas horn im a wellknown businessman in this country such tactics are not my usual style but this is a special case a member of your family stole something that belongs to some associates of mine horn sat so still that his mouth barely moved when he spoke stern tried to concentrate on the old mans words but somehow his attention was continually drawn to the facer what little he could see of it a low buzz of alarm began to insinuate itself into his brain with a combat veterans sensitivity to physical wounds stern quickly noticed that the old man had but one eye watery and blue it flicked restlessly back and forth while the other stared ever forward seeing nothing my god stern thought here is professor nattermans oneeyed man but i am a pragmatist horn was saying i always take the shortest route between two points in this case that route happened to run through your family you have a fine granddaughter a true daughter of deutschiand but in matters such as thismatters with political implicationseven family must take second place stern felt sweat heading on his neck who in gods name was this man he tried to recall what natterman had said about the oneeyed man helmut that was the name the professor had mentioned but of course natterman had thought helmut was a code name for the real rudolf hess stern felt his heart thud in his chest it cant be he thought quickly it simply cannot be and so you see how simple it is professor horn concluded for the spandau papers i give you back your family stern tried to speak but his mind no longer controlled his vocal cords the man murmuring to him from the shadows was at least twenty years older than himself the face and voice had been ravaged by time but as stern stared he began to discern the telltale marks of authority the indelible lines etched into the face of a man who had held great power could it be asked a voice in sterns brain of course it could answered another hesss double died only weeks ago and he had endured the soulkilling loneliness of spandau prison for almost fifty years this man has lived the life of a millionaire with access to the best medical care in the worldive read your book professor horn said smoothly germany from bismarck to the bunker a penetrating study though flawed in its conclusions i would be very interested to hear your opinion of the spandau papers stern swallowed ii havent really had that much time to study them they deal mainly with the prisoners at spandau prisoners professor not one prisoner in particular stern blinked not prisoner number seven horn smiled cagily have no fear professor my interest is purely academic id simply like to know if the papers shed any light on the events of may tenth on the flight of rudolf hess the solution to that mystery has always eluded mehe smiled againas it has the rest of the world stern fought the urge to step backward what kind of game was this there is mention of the hess flight he whispered and are you familiar with the case professort conversant excellent i happen to have a unique volume related to it here in my library the only one of its kind horn tilted his head slightly pieter smuts crossed to some tall shelves at the dark edge of the library and pulled down a thin black volume he hesitated a moment but horn inclined his head sharply and smuts obeyed stern accepted the thin volume without looking at it you hold a piece of living history in your hand professor horn said solemnly a piece no historian has ever seen before may of was a critical juncture in the march of western civilization a time of great opportunities he sighed missed opportunities id like you to read that while we verify the spandau papers perhaps it will help you to do what no one else has yet been able to dosolve the hess mystery stern looked down at the book in his hands it was a notebook he saw bound in black leather with a name stamped in gold on its cover v v zinoviev the name meant nothing to stern what was he holding in his hands had this man horn threatened to kill ilse apfel in order to suppress one clue to the hess enigma only to give the man he thought to be her grandfather another was he a fool of course not he was a snake allowing the sparrow one last song before it felt the fangs strike any knowledge that professor natterman gained from the zinoviev notebook in the next few hours would perish with him come closer professor horn said raising his chin like a connoisseur examining an antique for authenticity do you have jewish blood in your family the flickering blue eye fixed on stern and bored in searching for the slightest hint of deception stern struggled to maintain his calm during the helicopter flight he had worried that his rusty german would give him away yet no one seemed to have noticed it would it be his semitic nose that betrayed him that put the final bullet through his heart nein he said forcing a smile this nose has been the bane of my life herr horn theres some arab blood far back down the line i think it almost cost me my life several times during the thirties i can imagine horn said thoughtfully so the spandau papers you have brought them to me horns cadaverous face seemed to waver ghostlike in the shadows as if by its own volition sterns right hand burrowed into his trouser pocket and brought out the missing pages before he even realized what he meant to do he had lurched forward and laid the three sheets on horns desk you have it all now he blurted make what you wish of it just give me back my granddaughter he turned and moved zombielike toward the door his eyes focused on the handle as he neared it herr professor stern froze horns warbling voice floated through the darkness like a phantom ancient and unreal i called the document centre in berlin they informed me that you were at the siege of leningrad this shouldnt be too great an ordeal for an old wehrmacht soldier have a rest see your granddaughter all will soon be back to normal and you and i will exchange old war stories and dont forget to read the zinoviev book stern peered through the shadows the conversation seemed to have tired the old man the face which had looked so alive at the beginning of the meeting now sagged as if drained by chronic pain stern groped behind him for the door pieter smuts turned the knob and slipped into the hall ahead of him stern saw horn raise a skeletal arm in farewell and then smuts pulled the door shut dazed stern followed the tall afrikaner down the long corridor toward the reception hall they crossed it then walked the length of several dim passages stern felt like alice being led through the warrens of the lookingglass world finally smuts stopped before a door and opened it stern saw a striking young blond woman dressed in a smart navy skirt and white blouse from nattermans description he recognized ilse apfel immediately but he was still so deep in frenzied speculation about the old man that he failed to notice the shock on her faceilse looked from smuts to stern then back to smuts she started to speak then held her tongue waiting for the afrikaner to explain the intrusion smuts said nothing ilses eyes moved up and down sterns lean frame lingering on his unfamiliar face finally settling on professor nattermans patched tweed jacket smutswho was nominally quite sensitive to subtleti of human behaviorput ilses awkwardness down to surprise i hope you both appreciate herr horns generosity he said the words woke stern from his trance instantly he registered the dangerous bafflement on ilses face steady girl he thought steady ilse he cried my little enkelkinder come to me he took a step forward and held out his arms come on girl get it without quite understanding why ilse moved forward first hesitantly then in apparent jubilation she rushed to the stranger and pressed her head against his jacket clinging to him like a child she would never know why she did it it was an impulse a tingling flash of inexplicable certainty like those that sometimes hit her as she watched the stock quotes flickering across the toteboard at work she didnt question it she simply obeyed my little darling stern said soothingly stroking ilses cheek are you all right yes opa yes ilse murmured can we go home now not yet little one not quite yet but soon stern glared at smuts over ilses blond hair could we have some privacy he asked icily a tight grimace pluckedat the corner of the afrikaners mouth but he left them ilse immediately pulled away from stern and opened her mouth to speak stern stifled her with an upturned palm then pointed to the door who are you ilse mouthed silently stern leaned over until his lips touched the shell of ilses ear a friend he whispered thank god you managed to suppress your shock i believe you just saved my life it was the jacket ilse whispered excitedly youre wearing opas jacket at first i thought it was some kind of crazy trick but no trick where is opa he is safe hes with captain hauer and hans is hans safe stern nodded impatiently as if hans were merely a secondary problem to be dealt with when and if possible hans is here now he tried to trade the spandau papers for your life but failed ilses eyes widened hans is here yes but we cant worry about that now if we dont figure out exactly where we are and get me to a telephone well probably be dead within an hour ilse shook her head youll need an airplane to get out of here you know where we are not exactly but ive been outside were far out in the wilderness near something called the kruger park i think the kruger national park stern looked at his watch estimating the distance he had traveled by road and by helicopter yes that would be about right his voice grew urgent ilse i dont know how much you know about the situation you are in you may like your grandfather see it as merely a squabble over the rudolf hess case but much more than that i believe that somewhere in this country there are men who mean to cause great harm tomy countryisrael damn it stern cried suddenly what is hiding here that bastard asked me if i had any jewish blood in my veins aifd ian israelidenied that i did he threw the zinoviev notebook onto the bed and tried the doorknob again shaking it furiously ilse reached out and clutched the sleeve of her grandfathers jacket youre right she whispered about israel what stern turned to face her what do you meant i mean that horn wants to destroy israel stern clutched her arms how do you know that out with it girl speak youre hurting me stern released her what are you talking about ilse brushed a strand of hair out of her eyes last night herr horn met with some arabs up in the central tower of the estate for some reason he wanted me there i dont know why he offered to provide these arabs with a nuclear weaponne or more than one im not sure he said he would provide it flee of charge if the arabs would use it as wished he said there was a nuclear weapon somewhere beneath this house stern swallowed hard his eyes burning into ilses did you believe him she hesitated a moment then she nodded very slowly how did he say he wanted the weapon used he said he wanted it exploded intel aviv stern felt his bowels roll when within ten days he said stern crossed to the bed and picked up the thin black notebook horn had given him again he read the gold letters stamped on the cover v v zinoviev still the name meant nothing he slipped the notebook inside his shirt backed against the far wall and without a sound threw himself across the room and against the heavy wooden door ilse screamed the door didnt budge stern gasped for breath backed up charged again his wiry frame smashed into the wood with a sound like a child falling down stairs ilse cringed tlwice more the old israeli flung himself at the door but it refused to give bruised and winded stern raised his right leg and kicked at the knob with all his strength its no good ilse cried please stop youre hurting yourself stern did not even look at her with a howl of rage he kicked at the knob again when it refused to yield he backed up and launched his body at the door yet again this time the impact knocked him to his knees he got unsteadily to his feet and prepared to try again ilse caught his arm meaning to restrain him butwhen stern whirled something in his eyes moved her into some region beyond logic beyond reason she counted to three and together they flung themselves against the wood chapter thirtyfive pm mozambiquelsouth africa border the helicopters stormed northward on the mozambique side of the border hugging the plain between the lebombo mountains and the limpopo river occasionally they jinked westward long enough for burton to take bearings the englishman knew this part of africa well and the kruger park had enough landmarks to keep him oriented the border itself a garish scar of bare earth bisected by a huge electric fence divided two countries that might have been different continents on the mozambique side a desolate warravaged plain stretched toward the sea on the south african side the lushness of the kruger park began immediately wide green troughs of river in vegetation snaked westward out of sight forests of mopane sycamore fig and natal mahogany sheltered herds of elephant and zebra white rhino and lion take her back up alan burton ordered juan diaz breathed a sigh of relief the cuban pilot prided himself on his flying skill but this crazy english gringo had badgered him about the altitude until he wondered if the man had a secret death wish burton pointed to the north and shouted above the rotor noise we want to keep on this heading until we see the olifants river then well veer west and cross the park at treetop level he showed diaz the map the house we want lies about halfway between the western edge of the park and this little town here burton pointed to giyani then indicated an x marked about fifteen kilometers from the western edge of the kruger park diaz nodded then returned his gaze to the plain below the kruger parks about the size of wales burton told him but its thinruns north to south diaz ignored him probably never heard of wales eh burton laughed the prince of wales diaz shook his head either the cuban hadnt understood or he simply did not want to be bothered burton switched to a more relevant subject that fence down there he yelled pointing westward volts they fry a whole gang of mozambican refugees on that thing every year bloody awful the cuban grimaced he knew about dead refugees glancing back into the cabin of the jetranger burton looked the colombian soldiers over again the presence of alberto the big mnr observer made them look even more unprofessional what do you think of our south american friends diaz he yelled the cuban pilot did not share burtons confidence in the deafness of the colombians he pulled the englishmans head down near his own banditos he muttered no soldiers he cut his eyes back toward the cabin then crossed himself so that only burton could see bloody hell burton had hoped diaz might know something encouraging about the colombians that he didnt suddenly the englishman sighted a silver serpentine glittering beneath the dark clouds to the north theres the river he shouted diaz nodded then banked westward and dove for the plain their sister ship followed closely behind and to the right the green sea of the kruger park rushed toward them the jetrangers skimmed over the border fence and swept westward over the verdant foliage below burton saw a herd of antelope raising a huge cloud of dust as they fled the noise of the approaching choppers diaz pointed to the dark cloud ceiling above them much rain when it comes buckets this time of year diaz frowned but burton smiled wryly the weather didnt worry him that was the pilots problem but the accuracy of his intelligence reports did who in hell was the english informer who supposedly waited inside the target house probably anything but a soldier burton thought ruefully the informer had reported that alfred horn relied primarily upon isolation for securityisolation and a neonazi security chief burton wondered if the informer would even recognize defensive measures if he saw them swallowing his anxiety he slapped diaz on the back and grinned rains good for us he yelled better cover diaz glanced doubtfully back into the cabin where the bearded colombians crouched he dropped a little closer to the trees horn house the northern transvaal ilse sat opposite alfred horn at the long mahogany dining table and stared sullenly at her plate all the other chairs were empty in spite of their furious efforts she and stern had been unable to break out of the bedroom before linah arrived to take them to dinner stern had pleaded an unsettled stomach so ilse had come alone she wondered if the old israeli was still trying as linah leaned over her left shoulder to pour white wine she looked up at horn where is everyone she asked trying to hold her voice steady pieter has work to do horn replied and of course your grandfather remains in your bedroom he smiled i believe he would rather finish reading that notebook i gave him than eat ilse lifted her fork and tried to make a show of eating stern had advised her to carry on as she had been but now that she knew hans was almost surely somewhere inside the house she couldnt contain herself where is my husband she cried suddenly horn looked up slowly from his plate he has not yet arrived my dear liar hes here horn swallowed some wine then set his crystal goblet on the table who told you that he asked quietly your grandfather no one i i just feel it ah womans intuition an overrated faculty ive found do not worry your hans will arrive soon ilse uivered with anger youre lying she said stubbornly hans is here horn slammed his frail hand against the table rattling the silver i will not tolerate this at my table you will behave as a german woman should or at that moment pieter smuts marched into the dining room with jiirgen luhr on his heels aircraft approaching the house sir he announced fwo blips so far theyre at the edge of the kruger park now what type of aircraft pieter smuts smiled coldly no radio contact no iff but from their speed i would guess helicopters horn sighed deeply the bunkers manned yes sir smutss face was taut everyones in place and lord granville the afrikaner shook his head im not sure where he is while the men spoke ilse slid her right arm off of the table taking her silver dinner fork and salad fork with it take frau apfel to her room said horn then get to the tower ill be in my study but sir with granville loose horn silenced the afrikaner by ringing a hand bell that summoned linah to the tower pieter he commanded i am in no danger bring the girl smuts told luhr and hurried out frau apfel luhr motioned for ilse to stand he forced himself to smile as soon as linah had wheeled horn out of the dining room however he snatched ilse up by the arm and dragged her into the hall lock her in smuts called from up the corridor then meet me at the reception hall elevator when ilse and luhr reached the bedroom door she reached into her pocket and closed her hand around one of the forks she thought of driving it into luhrs neck but she did not better to let stern make a move if he thought the time was right stern didnt get the chance luhr turned the knob quickly and kicked open the door knocking the israeli backward onto the floor he laughed then shoved ilse inside and jerked the door shut ilse pulled the silver forks from her pocket and tossed them to stern get us out of here she snapped now when the elevator door opened in the domed observatory tower jiirgen luhr stepped into a room unlike any he had ever seen he had once been admitted to the control tower of frankfurt international airport but even that see primitive compared to this futuristic command post computer screens satellite receivers amplifiers massive banks of switches closedcircuit television monitors and countless other pieces of hightech equipment hung from the ceiling and rose from the carpeted floor an eerie green glow bathed the circular room silhouetting three men dressed in khaki who ceaselessly monitored the various surveillance consoles one man made way for smuts who took a seat before a phosphorescent radar screen who is in the helicopters luhr asked smuts smiled thinly im not sure but you can bet theyre friends of lord granville our pet english nobleman you see those switches there the red ones here asked luhr reaching dont touch them christ look at the markings north east south west when i call a direction pull the first switch for that heading when i call it again pull the second got it luhr nodded what do they do youll find out soon enough taking a last look at the radar screen smuts moved to the center of the room ascended a short ladder and climbed into the strangest contraption luhr had ever seen a monstrosity of steel tubing pedals gears and hydraulic lines it looked like something stripped from the belly of a world war two vintage bomber protruding from this strange machine were six long narrow metal tubes joined at the center and extending to within an inch of the domes wall suddenly luhr realized what he was looking at a vulcan mm rotary cannon he had seen them many times in germany jutting from the stubby snouts of american aio tankkilling warplanes hit the blue switch smuts ordered luhr obeyed and watched in wonder as a narrow oblong section of the domed ceiling receded into a hidden slot in the wall smuts touched a button the barrels of the vulcan gun moved forward through the opening like the barrel of a telescope now the gun could be traversed on a vertical axis hit the next switch down luhr gasped as the middle four feet of the circular wall sank into the floor with a deep hum through the bulletresistant polycarbonate glass that now served as the wall luhr could see a degree panorama of the grounds surrounding horn house the sky was heav and nearly black with impending rain four hundred meters to the north horns leadet and helicopter sat like toys in the fastfading light next said smuts luhr hit the final blue switch immersing the room in neartotal darkness only the luminous green radar screens competed with the gray light outside the turret smuts pulled down a leather harness and buckled it across his chest then he grasped two elongated tubes and positioned them directly over his eyes luhr realized they were laser targeting goggles sit down and strap yourself in smuts ordered whyll scowling smuts jabbed a foot pedal instantly the turret began to rotate throwing luhr to the floor dont ever question my orders lieutenant luhr scrambled to his feet and buckled himself into the chair on the radar screen to his left two tiny blips crossed the line indicating the western edge of the kruger national park then turned southwest toward an h marked on the screen in grease pencil fifteen kilometers and closing announced a khakiclad technician approach speed knots luhr watched the fuzzy green specks pass slightly to the north of the h then veer left and bore straight in who are they he asked unable to suppress his apprehension dead men smuts replied from the gun cage hans apfel could not move he lay in the absolute darkness of a cell one hundred meters below the earth this was the same cell in which jiirgen luhr had spent his first night in south africa hans was bound to a heavy cot with rope and gagged with a thick strip of cloth he could only breathe through his nose no sound had reached his ears for hours save the occasional sibilant hiss of a ventilator blowing air into his cell suddenly a deep buzzing alarm blasted through the basement complex every muscle in hanss body contracted in shock what was happening a fire for the hundredth time he expelled every ounce of air from his lungs and tried to shift his body on the cot it was no use he had never felt so helpless in his life yet despite his fear for ilse one desperate hope flickered in his brain is it my father ive almost got it stern grunted working feverishly at the lock on the bedroom door by intertwining the tines of ilses stolen forks and snapping off several hed managed to fashion the dinner fork into a serviceable lock pick hurry ilse urged i dont think we have much time did horn seem upset stern asked still working surprised frightened not really please hurry we must find hans at that moment the clouds opened the rain lashed the roof of horn house in great sheets then settled into a steady torrent that would soon turn the surrounding gullies into raging rivers got it stern cried he cracked the door slightly then flung it wide ilse darted into the hall where should we start beat on every locked door you can find if hans is here hell be behind one arent you coming you dont need me to find your husband ive got something else to do what after what you told me you ask me that move girl stern spun ilse around put a hand between her shoulder blades and shoved her down the hall she hesitated a moment then seeing that the israeli meant what he said she started slowly up the corridor stern clenched the broken fork tightly in his fist and set out in the opposite direction the jetranger helicopters skimmed across the veld like great steel dragonflies in the distance burton could just make out the copper dome of horns observatory glinting through the heavy rain he flattened his palm and dropped it closeto his thigh indicating that diaz should fly still closer to the earth the cuban muttered something in spanish but the scrub brush rose up into the plexiglas windshield until burton felt he was tearing across the veld on a horse gone mad even the few stunted trees they passed rose higher than the choppers rotors see it burton yelled pointing the cuban nodded we should see an airstrip soon thats our objective set right down on it burton poked his head back into the crowded cabin and gave the colombians a thumbsup signal most of them looked airsick but albertothe guerilla observergrinned back his square white teeth flashing in the shadows forty seconds later diaz wheeled the jetranger in a wide circle and settled onto the freshly laid asphalt fifty meters from horns leadet burton punched open the plexiglas door and jumped to the ground just as they had practiced a dozen times on the casildas afterdeck the colombians poured out of the chopper one after another looking for all their amateurishness like a squad of marines securing a hot lz a quick glance across the tarmac told burton that the men on the other chopper were doing the same see you after the party he shouted to diaz the cuban shook his head english loco he muttered twirling his forefinger beside his temple the colombians crouched at the edge of the rotor blast waiting for burton to take the lead the mercenary jumped to the ground and immediately started toward the distant dome at an easy trot the colombians twentytwo in all followed closely thirty seconds running brought them up short at the rim of the wash burton stared angrily into the ravine hed been told to expect a shallow trench no more than a thirtysecond delay but the summer cloudburst had turned this steepsided gully into a treacherous river that would take minutes not seconds to cross three feet of muddy runoff churned through the undergrowth near the bottom and the water was rising fast move burton shouted and leaped over the lip of the ravine he halffell halfslid toward the torrent below looking back he saw the colombians skidding down behind him two minutes later they all stood en the opposite rim of the wash huddling against the rain burton started slogging westward again without a word for a few minutes he saw nothing ahead but rain then like a mirage the whole stunning specter of horn house appeared out of the downpour burtons blood ran cold one glance told him that his inside informer didnt know his ass from his elbow the soft objective he had been briefed to expect stood like a medieval fortress on a hill at the center of a huge expanse of open ground ten men armed with medium machine guns could defendthat house indefinitely against a force the size he had brought his ragtag outfit had only one hopesurprise the colombians had not yet picked up on the alarming deterioration of their situation and burton didnt intend for them to all right lads he barked change of plan id intended to use the mortar to soften the target for youburton paused while a bilingual colombian interpretedbut this open ground changes everything if i open up before you go in the target will be warned many of you could die in the charge burton saw several faces nod warily as the interpreter conveyed his words my suggestion is that you all go in at the doublea quick silent run you go in very fast and close to the ground the israelis favor this tactic and theyve surprised a lot of arabs with it i can tell you he summoned a bluff grin ready lads two or three colombians nodded but most looked a shade paler than they had when they thought burtons mortar barrage would precede their attack the englishman took a final look at his unit they were a ragged lot by any standard standing there in the rain weighted down by bandolero ammo belts grenades and law rockets they would have been comic but for the near certainty of their impending deaths looking past them to the distant house burton felt a sudden almost irresistible urge to order them back to the choppers to savetheir miserable lives before they charged the fortress that waited beyond the gray wall of rain but then he remembered the deal move out he shouted angrily goddamn it charge the colombians stared dumbly for a moment then they turned and trotted down the slope into the shallow bowl one hung backa teenager named ruiz whom burton had tried to instruct in the finer points of mortar operationwaiting to see if he was needed burton started to nod then he sensed someone behind him he turned to see alberto the huge mnr guerilla observer burton pointed to the mortar tube he had dropped onto the grass and eyed the guerilla questioningly when alberto nodded with confidence burton decided he would prefer skill to gw company today he motioned for ruiz to follow the charge alberto immediately began setting up the mortar but burton impelled by some morbid instinct crouched on the rim of the grassy bowl and watched the colombians go in as his eyes followed the camouflaged figuresrunning nowhe suddenly noticed something odd about the floor of the bowl subdividing the approaches to horn house into measured sections were dozens of small grasscovered mounds at first glance they seemed only natural irregularities in the groundanimal spoor perhapsbut burton soon realized that the humps were anything but natural his mind faltered for a moment not wanting to accept it then his gut instinct grasped the whole ghastly scene a killing ground those innocentlooking mounds concealed land mines burton shouted a warning but the colombians had already passed out of earshot alberto raised his head at burtons shoutthen it started sixteen claymore mines exploded simultaneously sending thousands of steel balls scything through the air at twice the speed of sound half the colombians were shredded into bloody pulp before they could scream the sound came in waves deep shuddering concussions muted by the rain most survivors of the first blast staggered to the ground mortally wounded shrapnel detonated some of the colombian ordnance grenades flashed in the dusk one of the law rockets exploded in a blinding fireball consuming the man who carried it burton lay stomachdown shielding his eyes against the flashes alberto tugged at burtons pack groping for mortar rounds so that he could return fire burtonslaived the hie guerillas hand away bloody hell all youd do now is pinpoint our position he punched his fist into the soggy veld poor bastards in spite of the englishmans pessimism alberto grinned and pointed down the slope to where unbelievably a halfdozen colombians still crawled doggedly toward horn house having gone too far to retreat with any hope of survival they went blindly on forty meters from the great tliangular structure one of them rose to one knee and let off a law rocket the smoke trail arrowed across the grass and the exploding warhead tore a jagged hole in the wall above a shuttered window emboldened by their comrades success three wounded colombians got up and cheered then charged the main entranee with their aks on full automatic at that momentwith a sound like a handsaw nppi tinsmutssvulcan gun opened up from the observatory from the tower jijrgen luhr watched the carnage with morbid fascination he could not quite comprehend the fact that he had obliterated a dozen human beings with the flick of a switch the land around horn house looked as if a hundred plows had passed over it sowing blood and fire the remotely detonated claymores had churned the earth into a smoking graveyard when the vulcan gun began to fire luhr thought he had gone deaf white flame spat out of the six spinning barrels the unbelievable rate of fire made the scarlet tracers look like laser beams arcing across the slope below anywhere the gun lingered for a full second more than a hundred depleteduraniumtipped slugs impacted in a steady stream of death the rain and darkness obscured the remaining attackers but smuts seemed to have no trouble finding them wearing ear protectors now he worked the pedals with practiced skill traversing the gun with remorseless accuracy watching smutss sliteyed face behind the vulcan luhr actually pitied the men who remained alive four floors below the observatory robert stanton lord granville watched the weapons he had known nothing about blast his dreams of power into oblivion if alfred survives this night he thought desolately what will shaw give me not afucking thing thats what he shook his head in wonder not one member of the assault teaxn remained standing unbelieving stanton pressed his palm against the windowpane watching in horror as the vulcans terrible tracer beam climbed the slope then disappeared over the ridge seconds later a fireball mushroomed into the sky probably a helicopter he realized stanton could bear no more he knew he had but one chance now to find horn and allay any suspicion that he was connected with the attack if burton is killed he thought hopefully i might just bring it off he dashed into the dark hallway and made for the study almost sure that horn would be closeted there scurrying through the vast reception hall he saw ilse jerk back into one of the corridors but she meant nothing to him now in seconds he would be fighting for his life a quick sprint brought him to the study door which he found unlocked he burst through it like a man in blind panic a greenshaded lamp burned at horns desk but the old man was not there then slowly stanton made out the wheelchair silhouetted against the rainspattered picture window scarlet tracers sliced through the darkness outside giving the room a surrealistic sense of drama like the bridge of a ship during battle alfred stanton cried with exaggerated relief thank god youre safe slowly horn rotated his wheelchair until he faced the young englishman his face was haggard but his solitary eye burned with black contempt so robert he rasped you would be my judas ilse tore through the halls like a madwoman she had searched every unlocked room and pounded on every locked door in the house but shed found no sign of hans nor had she seen stern since they parted at the bedroom door she had found one useful thing in a spartan bedroom decorated only by an eightbyten photograph of a younger uniformed pieter smuts shed found a beretta mm semiautomatic pistol in a holster hanging from the bedpost she wasnt sure she could use it but she had no doubt that stern could or hans if she could find him approaching the reception hall at a full run she saw lord granville sprint across it in another direction she skidded and tried to backpedal into the narrow corridor but she was too latestanton had seen her yetjust as she turned to flee she heard the englishmans footsteps echoing down one of the main passagewaysaway from her carefully she crossed the reception hall and peered down the corridor into which stanton had vanished whats he after she wondered what is so important that he would ignore me running loose another prisoner perhaps hans ilse darted down the hallway after stanton toward the far end of the dark corridor she saw a vertical crack of light as she neared it she heard voices one was unmistakably stantonsthe other she couldnt be sure pulling off her shoes she slipped quietly through the door she pressed herself flat against the paneled wall of the study alfred horn sat hunched in his wheelchair before a large picture window barely discernible in the shadows beside an ornate desk four meters away stood lord granville he was gesticulating wildly with his hands i told you alfred he shouted smuts is insane he knows nothin of my loyalty im your partner for gods sake you are a liar and a coward horn said evenly and you care for nothing but money he swept a hand toward the window where sporadic tracer fire still illuminated the grounds in short bursts you see how your greed ends roberl stanton raised his arms in supplication but i know nothing of that its another of smutss schemes to discredit me hes always been jealous of me you know that horn shook his head sadly dear robert how is it that great men produce heirs such as you it is the bane of the world please stanton begged what proof is there against me horn rubbed his wizened forehead reach beneath the desktop robert stanton did his fingers touched a toggle switch he flipped it reflexively a mate voice boomed from speakers on the bookshelf good christ are you mad stanton felt faint shut up and listen snapped a voice he recognized as his own i had to call from here they wont let me go anywhere else look youve got to call it off what asked the incredulous voice the british accent unmistakable he knows im telling you horn knows about casilda i dont know how but he does he cant know he does theres no stopping it now said sir neville shaw and your information on horns defenses had better turn out to be good granville or alfred horns bitter voice rose above the recording you dont even make a good judas robert youre pathetic but but its not what you think stanton wailed that call was about the gold were expecting liar youve betrayed me i will coddle you no more with a sudden straightening of his body stanton pulled a caliber pistol from his belt youre the fool he cried his eyes burning with maniacal hatred doddering around this carnival house clinging to your rotting fortune like a sick lion blubbering your idiotic racial philosophies through these empty halls youre daft your day is past old man its my turn now stanton aimed the pistol at horns head put down the gun robert horn said quietly i will forgive you please for your grandfathers sake shut up youd never let me live now i will forgive you robert but first you must tell me all about your friends from london stanton shook his head like a terrified child i cant i tried to protect you you know they wanted me to kill you myself but i refused they offered me the bloody moon they threatened to blackmail me to expose some horrible secret about my grandfatherstanton grinned wildlybut then i realized they were more afraid of the secret than i was the petulant scowl returned but they mean to kill you alfred one way or the other dont you see i had no choice london will only send someone else for you perhaps horn said wearily perhaps i made a mistake robert because you are like you are i never revealed to you my true identity my true mission even your father kept it from youwisely i thought but the time has come for you to know i will forgive your treachery but first you must put down the gun put it down and learn the true story of your noble heritage you bastard stanton screamed he charged forward and kicked horns wheelchair over spilling him onto the parquet floor drawn inexorably forward by the madness of the scene ilse edged along the wall until she could see horn lying on his back erratic flashes through the picture window fell on his gaunt face contorted with pain and confusion above him stanton his eyes alight with maniacal fury held the gun in his quivering right hand you talk of forgiveness he shouted who are you to forgive he jerked back the slide of the and aimed at horns glass eye what did you make my grandfather do nothing horn said pleadingly you have it all backward please robert i do not fear death but i fear for my mission for your grandfathers mission for mankind horns voice rose in desperation do not end the work of half a century stanton laughed wildly then he tightened his mouth into a grimace and steadied the gun with both hands last alfred he cried its long overdue as if in a dream ilse raised smutss beretta and pulled back the slide just as she had seen hans do a hundred times in their apartment stanton heard the metallic click he whirled trying to pinpoint the source of the sound ilse fired chapter thirtysix stern ran silently swiftly through the house ilse had described the triangular layout of horn house to him but from inside the myriad halls and passages seemed only to lead back upon themselves he had tried to always turn inward toward the central tower that ilse had told him would lead to the basement but each time he was eventually stopped by the same obstaclean impenetrable sheet of black anodized metal the heavy shields blocked every inwardfacing door and window he could find the central tower and basement complex had obviously been sealed for battle stern paused for breath beside a wide metal door marked nkenhaus he had yet to find a telephone and even if he found one he could only give hauer the most general idea of where he was being held he needed a map who is attacking this house he thought angrily the arabs come for their damned bomb if it even exists in any other country the idea that a private citizen had gained possession of a nuclear weapon would be ludicrous but stern knew that in south africa no normal rules applied in a nuclearcapable state that had developed beyond the scrutiny of any regulatory entity anything was possible a man of horns wealth might well have been instrumental in south africas nuclear weapons program and god alone knew what price he would have exacted for his aid and if he does have the bomb stern asked himself what then visions of israeli commandos parachuting into the courtyards of horn house made his pulse race but he knew that such a raid would not happen here when he finally found a telephone he would not have time to make the six or eight calls it would take to reach the proper members of the israeli general staffif they werent out playing golf somewhere and even if he did reach them what action could they take south africa wasnt lebanon or iraq violating south african airspace would be a dangerous act of war the unofficial motto of the south african army was thirty days to cairomeaning that the south african defense forces could fight their way up the entire length of africa in a month few experts argued the point no stern realized hauer was his only chance hauer was in south africa he was one phone call away and he was ready to act stern wondered what the mandarins in jerusalem would say if they knew the future of israel might depend on a single german stern pushed open the infirmary door and looked for a telephone he saw an ekg machine an iv stand several laboratory instrumentsbut no telephone there were two doors set in the far wall one was marked intensive care the other bore the international warning symbol for radiation behind the first stern found a plethora of lifesupport equipment but no telephone behind the second he found an xray machine and table a paneled door marked darkroom fluorescent screens for examining printed xray films and shelves of manila folders for stoning them no telephone stern hurried back into the hallway after trying another halfdozen rooms he found himself standing in the library where he had initially confronted horn though empty now and shrouded in darkness the room seemed to retain some residue of human presence stern saw no one yet he felt something a strange aura of awareness was someone watching him from a corner uneasy he moved toward the desk from which horn had interrogated him his common sense told him to get out of the library fast yet his intuition told him he was close to something important he switched onthe greenshaded desk lamp and stared at the books lining the library walls they were standard volumeg the generic fare that adorns the shelves of gentlemen of great wealth but little culture driven by a vague premonition he stepped closer to the shelves he touched the books first then the wood between them working his way to the corner of the library probing with his long fingers as he neared the corner he felt cool metal graze his fingertips he peered between the shelves just where the wood met the wall was a tiny brass knob he closed his thumb and forefinger over it then gently pulled the resulting snick made him jump but instantly a thin crack appeared around a threebysixfoot section of shelving he pushed forward slowly slipped his arm into the dark cavity and felt for a switchplate there after ten silent seconds he flipped the switch and lunged through the secret door stern recoiled in dread as blood red and black assaulted his senses the room beyond the door was small but highceilinged like an upended coffin great scarlet drapes fell from the vaulted ceiling to be gathered chesthigh by black silk sashes he felt an involuntary shudder pass through his body sewn into the center of each black sash was a glittering white medallion and crowning the center of each medalliona blackpainted swastika from the wall opposite stern a grouping of blackandwhite photographs leaped out like phantoms from a mass grave thousands of gray uniforms stood in endless rigid ranks hundreds of jackboots goosestepped down a depopulated paris boulevard dozens of young lips smiled beneath eyes that had witnessed the unspeakable as stern stared individual faces emerged from the collage of depravity goring and himmler heydrich stretcher hess and bormann goebbels they were all here fighting a growing sense of dislocation stern turned only to confront still another demon from his past rearing high above him its enormous bronze wings stretching from one corner of the reddraped wall to the other was an imperial nazi eagle speers eagle he thought with a chill risen again yet the great bird was not an eagle for its legs were engulfed in bronze flames and clutched in its talons like a world snatched from the primordial fire was a blood red globe emblazoned with a swastika the phoenix exulted a voice in sterns brain professor nattermans voice stern stared in wonder the head of the mythical bird was turned in profile its sharp beak was stretched wide in a defiant scream its solitary eye blazed with fury stern felt his knees tremble here is your egyptin eye professor the exact design the tattoo used by the murderers of phoenix the mark sketched on the last page of the spandau papers with dreamlike clarity stern remembered nattermans explanation of rudolf hesss egyptian connection this phoenix looked almost identical to the old nazi eagle but the egyptian character of its eye could not be denied the eye did not match the rest of the sculpture at all neither did the flames at the birds feet they added long after the original sculpture was cast but by whom stern wondered by a man who spent the first fourteen years of his life in egypt by a man who lost one eye sometime after by rudolf hess under other circumstances stern reflected this strange sanctum might pass for a private trophy rooma perverted version of the narcissistic shrines one often found in the homes of vain old generals but herehidden in a fortress at the end of a twisted trail that began at spandau prisonthese relics suggested something else altogether this room was no museum no maudlin monument to the past it was a time warp a place where the past had not been merely preserved but reanimated by a personality bent on resurrecting it stern felt a wild urge to leap up and tear the effigy down like marshal zhukovs russians atop the reichstag he stretched up on tiptoe then froze mounted on the wall beneath the huge phoenix he saw what he had come looking for maps and not only maps but a telephone the map on the lefta projection of the african continentstern ignored but the othera topographic survey of the northern transvaalwas just what hed wanted quickly orienting himself to pretoria he slid his finger northeast toward the splash of green that represented the kruger national park his fingernail stopped an inch short of the park border there you are he said aloud just as on the radar screen in the turret high above the location of horn house had been clearly marked with a large red h stern figured the distance from the h to pretoria at just under three hundred kilometers roughly three and a half hours overland making allowances for what appeared to be trackless wilderness surrounding horn house itself he snatched up the telephone from the desk his heart pounding thenas he punched in the number of the protea hof hotelhe heard muted voices he dropped into a crouch behind the desk taking the phone with him the voices were not coming from the telephone nor were they getting any closer stern got cautiously to his feet by moving to different parts of the room he soon located the source of the sound the voices were coming from behind the wall of photographs he flattened his ear to the wood both voices were male one much stronger than the other the stronger voice spoke with a british accent feeling his way across the wall to get closer to the voices stern touched cold metal with his right hand another knob now he understood this unholy shrine adjoined the library and study by means of two hidden doors horn had made sure that his secret sanctuary had two routes of egress taking a deep breath stern turned the knob he heard the familiar snick of metal but the voices went on talking he pushed open the door the study beyond was dim but not lightless flashes from the picture window intermittently lit the room stern could hear the rattle of small arms fire outside punctuated by the occasional burp of some heavier weapon he edged into the room and pressed himself against the paneled wall by the greenish light of a desk lamp he picked out the man with the british accent he was pointing a large pistol across the desk at a shadow seated before the window stern jumped when he heard the voice of the man in the chair a gravelly rasp full of contempt it was horn he couldnt make out all the words but the old mandespite his vulnerable positionseemed to be offering the englishman mercy this only infuriated the younger man with a cry of rage he charged the wheelchair kicked horn over then raised his pistol and jerked back the slide by god he means to kill him stern realized he started forward instinctively then he stopped a broken fork was not much good against a semiautomatic pistol yet beyond that something deep in sterns soul something angry and crusted black told him to do absolutely nothing if the old man lying helpless on the floor actually had gained possession of a nuclear weapon stern could neutralize him now by simply allowing the enraged englishman to blow his brains out perhaps that was best the next moments passed like chain lightning stern heard horn mutter something from behind the sofa the young englishman driven beyond his limit of endurance steadied his gun with both hands and prepared to fire death at last alfred he cried its long overdue stern stopped in his tracks alfred he felt a jolt of disorientation alfred horn but the old man had introduced himself as thomas homa sharp metallic click froze everyone in the room the sound was unmistakablean automatic pistol being cocked as if controlled by the same brain jonas stern and robert stanton whirled toward the sound stern glimpsed a swatch of blond hair in the shadows then the muzzle flash blinded him five in a row very fast the first shots went wild but the last two snatched the englishman off his feet and drove him through the picture window shattering the panes into a thousand glittering razors stern dropped to the floor the blond hair he had seen told him one thing peter smuts had arrived to save his master as stern peered through the darkness trying to pick out the afrikaner the study door burst open and the overhead lights flashed on what stern saw next stopped the breath in his lungs ilse apfel stood rigid at the center of the room a smoking pistol clenched in both hands she was the blond who had saved horn from his wouldbe executioner pieter smuts bounded across the room and tackled her one hand immobilizing the pistol as he knocked her to the floor she went down without a sound the afrikaner came to his feet almost instantly scanning the room for his master pieter cried a weak voice behind the sofa smuts darted to the old man and fell to his knees are you hit what no you saved me pieter linahi smuts shouted get the doctor stern heard footsteps scurrying down the hall only now did smuts notice the broken window stantons mangled corpse lay half in and half out of it his lifeless eyes turned upward open to the rain the afrikaners mouth dropped open in wonder as he realized what must have happened thank god you arrived pieter horn mumbled the swine meant to kill me i didnt think he had it in him watching ilse closely smuts righted the wheelchair lifted the old man into it then crossed the study and pulled ilse to her feet she looked no more alert than she had when smuts bowled her to the floor the afrikaner led her gently over to horn sir when i got here i saw frau apfel standing over there with a pistol raised it was she that saved you smuts made a sudden sound of astonishment its my beretta by god she shot lord granville with my bloody beretta ilses face remained expressionless but horns eyes began to shine i knew it pieter he said triumphantly she couldnt stand by and watch me die she is a true german horn rolled his chair forward and took ilses hand did you kill lord granville my child ilse said nothing shes in shock horn murmured shaking his head it is a miracle pieter fate brought this woman here to me while appreciative of ilses actions smuts would not have carried the praise so far sir he said carefully it appears to me that frau apfel acted purely by reflex she was trying to escape she saw a murder about to be committed she fired blindly to prevent it i dont think we should attach more significance to it than that ignoring smuts horn squeezed ilses hand in his own my child he said softly by your action tonight you not only saved my life but your husbands also but sir smuts protested think what youre saying silence pieter horn exploded i want half a million rand transferred to the deutsche bank in berlin under frau apfels name he smiled at ilse for the child he said pieter told me that you are pregnant my dear smuts stared incredulously at his master this was insane he had never seen the old man make decisions based on sentimentality somehow the apfel woman had acquired a dangerous amount of influence over alfred horn and that influence was obviously growing a tragic accident might soon be required a sudden roar from outside rattled the shattered window from his position by the hidden door stern saw a line of tracers arc out toward the rim of the bowl what of the attack horn asked the house is secure smuts said tersely and oberieutnant luhr a good man thats him firing the vulcan horn smiled i imagine your little toys came as something of a surprise to roberts friends eh smuts grinned nastily do you know who they are yet well round up the bodies tonight then well see horn nodded then turned to ilse and spoke softly pieter will take you to your husband now a matter of minutes do you hear me child motionless until now ilse suddenly began to shiver a single tear streaked her face she looked as if she might collapse take her now pieter horn commanded schnel sir the afrikaner snapped into motion realizing that he had only moments to reach safety stern ducked back into the shrine room and reached for the telephone he was about to punch in the number of the protea hof when he heard a voice coming from the phone his throat tightened in disbelief who could it be one of smutss soldiers did it really matter closing his palm over the mouthpiece stern stuck his head back through the little door he saw the vulcans bright red tracer beam climb the distant ridge searching out more victims horn too had wheeled his chair around to watch the tracer beam jinked back and forth beyond the dark horizon steadied a moment then lurched into the sky for an instant the end of the deadly arc became visiblethen it detonated in a huge fireball the shock wave blasted a sheet of rain and glass into the room several shards fell onto horns lap but the old man didnt seem to notice he reached for a button on the arm of his wheelchair preparing to turn stern hunkered down hoping to see the gray face once more in the light he heard the hum of the wheelchairs electric motor saw the face in profilethen his survival instinct overrode his curiosity he scrambled back into the secret room and pulled the door shut behind him when he put the phone to his ear the voice was still talking with a silent curse he slipped the receiver back into its cradle there would be no call to hauer stern estimated he had less than a minute to become professor natterman again alan burton lay bellydown in the mud humping it with the infantrymans desperate love even before he heard the apocalyptic roar of the vulcan gun he had seen the deadly tracer beam reach out from the tower now the gunner was raking repeatedly over the corpses of the colombiansfor corpses they surely were when a stream of armorpiercing slugs intersects a human body at the rate of sixtysix hundred rounds per minute the result cannot be described burton had seen it before he had no desire to again apparently alberto did four times already the big guerilla had lifted his head over the rim of the bowl to watch the slaughter the last time he must have gotten his fill because burton could hear the giant african whimpering beside him in the mud when one of their escape helicopters exploded behind them alberto began babbling to himself the incoherent syllables sounded vaguely religious to burton and the englishman decided that a bit of prayer might not be out of order even for a confirmed old sinner like himself when the terrible roar of the vulcan diminished to desultory bursts alberto tried to jump up and race back to the airstrip burton pressed him violently back into the mud as far as burton knew they still had one operable helicopter and hopefully a pilot but to run for it now would be suicide any idiot could see that the gunner in the turret was using nightvision equipment burton could picture the smug bastard perched up there behind his monstrous weapon waiting for one desperate survivor to jump up and bolt for the airstrip burton didnt intend to be the moron who tried that but alberto did after the vulcan had lain silent for ninety seconds the big african rose tentatively to his knees and beckoned burton to follow the vulcan burped just once the threesecond burst flashed up the slope like a lightning bolt approximately ninety bullets tore into albertos body eviscerating and then decapitating him the mangled hulk that thudded into the mud next to burton would be food for the jackals in an hour the englishman decided not to wait around to see the feast the deal be damned he thought bitterly maybe shaw will give me another chance god knows i didnt have much of one today with movements so subtle only a serpent would perceive them burton slithered backward through the mud until he dropped below the vulcans angle of fire then he jumped to his feet and ran as he never had in his life low to the ground but fast when he felt the ground rising beneath his feet he knew he was nearing the airstrip the wash brought him up short three feet of water raged through its bottom now but burton tobogganed down the steep slope as if the torrent represented safety rather than potential death hoisting his mp submachine gun high above his head he waded into the flood it took superhuman strength to hold himself upright against the current but he made it across he scrambled up the far side of the ravine in twenty seconds flat and found himself staring into the face of juan diaz madre de dios the cuban cried the helo burton gasped his chest heaving they got ours english but fidelthe other pilothes waiting for us come before they shoot the runway again they ran burton could see the airstrip ahead a glistening asphalt line horns learjet waited silently on the apron like a falcon sitting out a storm the surviving helicopter stood about forty meters from the lear only twenty meters from the stillburning wreck of its sister ship burton heard its rotors whining as he neared the runway running full out then the whine was swallowed by the furious ripping sound of the vulcan burton looked back he saw the tenible tracer beam race across the bowl leap over the wash and streak up behind them run he screamed at diaz the cuban needed no prodding he was ahead of burton already the tracer beam actually passed between the two men as it raced toward fidels chopper churning the earth into a furrow of death then it happened fidel lost his nerve seeing the tracers closing in on him he simply could not control his panic with the only survivors of his team less than thirty meters from his chopper the terrified cuban lifted off diaz screamed for his comrade to wait but the errified pilot ignored him burton had seen this a hundred times before slowing his sprint he unslung his mp and dropped to his knees the only way to stop a panicked man from bolting was to put an equal or greater throat in front of him burton sighted his submachine gun in on the windshield of fidels chopper and squeezed off a threeround burst are you loco diaz screamed youll crash him signal him to put down fidels chopper bucked wildly hovering ten meters off the ground unaccustomed to firing the vulcan jijrgen luhr had missed the chopper on the first pass tracers danced wildly above the choppers rotors diaz signaled frantically for his compadre to put down but fidel still seemed uncertain of where the greater danger lay burton convinced him with a sustained burst that fragmented the choppers windshield the jetranger dropped until it hovered a meter above the runway burton dashed for its side door passing diaz on the way he leaped into the shuddering machine and trained his weapon on fidel dont take off till diaz is in the little cuban was close but not close enough without even meaning to fidel jinked his ship two meters higher down burton roared the jetranger settled then jerked up again luhr backed his tracers off about forty meters from his target and began vectoring in again this time the deadly beam held steady as he walked it in on the struggling helicopter jump burton yelled diaz leaped for the choppers right skid caught it burton got one hand on the cubans collar saw the fear and anger in his eyesthen he felt the wild impact for the briefest instant the tracer beam had sliced up and nicked diaz in the side one bullet plucked him off the skid as deffly as the finger of god the chopper yawed wildly as fidel sought to avoid the tracer beam set this whore down burton cried he fired a round through the plexiglas two inches from fidels head the panicked cuban shrieked in tenor leaning out of the side door burton saw diaz lying in the mud below one arm raised in supplication without any warning the chopper tilted ninety degrees and whether by fidels design or not burton tumbled out he caught himself on the skid and hung on with claws of desperation he felt the jetranger start to rise fidel had made his decision he was clearing out in a split second burton made his own with a curse on his lips he let go of the skid and fell six meters to the ground he landed badly but the muddy earth cushioned his fall above him fidels chopper climbed rapidly but not rapidly enough luhr had finally got the hang of the vulcan the fiery stream of slugs intersected the jetranger amidships and nearly cut it in two before the fuel tank blew the chopper fireballed like its sister ship blasting wreckage all over the runway burton threw himself over diaz as the shrapnel tore the asphalt all around them without waiting for any further fire from the vulcan he took hold of the cuban heaved him over his shoulder like a sack and started slogging toward the wash if that gunners still watching the fireball he thought we might just make it but if he saw me jump hes sighting in on us right now ten meters to the edge seven ton sped up leaned forward he leaped the two men tumbled head over heels down the steep slope and skidded to a stop at the edge of a raging flood burton made sure diaz wasnt about to be swept into the water and then he glanced around for a hiding place the cuban caught his sleeve and pulled his face down close gracias he coughed gracias english burton looked down at the tough little cuban diazs camouflage shirt was soaked with dark blood but his lips and eyes showed the trace of a smile dont thank me yet lad the englishman said quietly its going to be a long bloody night with the stealth that had carried him safely through four wars and countless intelligence operations jonas stern made his way back to the bedroom he had briefly shared with ilse his brain duummed wildly he had to get back to that telephone he had scratched a mark deep in the library door with his broken fork so that he could quickly find the secret room again but would he get another chapce horns security chief would surely check the bedroom soon the afrikaner would naturally assume that professor natterman had tried to escape with his granddaughter and when he found stern waiting here what would he think would he believe that natterman had sat like a rabbit in an open cage while his granddaughter risked her life to escape stern had heard horns promise to spare hans apfels life but he doubted if the old mans clemency would extend to ilses grandfather to survive the next few minutes stern knew he would have to find some plausible reason for having stayed behind while ilse fled boot heels were already pounding up the hall when he remembered the zinoviev notebook snatching it from inside his shirt he darted to the little writing desk mussed his hair and opened the leatherbound volume at the middle the boots stopped outside his door chapter thirtyseven stern did not look up when smuts opened the door he pored over the thin black volume as if it were a lost book of the bible the afrikaner stood silent for some time watching him what are you doing professor he said finally reading stern muttered i can see that snapped smuts where is your granddaughter i have no idea how did she get out of this room stern looked up at last she picked the lock with what a fork from your dinner table i believe smuts frowned why didnt you go with her stern shrugged she is young i am old with me along she would have little chance of escape without me who knows she did not escape smuts said smirking stern sighed and let a hand fall from the desk to his knee will you bring her back to me please impossible she must pay for her insolence recalling horns promise of mercyto ilse stern suppressed a smile as he brought a hand to his forehead shes only a young girl who wanted to find her husband where is the crime in that herr horn will decide smuts answered stiffly i think youre lying professor you tried to escape and failed didnt you you ran into the shields you underrate my devotion to history young man stern laid a hand on the zinoviev notebook this volume is a treasurea lost fragment of history already ive learned things my colleagues would trade a limb for smuts shook his head slowly youre past it old man you cant see anything can you i see that this book is far more valuable than the rubbish hans found at spandau ill tell you what that book is professor smuts snarled its your bloody death sentence only one man has read that book and remained alive and youve already met him smuts reached for the doorknob enjoy it while you can he said and went out stern stared at the closed door he knew he could pick the lock again but the afrikaner might be waiting for just such an attempt he took a deep breath and rubbed his temples he was sweating sixty seconds ago he had seen something so shocking it had wiped the ghastly nazi shrine room from his mind it was the book zinovievs notebook the moment he had opened it the moment before pieter smuts marched into his room stern had seen the strange black characters marching like foreign soldiers down the page cyrillic characters paragraph after paragraph of laboriously handwritten russian covered the lefthand page and on the rightneatly typewritten on an old german machinestern had seen what he prayed was a german translation of the russian handwriting but what had so shocked himwhat had blown everything el e out of his mindwas his nearcertainty that the cyrilslic characters had been written by the same hand that wrote the fire of armageddon note warning of danger to israel in the same note which had said the secret of that danger could be found in spandau now he leafed quickly through the thin volume the pagestwenty in allwere merely sheets of heavy typing paper glued amateurishly into a leather spine the same strange configuration over and over first russian then german stern could not verify his intuition about the author of the spandau note the note was in his leather bag back in hauers room at the protea hof but he did not need to verify anything he knew he closed the black notebook and reread the name on the cover v v zinoviev who was this mysterious russian how was he tied to the rudolf hess case if zinoviev had warned israel in of some apocalyptic danger had he voluntarily given this book to alfred horn stern shivered with a sudden rush of deja vu alfred horn the name buzzed in his brain like a swarm of bottleflies where had he seen it before in some intelligence report on some tattered list of nazi sympathizers crossing a desk intel aviv he forced his mind away from the question he forced himself to think of the telephone the phone that waited in the bizarre nazi shrine room to think of hauer and gadi waiting anxiously for his call he had to make contact with them yet in spite of ilses warning about a nuclear weapon in spite of his conviction that israel actually was in danger stern felt oddly certain that the key to the whole insane businessboth past and presentlay within the thin volume in his hand if the papers hans apfel found in spandau prison proved that prisoner number seven was not rudolf hess what did this strange book reveal horn had saidit related to may of did this book finally reveal the secret of rudolf hesss real mission to england did it name hesss british contacts did it reveal the full scope of the threat to israel could it silence the maddening hum at the back of sterns brain when he heard the name alfred horn this notebook he thought not the spandau papers is professor nattermans rosetta stone of i only hope i live to tell the oldfool about it stern opened the black cover and began to read i valentin vasilievich zinoviev here record for posterity thefacts of my service to the german reich specifically my part in the special operation undertaken in great britain in may known as plan mordred i do so at the request of the surviving reich authorities to the best of my ability adding or omitting nothing i was born in moscow in to vasili zinoviev a major in the army of alexander ii at seventeen i became a soldier like my father but after rising to the rank of sergeant i was recruited into the okhrana the tsars secret police i was promoted rapidly there some of my colleagues criticized my methods as overly harsh but no one denied the results i achieved looking back on the bloodbath of i believe many of those same colleagues would say that my methods were not harsh enough but they are dead now and that is another story when i received word in that tsar nicholas ii and his family had been executed by the bolsheviks i decided to make my way to germany strange to choose the vanquished nation as my sanctuary but i did of all the western nations i had admired prussias military most the journey was a nightmare europe was a shambles but by using okhrana contacts i finally managed to pass through the frontier into poland from there i had little trouble germany was in chaos the people were starving armed gangs roamed the streets at will preying on the unwary and stripping returning soldiers of their decorations chief among these gangs were the spartacist communists i could scarcely believe i had fled lenins revolution only to find more of the same madness awaiting me quickly seeing how things stood i offered my services to a band of friekorps one of the groups of german exofficers and enlisted men who were trying to reestablish order in their country the friekorps leadership appreciated my special talents and put me to work immediately these were farsighted men even at that early stage they were planning for the next war at their request i refrained from joining the nazi party throughout adolf hitlers rise to power they preferred to use me as a cats paw whenever actions were required where absolutely no risk of being traced back to the party could be tolerated because the chief enemy of the nazis was the communist party i proved invaluable and soon came to the attention of heinrich himmler reichs hrer of hitlers newly created ss m though i never developed more than the most superficial personal relationship with this strange character i admired his efficiency himmler saw to it that some of my okhrana methods were taught to members of his counter intelligence unitthe sd it was through these endeavors that i came to know a promising young officer named reinhard heydrich because of what happened later i should mention my service in spain in i accompanied germanys condor legion to spain to help generalissimo franco in his struggle against the republican forreswhich were actually controlled by the spanish communists and a few generals borrowed from stalin i served as an interrogator my chief responsibility being interrogation of communist prisoners it was this eighteenmonth period that would later rise up to thwart my greatest mission but who could foresee it then back in germany i worked closely with heydrich on a special program which i had helped initiate after the communist uprisings in germany because yet another world war seemed inevitable certain nazi leaders expressed a desire that we should infiltrate not only the german communist party but the communist organizations in those countries likely to be enemies of germany in the next war by we had put a large number of agents in place and by we had the most extensive anticommunist intelligence network in the world there were losses and defections of course but the strategy remained sound two years later january hitler informed heydrich that a powerful highly placed clique of nazi sympathizers existed in england men who wished to arrange a peace treaty with germany these englishmen claimed to be in a position to seize their government if only two obstacles could be got out of the way the main obstacle was winston churchill who considered adolf hitler his personal nemesis the second was king george vi who unlike his dethroned older brother was a fervent antinazi hitlers english sympathizers saw this dethroned brotherthen called the duke of windsoras a malleable alternative british monarch hitler charged heydrich with removing the human obstacles to this alliance and heydrich naturally turned to me because an anglogerman alliance would virtually guarantee the destruction of stalins regime i volunteered immediately heydrichs plan though complex in execution was simple and ingenious in theory we would assassinate both churchill and the king then lay the blame on our archenemies the communistsjust as the nazis had done with the reichstag fire to accomplish this heydrich envisioned using one of the british communist cells infiltrated by our agents he asked if i thought we might dupe one of these groups into carrying out the assassinations for us and i must admit that i expressed pessimism the revelation of the hitlerstalin pact of had disilsioned communists around the world consequently i considered the chance of finding western communists still fanatical enough to attempt a suicide mission very small but heydrich was undaunted on his orders i set to work bringing his plan to fruition the communist cell i chose for the operation was based in london and from our point of view was under the command of one helmut steuera former wehrmacht sergeant this helmut deserves special mention for helike the unit he had createdwas uniq helmut had been spying on communists since munich where he was sole survivor of the massacre at the hauptbanhof when he fled to britain on our orders the british communists welcomed him as a hero his bond with them was so strong that when these communists went to spain to fight in the international brigades in helmut went with them heydrich could not believe it it was an insanely dangerous thing for helmut to do but i understood he was a young man then a man of action and he craved danger in spain he fought heroically for the republicans all the while feeding to the fascists information on the movements of the very armies he was fighting in helmut lost an eye at guernica and probably because of the accuracy of his own reports it was truly a miracle that he survived at all yet his service in spain made him irreproachable in the eyes of his english comrades after returning to englandstern stopped reading his heart was pounding he put his finger to the paper traced the sentences backward and read again helmut lost an eye at guernica my god he muttered ive found you out at last alfred horn youre not rudolf hess and youre notzinoviev either sterns mind raced as he tried to assimilate this new information there actually was a helmut involved in the hess affairjust as the oxford draft research had claimed professor natterman would be extremely disappointed to hear it stern heard himself laughing it all fits he thought with satisfaction i simply couldnt accept the idea that rudolf hess had survived the war that he had wormed his way into south a icas power elite and i was right fr well he murmured lets find out exactly what helmut the great german spy did during the war stern picked up reading zinovievs narrative where he had left off after returning to england helmuton our ordersorganized his own communist cell it was small six men not counting helmut and every man had been seriously wounded either in the great war or in spain in his communiques helmut called them his verwunden brigadethe wounded brigade these men had come from the british working class and no men everfelt more betrayed by their government than they the flower of their generation had been slaughtered in the great war yet they had survived and when a neighboring republic was threatened by a newly risen german monster their government had not only turned its back but disparaged its sons who went to defend the democratic ideal that their friends and brothers had died for in the great war there is no hatred like that of idealistic men who have been betrayed even the hitlerstalin pact had not disillusioned these men they saw it merely as an adroit political move by stalina temporary alliance that would be rescinded as soon as russia could defend herself against germany if any englishmen could be made to take up arms against churchill and their king i knew it was helmuts verwunden brigade i arrived in london in april of armed with secret documents bearing the signatures of the highest officials of the soviet communist partyall excellent forgeries of course this deception was risky but necessary no communist cell howeverfanatic would undertake an operation of the magnitude we planned without the full weight of the party international behind them my mission was to symbolize this authority i was the holy messenger sentfrom moscow the sacred city and the documents i carried sanctified my crusade they made the planned assassinations sound like the first shot of a worldwide communist revolution one document even bore stalins signature the sd forgers had done their jobs so well that i myself was tempted to believe in my newfound power of the operation itself there is much to tell and yet little the mechanics were relatively simple from english collaborators and german agentsinplace we received regular reports on our targets daily movements along with predictions of their future agendas that part was easy churchill tramped all over the country with his fat cigar inspecting troops or viewing airraid damage with an assassin willing to die in the deed the prime minister was as good as dead king george presented a more difficult problem but not insurmountable though better protected than churchill he occasionally left buckingham palace to put on a show of solidarity with the common people what made the mission impossibly difficult was hitlers commandment that the operation be carried out on the tenth of may limiting the mission to a single day meant that our assassins would have to strike regardless of circumstances i wasnt concerned about their chances of survival on the contrary we wanted to insure that the assassins would be killed in the accomplishment of their mission but i also had to be reasonably sure that the targets would be sufficiently exposed for our men to reach them when i expressed my apprehension to heydrich however he assured me that hitler had devised a diversionary ploy that would bring our targets into the open on the given day at the time he would tell me no more than that with helmuts help i set to work selecting our assassins we had decided to choose three menone man for each target with one backup man i n case of unforeseen circumstances the men we ultimately chose were named william banks and william fox i shall neverforget them the confusion caused by the similarity of their names was circumvented by their nicknames banks a redhaired giant was known as big bill and the more diminutive fox as little bill the backup manselected by helmutwas a distasteful little fanatic named sherwood this sherwood almost wrecked the operation on the first day during the spanish war hed been captured at jarama and the first time he saw me he turned pale as a fish when helmut asked him what was wrong i spoke little english sherwood asked if i had ever been in spain naturally i said i hadnt whereupon the little man told his comrades that i could have been the twin brother of a certain el muerte sadistic russian interrogator who worked for the germans in spain helmut laughed outright and the rest o us joined f in all but sherwood the memory had shaken him badly it had shaken me too in spainwhere i had used my okhrana methods ruthlesslythe communists had christened me el muerte my job was to motivate banks and fox to carry out their suicidal attacks helmut had prepared them well and this made my role much easier from the day he founded his tiny cell helmut had promised his disenchanted men that when the revolution came they would be called on by moscow to carry out the first strikes against the iniperialist oppressors my years in the okhrana had given me an encyclopedic knowledge of communistmethods and terminology and i used it to the full in dealing with these englishmen i told them solemnly that hitler intended to break his pact with stalin and attack russia within thirty days to this terrifying news i added the usual stalinist drivel e that while the industrialized nations would eventually fall like rotten apples from the tree the war had presented an opportunily we could not afford to let pass now was the time for revolution i cried with passion and the names of the martyrs who struck down the imperialist leaders would be engraved forever in the histories of the new world stalin i told them had decided to save russia and ignite the worldwide revolution in one daring stroke not only were churchill and george vi to die but the leaders of imperialist france and the fascist leaders of italy and germany the forged documents i carried added the weight of holy writ to my tale and these two englishmen accepted it all with grave pride it was a sobering thing to seetwo men who had fought so bravely for their homeland agreeing to bring it to its knees of course in their minds they were liberatorsdowntrodden proletarians who would free their fellowcountrymen from the clutches of warmongers like churchill one week before the target date we received reports that churchill would be spending the weekend of may th at ditchley park a private country house owned by a friend the king of course would be at buckingham palace soon after i received a coded message from heydrich outlining the diversion that hitler would provide the fuhrer had ordered an air raid on london for the night of may thto occur simultaneously with our mission and not just any air raid heydrich said but the largest bomber strike yet visited on the city hitler believed that such a raid would not only provide us with a perfect diversion but would also demonstrate to the english the futility of continued struggle against germanythe moment i read this message i decided to change the strike date to may th regardless of hitlers orders i knew that our targets would not leave their protected shelters during the air raid and if our assassins attempted to break into ditchley park or buckingham palace they would be shot dead long before they reached their targets but on may thwhen both churchill and the king would emerge to view the unprecedented bomb damage of hitlers raidthe chances of success would be highest the weapon we chose for the attacks was the british sten gun although prone to jamming the sten was easily concealable and insured that a high number of bullets would penetrate the targets each man was to carry a revolver as a backup in the event of a jam five days before the strike date i suggested to helmut that we dismiss the alternatesherwoodfrom training helmut agreed and informed sherwood of the change from this moment on things began to go wrong first big bill banks the man assigned to kill churchill refused to remain in the safehouse during the final days before the strike date his parents lived in london and he wanted to spend his last days with them helmuts best efforts could not change the mans mind little bill foxthe man assigned to king georgehad no family and agreed to stay in the safehouse with us together we passed the days playing cards and listening to the radio at night around tenthirty big bill would show up to make sure the plan had not changed twice during this period sherwood found an excuse to break orders and come to the safehouse i should have found some way to kill the bolshevik rat but since liule bill was with us all the time i couldnt risk doing it in the house i thought of ordering helmut to slip out and kill sherwood but i must confess i had some doubt as to whether he would do it helmut had lived withandfought bthese englishmen for years and i could see that the inevitability of their deaths was beginning to weigh upon him helmut wasnt disloyal but the strain of living a perpetual lie had started to build up in him to a significant degree because of this i let the sherwood matter go unresolved on may ththe final night before the strikethe atmosphere in the house was electric we had a car parked behind the house filled with blackmarket petrel every minute it sat unattended was another minute of increased risk around ten pm we heard the first luftwaffe bombs falling outside they were far away from usheydrich had seen to thatbut the noise was still frightening i began to worry by eleven pm big bill had still not arrived i began to wonder if he had lost his nerve or evengod forbidif he might have been killed in the air raid his lateness did not help foxs resolve either the little man paced the room like a prisoner in solitary confinement at elevenfifteen disaster struck the door burst open and big bill stormed into the room his eyes blazing theyre dead he shouted like a madman dead dead dead i will neverforget his huge redface shaking in anguish i couldnt imagine what he was screaming about but he soon told us both his parents had been killed in the airraid he wailed burnt blacker than coat he wanted revenge revenge on goring on the luftwaffe and most of all on hitler i tried to turn this catastrophe to our advantage banks would have his revenge i said tomorrow hitler would be killedjust as churchill wouldby a communist martyr just like banks what better revenge could his parents have when i mentioned churthill however a strange look crossed bankss face then an odd calm settled on him i wont do it he said simply i almost collapsed what i cried speaking in a voice almost too low to hear banks said that all along churchill had been the man who had stood up to hitler that no mauer what extremes of capitalist greed churchill stood for churchill wanted hitler dead it seemed that this alone was now enough for big bill banks the s f man anatical communist zeal had disappeared in the blink of an eye i wanted to shoot him on the spot i could see that his uncertainty was having a similar effect on fox immediately i redoubled my efforts to convince banks to push on helmut did his best to help me and after several minutes of emotional appeals banks started to come around somehow helmut had redirected bankss anger onto churrhill it was churchill whod brought the air raids down on england he said churchill whod actually killed bankss parents big bill took hold of his sten and began marching around the room a snarl on his lips and tears in his eyes his rededication steeled fox for his task and i believed that our mission might yet succeed but disaster struck again this time in the form of sherwood we heard the groups secret knock at the door helmut answered it ready to brain whatever fool had broken his order not to come around the moment he unlatched the door sherwood burst in with a revolver and ordered me against the wall jabbing the gun at me he told the others that i really was el muerte the russian torturer from spain i calmly called the man a lunatic and told him he was about to wreck the greatest strike for world communism since sherwood laughed wildly both helmut and linle bill fox urged him to put the pistol down but the fanatic showed no reluctance to point the gun at his own countrymen if they interfered sherwood stepped up to me and laid the barrel of the pistol between my eyes tell them he said tell them who you really are i could almost see helmuts brain spinning no one suspected him yet but he had to be careful comrade zinoviev comes from moscow he told them from stalin himself dont bring stalins wrath down upon us but helmut words had no effect on sherwood he thinks were fools bill sherwood shouted to banks wants us to kill our own king he does wants us to kill churchill and help hitler banks looked confused why would a russian want that he asked sherwood sherwood scowled aye he a russian bill but hes no communist hes a tsarist killer and a bloody nazilover too arent you he said jabbing me with the revolver i told sherwood he was mad all the while praying that helmut had a pistol on him this couldnt go on much longer i knew and it didnt sherwood suddenly called out a name and a ragged old man shambled through the door my blood ran cold before me stood the interrogators nightmarene of my former victims a man whose arm i had ordered broken in several places i could not conceal my shock the man had only one arm now but i remembered his face from spain while sherwood pointed his pistol at me the old man raised his one arm and slapped me in the face bastard he said then he turned to the others and said this is el muerte sherwoods eyes sparkled with glee little bill fox stood shaking his head in disbelief sherwood took two steps back and steadied his aim he meant to kill me on the spot in that moment helmut saved my life he jerked a knife from his pocket and buried it in sherwoods heart the stunned englishman staggered back gurgled once fired the pistol and fell dead everyone in the room stood still not quite sure what had happened i had the insane notion that we might yet salvage the mission thenin aflash of insightbig bill banks understood it all youre a nazi he said to helmut his face slack with astonishment youyou always have been he looked like a shellshocked recruit but you fought with us at jarama he mumbled and madrid helmut tried to deny it but banks heard nothing his eyes narrowed and his lips grew white and thin it was the killing lookid seen it a hundred times before had banks simply shot helmut i would not be here todaybut banks was a huge man and his instinct was to smash what he hated with his hands clutching the sten gun like a bat he smacked its stock across helmuts face i felt helmuts blood hit me as it sprayed across the room he staggered but held his feet dazed he tried to reason with banks but the englishman raised the sten above his head and brought it down on helmuts skull helmut crumpled to the floor bankss fury at the loss of his parents had been unleashed and nothing short of death could stop it fox and the old man who had pointed me out backed against a wall cowed by the violence of their comrade as banks raised the sten once more i snatched up foxs sten from the table pulled back the bolt and pointed the gun at banks the man did not even notice me i could have cut him down at that instant but i hesitated by killing him i would be admitting that my mission hadfailed of course it already had but i could not yet accept that my finger quivered on the trigger how could this specter from my past have traveled to this very room after so long and the bombshow could they have fallen right on bankss house how could it possibly have happened i saw banks bring the sten down once more ontoor rather intohelmuts skull and i pulled the trigger whirling around the room in fury i cut them all down in seconds then bolted for the car i had just got it started when i remembered my forged papersmy orders from moscow dashing back inside i searched for my suitcase but couldnt find it in the main room i checked the kitchen found nothing then returned to the room where the bodies lay i caught sight of my case in a dark corner i started toward it then froze a pair of tall workboots stood beside it and standing in the boots was a thick pair of legs bill banks the redhaired giant had somehow gotten to his feet and he still held his sten he wobbled then fired he hit me twiceonce in the right arm once in the right shoulder i had no choice but to rum at worst i thought the forged papers implicated stalinnot hitlerso i ran i cranked the old car and in the confusion of the air raid i managed to escape to the countryside east of london i used my escape plan just as if the mission had been accomplished i lay low for a few days on the british coast with a german agent who maintained a radio link with occupied francethen crossed the channel to safety i served out the remainder of the war in heydrichs sd and near the end fled with some others to south america my dream of returning to my native russia was crushed forever in i must live with the knowledge that the terrible shadow my motherland lives under is in no small part due to my failure in england in the spring of surely that knowledge is punishment enough for my failure signed v v zinoviev paraguay witnessed rudolf hess paraguay sterns stomach rolled rudolf hess good god what did it mean had hess survived the war after all had he fled to paraguay with zinoviev after his failed mission but what of helmut the daring german spy with the eyepatch had he really died from his terrible beating or had he somehow managed to escape and eventually make his way here to south africa stern felt more confused than he ever had in his life how are hess and zinoviev connected he wondered where did their lives intersect nowhere in zinovievs account was hess mentioned yet the date of the planned assassinations simply couldnt be coincidence hess had flown to britain on may the exact date that zinoviev had been ordered to kill churchill and the king so why had hess been ordered there at all abruptly stern stood and closed the notebook of course zinovievs failed missionthe double assassinationas important as it was was merely preparatory the real objective was the replacement of churchills governmenta coup detat that was hesss part of the mission the political side but what had gone wrong the bombs had fallen as hitler ordered but churchill and the king had not as far as stern knew no assassin ever got close to either leader on may so where did that leave the british conspirators who had planned to replace them where did that leave the real rudolf hess whatever hesss mission had been zinovievs failure had blown it so where had hess gone when his mission failed why didnt he go straight back to germany why run to paraguay where he had ap patently witnessed zinovievs document many nazis fled to south america after the war patently witnessed zinovievs document many nazis fled to south america after the war had hess been one of the first to go and had he gone alone no somehow stern realized somewhere hess had met zinoviev before paraguay had it been in germany or was it in england on the run after the failed mission ill bet dear helmut of the one eye could answer that question stern thought wryly and ive got the oddestfeeling that hes sleeping in this very house stern hurriedly reconstructed hesss flight in his mind if what the spandau papers said was true the real hess had taken off from germany picked up his double in denmark then flown across the channel and reached the scottish coast around ten pm the real hess had bailed out over holy island then the double flew on directly over dungavel castlehis supposed targetall the way to the western coast of scotland there he had turned paralleled the coast for a while then flown back toward dungavel and parachuted into a farmers field a few miles away why was the double needed at all stern asked himself as a diversion he pictured the lonely frightened german falling from the scottish skyan image that had captivated the entire world what had been in the doubles mind at that moment in the spandau papers he had frankly admitted ignorance of the real hesss mission all the double knew was that the scheduled radio signal from hess had not come and rather than kill himself as ordered he had bailed out of the messerschmitt broken his ankle and then when a shocked and sleepy scottish farmer approached him he had claimed to be rudolf hessjust as hed been ordered to do had the proper signal come stern felt the breath leave his lungs in a rush my god he thought the double had not claimed to be rudolf hess not at first anyway he had not given the farmer hesss name but another namea name always thought to have been a cover but that was ridiculous stern realized because rudolf hess was the doubles cover name after his failure to swallow the cyanide pill after his bloodcurdling firsttime parachute jump the confused pilot had given the farmer his real name and his real name was alfred horn stuffing the zinoviev book under his shirt stern snatched the broken dinner fork from beneath his mattress and went to work on the door lock thirty seconds later he switched off the light and peeked outside two soldiers wearing khaki uniforms and carrying south african r assault ill guarded both ends of the dark corridor apparently the tive attack held prompted pietersmuts to post sentries against anyone who might have leaked through his defenses or perhaps stern thought desperately perhaps horns arab friends are scheduled to return sooner than i thought with his chest pounding he eased the door shut and slumped against it he had to find a way out he knew exactly where he wanted to go and it wasnt to the basement in search of frau apfels alleged nuclear weapon nor was it to the shrine room telephone to call hauer all he could think about was something professor natterman had reminded him of during the flight from israel something he had known for so long that he had forgotten it something about rudolf hess chapter thirtyeight pm horn house hans and ilse lay in darkness in the opulent main guest room of horn house they left the light off for they knew each other better without it ilses face wet with tears nuzzled in the hollow of hanss neck piled upon the tortures she had already endured killing lord granville had caused ilses brain to spin a protective cocoon around itself after a time though the barrier began to thin and stretch whin it finally broke the tears had come and she began to answer hanss questions his first was about the baby and ilses confirmation of what he had been too frightened to believe engendered a deep and dangerous tension within him his left hand stroked ilses cheek but his right fist clenched and unclenched at his side dont worry she whispered from the darkness herr stern is going to help us hans went still who herr stern i thought you knew about him he came here impersonating opa hes come to help us what hans rolled out of the bed stumbled over to the wall and found the light ilse what have you done she sat up nothing hans my oandfather is here in south africa hes with your father in pretoria herr stern is working with your father hanss eyes grew wide ilse this must have been some kind of trick to get you to talk what did you tell them nothing hans i dont understand it all but herr stern came here wearing opas jacket and the kidnappers plainly believe that he is my grandfather my god where is my father now did this man stern say he told methat he left your father opa and three israeli commandos at a hotel in pretoria theyre waiting for instructions from stern right now israeli commandos hans felt as if he had stumbled into a madhouse where is stern now i dont know they were holding us together but we split up when we escaped who is this stern hans asked irritably how did he even become involved hes an israeli he met opa at the cabin in wolfsburg he is a good man hans i could feel it he told you he had commandos with him how old a man is he ilse shrugged somewhere around opas age i guess and this is the man whos going to get us out hes done more than anyone else that stung hanss pride but he tried not to show it if ilse could cling to her optimism all the better but might they really have a chance had his father somehow managed to organize some kind of rescue ilse he saidsoftly how can this man stern help us i dont know she said thoughtfully but i think he will jonas stern closed the infirmary door and flattened himself against the wall his heart beat like mad as he waited for his eyes to adjust to the darkness the astringent tang of isopropyl alcohol and disinfectant wrinkled his nose he had been forced to wait almost seven hours before the guards outside his room finally left their posts he had no idea if more would be sent to take their place but he hadnt waited to find out even in the dark he could make out the hightech gleam of stainless steel and glass hd eased forward after eight short steps he felt for the interior doors he remembered finding one cool metal knob he turned it and hit the wall switch he saw an empty hospital bed oxygen bottles telemetry wires a dozen other gadgets wrong room he killed the light and closed the door sliding his hands up the facing of the second door he found the warning sign he remembered three inverted triangles yellow over black radiation sterns pulse quickened as he opened the door and slipped inside there was light here the dim red glow of a darkroom safelight he moved quickly around the xray table to the file shelves one way or the other he thought here would be the proof he reached into the first compartment and pulled out a sixinch stack of fourteenbyseventeen manila folders then he crossed to the viewing screens and hit the switches harsh fluorescent light flooded the room while the viewers buzzed like locusts be pulled an exposed xray film from the top file folder and clipped it against the screen chest xray it took him a few moments to orient himself the spinal column and ribs showed clearly as strong graceful white lines against the gray soft tissues and the almost burntblack spaces of the body cavities after that it got tougher a dozen shades of gray overlapped one another in seeming chaos despite his initial confusion stern believed that what he sought should be reasonably apparent even to a layman he tried to discern the subtle differences between the anatomical parts then groaned as the outlines of two pendulous breasts emerged from the shadow of the internal organs its a bloody woman he muttered then he noticed the small radiopaque idplate image on the top left corner of the film it read linah stern unclipped the film ffimst it back into the folder and dropped it on the floor the outside of the next folder read stanton robert b he dropped it smuts pieter the next file also belonged to smuts after three more names he did not recognize he returned to the storage shelves the first folder he pulled out measured an inch thick by itself the topleft corner read horn thomas alfred with shaking hands stern removed the top film from the file and clipped it to the viewing screen it showed two views of a hand positioned to reveal a hairline fracture that stern couldnt see and cared nothing about he jerked the film from the screen and let it fall to the floor the next three films showed a series of intestinal views enhanced by the ingestion of barium sulfate these too stern let fall a comprehensive xray anthology followed grossly arthritic knees lumbar spine cervical spinestern tossed them all onto the growing pile at his feet finally he found what he wantedan xray of alfred horns chest with mounting anticipation he clipped the top edge of the film into the clamp and stepped back no breasts on this film stern began with what he clearly recognizedthe spine the ribs climbed both sides of the spine like curved white ladders the lungs were the dark ovals behind them a triangular white blob overlaid the spine the heart thought stern he knew the heart to be situated slightly left of center in the bodya fact he had learned during a silent killing course as a young man in palestine so the left lung should be here he touched the film with his right forefinger now compare check each lung against the other until ifind a discrepancy he immediately found several opaque disks the size of small coins seemed to float like celestial bodies in the dark lung spaces these disks were small scars left by a mild case of tuberculosis stern did not know this but he soon dismissed the disks as unrelated to what he sought the first suspicious thing he saw was a kind of widening of two rib bones at onespot in the left lung they seemed thicker than the other ribs more built up somehow not quite as smooth stern had an idea pulling another stack of films from horns folder he rifled through them until he found what he wantedan oblique xray of horns chesta picture shot from the side with both arms held above the head when he pinned this film to the screen the mark he sought jumped out at him like a contrail against the sky he swallowed hard raised a quivering finger to the film crossing the dark left lung in a hazy transverse line was the scar of a rifle bullet a rifle bullet fired seventyone years ago the opaque track diffused rapidly into the surrounding shadows but the path of the old bullet fragments was plainly visible with his heart pounding stern counted downward from the collarbone to the scarred areaone rib at a time four five six seven he switched back to the first xraythe posterioranterior viewand carefully counted down again this time searching forthe ribs with the strange builtup areas three four five sixstern felt sweat dropping into his eyes seven my god he murmured feeling a catch in his throat hess is alive simultaneously a voice reverberated in his brain the bomb for tel aviv is real folding the two stiff chest xrays in half stern thrust them inside his shirt between zinovievs notebook and his pounding heart he quickly gathered up the discarded films and folders from the floor shoved them back into the shelves then slipped quietly out of the xray room and into the dark hallway he sprinted to the library in the musty darkness he tripped picked himself up then moved carefully on toward the tall bookshelves feeling his way across them to the corner he found the tiny brass knob he turned it he had already resolved that if he found anyone other than hess himself inside the secret shrine room he would kill him the room was empty stern sat down behind the mahogany desk and breathed deeply he wanted to slow his racing heart above him the bronze phoenix screamed silently from the wall to his left a hundred nazis gazed at him as stern reached for the phone to call hauer at the protea hof he froze someone had been in the room since his visit across from the deskwhere there had been only red drapes beforehung gigantic oil paintingtwice lifesizeof adolf hitler rendered in muted greens and browns the dictator gazed down with sullen intensity at the jewish intruder someone had pulled back the drapes to admire the fuhrer gooseflesh rose on sterns neck his left cheek began to twitch after working his dry mouth furiously the old israeli spat a wad of mucus across the desk onto the canvas it struck hitler just above his groin stern raised his left arm made a fist and shook it at the portrait never again he vowed he lifted the phone am protea hof hotel pretoria hauer came off the bed like a fighter pilot hearing a scramble alarm gadi and aaron sat halfconscious against the foyer walls professor natterman lay on the opposite bed his right thigh wrapped in gauze his eyes halfclosed from the effect of the morphine stern hauer said its him the young commandos leapt to their feet natterman tried to sit up then lay back groaning get a pen and paper stern ordered write down everything i tell you hauer looked at gadi abrams who stood ready to copy down every syllable he repeated were ready he said go ahead stern spoke in a rapid whisper im being held at a private estate in the northern transvaal its situated halfway between the kruger national park and a village called giyani have you got that got it the house belongs to a man named thomas alfred horn horn horn thomas alfred horn behind hauer professor natterman gasped his right arm shot out and caught hauers sleeve captain hold it stern the professor what did you say natterman croaked what name did you just say gadi read from his notes horn thomas alfred horn mother of god it cant be go on stern hauer said angrily i think the professor is hallucinating no he recognizes the name hes alive natterman cried i was right hess is alive hauer pulled away from nattermans grasp stern the professors yelling about rudolf hess you can tell the old fool he was right rudolf hess is alive and reasonably well he is also quite mad natterman clawed at hauer give me the phone captain hauer held the receiver away stern said to tell you that you were right professor that rudolf hess is alive i think youre both mad natterman shook his head perfectly sane captain i understand it all now every wretched bit of it alfred horn was the name hess double gave the farmer when he first chuted into scotland my god its so obvious hauer stern snapped his voice strained forget about hess weve got a crisis here im listening mounting a rescue along the lines we discussed is no longer an option whatever security forces hess has here they were sufficient to repel a determined attack by a force larger than yours the stakes have gone up hauer up beyond belief yesterday you aked me what i was after well ive found it last night frau apfel witnessed negotiations between hess and a group of arabs for a nuclear weapon hauers eyes met gadis the young israeli was watching him like a cat i havent seen the weapon myself stern continued but i have no doubt whatsoever that it exists what about hanst hauer asked and ilse are they still alive they are but if you want to see your son alive again captain this is what you must do go to the union buildingthats the huge government building on the hill in central pretoria its floodlit every night on the diird floor you will find the office of general jaap steyn chief of the national intelligence service thats steyn jaap steyn is a friend to me and to israel explain the situation in the way you think best but you tell him he needs to mount an assault of sufficient strength to reduce a fortified position youre at least four hours away from me now so youll need to move fast and keep hesss name out of this altogether from this moment on we speak only of alfred horn just a damned minute hauer protested you think t can waltz into the offices of south african intelligence and demand a paramilitary operation on the basis of wild accusations theyll laugh me out of the building if they dont clap me in irons first theyll have no choice but to cooperate stern said evenly my name should be sufficient to get jaap steyn moving but in case its not im going to give you some information that will ensure his cooperation write down every single word of this hauer signaled gadi to hand over the pen and paper stern spoke slowly there now exists between the republic of south africa and the state of israel a secret military contingency plan called aliyah bethgadi can spell it for you later in hebrew aliyah beth means going up to zion this plan mandates the clandestine removal of hauers throat went dry as stern proceeded to describe in detail the most sensitive protocol of the secret nuclear agreements between the republic of south africa and the state of israel is that true he asked when stern had finished captain with that information you will be able to blackmail general steyn into giving you anything you want or force him to shoot me no to avoid that leave yosef behind at the hotel tell general steyn that if you dont check in with yosef by telephone at prearranged times he will forward the details of plan aliyah beth to the western press hauer sighed heavily im sorry stern yosef is dead and professor natterman is wounded some russians found us weve got corpses piled in the bathroom like firewood leave aaron at the hotel instead stern said tersely the russians also got hold of our photos of the spandau papers hauer confessed you thickheaded kraut stern exploded those rags mean nothing now you just get those troops out here hauer forced down his anger listen stern south african intelligence isnt going to give in to blackmail no matter what i threaten them with german intelligence wouldnt you must force them to ive given you the leverage but be careful horn didnt gain access to a nuclear weapon by playing recluse up in the transvaal hes probably a key figure in their defense industries trust only general steyn his loyalty to israel is beyond dispute anyone else god only knows great oh a tactical tip for you captain theres some type dr rotary cannon on the roof here and there could be any number of other surprises as well bring enough firepower to flatten this place if you have to now could i speak to gadi for a moment hauer handed over the receiver yes uncle listen to me gadi captain hauer is going to give you my instructions i want ypu to listen to him as if he were me do you understand on this mission hauer will be in command gadi clenched the phone tighter i know it ont be easy taking orders from a german but i believe hauer is the man to carry this through gadi ground his teeth i understand uncle good because we are dealing with a nuclear weapon here gadi possibly more than one and it is targeted at israel at tel aviv maybe jerusalem gadi felt his face grow hot the other crazy thing you heard is also true rudolf hess is alive if there is any way possible i mean to get him away from here and take him back to israel for trial but if i cantor if for any reason you and hauer cannot raise enough force to take this housei will locate the weapon and try to detonate it gadi felt his heart stop no uncle ill have no choice gadi anything could happen before you get here if you get here at all its like the osiraq reactor in iraq only a hundred times worse do you understand gadi wiped the sweat from his forehead god in heaven once you get within a few miles of here you and every man with you will be within the blast radius no one else will know gadi said in hebrew good boy theres one more thing once you learn the exact coordinates of horn house i want you to call tel aviv and ask for majorgeneral gur explain the situation give him the coordinates then say revelation thats the iaf crisis code for imminent nuclear emergency i doubt jerusalem would give clearance for a raid here but its worth a tiy if we fail perhaps the air force will make an attempt now gadi i must go its time to become the professor again i hope to see you soon my boy shalom gadi swallowed shalom uncle stern disconnected hauer stared suspiciously at gadi for a few moments but he decided not to press he shoved his walther into his belt lets go blackmail some spies he said separated from jonas stern by one thin wall lieutenant jiirgen luhr held the silent telephone to his ear luhr had been unable to sleep after the exhilaration of the battle and his wanderings through horn house had eventually led him to alfred horns study hed been standing by the shattered picture window through which ilse had blasted lord grenville when he saw a yellow light flashing on horns desk hesitating but a moment he had lifted the receiver and over heard the final few seconds of sterns conversation with gadi now he stood still as stone trying to comprehend what he had heard it seemed impossible apparently professor nattermanor the jew claiming to be professor nattermanhad made a call from somewhere inside this house but to whom from the little hed heard luhr could not be sure he would have suspected dieter hauer but hed heard the swine on the other end of the phone speak hebrew and hauer wasnt a jew luhr was sure of one thing alfred horn and his afrikaner security chief would be very grateful to the man who informed them not only that they had a zionist spy in their midst but that they might soon be the target of an israeli air strike with his pulse racing luhr dashed into the hall to rouse the house chapter thirtynine aiw horn house they came for jonas stern as the gestapo had come for his father in germany four heavybooted soldiers burst through the door with pistols drawn and snapped on the overhead light shouting at the top of their lungs up judin up schnell the sudden light blinded stern for he had been lying fully clothed in the darkness he leaped from the bed with his broken fork raised but the click of pistol slides made him freeze where he stood there was only one explanation for this the worst had happened somehow on the same night he had discovered that alfred horn was not who he pretended to be alfred horn had discovered the same thing about him powerful hands seized sterns arms and lifted him off his feet the soldierstheir khaki uniforms now replaced by wehrmacht grayfrogmarched him into the corridor and hustled him along at the double when stern glanced up he saw the cold black eye of a pistol barrel above it hovered the face of pieter smuts where are you taking me asked stern where do you think jew the afrikaner jeered walking backward to see the fuhrer stern stared across the mahogany desk with a lump in his throat ghostlike and gray the old man who called himself i r alfred horn sat hunched in his wheelchair an expression of bemusement on his deeply lined face as stern stared he felt a sudden stab of doubt concealed in his shirt were the xrays that he believed would prove beyond doubt that alfred horn was rudolf hess and yet the old man sitting across from him no longer looked quite as he had before now instead of a glass eye horn wore an eyepatch all stern could think of was zinovievs description of helmut steuer helmut had worn an eyepatch had helmut steuer survived his mission after all was rudolf hess really dead had helmut somehow managed to hunt down hesss xrays to conceal the truth or had both men survived could it be that hess had lived for a time as alfred horn and then after he died helmut had quite naturally taken over the false identity whatever his true identity the old man across from stern was not wearing the plain khaki uniform rudolf hess had worn as deputy fuhrer of the reich he was wearing a gray suit jacket much like the one adolf hitler had worn as supreme commander of german armed forces and suspended around his neck was the grand crossnazi germanys highest military award to sterns knowledge rudolf hess had never won that decoration pieter smuts stood rigid behind his master eyes smoldering mouth set in a grim line above him reared the bronze phoenix directly behind the maps from which stern had copied the coordinates hed given hauerstern sensed the soldiers standing behind him we seem to have a problem of mistaken identity horn said would you care to enlighten us herr professor stern stood still as a pillar of salt smuts nodded one of the soldiers behind stern smashed a savage fist into his right kidney stern crumpled but managed to stay on his feet as he straightened up the two xrays he had stolen from the medical unit made a crackling sound smuts came around the desk ripped sterns shirt open and jerked out the films he handed them to horn who held them up to his desk lamp and clucked his tongue softly youre a clever little rat arent you he growled herr stern stern struggled to hold his face immobile as his brain raced to adapt to the changing situation if horn knew his name that meant that either ilse had been made to talk or hauer and gadi had been captured stern prayed it was the former id say we have two cases of mistaken identity he said coolly smuts signaled for another kidney blow but horn raised a peremptory hand i think you know who i am he said his watery eye twinkling deputy fuhrer rudolf hess i suppose that title is long out of date after the fuhrer died his responsibilities passed to me youve pinched his uniform and decorations at any rate stern needled i thought the dubious honor of the nazi succession passed to hermann goring hess colored another vicious blow hammered sterns left kidney driving him to his knees the reichsmarschall is also dead hess said testily and the grand cross was awarded to me by the fuhrer himself secretly of course stern looked up at the old man and stared into the single furtive eye if you are hess he said what happened to helmut steuer helmut died a heros death in he was a german patriot of the highest order and i immortalized his efforts by awarding him the knights cross and the tattoo the single eye hess shrugged i needed a symbol i couldnt risk telling my associates my true identity i wanted a mystical sign that would signify their bond to me and to each other i remembered the allseeing eye from my childhood in egypt hess touched his eyepatch it certainly seemed appropriate as did the phoenix all just as professor natterman guessed how did you lose the eye stern asked hess grimaced a british bullet i had no access to a doctor until it was too late the old man jerked his finger away from his face this is ancient history i want to know what you hoped to accomplish by your ridiculous deception jew other than suicide of course stern stared back with cold assurance i have come to take you back to israel to stand trialfor the crimes you escaped at nurembergthe crimes for which your double served a life sentence in spandau prison hesss laugh was hoarse and hollow but frightening all the same you should see a psychiatrist herr stern you suffer from serious delusions of the paranoid type i will arrange for my personal physician to visit you stern waved his arm taking in the nazi regalia that covered the walls youre the one whos mad if you believe youre going to raise some kind of fourth reich in germany youre hopelessly senile hesss eye brightened is that what you think i want a fourth reich in germany im afraid the only people with whom you share that fantasy are paranoid russians and writers of pulp fiction he glanced at smuts perhaps a few german policemen he added what is it then im sure you have some master plan for german world domination hess smiled do you really think i need one the postwar world has evolved along the very lines the fuhrer predicted germanyeven when dividedis the most powerful nation in europe america has assumed britains imperial mantle and rules the seas in her stead japan rules the pacific and a lot more besides which brings us to the soviet union how far are we really from seeing russia as an economic colony of greater germany the soviet economy is almost as weak now as it was just prior to the revolution how long before it explodes when that explosion comes it will be germany who rebuilds the country well trade cash for raw materials and gain access to the enormous markets that will be opened there the final step toward economic hegemony over europe we already hold the purse strings to half the american national debt and our power and influence grow stronger every day reunification is inevitable then why destroy israel hess scratched beneath the black eyepatch for the most pragmatic of reasons i assure you in a way i almost regret having to do it sometimes i think you jews learned more from the fuhrer than anyone have you ever seen israeli soldiers at the wailing wall herr stern praying in formation it is a sight worth seeing the israelis have become the new germans isnt that a shock israel has become a supernationalist expansionist bloodandsacred soil state with the besttrained army in the world it is surrounded on all sides by enemies just as prussia was the chosen people yes just as we germans were chosen to lead the aryan race stern stared in wonder at the man before him if you strike israel with nuclear weapons youll start a war that could wipe every country off the face of the earth israel has her own bombs hess and she will use them the old man nodded excitedly im counting on israel using her bombs stern i know exactly what the zionists have in their arsenal and more importantly i know where their missiles and black bomber squadrons are targeted more than half of israels warheads are aimed not at the arabs but at the soviet union israel does this to prevent soviet resupply of the arabs in the next mideast war hesss eye gleamed but times change dont they stern old men know that best of all right now the israeli warheads point at the soviet union ten years from now they will be aimed at greater germany my god stern breathed youre trying to provoke israel into retaliating against russia with nukes when the arabs wipe out tel aviv or jerusalem with a sophisticated bomb the israeli government will have no choice but to respond in kind and where will they respond where could arabs have procured such a weapon from the russians of course hess smiled thinly i knew youd appreciate the simplicity of it sterns mouth went dry but you cant predict what will happen in a situation like that you could ignite a fullscale thermonuclear war theres no telling who might be drawn into it it wasnt my original plan hess admitted but when the british started trying to kill me last month i was forced to improvise the british are trying to kill you they know youre alivet oh yes only tonight mi sent men here to kill mea force of filthy colombians hess smiled but im afraid they are all dead now he fiddled with a pen on his desk i suppose i owe the british a debt of thanks by rushing me they forced me to think creatively and it was thus i came upon the fuhrers old palestirfe strategy the vry same year i flew to britain hitler armed the mufti of jerusalem and bade him destroy the jews of palestine only it turned out that the jews had been better armed by their zionist relatives in america i find that quite ironic since it is ultimately for the americans that i now arm the arabs what sterns eyes widened in disbelief yes jew the americans are the inheritors of the fuhrers work is that so hard to see you really are mad america is the most liberal democracy in the world hess chuckled if all the jewish tribe were so naive as you my work would be greatly simplified the americans are a strange people stern a violent people they arent nazis hess looked bemused the other day i was speaking with an american businessman on the telephone do you know what he said to me he said hitler had the right idea alfred he just had a poor marketing strategy an offcolor remark is a long way from a fascist revolution is it really i suppose that depends on whos doing the talking this man happened to be the president of a fortune company hess drew an imaginary line in the air a very thin line divides democracy and anarchy in america stern it is concealed by vast material wealth but it is there and the americans can be pushed over it they have been before and they will be again think about it whenever the nordic american has felt the existence of his values and race imperiled he has steeled himself and done whatever was necessary to insure his survival did americans shrink from interning thousands of japanese during world war two did they shrink from ruthlessly hounding down thousands of communists in the fifties in the sixties they even found a way to thin the ranks of the mongrel blacks by sending them to die in southeast asia ingenious and so subtle it would put goebbels to shame and what of their precious constitution to hell with it in time of crisis jew expediency rules stern was silent he had seen that principle in operation many times in the political councils of jerusalem and what does he face today the nordic american abroad violent terrorism arab jackals run mad with power drunk on a great tide of oil which willrun out in two or three decades but not before the savages succeed in purchasing nuclear warheads and the delivery systems necessary to threaten the civilized nations at home its even worse white americans cannot even walk the streets of their cities at night robbery murder and rape are the rule and all the work of the mongrel races armed gangs roam the streets just as in germany after the great war the defiled bloodlines drag america to her knees while in the highest circles of power your zionist rasputins work their devious schemes hess steepled his shriveled fingers but that is as it should be he said softly as it must be fascism isnt gangs of ruffians scrawling swastikas on synagogues and tearing up jewish cemeteries it is the final distillate of human society the purest system of government born in the crucible of poverty injustice and war that is why america is the last hope of the world stern it is there that the final struggle will begin hess waved his hand in disgust germany has become too fat too rich the fatherland is governed by cowards who care only for money germany could have nuclear weapons of its own now if bonn had any nerve social democrats hess spat the swine should be lined up in front of the reichstag and shot hesss solitary eye burned with evangelical fire but the change is coming jew and germany will be ready even now loyal germans in both east and west work to push the communists out when america calls germany will step forward already immigrants choke american employment lines drugs poison the small towns the people see that their government is powerless to stop the madness in a few years the pressure will be so high that the smallest spark will set off the explosion and when the spark comesbe it war or plague or economic catastrophewhen the price of patrol rockets to ninety dollars per barrel when american cars sit empty on freeways while their owners freeze in their homesthen the great change will come and it will come like a crash of lightning a new leader will rise jew and it matters not who he is like the fuhrer he will be a man of the people he will be equal to the times and when he steps forward the people will recognize him they will follow him to glory america will finally seize the reins of power she has shied away from for so long then countries like germany can stand up and play their part my god stern murmured the day of reckoning is nearly upon us jew that is why your race must be purged the incineration of jerusalem will mark the birth of the new millennium by the year the nordic race will rule over threequarters of the globe and the jews will be no more stern shook his head like a man faced with some human aberration of nature but this is so utterly insane he said il quietly have you considered your family hess have you talked to your wife to your son hess turned his face downward what could i expect from my son stern a boy raised in a germany poisoned by artificially imposed guilt a germany crippled by a psychological versailles treaty in which the people can never pay enough tears for dead jews my family has been the most painful burden of my life to watch my son on television fighting so valiantly to free the man he believed to be his father and now that horn has been murdered to know that wolf believes me dead it tears my heart to pieces so many times i have been tempted hess wiped a tear from his eye and clenched his wrinkled hand into a fist my duty to the fatherland and to history comes first i alone have survived to carry on the fuhrers work stern stared thoughtfully across the desk how have you managed to conceal your true identity when you so brazenly used the name your double gave when he landed in scotland surely the name alfred horn is known to anyone familiar with the hess case hess smiled cynically why do you assume that i have evaded detection do you think your fellow countrymen are so constrained by moral absolutes that they would feel compelled to send an assassin to my roor its been known to happen stern said oh yes hess agreed but my dear fellow i was no eichmann the socalled atrocities against jews took place long after i left germany i signed a few pieces of legislation limiting jewish social activities but that was simply paperwork hardly a reason to execute a man who can be so helpful in vital areas of your countrys national interest i dont believe you had anything to do with israels nuclear weapons program stern said angrily no jew would knowingly deal with you hess leaned his head back with scorn are you really so unworldly stern you know the saying dont look a gift horse in the mouth i have found the israelis to be great lovers of that proverb no one can afford to quibble over moral distinctions when hes shopping for a nuclear bomb not even the jews it is poetic is it not in their lust for power the jews have sown the seeds of their own destruction in its quest for nuclear weapons israel gave over its most precious secrets to south africa and i intend to give them back a thousandfold you wont succeed stern said hess smirked i presume youre referring to the telephone call you made to your associates in pretoria requesting the aid of the nis of general jaap steyn to be precise stern felt his heart stutter in all fairness i should tell you not to have any great hopes on that account the nis is thoroughly under the control of certain associates of mine respected members of the government a cruel smile plucked at the corners of hesss mouth so perhaps i shall succeed yes pieter smuts chuckled softly stern tried to still his quivering hands but the snuffing of his solitary hope for rescue drove him beyond reason with a primal scream he flung himself across the desk groping for hesss throat he felt his hands grasp the beribboned jacket then the old mans spindly necksmutss beretta crashed down on his skull and blotted out the light i am the union building pretoria hauer sat as still as possible and tried to control his frustration he had been waiting this way for almost two hours across the desk from him sat a tall sandyhaired young man of about thirty his name was captain barnard and he was one of general jaap steyns two personal staff officers captain bernard had been working a graveyard shift when hauer and gadi were ushered into his thirdfloor office by an armed duty officer the young captain had listened patiently to hauers requests to speak to general steyn but he had acted on none of them general steyn captain bernard explained never woke before seven andunless hauer could be more specific about what he meant by national crisis he would have to wait until then when barnard would be happy to call the general at home no the captain had not heard of an alfred horn who had an estate in the northern transvaal at that point hauer had resorted to blackmail he mentioned plan aliyah beth which captain barnard blandly explained was greek to me in the face of this delay gadi abrams stood and moved softly toward the door where are you going captain barnard asked sharply gadi reached for the door handleand pulled in the doorway stood the khakiclad duty officer who had brought them upstairs he leveled his pistol at gadis belly id like to call my embdssy gadi said evenly he was gauging his chances of taking the sentry before the man could pull the trigger the officer seemed to sense gadis intentions he took a quick step backward which embassy would that be captain barnard asked the israeli embassy youd best not said the afrikaner lets everyone just have a seat shall wet hauer sat still and tried to remain calm to be forced to sit here while hans and ilse waited for a bullet while stern sweated out his deception and while schneider flew toward berlin was maddening yet things could be worse they had not yet contacted the right south african but they had not run into the wrong one either hauer studied the office it was the twin of a hundred offices in berlin outside the union building was a massive colonnaded block built of ocher sandstone and crowned with twin domes it sat high atop a ridge over the capital city dominating the halogenlit valley below yet inside the building was as monotonously official as the police presidium in berlin i say there captain barnard said suddenly you wouldnt be meaning thomas horn would you thomas horn the industrialist we might hauer said cutting his eyes at gadi thomas horn has several houses throughout the country im not sure about one near the kruger park though barnards face clouded here now is thomas horn in danger hes a very important man in this country he may be hauer said carefully captain barnard frowned someone had better speak up about all this he said and damned quickly captain barnard hauer implored you must see how important this is how often do foreign law enforcement officers come in here in the middle of the night and tell you that your country is in danger not very often barnard admitted and ive half a mind to let you and your rude companion wait for the general in a police holding cell for gods sake hauer pleaded coming to his feet theres no time for that without warning the door to captain barnards office banged open and a short heavyset afrikaner with carrot hair and lobsterred skin marched in the sounds of early morning office traffic filtered through the doorway until the newcomer slammed it shut he looked quizzically at hauer then at gadi and finally at captain barnard hauer was struck with a strange certainty that the redhaired man had been summoned by the duty officer for the guard took up position in a corner with one hand on his holstered pistol whats all this then bernard the redhaired man asked sharply captain barnard stood major graaff this is captain dieter hauer of the west berlin police captain hauer this is ma or graaff general steyns senior staff officer major captain hauer claims to have very important information for general steyn he refused to discuss it with me so i decided to wait until seven and call the general as a matter of fact i was just about to call wake the general graaff looked as if he were being asked to arrange a papal audience what the devil are you men doing here out with it hauer eyed major graaff uncomfortably our message is for general steyn he said im sorry major but thats the way it has to be graaffs skin grew even redder youve got some bloody nerve jerry he turned to barnard im surprised you didnt throw these characters into a cell they mentioned thomas horn sir captain barnard said surprised by graaffs vehemence i think he may be in danger thomas horn graaffs eyes narrowed whats he got to do with this they wont say sir they wont well see about that they also mentioned what they said was a code major what was it captain hauer hauer didnt like the look of major graaff at all but hed already given the code to captain bernard maybe it would light a fire under graaff the code is aliyah beth he said graaffs eyes narrowed means nothing to me barnard gadi flushed with anger why dont i call the general captain barnard suggested its almost seven nonsense scoffed major graaff not until weve found out what these characters are up to send them over to visagie police station let the interrogators have a go at them well soon get to the bottom of this call visagie bernard have them send over a van while bernard made the call major graaff glanced disapprovingly at gadi whos this dark one then i dont like the look of him captain barnard tried once more you dont think perhaps i should call the general dont be an idiot bernard well know everything about this lot by lunchtime ill speak to the general then if its worth bothering him about theyre probably journalists trying to poke their noses where they dont belong hauer considered telling major graaff about aaron haberthe insurance they had waiting at the protea hofbut something told him to keep silent at least for the time being major graaffs police escort arrived in less than fifteen minutes they brought handcuffs but gtaaff waved them aside these buggers wont be making any trouble he laughed theyre fellow police officers after all where are their papers barnard captain barnard looked sheepish graaff shook his head damn it man its a wonder they didnt kill you and take the place over it wouldnt have mattered hauer told him were traveling under false papers are you now graaff said well lets just toddle down to the police station shall we the major shoved his prisoners through the door captain barnard got up and closed the door he was strangely irritated by graaffs remarks why didnt i ask to see their passports he wondered but he knew why because the longer he had stared into the earnest eyes of the german policeman the more convinced hed become that the man was telling the truth there was some kind of crisis going on and what was the harm in calling the general anyway jaap steyn prided himself on keeping a hand in evycase that directly affected his office and if two foreigners asking to speak to the general on a matter of national security didnt directly affect his office what did barnard reached for the phone and dialed general steyns home number he listened to it ring three times then hung up with an oath graaff was probably right better to wait until they knew they had a problem before bothering the general the visagie interrogators would know everything about the strangers in a few hours and south africas political battles kept general steyn busy enough without jerking him away from his morning coffee to deal with a nonevent captain barnard took his car keys from his desk and wrote a note to his secretary hed been working all night he was going home to shower shave and have a bite of breakfast he would be back around ten am it will all be sorted out by then he thought as he slipped out of the office but then he remembered the german policemans sober gaze and he wondered chapter forty a m mi headquarters charles street loodon sir neville shaw looked up as wilson rushed into his dim office his deputy shook a thin piece of paper in his right hand cable sir neville well read it man whats the bloody rush wilson shoved the message across the desktop personal for you sir shaw tore open the seal and read director general mis the men you sent are dead stop lord grenville is dead stop you broke a solemn agreement made more than thirty years ago stop i am no longer bound by terms of that agreement stop ive never known an englishman who kept s word stop secret now held at my discretion stop better luck next time hess shaw felt his hands begin to shake good god he murmured burtons dead he looked up his face red and blotchy wilson do you have those files i told you to get in my office safe sir i dont believe the foreign office has noticed them missing yet damn the foreign office shred those files t en incinerate them in the basement do it yourself and do it now wilson moved toward the door then paused and looked back at his superior i was a bloody fool to order swallow off the case shaw said hoarsely she could have killed hess herself wilsons eyes narrowed you mean horn sir shaw looked up with red eyes horn is hess wilson havent you got that yet wilson took a step backward shaw looked down at the wrinkled map on his desk swallow could still be in south africa he muttered by god she might be able to save us yet wilson put out a message to every resource we have in south africa anyone who contacts agent swallow should order her to call me here and if she calls us for any reason you put her through to me immediately do you understand yes sir shaws eyes sparkled with excitement by god i should have used that harpy in the first place murder has always been womans work am protea hof hotel pretoria swallow had been waiting outside room for twelve hours and her patience had almost run out in the halfdozen times she had approached the door only once had she heard any conversation from the two men inside for the hundredth time she glanced at her watch almost seven am maids would be coming on duty any moment to hell with it she thought im going in she already had a plan taking a last glance at the door she headed downstairs to use the lobby telephone inside room professor natterman lay flat on the bed in a haze of morphine fever and pain thanks to aarons expert medical training the gunshot wounds had at least stopped bleeding if not hurting the professor had spent the night wrestling with despair rudolf hess was alive as he had predicted yet he would not be at horn house to confront the old nazi and worse hauer had told detective schneider where to find his photocopy of the spandau papers wiping out any hope of his publishing an exclusive translation of the papers all night natterman had clutched his only consolation to his of the spandau pages a dawn began to creep around the edges of the dra natterman wondered when or if hauer would call back would the south africans give hauer the troops stern had told him to ask for and if so could ilse survive such an assault natterman glanced over at the other bed aaron haber lay there watching a silent television the young commando had lain that way most of the night except when he took time out to check nattermans bandages hed said he muted the sound so that he could hear anyone approaching the door natterman wiped a sheen of sweat from his brow the hotel airconditioning whooshed straight out of the window shattered by borodins sniper natterman jumped as a sharp knock sounded at the door aaron came to his feet like a leopard startled from sleep his uzi cocked and pointed at the door natterman could just see the door from where he lay as the israeli tiptoed toward it the knock sounded again aaron flattened himself against the foyer wall whos there he called messenger said a male voice telegram sir aarons brow knit in furious thought telegram from who from a meneer stern sir the young commandos blood quickened shove it under the door there was a pause im sorry sir meneer sterns instructions say i must personally give this message to one of his boys aaron nervously fingered his uzi which of his boys meneer stern does not say sir keeping his uzi leveled aaron stepped warily up to the door and peered through the peephole through the blurred fisheye lens he saw a thin young black man wearing a blue messengers uniform buttoned to the throat hold up the telegram he said the young bantu held up a piece of yellow paper too far back for aaron to read i must hurry sir he said i have other stops to make aaron muttered something in hebrew then reached for the door knob dont open it natterman warned but the young israeli signaled him to be quiet natterman heard the lock click then the door opened and caught against the chain hand it through aaron said from behind the door im not letting you in after a moments hesitation a small black hand slipped the telegram through the crack in the door aaron reached out then froze a faint scent of body powder and perfume had wafted into the room for an instant aaron flashed back to last night he heard gadis voice saying and the perfume i tell you it was the same woman the woman from the airplane in a fraction of a second aaron comprehended the danger but he was too late already a thin white hand had snapped through the fourinch space between the door and its frame the hand held a silenced ingrain machine pistol as aaron looked down in astonishment the ingrain spat three times blowing him off his feet and dropping him less than a foot from the bloody stain where yosef shamir had died twelve hours ago natterman tried to roll off the bed but he was tangled beneath the covers he heard two more spits then a clinking rattle swallow had shot off the chain latch he heard the door close then a heavy thud somehow natterman knew who the killer was before he saw her he actually stopped breathing as the pale apparition glided swiftly to aarons body with one chilling glance at natterman the thin woman bent down and tugged the uzi from aaron habers clenched hands swallow natterman thought remembering sterns words whats left of the girl whose brother stern killed while he sat on a toilet in a british barracks a million years ago swallow glanced into the bathroom she saw the russians piled like cordwood in the bathtub and yosef shamir propped against the whitetiled wall then she crossed immediately to natterman reached down and jerked his gag aside when he opened his mouth to gasp for breath she jammed the barrel of the ingrain inside it hello again professor she said in a low flat voice where is stern natterman felt the gun barrel against the back of his throat as cold and deadly as a snakes head he desperately needed to gag but he didnt dare the woman leaning over him was like a creature from a mother with bluerinse hair yellowed pearls hanging round her wrinkled throatjonas stern swallow snapped where is he natterman nodded his head carefully swallow removed the ingrain from his mouth for a momentthinking of stern and his missionnatterman considered lying he changed his mind when swallow jammed the gun barrel down onto the bloody bandage that aaron had wrapped around nattermans wounded thigh alfred horn he gasped stern went to see a man named alfred horn swallow jabbed the ingrain deeper into nattermans wound where to see alfred horn natterman felt his stomach heave somewhere in the northern transvaal thats all i know it was a blind rendezfi vous stern didnt know where he was going himsel while swallow considered this natterman looked past her to the floor he saw black skin and white eyes the messenger now he understood the second thud swallow had shot the bantu boy in the throat stern was wrong he said thinking aloud he thinks youre after him but youve come to destroy the spandau papers havent you swallows nostrils flared ive come for stern if he has the papers thats a bonus natterman glanced back at aaron the israeli had fallen with his back against the foyer wall except for the blood on his chest he looked like he was sleeping natterman remembered how innocent the young commando had looked watching the soundless television how do you do it he asked that boy was hardly more than a child swallow followed nattermans gaze to aarons motionless body she shrugged he was a soldier today was his day natterman shook his head every bullet has its billet eh king william swallow murmured recalling the quote from her wartime service youre a philosopher im a fool and youre a murderer and a hypocrite as well that boy was probably someones brother too swallow smacked natterman on the mouth with the ingrain drawing blood her eyes as cold and dark and empty as deep space settled on his face natterman had never in his life felt such fear not even as a young german soldier patrolling alone in the shadow of russian tanks outside leningrad youre going to kill me he said sotto voce not quite yet swallow lifted the telephone receiver and dialed an international number as she waited for an answer she casually pulled off her bluerinse hair nattermans eyes widened beneath the wig swallows hair was iron gray and cropped to within an inch of her skull she did not look like a grandmother anymore swallow she said harshly in london sir neville shaws heart leaped good christ where are you swallows knuckles whitened on the telephone listen to me little man im giving you one last chance to tell me where stern is hes gone to see a man named alfred horn i want to know where ill tell you exactly where to find him without wasting a second the mi chief read out the overland directions to horn house swallow repeated them as they came her head bobbing with birdlike impatience her eyes locked onto natterman when shaw finished reading the directions he said im modifying your assignment you can still do what you like with stern but i need more than the spandau papers now i need alfred horn dead you shouldnt have any trouble recognizing him hes an old man rides in a wheelchair most of the time if you kill alfred horn you can name your price swallow laughed a dry rattle her finger slipped inside the ingrains trigger guardas natterman stared in horror she reached out casually and laid the machine pistol against his cheek sir neville shaws voice warbled from the telephone swallow drew back her lips exposing her teeth like an animal preparing for a kill then her head snapped around toward the foyer she dropped the telephone and raised the ingrain what is it natterman thought wildly is someone at the door he couldnt hear anything but his hammering heart following swallows line of sight he finally realized what she was looking at with such alarm nothing where less than a minute ago the bulletriddled body of aaron haber had lain against the foyer wall only bloodstained wallpaper remained shrieking like a demon swallow fired a sustained burst into the foyer then adjusted her aim to the bathroom wz the muted barks of the silenced weapon modulated quickly into loud bangs her silencer was burning out natterman threw off the sheets and rolled off the far edge of the bed he had been on the floor for less than five seconds when the firing stopped what the devil was happening he raised his head above the line of the bed swallow was crouched at the end of the bed nearest the foyer trying frantically to clear the jammed receiver of her ingrain like a man rising from the grave aaron haber lurched up from the narrow space between the bed and the bathroom wall nattermans heart leaped with joy and astonishment dark blood covered the young commandos neck and chest but his eyes burned wildly swaying like a drunken madman he steadied his automatic and fired four shots in rapid succession swallow was so desperate to reach the safety of the foyer that she actually leaped into aarons bullets two slugs slammed into her left shoulder but the others went wild she staggered into the foyer spun around and collapsed hoping that the impact of the fall had cleared her weapon she scrambled to her knees st her ingrain around the corner and pulled the trigger aaron fired the instant he saw the gun barrel appear his bullet tore the gun from swallows hand it spun through the air and landed against the wall too far away for either of them to reach all aaron had to do was step around the corner to finish the woman off he started forward then wobbled to a standstill bright blood pumped through his shirt why doesnt she just run natterman thought angrily she has the information she wantedt and then he knew swallow meant to leave no witnesses behind a horrible coughing spasm racked aaron habers body he lunged forward gurgled something in hebrew then dropped his pistol and collapsed at the mouth of the foyer natterman peered around the edge of the bed the israeli lay on his stomach with his head pointed toward the door swallows ingrain lay at his feet nattermans heart sank the gun might as well have been ten kilometers away but as he jerked his head back behind the bed he saw something that stopped the breath in his lungshanss crossbow loaded and lying beneath the bed yuri borodins gorillas had missed it during their sweep natterman lay flat and stretched his arm to its limit swallow glided soundlessly out of the foyer and bobbed over the wounded israeli a knife flashed in the air swallow reached for aarons hair meaning to jerk up his head and slash his throat but at the last moment she leaned toward his feet and grabbed for the ingrain the decision cost her her life the instant she moved aaron flipped over onto his back and grabbed her by the waist unable to reach the ingrain swallow twisted in his arms and brought the knife down into his chest she raised it again for the deathblow but natterman struggled up over the bed steadied the crossbow and fired the razortipped bolt speared through swallows breastbone with a sickening crunch sucking for air she no longer needed she pawed the air in maniacal fury her last cry carried all the atrophied rage and pain of her unfulfilled quest for vengeance sterrm swallow collapsed on top of aaron preceding the young commando into death by only seconds natterman stumbled over to the gasping israeli and with painful effort shoved swallows corpse off his bloodsoaked chest aaron strained to raise his head then fell back and reached up to natterman for succor natterman knelt over him lie back he said youre safe now a froth of blood bubbled from aarons mouth did i stop her he asked softly she wanted stern natterman looked over at swallow lying dead with the arrow buried in her chest she looked like a locust husk spiked to a display board natterman smiled at the young israeli you stopped her tell tell gadi did my duty aaron coughed once more then he closed his eyes natterman swallowed hard this young soldier had given his life for jonas stern filled with a gudden rage natterman lurched to his feet and scrambled back to the telephone who is this he shouted speak who is this came the wary reply the british accent clear natterman felt his hands shaking your assassin is dead he yelled your secret will be secret no more he threw down the telephone moaning in pain he stripped off his shirt picked up aarons firstaid bag and began rummaging through the drug bottles he wanted lo anesthetic he needed to dull the fire of his wounds but he could not risk losing consciousness he had to be able to board an airplane under his own power he hated the idea of leaving ilse and the others behind but he suspected that if he did not get out of south africa today he might not get out at all aal mi headquailers chrigps street london sir neville shaw dropped the phone his face ashen deputy director wilson faced him from the doorway its over shaw said quietly after all this time its over what do you mean sir swallows dead theres no stopping the secret now weve fired our last shell from churchill down to me and all for nothing churchill sir neville i dont understand dont you havent you got it yet man horn is hess hess is horn the great bloody secret ever since churchill its been our sacred charge sacred charge this service wilson my office particularly it was mi who ran the original hess doublecross in we intercepted the first letter from hess to the duke of hamilton shaw lifted two sheets of paper from his desk why dont you read this old man its a memo to the prime ministertyped it myself while you were getting tea wilson stepped forward uncertainly and took the proffered pages his eyes widened as they flew over phrases that made his blood run cold dear mrs prime minister in may rudolf hess deputy fuhrer of the german reich flew to this country to assist in a coup detat aimed at the government of prime minister winston churchill and king george vi mi was aware of this plot almost from its inception and used it to buy time to forestall the german invasion of this country operation sea lion regrettably the success of the coup hinged on the participation of numerous ranking members of the wartime parliament and the nobility as well as a second accession of the duke of windsor to the throne on may prime minister winston churchill instructed this office secret finding to conceal all evidence of this anglonazi collusion on the grounds that exposure of such highranking treason might bring down the government and possibly even prevent american entry into the war events of the past five days have made the continued suppression of this information highly unlikely i must inform you that rudolf hess is alive as of this writing and is a citizen of the republic of south africa living under the alias alfred horn hess may soon reveal this fact himself or certain papers unearthed at spandau prison may do so my best efforts to silence hess and to destroy the papers have failed hesss current activities fall into the realm of the criminal and if exposed could put at risk a significant number of british nationals the family of lord granville particularly may soon be made public in this connection as it has owned and operated phoenix ag a multinational defense contractor at the bidding of alfred horn since other families of the peerage one of whom boasts a member of your cabinet have lent their names to similar enterprises in exchange for large cash payments and possibly for ideological reasons as well im afraid issuing a dnotice at this time would be counterproductive however as it would tend to indicate prior knowledge by your office of these activities the suppression of the hess information to date has only been possible thanks to the nerve and foresight of prime minister churchill in october churchill flew to moscow for a meeting with joseph stalin with him he carried copies of assassination orders that were to all appearances signed by stalin himself these orders were actually forgeries fabricated by reinhard heydrichs sd they were brought into this country by a germantrained white russian agent named zinoviev and recovered by mi on may in moscow churchill warned stalin that he would inform the world press that stalin had ordered the murders of churchill and king george vi if stalin did not cease making accusations about anglonazi collusion in the hess affair five weeks ago on the strength of secret finding i ordered the liquidation of hesss double the real alfred horn in spandau prison on my order the foreign office file on hess has been sanitized i have placed in my personal safe papers which washed ashore in scotland on may which were thought to have been ditched from hesss plane these papers contain the names of many of the british coup conspirators the war office file on hess contains damaging information on the duke of windsor which the royal family is frightfully anxious to keep buried but that file is sealed until the fo file is sealed until we should meet as soon as possible sir neville shaw director general mi ps this unfortunate situation has been complicated by the arrest yesterday of an mi intelligence analystwho for seven years made available to agents of alfred horn some of our most sensitive intelligence secrets including copies of american satellite photography three weeks ago this man inferred from information which had been requested by phoenix agi that some type of attack possibly nuclear was imminent against the state of israel in a belated fit of conscience he sent an anonymous warning to the israeli embassy in london we cannot discount the possibility that my efforts to liquidate hess prompted him to attempt some desperate action against israel but i consider this scenario unlikely alfred horn does have significant uranium holdings in south africa but the possibility that he has acquired a nuclear device is infinitesimally small deputy director wilson looked up at shaw with horror on his face you dont really mean to send this shaw raised his eyebrows of course i do as far as im concerned the hess secret is blown ill be sacked tomorrow so what do i care im tired of protecting traitors wilson its time the world learned what a heroic mission this service performed in we saved churchill and the dnd i should write it up for the king man we saved englands bloody imesp the blood drained from wilsons cheeks surely youre joking sir neville youre overwrought but im deadly serious the deputy director glanced behind him to the closed office door im sorry to hear that he said soffly he pulled a revolver from his coat pocket shaw studied the gun a bit noisy for murder dont you think too many people around wilson gave his superior a wintry smile not murder sir neville suicide shaw smiled appreciatively ah im about to crack under the strain of a failed operation eh youll discover me with my head bleeding over the hess file the mandarins will cover it up for the good of the service and youll take my chair as director general is that it wilson nodded ive been laying the groundwork ever since you locked yourself in here like a hermit the secretaries are already whispering about you shaw sighed you were horns man all along werent you as long as my efforts went toward keeping the secret you went right along but you and your bloody unclelord amersham isnt ityou didnt know that some of the conspirator families had asked me to liquidate both hess and number seven did you gutless bastards they claimed horn had gone senile that he had too much power i saw the truth though glasnost had those blueblooded cowards pissing their beds at night gorbachevs whole program was openness sweeping out the past couldnt have that could we our brave peers were scared silly that the russians might not veto number sevens release next time around shaw raised a forefinger and they were right you know two days ago i learned that gorbachev had recently indicated to hesss son that he was on the verge of releasing prisoner number seven wilson kept his pistol pointed at shaws chest how did you kill number seven without my knowledge shaw shrugged easily i used a retired sas man michael burton the whole hess business has always been run outside official channels thats why you knew nothin about the casilda but you found out in time didnt you wilsons face reddened i warned horn you warned hess about the raid my god muttered shaw you didnt even know who you were working for did you just like that idiot in mi at least his mother was south african the revolver shook in wilsons hand why was hess allowed to live why did we let him out of england at all shaw smiled humorlessly we never had hess wilson we only caught ho e double heydrich sent to confuse us we never found out how hess escaped if he came here at all mi finally located him in paraguay in the israelis and other nazihunters never found him because they werent looking as far as they knew rudolf hess was locked inside spandau prison why didnt you kill hess in paraguay shaw snorted you think your friends are afraid of the spandau papers hess knew the name of every bloody british traitor involved in the coup attempt he claimed he had taken steps that would make those names public in the event of his untimely death and we believed him but why kill number seven after all this time hed held his silence for decades why should he break it because his wife and daughter were dead shaw explained had been for years we kept number seven quiet by threatening his family just as hess must have if number seven had been released from spandau he might have discovered they were dead and we would have lost our leverage if the russians hadnt vetoed his early release every year we would have had to kill him years ago sir neville shaw steepled his fingers tell me one thing wilson how much have you told hesss people about jonas sternt nothing until today i assumed swallow would kill stern before he became a threat and i didnt want to risk further direct contact stern must have blown his cover himself two hours ago horns security chief called me and asked if i knew anything about a jew who had come after horn shaw nodded thoughtfully i suppose you intend to burn my memo yes actually shaw reached out his hand here let me shred it for you puzzled wilson handed shaw the letter then watched incredulously as the mi chief fed both pages into his highspeed shredder but why what are you doing shaw smiled dont worry theres a copy in my safe but things havent quite reached the stage where i feel compelled to send it shaw looked over wilsons shoulder to a dark corner of the large office sergeant he said crisply please arrest mr wilson the charge is treason like a thousand fools before him wilson whirled to face an imaginary threat when he looked back at shaw there was a silenced browning hipower pistol in the old knights hand sorry old boy shaw said but he had already pulled the trigger wilsons astonished eyes went blank as the bullet tore through his heart he dropped dead on the floor without a sound shaw calmly lifted his telephone and punched in a number the call was answered immediately rose here said a gruff voice with a texas twang good morning

chance that make you feel any better shaw smiled with satisfaction thank you colonel i shall be in berlin by noon il chapter fortyone am angolan airspace at eighteen thousand feet the lear a turbojet knifed southward through the sky and down the length of africa in the sumptuously appointed passenger cabin prime minister abdul bake jalloud sipped from a glass of sherry and contemplated the excited face of dr hamid sabri the bespectacled young physicist could barely restrain his enthusiasm in a matter of hours he would be shepherding back to libya the first nuclear weapon ever to stock an arab arsenal prime minister jalloud was more subdued despite muammar qaddafis repeated assurances that all was well jalloud could not shake a vague suspicion that something was not as it should be are you all right excellency asked dr sabri you look pale its the food jalloud muttered i shouldnt have eaten anything im nervous myself sabri confessed i cannot wait to return home with the device i cant wait to return home period jalloud murmured this curious statement disconcerted the young scientist he glanced through his window at theclouds below excellency he said quietly i must admit i am glad major karami is not accompanying us on this trip he makes me uncomfortable i do not believe mr horn liked him either major karami makes a lot of people nervous said jalloud glancing past dr sabri at the rear of the cabin sitting on a pile of embroidered pillows six very dangerouslooking soldiers quietly smoked cigarettes qaddafi had assured jalloud that hed ordered them loading of the weapon but jallc doubted this on the last trip two security guards had been considered adequate escort jalloud was almost certain that these men had been handpicked from ilyas karamis personal bodyguard im not so sure we are flee of major karanii he whispered cutting his eyes toward the guards dr sabri peered around the prime ministers kefflyah and looked at the sullen group dont say that he said quietly allah protect us dont even think it twentyeight miles behind the lear major ilyas karami stepped onto the flight deck of a sovietbuilt yakovlev airliner and leaned down into the pilots ear should i go over it for you again he asked its net necessary major the pilot replied good karanii laid a hand on the young mans shoulder because what i told my commandos goes for you pilots too any man that makes a mistake on this mission will lose his head when we return to tripoli the pilot strained to keep his hands steady on the controls ilyas karaitis threats were never empty and his testicles will be in his mouthkarami added the plane lurched violently as if buffeted by turbulence im sorry major the pilot croaked lowpressure pocket the copilot covered quickly major karami snorted and left the flight deck this yakovlev aircraftpopularly known as the yak had begun its life as an aeroflot jetliner then passed into libyan commercial service but for this mission major karami had ordered it configured as an air zimbabwe commercial airliner karami smiled with satisfaction as he walked through the stripped cabin of the plane lining both walls of the yak were fifty heavilyarmed libyan commandos and filling the center section from front to rear were pallets stacked high with weapons ammunition a small truck and at the rear of the cabin lashed to the fuselage by chains a millimeter artillery piece karami nodded to his company commanders as he made his way through the tangle of legs and equipment and stopped beside the small pickup truck the bed of the toyota had been padded with wrestling mats and its sides fitted with cleats sized to take chains ostensibly the truck had been brought along to tow the mm howitzer into position only major karami knew what special eargo its bed and suspension had been modified to accept when they got a little closer to their destination however karami would let his men in on the secret for what force could withstand the fury of arabs come to claim the weapon that would finally wipe the jews from the sands of palestine o aai northern transvaal republic of south africa alan burton scrambled over the lip of the wash and down the slope to where juan diaz halfsat halflay in the slowly drying mud he had bandaged the cubans wound as best he could it was crusted with blood but not suppurating diaz opened his eyes when he heard burton approach well english he croaked no chance burton said bitterly its worse than it looked last night fidels chopper blew itself all over the runway its a wonder we werent cut to pieces the tail of that lear looks like scrap metal the lateral finst diaz asked hopefully or the vertical left laterals completely gone verticals got more holes than a swiss cheese shit what now amigo diaz tried to smile we re dead men eh not bloody likely burton said with an optimism he didnt feel thats an airstrip up there isnt it this place is too damned remote to service by road its bound to be just a matter of time before another plane lands diaz squinted skeptically at the englishman and when it does sport said burton tapping his submachine gun against his chest im going to climb aboard and watch captain juan diaz fly our wet arses right out of here the cuban grinned exposing dazzling white teeth burton pulled some more brambles around the little depression he had expanded into a hiding place during the night a patrol from the house had come by just after last nights attack it had missed them but burton wasnt sure the shelter would stand up to daylight scrutiny i tell you juan boy he said wistfully its times

in vain to reach general steyn since tenthirty when the general failed to show up for work this morning barnard had assumed he was simply late but by ten am barnard knew something was wrong no one answered at general steyns home and none of the government ministries knew where he was as barnard continued his round of calls a disturbing image kept coming back to him the resolute eyes dr the german police captain barnard was certain that captain hauer believed he possessed information vital to south africas security hauer might be insane but he was sincere the afrikaner ground his teeth in frustration major graaff had told him that the visagie police interrogators would have the prisoners story by lunchtime yet bernard had received no further word regarding them bernard had never liked major graaff but in the nis like the army you had to go along to get along fspecially with superiors barnard almost jumped out of his skin when the phone on his desk rang general steyns office he answered bernard boomed a husky voice general steyn where are you im out at the pretoria office of phoenix ag the directors here seem to think that some type of shenanigans may be going on in their defense division i felt i should handle it myself phoenix works on some very sensitive projects you know captain barnard felt sweat on the back of his neck excuse me general but how did you learn about this problem gruaff called me at home this morning hes right on top of this seems hes friendly with the people over here at phoenix he was the one who suggested i handle it personally in fact where is major graaff now generait i havent the foggiest bernard general captain barnard said hoarsely i think weve got a problem pm visagie straat pretoria when general jaap steyn strode through the doors of the visagie police station the desk sergeant knew that his afternoon had just been shot to hell the chief of south africas ruthlessly efficient intelligence service was a bluff redfaced giant of a man he stalked straight up to the high desk and planted himself like an admiral on the prow of a flagship sergeant he bellowed i want to see your foreign prisoners immediately where are they urn yes sir well one is in the cellblock and the other i believe major graaff is supervising his interrogation lead on sergeant the desk sergeant wasnt sure if the nis general had legal authority to give orders to a municipal police officer but risking his career to find out didnt seem like the best of options he jumped down from his stool and led general steyn and captain barnard to a heavy steel door at the back of the station he nodded once then fled down the hall general steyn grunted and pushed open the door inside he saw two bullnecked policemen holdinga shirtless grayhaired man against a cinderblock wall the mans face was covered with sweat and blood major graaff held a rubber truncheon high above his head poised to strike that will do major general steyn said icily graaff whirled when he saw his furious general filling the door he ftoze the truncheon still above his head he looked back at his muscular accomplices but after one look at general steyn they released their bruised captive and came to stiff attention hauer slid slowly to his knees captain bernard general steyn ordered place major graaff under arrest you men clean the prisoner up and bring him and his companion to the visiting room general steyn stalked out barnard drew a pistol and leveled it at graaff give me an excuse you bloody bastard hauer faced general steyn across the long wooden table used to separate prisoners from their visitors he had a bloody towel wrapped around his bared shoulders captain barnard stood stiffly behind his superior gadi abrams sat at hauers left hauer had brushed aside their concern over his injuries and immediately gone over to the offensive i simply dont have time to explain everything you want to know general he repeated stern needs your help im afraid thats just not good enough general steyn said jonas stern is a good friend of mine a damn fine intelligence officer hes a friend to this country but i simply cannot agree to help without knowing more hauer sighed stern had told him to call out the nisin full strengthto request whatever was necessary to take alfred horns isolated fortress by storm but after what he had seen of major graaff hauer didnt share sterns confidence in the south africans who would be called upon to carry out that attack general did captain barnard inform you of the code word stern told me to repeat to you general steyns jaw muscles flexed he did and still you wont agree to help me captain hauer the south african government does not yield to blackmail if by some remote misfortune jonas stern has seen fit to confide in you the true meaning of that code wordand if you have been trumpefing it abouti may decide that major graaffs tactics were lenient do you understand now do you know the meaning of that code word hauer nodded slowly its hebrew literally it means going up to zion general steyns face flushed leave us please captain barnard barnard reluctantly obeyed general hauer said gravely aliyah beth is a secret contingency plan that mandates the evacuation by sea and air of south africas entire nuclear weapons arsenal and fuel stocks to israel in the event of armed insurrection by the black population this move will be considered a redeployment of weapons as the warheads will remain under the control of the south african government my god general steyn breathed sterns gone mad no hauer argued general stern knew that the dimensions of this crisis are such that any other consideration pales beside it im telling you that a nuclear threat exists nowinside this country general steyn slammed his fist down on the table then ill have the bloody details now captain even if i have to torture you to get them you wouldnt get them in time general im sorry but thats the way it is dont you understand your men cant be trusted major graaff was on your personal staff for gods sake one phone call from an informant could bring about the very disaster that stern is trying to avert a nuclear weapon could be detonated before we leave this building general steyn came to his feet knocking his chair to the floor startled captain barnard rushed in with pistol drawn its all right barnard the general said the afrikaner towered over hauer tell me something captain what does stern have to do with this how is israel involvedt hauer had been dreading this question general he said slowly all i can tell you is that a madman possesses a nuclear weapon within the borders of your country it could be detonated at any moment in my opinion any political considerations are secondary political considerations are never secondary captain mores the pity what about thomas horn whats he got to do with all this hauer knew he had to tread carefully beri general how would you describe herr horns ties to the south african government well hes what some would call a power broker a behindthescenes type very reclusive but i understand hes a force to be reckoned with in the ultraconservative encloves very chummy with the old afrikaner stock its the military horns tied to you see as you probably know during the last few decades south africa has been forced to become selfsufficient in many areasspecially defense we build everything from bullets to heavy artillery and aircraft were damned proud of it too as youmight imagine anyone with thomas horns industrial clout is courted constantly his money and factories have produced untold amounts of ordnance for the army hes involved in some very sensitive defense projects i imagine general steyns voice faltered my god horn is the sourre of this nuclear threat but but hes one of the most patriotic men in the country perhaps gadi said speaking for the first time mr horn isnt who he appears to be general steyn eyed the israeli suspiciously just who the devil do you think he is lad when gadi didnt reply the general turned to hauer what is it you want me to do captain exactly hauer looked straight into general steyns eyes i want you to place a small group of men under my command and give me until midnight before you call out the army the general gaped in astonishment youre mad youre asking me to place south african officers under the command of a foreign policeman so that he can carry out an unsanctioned and illegal operation within this republic is that what youre asking im not asking hauers eyes were flat and steady im demanding it general steyn reddened in outrage youre not in a position to demand a bloody toothpick hauer looked pointedly at his watch general i have a man waiting in pretoria for a telephone call he has a full description of plan aliyah beth if he does not receive that call in the next twelve minutes he will call the new york times the london daily telegraph cnn der spiegel general steyn raised his hand and if i dont consider that a strong enough threat you may be personally responsible for the deaths of millions of people captain bernard stood openmouthed in astonishment he had never heard anyone speak to general steyn like this and the mention of hostile nuclear weapons on south african soil had all but pushed him over the brink but general steyn simply rubbed his right hand over his closecropped scalp and said excuse us for a moment gentlemen barnard when they had gone gadi leapt to his feet what the hell are you doing hauer my uncle told you to get enough troops to flatten horns estate youre asking for a small group of men what are you up to im trying to save your damned country for you hauer snapped since you dont have the presence of mind to do it yourself would you use your brain for one minute lets say i tell general steyn everything where the bomb is who really has it everything what will he do his first impulse will be to do what stern wantstake a battalion up there and flatten horns place but guess what while the good general is flying up to the transvaal hes going to realize something hes going to realize that alfred horns target is not south africa eh because if it was horn could have sabotaged it a thousand ways before now hell realize that horns target must be outside south africa as we well know and when general steyns political bosses find that out theyre going to realize that the smart thing to do for south africais to simply let the deal happen let whoevers buying that bomb land their plane load it on board and fly it right out of south africa thereby neutralizing the threat to their country the color drained from gadis face they wouldnl they damn well would hauer asserted even if they want to stop horn how can they hes got the ultimate blackmail weapon if they attack him he can detonate the weapon right where he isinside south africa and i imagine someone in the south african government knows hes crazy enough to do it all right gadi said i see your point but general steyn isnt going to give you any men he is hauer said calmly on one condition what condition suddenly the steel door clanged open general steyn marched in with captain bernard on his heels lets see hauer murmured to gadigeneral steyn stopped in front of hauer before i answer he said i want to hear exactly what you want hauer didnt hesitate hed made his shopping list while he waited in the cell i want an armored car i want it mounted with a heavy machine gun not a water cannon i want five men from your elite counterterror unit i dont want them to know where theyre going or what the mission is but i want them to bring along their whole bag of tricks flashbang grenades body armor flares combat shotguns the works mmm the geneml murmured is that all no one more thing yes a steyrmannlicher ssg general steyn glanced at captain barnardour counterterror team uses a different sniper rifle barnard explained but i think we can get hold of a steyr hauer was still watching general steyn do i get my men general on one condition the afrikaner said stiffly and its nonnegotiable i cant imagine what it is hauer said almost smiling i go with you gadis jaw dropped but im in command hauer pressed general steyn pursed his lips tactical command he allowed hauer breathed a sigh of satisfaction make your calls general chapter fortytwo pm horn house jonas sterns head chest and ankles had been scraped bloody by the leather restraining straps of the xray table blinding white light stabbed his eyes he had counted forty blasts of the xray unit already and in between he had heard the muffled voices of the men behind the heavy lead shield his murderers they had asked no questions given no explanations and stern needed none he was a jew thats rads said a voice stern recognized as pieter smutss how much is that asked a second eager voice jiirgen luhr how much can he take oh quite a bit more smuts replied and he will just a moment said a hoarse highpitched voice stern heard the hum of an electric wheelchair and then hess rounded the lead shield stern tried to move his head to look but the straps held him fast he saw only the brilliant white light overhead hess chuckled beside his ear pieter has devised a rather ingenious method of eliminating my jewish problem wouldnt you say herr stern stern said nothing i wanted you punished you see hess explained but i also wanted you to live long enough to see your country destroyed he may not actually see it sir smuts interjected as he stepped around the shield in a few hours he will experience blindness similar to that caused by flashburns he may or may not recover his sight hesss face darkened but he will live long enough to know that israel is no more if the libyans stick to the schedule yes we could stretch this out for months if you like hess shook his head just long enough for the jew to see what happens to israel what will become of him after that smutss voice took on a clinical detachment it varies this dosage will cause severe nausea and vomiting for the next twentyfour hours hell have deep burns bloody diarrhea his hair will fall out therell be bone marrow destruction hess raised his hand how muchcan he stand and survive for two weeks i wouldnt push it over rads sir not if you want him to live until the detonation when stern finally spoke his voice was a knife blade in one week hess you will stand in the dock before a war crimes tribunal in jerusalem hess laughed yes well you might be interested to know that your friend hauer and his young jewish companion are now in a pretoria police cell and general jaap steyn is chasing a school of red herrings at the request of my pretoria office you will be manacled stern went on stubbornly israeli schoolchildren will file past your cell and spit in your face history will judge you as it did your master as one more tragic gangster with an inferiority complex swine hess shrieked when your skin turns black and begins to drop off you will regret your words dont let him provoke you sir smuts said evenly in ten days time israel will be a dead island in a sea of arabs yes hess rasped what do you think of that jew i think you should plead guilty stern retorted it will shorten the time you have to stand in shame before the worlds cameras enraged hess stabbed a button onhis wheelchair and wheeled away toward the door give him rads now jtirgen luhrs hysterical laugh was cut short by a sharp knock at the door a grayuniformed soldier stepped in saluted hess then turned to smuts the radar shows one aircraft approaching sir twenty kilometers out it responded properly to the codes hess smiled our libyan friends have arrived to take possession of their new toy i should get up to the tower sir smuts said no finish here first i want this jew to get his rads today smuts frowned i should be with you when you meet the libyans lieutenant luhr can finish here the machine is set all he need do is press the button hess paused very well fifty more exposures smuts tofu luhr jawohl luhr replied his eyes exultant after smuts rolled hess out luhr swaggered over to the table and leaned over stern are you enjoying this you filthy stern spat into luhrs open mouth the german gagged raised his fist high over sterns neck then dropped it shaking to his side he reached up took hold of the xray tube housing and brought its barrel to within an inch of sterns groin then he hurried behind the lead shield and peered through the thick bubble window lets see if we can burn your balls off jew he snarled he pressed the trigger pm the northern transvaol the south africanbuilt armscor ac armored car swerved off of the last road east of giyani and crashed down onto hard veld six huge wheels hurled the long wedgeshaped hull over berms and trenches at forty miles per hourthe speed of a mildly agitated rhinoceros machine guns bristled from the arinscors steel hide giving the lowslung fighfing vehicle the look of a tank designed for a war on the moon inside dieter hauer checked his watch the hellforleather journey from pretoria had taken three hours they still had twenty kilometers of punishing trackless wilderness to cover before they reached horn house he estimated they would find it about duskthe worst possible time it would still be light enough for the defenders to see them coming but too dark for accurate smallarms fire by his assault team he had tried to keep his mind off hanss fight during the trip hed spent most of the ride conferring quietly with general steyn by concentrating on tactics he ad almost managed to ignore the fact that with stern and the missing pages now in his custody hess had no reason to keep hans and ilse alive any longer the scene inside the armscor comforted hauer though it would have terrified most civilians ever since giyani his team had worn their black kevlar helmets and antiriot respirators these sophisticated gas masks concealed the entire face giving their wearers the insectile look of hollywood movie aliens every man also wore a full suit of black body armor made of kevlar composite material fortified by ceramic tile inserts these suits would stop not only pistol rounds and shrapnel but highvelocity armorpiercing bullets hauer could scarcely tell the men apart he knew that general steyn sat beside him on the metal bench seat and that one of the men sitting across from him was gadi abrams captain barnard was up front in the shotgun seat the driver and the other two men were members of south africas elite counterterror ct commando unit making up the fiveman force hauer had originally requested all the rifles save hauers were south african gadi did not mind this as the south african r assault rifle was merely a carbine style variant of the israeli galil hauer carried the long graceful sniper rifle he had requested from general steynthe austrianbuilt steyrmannlicher ssg on the floor lay an assortment of weapons from grenades to combat shotguns he wrenched his respirator aside stern said to expect a strong defense he shouted and i think he knows what hes talking about general steyn pulled his own buglike mask off revealing his perpetually red face he does captain youre the one who insisted on one vehicle and five men i would have hit this place with an airborne division and seen this corner of your country vaporized hauer reminded him what about land mines general arent they popular down here very we have so many unpaved roads that mines are the weapon of choice the bottom of this vehicle is designed to deflect mine blasts upward and away but a sustained series of hitsone large minefield sayand weve bought it general steyn grinned i may be getting up in age but i dont fancy a hot fragment in the balls hauer laughed the closeness of the sound inside the respirator gave him a brief flush wearing a full suit of armor was disorienting it insulated a man from lethal projectiles but it also isolated him from the men around him staring through his bubble eyeholes hauer wondered about the south african ct troops general steyn had vouched for their loyalty but hauer didnt count that for much not when one of the generals own staff officers had been on phoenixs payroll hauer would have given his pension for a german gsg assault team to replace the south africans hed have few doubts about success then but it was no use wishing you fight with what you have he wondered if jonas stern calculated the same way he could imagine the dilemma the israeli was struggling with nowif stern was still alive if it came to a choice between detonating a nuclear weapon on south african soil or letting it be captured by arab fanatics sworn to destroy israel hauer knew stern would not hesitate to turn this corner of south africa into a radioactive wasteland if the choice were between germany and south africa he knew he would do the same he only prayed it wouldnt come to that across the narrow aisle the south africans sat like sphimes behind their black masks hauer finally discerned the smoldering gaze of gadi abrams through the bubble eyes of one respirator hauer stared back trying to read the message in the israelis dark eyes the best he could come up with was i trust only you and me and im not too sure about you before the young commando turned away hauer felt exactly the same pm horn house this time smuts did not meet the libyans on the runway he waited in the relative security of the recepton hall with his master if they dont like being met by a kaffir he thought to hell with them hess sat in his wheelchair beside smuts wearing a gray suitjacket and black eyepatch he had once again assumed the role of alfred horn smuts peered through a window as his zulu driver goosed the range rover up the final crescent of the drive when the libyan delegation climbed out smuts immediately noticed the ratio of four bodyguards to two negotiators on the last trip he recalled that ratio had been reversed he also noted the conspicuous absence of major ilyas karami smuts had expected something like this and despite hesss optimism he had prepared for treachery he had two marksmen waiting in the corridors on either side of the reception hall and he had reinforcements on the way this morning when major graaff had called to report that he had taken dieter hauer into custody smuts had requested a contingent of nis men to holster his own force graaff had enthusiastically agreed smutshoped they would arrive soon he took a last look at his marksmen then opened the great teak door and stepped back wearing flowing white robes prime minister jalloud swept into the hall and threw his arms wide in greeting herr horn he exclaimed the historic day has come allah has brought us here safely may he smile upon our business hess nodded curtly guten abend herr prime minister dr sabri and the four bodyguards stepped over the threshold where is major karami smuts asked i had hoped to see him again jalloud smiled im afraid major karami was called away at the last moment to attend to pressing military matters ill bet he was smuts thought wryly flexing his fists to channel off tension sorry to hear it would anyone like refreshments hess asked it is a long flight from tripoli im afraid our leader has forbidden any delay herr horn jalloud said softly he awaits our return with the utmost anticipation to business then i assume you wish dr sabri to verify the weapons operational readiness before we load it if we might so impose jalloud said timidly in that instant inexplicably smuts decided that if trouble was coming prime minister jalloud knew nothing about it the afrikaner signaled his marksmen by touching his right eyebrow with his right hand he intended to trigger any treachery long before the libyans gained access to the basement complex with all respect mr prime minister he said i must ask that your bodyguards wait here we allow no fiream the basement jalloud looked uncomfortable but our leader provided these men to assist with the loading of the weapon the bomb weighs more than a thousand kilograms smuts replied it must be loaded mechanically in fact i have my doubts about your jets ability to carry both the weapon and passengers i had assumed you would bring a cargo plane i see jalloud said slowly wondering why no one in tripoli had thought of this or perhaps he thought with a shiver someone did by all means he said he turned to the bodyguards you will wait here while dr sabri checks the weapon taken aback by this request the soldiers hesitated their orders had been to wait until they gained access to the basement before carrying out their mission but the afrikaner had forced their hand simultaneously reaching the same conclusion major karamis four assassins raised their uzis as one their faces showed even more surprise than prime minister jallouds when smutss concealed marksmen opened fire with their r assault rifles the graycladafrikaners emptied their clips into the line of assassins from eight meters away blowing all four backward against the great teak door the elevator smuts shouted everyone get inside move while hesss wheelchair whirred toward the open elevator prime minister jalloud and dr sabri shouted riantic arabic and crawled along behind him jalloud took a bullet in the left arm but in his panic he barely felt it smuts had looked back to make sure that hess was safe inside the elevator when a stunned libyansat up with a wild cry and let off a long burst of bullets in his direction body armor smuts shouted head shots only bullets ricocheted through the marblefloored reception hall one libyan took smutss advice before the afrikaners did his tefloncoated mm slugs exploded the head of one of smutss marksmen like a cantaloupe the surviving afrikaner avenged this loss then scurried to shelter behind a large rosewood chiffonier against the far wall another libyan darted outside to use the doorway as a firing position two seconds later he staggered back into the great hall blood spurting from his throat smutss zulu driver appeared in the doorway with a long hunting knife in his hand the zulu moved quickly to another downed arab dispatched him with his knife then fell to a long burst from the surviving libyan assassin smutss marksman knocked down the last libyan as smuts himself hustled jalloud and the dazed physicist into the cubicle where hess waited stay here smuts ordered his marksman ill reinforce you soon the elevator door slid shut ten seconds later the last libyan to fall opened his eyes brought up his uzi and fired a sustained burst from the floor two slugs struck the afrikaner guard in the head killing him instantly groaning in agony major karamis last surviving assassin began crawling toward the elevator from hans and ilses bedroom the skirmish in the reception hall sounded like the battle of the bulge when the firing stopped hans shoved open the door where do we go he asked should we try to get out theyre probably guarding the main doors ilse poked her head outside the door theres nowhere to run i told you weve only got onr chance stern hans could think of no better plan all right he said but stay behind me understand another burst of machine gun fire rattled in the reception hall behind you ilse murmured wondering where smuts might be holding stern keeping close to the wall they started down the corridor away from the sound of the gunfire high in the observatory tower pieter smuts searched the airstrip through a pair of powerful zeis field glasses dusk was falling fast he saw the wreckage of the jetrangers shot down last night spread out over the eastern end of the runway in the midst of the debris sat hesss own lear scorched black and missing most of its tail there was a single guard standing beneath the libyan leaijet no one else where was the main body of the assault force where was major karami behind smuts hess nodded restlessly in his wheelchair he was trying desperately to fathom the reason for the libyan soldiers attempt to kill their prime minister jalloud himself sat propped against a bank of satellite recei moaning from the pain of his shattered arm shaking in fear dr sabri ministered to him as best he could no sign of karami yet smuts said pulling the field glasses away from his eyes but it will be dark soon thats when hell come vao hess murmured still dazed by the suddenness of the attack yes jalloud groaned it is karami it must be smuts glanced at the vulcan gun a trim young afrikaner sat in the firing cage his alert eyes checking the fearsome weapons nightvision system three more grayclad south ahicans manned the radar and communications gear why hess cried indignantly has qaddafi gone mad smuts chuckled quietly he always has been we knew this was a risk we needed more time sir interrupted a radar controller i show one aircraft approaching from the north hes very close he must have been flying ten feet off the veld smuts pressed a button on his console attention unidenfified aircraft he said tersely you have entered restricted airspace turn back now or you will be fired upon repeat turn or be fired upon it must be the air zimbabwe jet said the radar man an hour ago i marked him as a civil airliner bound for joburg he must have sneaked off his flight path after he went into the ground clutter smuts waved his hand to the vulcan gunner the afrikaner donned his targeting goggles and depressed two foot pedals with a deep hydraulic hum the entire turret rotated to face the airstrip inside the approaching yak major ilyas karami stood behind the anxious pilot and listened indifferently to smutss flintedged threats do they have antiaircraft guns major the pilot asked shut up karaini snapped you know what to say the pilot picked up his mike this is air zimbabwe flight he said in a quavering voice we are in diswe have an avionics malfunction do you read majorkaramicrackledsmutssvoicethisisyourfiw warning turn back now or be shot out of the sky your mother fucks goats karami bellowed he knows who you are cried the pilot the missions been compromised were unarmed we must turn back suddenly a brilliant line of tracer fire flashedup through the gray clouds it passed high over the nose of the jet then swung back and forth searching out the airborne intruder allah protect us the pilot wailed instinctively beginning an evasive maneuver he had flown mig fighters in combat but to sit helpless in an unarmed airliner was a new and terrifying experience forhim karami pulled a pistol from his hip holster and laid the barrel against the pilots temple land this whore he shouted now where shrieked the pilot i see the flares the copilot yelled dive steeling his nerves the pilot banked sharply and headed down toward a line of flares laid by jailouds bodyguards it would be a bellyflop landing but he didnt care never in his life had he wanted so badly to get on the ground smuts cursed as he saw the chain of green starbursts light up the center line of the runway shoot out the flares he screamed they cant land without them m y goggles are going crazy the gunner protested i cant see a bloody thing take them off shoot the roar of the vulcan blotted out everything hess covered his ears and shouted something but no one heard him the gunner made a valiant effort to extinguish the flares but only succeeded in knocking a few out of line the main effect of the vulcan was to rip the surface of the newly laid asphalt to pieces suddenly hess gasped in horror dropping out of the sky like a great prrhistoric bird was the libyan yak it roared past the turret in profile as it fell earthkvard there they are smuts yelled fire fire the gunner depressed his trigger scarlet tracer rounds arced from the vulcans flaming barrels reaching out for the black apparition suddenly the turrets elevator door hissed open smuts turned in disbelief then dived protectively across hesss wheelchair inside the elevatortrapped on the floor with his back against the wallwas the surviving libyan assassi screamed a curse raised his uzi and fired bullets sprayed wildly throughout the confined space hammering the polycarbonate windows and tearing through the faceplates of sensitive electronic gear one of the south african technicians took a round in the back of the head and fell dead over his console the radar technician managed to draw his pistol and get off three shots before a ricochet caught him in the neck and then there was silence the libyan had run out of ammunition smuts heaved himself off of hess picked up the dead radar mans pistol and shot the libyan twice through the face it took him three more seconds to realize the true significance of the silence the vulcan had stopped firing when smuts whirled he saw why his gunner had been blinded by flying glass worse the vulcans electronic targeting system had been damaged beyond repair the prime minister has been hit again dr sabri cried smuts took no notice of the physicist he darted to the broad window the libyan jet had landed safely through his field glasses he watched fifty commandos spill onto the tarmac he forced himself to stay calm soon the libyans would be at the edge of the shallow bolo that surrounded the house inside the killing zone he dropped his field glasses and jerked the bleeding gunner from the vulcans operating chair then climbed in himself he put his eyes to the visual aiming goggles and scanned the airstrip beneath a wide door in the rear of the yak he saw arabs lowering some type of artillery piece from the plane by means of winches smuts grinned like a demon and opened fire the armorpiercing bullets streaked across the wash and raced toward the plane but just as the tracer beam reached the laboring arabs smuts released the trigger destroying the jet might not be the smartest option in these circumstances he realized with no means of escape the libyans might fight twice as fiercely to take the house as he watched the arabs beneath the plane smuts noticed something sitting about ten meters behind the yaks tail it was a pickup truck what the hell is that for he wondered then he knew theyd brought the truck to tow the big gun and to haul their stolen bomb from the house to the plane smuts jammed his thumb down on the vulcans trigger it took longer than normal to acquire the toyota using visual aiming only but once he did the uraniumtipped slugs chewed the toyota into scrap metal in seconds the gas tank fireballed and set aflame three libyans beneath the plane smuts climbed out of the vulcan d went to the panel of an switches that controlled his claymore mines his only real worry was the heavy gun he would wait until the soldiers got it away from the plane then he would destroy men and machine together he pressed a button on the console and spoke crisply bunker gunners prepare to fire at will he turned to hess wed better raise the shields sir we ant risk letting even one man get irito the basement complex the prime minister is dead howled dr sabri from the floor hess rolled his wheelchair over to the bloodied mound of robes lying near the base of the vulcan prime minister jalloudminus the lower part of his facestared blankly upward at the steel roof of the turret two of the libyans bullets had found him the shields sir smuts repeated reaching for the appropriate button wait hess ordered frau apfel is still in the outer triangle smuts grimaced with forbearance as are lieutenant luhr linah the medical staff the rest of the servants and the jew sir we cannot afford to wait the old mans frantic eyes searched the closedcircuit television monitors above their heads although the cameras showed most of the outer rooms he saw no sign of ilse but pieter she saved my life if we shut her outside the libyans will never reach the house smuts assured him his voice taut but we must raise the shields just in case very well hess said thickly raise the shields smuts pressed the button throughout horn house black anodized metal shields rose up from the floor blocking every door staircase and window leading from the outer wings to the central complex the afrikaner sighed with satisfaction suddenly an explosion rocked the turret leaping to the window in alarm smuts heard the distinctive crump of a mortar seconds later a round fell just short of the outer wall of the house two more crashed through the roof of the west wing horn house was on fire as if urged forward by d flames twenty libyan commandos started across the killing zone at a fast run damn you karami smuts shouted he climbed back into the vulcan and opened up on the libyan mortar position he quickly silenced one but a replacement immediately took its place after forty seconds of continuous firing the vulcans drum magazine ran out smuts screamed at one of his soldiers hurry man load the fucking gun while the libyan machine guns chattered and the mortar shells rained down on the outer walls smuts scanned the dark rim of the bowl just as he started to look away from the horizon he saw the help he had desperately hoped for a hundred meters southeast of the libyans a squat black shape stood silhouetted against the lesser shadow of the falling night a pair of halogen headlamps winked once twice then died the black shape crept slowly forward hesitated again by god thats graaff smuts thought with elation its major graaff he cried he made it smuts hammered his fists against the vulcan in triumph if he knew graaff that armored car was only the spearhead of a veritable army drum loaded shouted the man beneath the vulcansmuts fired a celebratory burst into the darkening sky then he opened up on the libyans with a vengeance chapter fortythree poised on the ridge above smutss killing zone hauer watched the burst of spectacular tracer fire lance up into the sky from the observatory turret thats itf he shouted they think major graaff sent us go wait general steyn called to the armscors driver look at that tracer fire hauer thats a rotary cannon this vehicles tough but they could blow us to pieces in seconds with that gun hauer ripped his respirator aside general you gave me tactical command of this operation im sorry but i cant let you sacrifice my men without any hope of success they think were here to help them weve got a clear path to the house general steyn shook his head we need reinforcements hauer stared in disbelief he had come too far to be stopped here by one mans lack of nerve he struggled to keep his voice steady general my only son is down there and the longer we wait the greater the chance that he will be executed if i must ill go down there alone and on foot you wont have to captain gadi abramss pledge was punctuated by the chunk of his assault rifle being cocked he did not point it at anyone but the threat was plain enough general steyns hand moved toward the pistol at his hip gadi ripped his gas mask off and gave the general a look of open contempt israel fights he said quietly germany fights what of south africa general steyns red face whitened he knew he was being manipulated but in front of his men the israelis challenge il was simply too personal to ignore he leaned forward into the drivers compartment and shouted over the top hans and ilse dashed down the smoky corridor with towels held over their faces horn house was burning and the inner complex was sealed against them they had searched nearly every room in the outer triangle of the house yet they had seen no sign of stern only panicked servants and their children hans carried an attache case in his right hand they had brought it from horns study hurry ilse called its the only room we havent checked as they neared the hospital unit she wondered why she had skipped it before but she knew the nauseating memory of being strapped to e xray table had simply been too horrible to face again now she had no choice she felt a jolt of terror as she eased open the infirmary door the room was dark but the smell of alcohol hit her immediately signaling hans to follow she crept through the shadows toward the interior doors a crack of light shone beneath one of them halfway to the door she froze the sound had stopped her the terrifying buzz cut short by the low metallic clang ilse closed her eyes in remembered terror then opened them again she padded over to a countertop and felt her way along it here she whispered closing her hand around the base of a heavy niicroscopehans set down the briefcase and took the scope ilse turned the doorknob as quietly as she could as she pushed on the metal door the sound came again buzz clang in the eerie amber glow of the xray machines dials ilse saw a blond man standing with his back to her he was peering through the thick bubble window in the lead radiation screen are your balls getting warm yet jew the man called he cackled wildly ilse gasped the figure whirled you hans murmured luhr wore his police uniform the green trousers tucked into his spitpolished boots he looked first at hans then at ilse he laughed derisively you stubborn arschloch dont you know when to quit he dropped the cable trigger this time funk isnt here to stop me hes the one hans ilse said hoarsely the one who cut the policemans throat in berlin thats right luhr said with a laugh just like slaughtering a fucking pig steuben said hans his voice trembling he felt his throat constrict with unspeakable hatred he looked down at the microscope in his hand then let it crash to the floor frau apfel cried a weak voice is that you ilse darted around the lead shield jonas stern lay pale and bloodied beneath the leather straps that had bound her just two days ago hans shecried help me hans heard nothing he watched luhrs lips tighten into a thin pale line as he dropped his shoulders like a boxer and moved out from the xray machine hanss nerves tingled like live wires luhr feinted with his right hand and kicked hans high in the chest hans took the blow staggered steadied himself luhr jabbed with his left hand hans did nothing to block it he felt his right cheek tear but he ignored the pain a crashing roundhouse struck him on the side of the head he absorbed the shock but this time he raised his fists and moved forward backpedaling away luhr fired off a right that drilled into hanss eye socket hans roared in pain but he shook the tears out of his eyes and lunged blindly forward as luhr pivoted to evade him he felt his back collide with the faceplate of the xray machine at that instant hans lashed out his fist moxied from his side to the bridge of luhrs nose without seeming to cross the space between one moment luhrs face was pale with fury the next it was covered in blood hans had broken his nose luhr screamed in agony then tried to bull his way out of the corner hans stood him up against the machine and hit him three times fast in the solar plexus luhr sank to the floor hans tasted blood in his mouth he picked up the heavy microscope and held it high above his head his arm shivered from the weight one blow would crush luhrs skull like an eggshell this is for weiss he muttered wait rasped a male voice hans turned slowly the microscope still high above his head he saw a tall wiry man wearing sweatsoaked trousers and an undershirt leaning unsteadily on ilses shoulder not that way said stern his voice strangely flat luhr lay gulping for air at hanss feet slowly he got onto then turned ha and stared at the tanned stranger the beaked nose weathered hawklike face ive seen you hans said yes sergeant stern replied you have now pick that man up and put him on the table we dont have time for this ilse cried the house is burning we have to find a way through those shields a few exposures wont even hurt him put that animal on the table hans stunned luhr with a kick to the head then he hoisted him onto his shoulder and hauled him around to the xray table as soon as he dumped him there ilse strapped him down with the leather restraints get out stern barked both of you hans watched fascinated as the israeli lifted the broken microscope from the floor and smashed it down onto the cable trigger luhr had dropped shut off the power stern commanded ilse found the onoff switch and flipped it stern fiddled with the tangled mess in big hands for a few moments then dropped it and stepped up to the bubble window in the shield turn the power back on ilse obeyed the entire room seemed to vibrate for four seconds then it went still luhrs scream of terror rent the acrid air again the xray unit fired the indescribable buzz clang chilled ilses heart stern had permanently closed the circuit in the cable trigger the xray tube would continue to fire recharge and fire again until someone finally shut off the power or a fuse burned out luhr shrieked like a man trapped in a pit of snakes hans looked up at sterns lined face he saw nothing written there not satisfaction not hatred nothing at all lets go said stern pulling his eyes away from luhrs struggling body ilse held up the black briefcase hans had been carrying weve got the spandau papers we found them in horns study the other book too the zinoviev notebook ilse nodded everything good girl stern grabbed her arm and hustled her into the hall hans backed slowly out of the room his eyes still glued to the bubble window in the lead shield the xray machine continued to fire in foursecond intervals four hundred meters of open ground separated the ridge of the bowl from horn house the armscor had covered barely a hundred when a fierce hammering assaulted hauers ears they were taking fire from the libyan machinegun positions on the ridge behind them captain barnard was sitting in the armscors shotgun seat hauer grabbed his shoulder can you raise the tower on that radio captain i can try do it tell them to give us cover pulling off his helmet and respirator bernard began working through the frequencies on the radio hauer glanced back into the crew compartment at the arrnscors firing slits the blackclad team of commandos worked their r carbines like men on an assembly line one mans head and shoulders were thrust into the tiny turret mounted atop the arinscor he swiveled the caliber machine gun between the libyan positions with deadly accuracy yet libyan bullets still pounded the vehicles armor hauer turned again and watched horn house growing larger in the armscors reinforced windshield meters and closing suddenly an alien voice began speaking inside the vehicle phoenix to graaff phoenix to graaff do you read the tension in pieter smutss voice was like a cable stretched near to breaking phoenix to graaff where are your reinforcements answer him hauer told captain barnard tell him graaffs manning our turret gun hauer looked out at the house again meters he gave bernard an encouraging punch on the shoulder then he ducked back into the crew compartment to confer with general steyn the instant hauer left the compartment the driver lashed out with his elbow and struck captain barnard in the side of the head the arrnscor lurched to a halt meters from horn house hauer flew forward and crashed against a steel bulkhead only his helmet prevented him from cracking his skull the driver snatched u the radio microphone and be p gan transmitting rapidly in afrikaans arinscor to phoenix armscor to phoenix its a tri trap trap major graaff isnt here dazed hauer lunged back into the drivers compartment he did not understand afrikaans but he recognized a warning taking hold of the drivers head he wrenched with all his might hoping to snap the mans cervical vertebrae the driver went suddenly stiff then limp take the wheel hauer shouted at captain bamardwhile hauer dragged the driver back into the crew compartment captain barnard scrambled into the drivers seat and wrestled the armscor into gear the vehicle lurched forward back then began rolling toward the house again hauer laid the senseless driver against the armscors side hatch and tore off his own respirator another traitor he yelled to general steyngeneral steyn ripped off his gas mask his face was flushed with anger and disbelief at his feet the traitor squirmed and flung his arms upward in a fit of rage gadi kicked open the armscors side hatch and shoved the driver out onto the veld by the time gadi shut the hatch a libyan machine gunner had riddled the mans body with caliber slugs the armscor shivered as another libyan machine gunner locked onto the tail of the armored car hauer grabbed general steyns arm i dont know if the tower heard that warning but the sudden steelripping roar of the vulcan obliterated both hauers voice and the rattle of the libyan machine guns hauer leapt up to a firing slit his stomach rolled as he watched the blazing tracer line march toward the nose of the armscor he had seen similar guns on american tankkilling planes on maneuvers in germany the rotary guns mounted in their stubby snouts spewed out depleteduranium slugs per minuteenough to turn a t tank into a burning hulk in seconds captain barnard swerved to avoid the oncoming tracer beam but the vulcan gunner simply adjusted his fire barnard screamed as the shells churned up the earth directly in front of the armscor then suddenlymiraculouslythe fiery stream of death winked out hes jammed hauer shouted go go the annscor surged forward like a hailstorm from hell slugs pounded the vehicle from every side as smutss bunker gunners opened up from their concealed positions hauer peered out through a gun port trying to pinpoint the source of the fire bunkers he shouted theyre dug into the hill from a slit on the annscors right side gadi fired his r assault rifle in careful threeround bursts aiming for the muzzle flashes of the bunker guns momser he shouted but no one heard him the noise inside the armscor had reached a deafening level hauer was leaning into the drivers compartment to urge captain barnard forward when pieter smuts detonated the first string of claymore mines two claymores exploded directly beneath the armscor hurling the eighteen tons of hardened steel into the air like a childs toy the vehicle tottered on its three right wheels then crashed back onto all six and continued toward the house another string of claymores exploded in front of the armscor hundreds of steel balls scythed into its hull shattering the polycarbonate windshield captain barnard screamed in pain but the arrnscor kept rolling hauers mind raced they still had more than a hundred meters to cover the mines could be handled but not under the fire of the tower gun if the gunner cleared his weapon in the next thirty seconds they didnt stand a chance the vulcan had to be silenced stop he roared turn this thing sideways and stop captain barnardnot enthusiastic about hitting any more mines himselfgladly obeyed hauer turned back to general steyn and his men pour it in im going out one of the masked men jumped down from a firing slit ripped off his respirator and grabbed hauers arm it was gadi if you go out there youre dead he yelled hauer jerked his arm free just keep those bunker guns off me while gadi stared hauer snatched up his sniper rifle and unlatched the armscors side hatch the full din of battle filled the vehicle holding the steyrmannlicher close against his body hauer took a deep breath and leaped outside he hit the ground hard and rolled beneath the huge vehicle praying no one had seen him he got to one knee there was almost enough room for him to stand beneath the arrnscors undercarriage the six giant wheels provided a wall from behind which he could fire in relative safc bracing his right knee behind one of the giant tires raised the steyr to his shoulder and sighted in on the tower the last light of dusk had almost gone he had no nightvision scope but the standard kahleshelios zf optical scope was excellent even in near darkness it brought the tower in nicely when hauer saw the turret in detail he groaned at meters accuracy wasnt the problem with the steyr he could fire ten bullets into a sixteeninch circle from six times that distance the problem was the glass he saw forming part of the turrets circular wall it would undoubtedly be made of transparent composite armor through the scope he searched for a weakness suited to his weapon the turret rotates he realized noticing the huge gears mounted beneath the observatory dome but i cant damage those gears twelve seconds later hauer spotted his chance just where the vulcans six barrels protruded from the glass a narrow port had been cut so that the gun could be traversed vertically hauer felt the hair on the back of his neck rise he could see men working frantically to clear the jammed weapon he laid his cross hairs on the tiny port and chambered a round into the breech the steyr accepted a tenround magazine but like most sniper rifles it was boltaction he would get one perfect chance then nine snap shots he took a deep breath and pressed his bdy into the huge tire that shielded him he felt the reassuring weight of the rifle on his shoulder the wooden stock cool and familiar against his stubbled cheek the sound of the battle grew dim and distant as he focused on his target melding his eye with the tiny crack between the vulcans barrels and the armored glass in his mind the coinsized target expanded into a saucer then a dinner plate his finger settled firmly on the trigger squeeze the instant before hauer fired a blast of flame erupted from the vulcans spinning barrels tracer rounds arced out toward the rim of the bowl the turret began to rotate he felt his shot disintegrating his shoulder twitched his stomach heaved in sudden confusion all around he heard the desperate rattle of guns firing at the moving turret all to no avail the dazzling beam marched from position to position silencing one gun after another he felt a sudden surge of hope the gunner was ignoring the armscor he thinks were out of the fight because were not moving he thinks his bunker guns stopped us hauer searched swiftly for a shot with the turret rotating hitting the tiny gun port was out of the question instead he picked a spot a few centimeters to the left of the vulcans barrelthe spot he estimated the gunner would be sitting behind he fired nothing happened his bullet struck the very millimeter of glass he had aimed for but the transparent armor was simply too strong how many perfect shots would it take to drill through the polycarbonate like an automaton hauer worked the boltaction rifle tracking his moving target fire eject shell close bolt fire the transparent wall shuddered as hauers slugs relentlessly hammered the same single square of armor six shots seven eight fire eject shell close bolt fire he jerked out the empty magazine and loaded his spare around him the battle raged on the vulcan whined the bunker guns chattered the hull of the armored car rattled like a tin can in a hailstorm he smelled the burning phosphorus of tracer rounds as they streaked across the field in brilliant lethal arcs suddenly with a strange shiver hauer sensed the vulcans tracer beam stagger somewhere off to his right he jerked his eye away from the scope and scanned the dark field christ the gunner had spotted his muzzle flashes his mouth went dry as the vulcans angle of fire lowered toward him every fiber of his being screamed run he shut his eyes against the fear then forced himself to open them again and put his right eye back to the scope somewhere out there he thought fiercely is the man who is trying to kill me he could feel the vulcans slugs hitting the ground thousands in each burst like the first shuddering waves of an earthquake the roar seemed to swallow upthe very air and the light it was mesmerizing like some lunatic laser beam the tracer beam slowed as it neared the armscor smuts wanted to be sure he did not miss in that moment of hesitation hauer steadied his twitching muscles fixed his eye upon the tiny square of armored glass he had spent his first magazine against and opened fire pieter smuts found his mark first in the first two seconds of contact the vulcan slammed two hundred shells into the armscors tail shearing off a quarterton of hardened si armor the vehicle shuddered like a great wounded beast black smoke poured into the air suddenly the armscors turbocharged v diesel roared to life in a last frantic bid for survival captain barnard floored the accelerator the armored car bolted forward like a wild bronco leaping out of the vulcans line of fire and leaving hauer exposed on the ground stunned kneeling alone on the dark plain hauer raised his rifle and pressed his eye to the scope dirt showered over him as the vulcans bullets thundered after the armscor just meters away there is nothing here said a voice in his brain nothing but you and the man behind that gun he fired his bullet starred the glass he fired again the tracer beam jinked away from the armscor and moved back toward him too late smuts had realized where the real danger lay with the vulcan gun thundering down upon him dieter hauer actually closed his eyes as he fired his last shot the tracer beam stuttered flashed again winked out the spell was broken hauer scrambled to his feet and dashed after the armscor gadi abrams dragged him back through the hatch you crazy german bastard the armscor was filling rapidly with oily black smoke everybody shoot hauer shouted clear a path through the mines detonate everything in our path one claymore exploded harmlessly nearby but no more the armscor had reached the section of ground where burtons colombians had been slaughtered the night before the mines here had been spent no replacements laid the annscor roared forward and reached horn house in twenty seconds flat captain barnard pulled the vehicle across the main entrance like a barricade instantly two south african ct troops thrust shotguns through the ports and blasted the hinges off the teakwood door when hauer shoved open the side hatch he was staring straight into the marble reception hall where major karamis assassins lay dead move out he shouted wait general steyn was up in the drivers compartment leaning over captain barnard hauer remembered the young man had taken some glass in the face when the windshield shattered but as he peered over the generals beefy shoulder he realized that captain barnard was suffering from a mortal wound where is it son general steyn asked softly my chest sir carefully the general probed the young mans torso i thought he was wearing a vest hauer said quietly general steyn pulled a bloodstained hand from beneath barnards right arm theres a splinter of polycarbonate sticking out of him he whispered right where the vest stops at the underarm god only knows how deep it went in he turned back to captain barnard can you move lad the young man tried to smile then coughed in agony it feels like the damned thing is buried in my heart like a sword swear to god go on general steyns neck flushed red nonsense lad youre coming with us dont move me sir captain barnard gurgled please dont general steyn looked ready to twist off the head of the man who had caused this pain setting his mouth in a grim line he drew a caliber pistol from captain barnards belt and placed it carefully in the young mans hand if it gets too bad he said tersely you know what to do the general swallowed the lump in his throat ill be back for you barnard you have my solemn word stand fast general steyn turned and squeezed his broad shoulders back through the door of the drivers compartment his bluff face was swollen with emotion he looked hard into hauers eyes if its a war they want he said his voice trembling then its a bloody war theyll get he drew his own pistol and jerked back the slide into the house lads pieter smuts staggered away from the vulcan and wiped the blood out of his eyes with his shirtsleeve a dozen slivers of armored glass had been driven into his face by hauers slugs he crouched beside hesss wheelchair theyve breached the outer walls sir i dont know whos inside that armored car but they must be friends of the jew hess grimaced who could it be but captain hauer he wheezed i told you never to underestimate an old german soldier hauer obviously outsmarted major graaff damn the man a german a german attacking me we can still stop them sir how if i order our bunker gunners to cease firing the libyans will advance and kill anyone left alive outside the shields true hess said thoughtfully but then the libyans will be inside the house but not inside the shields not near younot near the weapons hess hesitated realizing that the order would mean certain death for ilse linah and all of the servants do it he said finally smuts pressed a button on his console and issued the order outside the rattle of the bunker guns stuttered then died in the eerie silence major ilyas karami ordered three quarters of his remaining commando force down the slope the rest he held back to transport the howitzer the battle was not yet over and he did not intend to lose it through overconfidence the prize was too great alan burton rolled back over the lip of the wash and slid down the muddy wall into darkness juan diaz lay halfburied in the mudandbramble shelter burton had built at the bottom of the ravine diazs wounds had developed an unpleasant odor and his eyes were pale yellow slits burton leaned close to his ear ive got our return tickets lad can you make it si diaz whispered theres a big jet up there an airliner but its too heavily guarded there is also a lovely little lear that looks like a bloody turkish brothel on the inside thats our bird grunting in pain the little cuban heaved himself to his knees pushing away burtons helping hand lets go english he rasped forcing a grin not enough senoritas on this beach it took the two men ten minutes to climb out of the wash and cover the eighty meters to the libyan learjet burton had to carry diaz the last third of the way instead of putting the cuban on board the jet however burton trudged to the edge of the asphalt runway and dropped him there diaz yelped as the pain of his wounds hit him sorry sport burton panted but this is the safest spot for the time being what diaz exclaimed finally guessing burtons intent but the plane is right there sorry lad i told you if i got half a chance id have another go at the house when those rugpeddlers started shooting they gave me just that from my point of view sport unless i do the job i was sent here to do that jet isnt an escape route for me its just a taxi back to purgatory diaz muttered a stream of cuban profanity come along now juan boy crawl into that brush over there wouldnt want those blighters over there to catch you out here alone burton pointed up the runway to where major karami and his men struggled in the dusk cut your balls off with a bloody scimitar they would when diaz had settled himself in the tall grass burton said i know you can reach that jet on your own sport i wouldnt want you to leave without me you wouldnt do that would you the cuban pulled a wry face yesterday i would have he admitted but last night you saved my life english cubano dont forget that eh you go play hero diaz be here when you get back burton took a last look the learhis solitary means of escapethen he tossed diaz his wristwatch and gave him a roguish grin if im not back in forty minutes sport its bon voyage to you with my best wishes diaz shook his head and lay back in the scrub grass burton unslung his submachine gun and started back toward horn house hauer charged out of the arinscor and into the marble reception hall with the south africans on his heels gadi brought up the rear the young israeli ran straight to the corpses as recogni them look said general steyn pointing to the rectangular black shield blocking the main elevator that must be the way to the gun tower and the bomb gadi murmured two ct soldiers aimed their shotguns at the shield captain called a voice from the shadows to their right hauer felt his heart thump peering across the great entrance hall he spied a figure against the darkness of a corridor to his right it was hans gadi called a hoarse voice uncle where are you stern stepped into the brighter light of the reception hall hans and ilse stood in the shadows behind him jonas bellowed general steyn youve got some bloody explaining to do gadi started across the floor but stern signaled him to hold back hauer watched in puzzlement as hans slipped out of the corridor and raced around the edge of the great hall like a runner circling a track when he skidded to a stop hauer drew back in shock hanss hair face and clothing were covered with blood he looked like hehad dived on a grenade hans what happened were you shot no time to explain only the whites of hanss eyes showed through the blood were dead unless we can get through those shields weve got a plan but i cant explain it now i want you to find two rooms with windows facing the inner part of the house there are cameras in some rooms not in others find a room without a camera if my plan works the shields should come down for a few momentsjust long enough for you to get through skirt the wall when you gotheres a camera by that elevator hans squeezed hauers arm hard then he sprinted back toward stern hauer looked questioningly at gadi the young israeli shrugged and started toward the hallway on their left hauer and the south africans followed high in the turret pieter smuts watched major karamis commandos charge across the bowl in a matter of minutes hauer and his men would be slaughtered smuts smiled his protective shields probably had claw marks on them by now it was a pity about linah of course but servants were replaceable pieter hess cried when smuts whirled he saw his horrified master pointing at one of the closedcircuit tv monitors ilse apfel filled the screen her face and clothing were smeared with blood and she held an uzi submachine gun in her hands she screamed silently at the monitor for help then she turned away from the camera and fired a burst from the uzi thats the elevator camera hess cried open the audio link instantly the sound of gunfire filled the turret ilse turned back toward the camera and screamed in the name of god help us theyre going to kill us herr horn please my husband is wounded at that moment hans staggered backward into the cameras field of view and fired a burst from an uzi he had seized from a dead libyan he too was covered in blood both the blood and the uzis had been provided by major karamis dead assassins hans and ilse had rolled in the bloody pools of the reception hall until they looked like walking casualties for gods sake pieter hess pleaded those are germans down there smuts shook his head angrily we cant risk it sir hauer and his men could already be inside the house can you drop only the elevator shield no sir its all or none thats the way theyre designed then drop them all for five seconds smuts clenched his fists like most germans his master could be infuriatingly sentimental in the same way a man who sent millions to the ovens could love dogs smuts thought for the first time since he began serving hess the afrikaner felt mutiny in his heart i think its a trick sir i see no arabs ilse whirled back to the camera her blue eyes wild with terror in the name of god herr horn save me save my baby hesss knuckles went white on the arms of his wheelchair i dont see hauer anywhere he said quietly his eyes scanning the other monitors not all the bedrooms have cameras hesss face contorted with rage those are germans dying down there pieter she saved my life last night but do it the afrikaner slammed his right fist down on the console chapter fortyfour gadi swung himself through the bedroom window even before the black shield had fully retracted hauer leaped after him and landed on the cobblestones of a small courtyard to his right he saw the south african ct troops helping general steyn to his feet weve got to find my uncle gadi cried general steyn pointed to a large wooden door across the courtyard and gave a circular flick of his wrist the shotgunarmed ct troops blew the hinges off the door silently they sprinted through the opening and somersaulted into defensive positions the others close behind them hauer was the last man through just before he stepped over the threshold he realized that the firing outside the house had stopped he puzzled over this for a moment then forgot it as he followed gadi and the south africans down a short corridor and into a huge windowless room several large crates were stacked in the middle of the floor a forklift had been parked in front of a door in the far wall suddenly from a hallway to hauers right stern and ilse came running into the room sensing danger hauer waved them back but before he could call out two men wearing wehrtnacht gray uniforms rose up from behind the forklift and opened fire with automatic weapons stern dived to the floor pulling ilse down with him gadi returned fire as the bullets flew hans came pelting out of the corridor skidded then backpedaled into the hall ilse he shouted crawl back here ilse looked back but stern had thrown himself on top of her hauer and general steyn scrambled back into the hall behind them the south african ct troops reacted differently the highly trained commandos considered their ia kevlar body armor an offensive weapon while one soldier fired covering bursts the other loaded a teargas canister into his shotgun and fired at the forklift stinging vapor fogged the far side of the room without even waiting to hear a cough the south africans charged firing as they ran clear clear came a shout in afrikaans thats it said general steyn lets go at the forklift hauer hugged hans and ilse fiercely but there was no time to speak at their feet lay the bodies of smutss men cut to pieces by the south african commandos the ct troops had already secured the stairwell beyond the door the steel steps led both up and down leaning out over the rail hauer looked up and counted six flights of stairs that ended on a wide landing three floors above below the stairs disappeared into darkness the bombs downstairs said stern a hundred meters down thats our objective but the enemys up there hauer argued pointing with his sniper rifle they dont matter said stern he doesnt matter who asked general steyn horn hauer cut his eyes at stern if we dont neutralize that tower we wont be able to do a damned thing about your bomb even if we find it stern laughed softly how long do you think those shields will hold those arabs back hauer five minutes ten horn will probably lower them himself so that the arabs can kill us for him scheisse hauer cursed thats why the firing stopped theyre already coming stern weve got to get control of that turret gun you can do what you want but im taking the south africans with me without hesitation stern and gadi started down the stairs hauer general steyn and the south africans started up with hans and ilse bringing up the rear on the topfloor landing hauer put his ear against the green metal door and listened he thought he heard voices on the other side but he couldnt be sure backing away he saw the south africans preparing to blow down this door just as they had the one in the courtyard he signaled them to wait taking hold of the aluminum knob he applied a very slight circular pressure the knob turned he glanced back at the south africans nodded toward the door held up a fist and shook his head the ct trvups gut the message no grenades hauer licked his dry lips beneath his respirator then he raised his leg and kicked open the door five menhess smuts and three of smutss security troopslooked up in stunned surprise after one frozen moment smutss men made the mistake of going for their guns general steyns troops instantly killed all three with shotgun blasts smuts himself did not xesist he stepped calmly away from the observation window and set down his field glasses no one seemed to know what to say general steyn stepped from behind hauer and looked down at the wizened old man in the wheelchair thomas horn he said rather pompously in the name of the republic of south africa i place you under arrest still wearing his black eyepatch hess looked up with contempt the general cleared his throat you are thomas horn i am not hess said with disdain i am rudolf hess and you general are a traitor to your nation and to your race general steyns mouth fell open youre who ignore him general hauer snapped hes mad as a sewer rat hauer turned to smuts why arent you firing on the arabs smuts wiped his stillbleeding face on his sleeve and smirked theyll kill you too hauer pointed out probably smuts conceded but they might not hauer moved to the bulletstarred polycarbonate wall and looked out half the libyan commandos had already crossed the bowl and more were comingblack phantoms gliding across the moonlit earth hauer looked back and studied the cage that controlled the vulcan gun general steyn can your men operate that gun at a nod from the general one of the blacksuited south africans pulled off his gas mask climbed into the cage and opened fire the noise was shattering the gunner knocked down a dozen libyans in less than twenty seconds when smutss bunker gunners saw the vulcan resume firing they assumed that their chief had gone back over to the offensive and they added their machine guns to the fray pieter smuts eased his hand toward the console that controlled the shields on the ground floor touch that and youre dead hauer warned smutss hand lingered over the switch until hauer backed him off with a flick of his rifle the vulcan thundered on vomiting shells and flame into the darkness listen to me hess said struggling to make himself heard you he pointed to hauer youre german in the name of the fatherland join me the old man looked around in sudden confusion where is frau apfel as if on cue ilse stepped through the door hans had held her outside until he was certain the skirmish in the turret had ended she understands hess wailed you should all join at that instant the first shell from major karmnis howitzer struck the tower the explosion rocked the entire structure on its foundations everyone out hauer shouted move pieter smuts darted across the room lifted hess out of his wheelchair and carried him bodily into the stairwell everyone else hurried after them only the south african manning the vulcan remained in the turret probing for the howitzer through the smoke below the group had reached the secondfloor landing when the second howitzer shell tore through the turret window and exploded incinerating man and machinery in a blinding fireball stunned by the explosion above everyone looked to hauer for instructions follow him hauer shouted pointing down at smuts even with hess clinging to his neck the afrikanerhad already managed to reach the ground floor general steyn and his men started after them but hans and ilse hung back hans grabbed hauers arm come with us he begged youll die here hauer pointed through a narrow slitwindow on the secondfloor landing with the vulcan out ofaction a strong libyan force had begun charging toward the burning house and more dangerous the big howitzer was actually being towed across the bowl under human power its progress was slow but steady find stern hauer told hans theres nothing you can do here the basement is the only safe place now ill buy you all the time i can hurry when hans hesitated hauer shoved him down the stairs hauer felt a startling surge of emotion when ilse stood up on her toes threw her arms around his neck and kissed him on the cheek she drew back and looked into his eyes thank you for coming for us she said you are a good father she smiled once squeezed hauers arm then took hanss hand and hurried down the steel steps into the darkness hauer smashed the narrow window with the butt of his sniper rifle and thrust the long barrel through he rolled his shoulders once took a deep breath and put his eye to the scope the libyan infantry were the closest targets but he ignored them he had to slow down the artillery piece he lined up the reticle laid his forefinger against the steyrs trigger and squeezed he knocked down four men in eight seconds down on the ground the big howitzer slowed then stopped as the men towing it scrambled for cover hauer began searching out the infantry hearing as he did a calm voice in his head running target fifty meters fire eject shell close bolt fire as he picked off the commandos one by one he wondered how long he had before the howitzer team pinpointed his muzzle flashes and decided to redecorate the second level of the tower with a mm shell alan burton lay prone on the rim of the bowl watching the libyans cross the killing zone he had seen the howitzer destroy the rotating gun turret and he had almost decided to try to cross the bowl himself when he saw the libyans falling to hauers rifle at least somebody up there knows what hes doing burton thought with admiration clearly he would have to find an alternate route into the house the renewed chatter of the bunker guns gave him the idea he peered through the darkness at the nearest one a concrete pillbox dug into the shallow slope forty meters to his right all he could see was a narrow horizontal slit with a flashing machine gun barrel protruding from it the bunkers serve the tower he thought theyre permanent installations so how are they supplied from the sur ce la no from the house but how tunnels he said aloud bloody tunnels crouching low burton crabwalked around the rim of the bowl until he lay directly over the concrete bunker then he pulled three grenades from his web belt and laid them on sporadically searching out targets in the gloom pulling the pin on the first grenade burton swung himself down lobbed it through the narrow firing slit and rolled back up onto the lip of the bowl the explosion shook the ground beneath him the machine gun fell silent gray smoke poured from the firing slit grabbing the other two grenades burton dropped down in front of the bunker one meter below the slit he noticed a padlocked steel handle set in the bunkers grasscovered face escape hatch he thought arming another grenade he jammed it against the lock and hopped back onto the roof of the bunker the blast tore the hatch right off its hinges covering his nose and mouth with his shirtfront burton disappeared through the smoking hatch like a rabbit down its hole hauers lungs were on fire he had just flung himself down the twenty flights of stairs to the basement complex thanking god with every step that he had run out of ammunition before the howitzer gunners spotted him now he worked his way through almost total darkness toward the voices he heard at the far end of the dark laboratory when he finally reached open space he saw eight people standing in front of a shining silver wall with great doors set in its face someone was speaking english very loudly but hauer didnt recognize the voice when he was only five meters from the group he finally saw what held center stage lying prone on a wheeled cart like truncated guided missiles were three bulbous metalfinned cylinders ominous and black they seemed to hold everyone away by some invisible repulsive force no one had noticed hauer yet so he hesitated trying to gauge exactly what was happening jonas stern stood with his back to the glinting storage vault speaking in low urgent tones to general steyn who faced him across the bomb cart gadi stood on sterns left an assault rifle hanging loosely in his right hand the two surviving south african ct soldiers still masked and helmeted stood directly behind general steyn smuts had propped hess against a nearby wall his wasted legs splayed out before him hans and ilse stood arm in arm beside dr sabri hauer slung his empty rifle over his shoulder strode greg iles through the semicircle and interposed himself between stern and general steyn captain hauer said general steyn he jabbed a finger at stern do you know what this madman wants to do hes talking about detonating one of these weapons hauer had already guessed as much what he could not understand was why stern had told general steyn about his plan at all perhaps the south africans had surprised the israelis in the process of arming the bombs hauer looked at smuts and pointed to one ofthe bombs exactly what are we looking at here when smuts did not respond dr sabri said you are looking at three fully operational nuclear weapons sir hauer studied the bespectacled young arab and you are hes a libyan physicist gadi said irritably weve established that already hauer stern said evenly the situation is hopeless you know that as well as and general steyn knows it better than both of us there is no way out of this building in a matter of minutes the libyans will break through when they do israel is lost unless unless you blow the northern half of south africa to hell general steyn bellowed ilses voice rose above the others how much time do we have i havent heard any explosions for a few minutes hauer rubbed his chin with the back of his hand i think some of the arabs are already inside but they wont be able to breach those shields with light weapons the main force is trying to drag their big gun across that bowl three hundred meters plus our armored car is blocking the door to the house id say we have fifteen to twenty minutes before we have to fight thank you captain said stern his voice softened as he spoke to general steyn jaap the damage from these weapons might be far less than you imagine dr sabri what are these bombs capable of the young libyan answered in a shaky voice ive only examined one of the weapons closely its a fortykiloton bomb thats a fairly low yield by todays standards though its twice the size of the hiroshima bomb if it were detonated as it was designed to bein an air burstthe results would be catastrophic but here i would guess were about a hundred meters underground the walls look like inforced concrete thats good he frowned such ings are difficult to predict but if only the one bomb exploded the result could be similar to a mediumsized underground nuclear test if however the other weapons detonated with the firstand if they are of the same approximate sizethe explosion might blow upward and break through the surface where we are standing would be the epicenter of a large crater as for the aboveground effects estimating blast radius and such my rough guess would be perhaps five kilometers the radiation is the real problem but if the wind is right the whole cloud might drift right out to sea or it might drift south and kill everyone in pretoria and johannesburg general steyn exploded hans stepped tentatively forward you said you brought an armored car with you is there some way we could sneak the bombs out of here hauer shook his head even if we could fight our way up to the vehicle wed never get the bombs up to it god only knows how much they weigh sixteen hundred and fifty kilograms each dr sabri volunteered there it is said stern with a note of finality the bombs cannot be gotten safely away that leaves only one option thats ridiculous roared general steyn all we have to do is find a way out of here ourselves we can leave the bombs right where they are as soon as we reach a phone i can call durban airbase the air force can shoot these arab pirates down before they even leave our airspace this suggestion found immediate favor in the group but while general steyn expanded on his idea gadi abrams eased slowly across the room to where hans and ilse stood listening when the general finished speaking stern put his foot on the nearest bomb laid an elbow across his knee and leaned toward the south african general steyn stared back with the tenacity of a bulldog behind him his masked soldiers stood with their shotguns at the ready jaap stern said softly i simply cannot allow these weapons to fall into libyan hands not even for an hour the risks are simply too great general steyn raised his right hand the gesture had a distinctly military quality to it and it brought an immediate response both south african commandos pointed their shotguns at stern their futuristic garb gave them the look of hostile aliens and their command over the group was total or almost total at the moment they brought their guns to bear gadi swung the barrel of his assault rifle up from behind ilse and fired from the hip ilse screamed gadis accuracy was startling fully aware that the south africans wore body armor he fired two consecutive bursts straight through the black gas masks killing both men instantly general steyn groped for the pistol at his belt gadi put one round through the generals left shoulder spinning him around and knocking him to the floor then he darted back into position behind stern and pointed his carbine at the rest of the group dr sabris face had gone white smuts was grinning ilse was still screaming but stern shouted above her everyone stay calm he had no choice no choice hans cried he murdered them general steyn struggled slowly to his feet his face flushed with pain and outrage hauer had already relieved him of his pistol you will pay for this jonas he vowed israel will pay and you know south africa can make it pay yes stern acknowledged the problem is some of you were already planning to make us pay a few fanatics general steyn spat youve gone too far stern spoke in a monotone we are talking about the survival of israel jaap if these weapons explode here in the transvaal it will be a disaster to be sure but if only one of these bombs were to explode over israel our tiny state would cease to exist and the entire world might be sucked into the vortex of war its a devils choice but its that simple tragedy versus a worldwide holocaust there was a highpitched cackle from the far wall an excellent choice of words jew even in his helpless position rudolf hess wore an expression of triumph a holocaust is exactly what is going to happen just as the fuhrer planned even if you could persuade these cowards to allow you to detonate the weapons you dont have the knowledge to do it i have won gadi abrams pointed his r at hesss face no gadi stern cried god i wanted so badly to take him back to israel for trial to see him forced to tell the world his vile story to tell what he knows about the british ill tell you now hess coughed youll all be dead within minutes anyway i might as well entertain you while we wait for major karami shut up stern snapped in german no one cares anymore let him talk hauer said if were going to die i want to know why i want to know what this nazi bastard had planned for germany hess smiled defiantly i think ill keep that to myself captain but i will tell you about the british hans stepped forward maybe there is another way out of here captain why dont we search the lab pieter smuts laughed dryly sorry sergeant one way in one way out thats the best security there is youre going to die where you stand youll die before i do hans shot back ilse reached out and squeezed hanss arm i want to hear hesss story hans i want to know why an innocent man rotted in spandau all those years and why the allies kept silent about it my grandfather came here to find those answers he thought they were very important i want to learn them if i can hess signaled for smuts to set him up straighter the gesture silenced everyone in the room in spite of the libyan commandos who would soon hammer through the protective shields above in spite of the incomprehensible danger that lay between them all like coals delivered up from hell every person in the basement crowded silently around the old man propped against the steel wall the jew knows most of it already hess rasped what he doesnt knowwhat nobody knowsis what my part of the mission was for so long the furor has focused on my flight to scotland the simple truth is that my flight was only a small part of the plan hesss voice gained strength our goal was to replace the government of england no one in england wanted another war yet any idiot could see that churchill would never make peace with the fuhrer so the answer was simpleget rid of churchill the americans and the soviet union did the same thing many times after the war coup detat is the fashionable term yes the fuhrer was always years ahead of his time hess scratched at a wisp of beard on his chin it makes me laugh now all that rot about how the valiant british saved the world from hitler ha there were dozens of powerful englishmen ready to throw churchill out and put a rightthinking man in downing street and i dont mean radicals they were lords and ladies members of parliament knights of the realm they understood that the onlyway to stop communism was to ally england with the reich so they tried it they got word to the fuhrer that if churchill and his gang could be got out they had men ready to step in if the king could be eliminated they could fill his shoes also of course the fuhrer agreed immediately while he made arrangements to have churchill and the king liquidated his english friends prepared to fill the coming power vacuum windsor was to take his younger brothers place on the throne hesss voice gained strength it was to happen on the tenth of maythe anniversary of our victorious attack on western europe my mission was simple the englishmen behind the coup demanded absolute proof that the fuhrer would live up to his end of the bargainthat he would actually make peace with britain cease the terror bombing of london and so forth hesss eyes glazed with lost glory so the fuhrer asked rudihis faithful deputy and lifelong friendto be his emissary to his british friends but why was your double sent ilse asked hess smiled cagily british intelligence learned that i was planning to fly to britain they had informers everywhere they expected me to land near dungavel castlewhich was my original planbut two weeks before my flight reinhard heydrich discovered that mi knew about the dungavel meeting rather than cancel it however heydrich simply changed the actual rendezvous to the beach opposite holy island hess nodded admiringly it was heydrichs idea to send my double on to dungavel to act as if nothing had changed you see the doubles mission was to dupe mi into believing they had captured me but just long enough for me to complete my real mission it was never intended that he do what he did but you didnt complete your mission hauer pointed out why not hess sighed because by the time i jumped out of the plane over holy island mi had found out about that rendezvous as well another informer had betrayed us when i landedseveral hundred meters off target by the wayi heard shooting i quickly realized that something had gone wrong when i moved closer to the firing i saw that british agents had already stormed the rendezvous sitewhich consisted of a halfdozen autos parked on a shingle of beach there was a gun battle between some mi operatives and my contacts hess grimaced as if at some private pain it was there i received the wound that eventually took my eye a stray bullet he shrugged my part of the mission had failed i knew the name of a german agent who maintained a radio link to occupied france from a nearby coastal village and i made my way to his house on a stolen motorbike the rest is unimportant but what of the plan to kill churchill ilse asked hess looked tired now ask the jew stern cast hess a disparaging look it actually might have worked he said but for a confused englishman who came to his senses just in time to thwart the assassination if my guess is right the only man to escape from that part of the missiona russian named zinovievfled to the same german agent hess did stern looked at hess isnt that right isnt that where the two of you met hess smiled distantly zinoviev never went back to germany as his journal claimed did he hess chuckled and in spite of your eye wound stern guessed the two of you escaped together to south america and finally ended up here sterns eyes flashed as he looked at hess zinoviev tried to warn us you know in he must have realized then how mad you were hess flung out a scarecrowthin arm zinoviev was weak all he cared about in the end was his precious mother russia holy russia he was practically a religious fanatic by hess sighed we found out about that warning though didnt we pieter and dear vasili had to meet his maker a bit earlier than even he wanted to why didnt you return to germany hauer asked hess looked genuinely sad i was confused it was never even considered that things could turn out as badly as they had you must understand i had long accepted in my mind that by may eleventh i would have succeeded in my mission or i would be dead yet i had failed and i was still alive it seemed foolish to kill myself at that point and stranger still churchills government had chosen to believepublicly at leastthat my double was in fact me day after day hiding on the coast i listened to reports of my capture while zinoviev tended my eye and then came the news from germanyfrom the fuhrer himselfthat i was mad i had suggested he say that if the worst happened but it was unnerving all the same the pronouncement told me how things stood the fuhrer had assumed that eidier i had committed suicide as planned or the british had indeed captured me his only option was to discredit me publicly it was the most difficult moment of his life i am sure not only had he lost his most faithful friend but he now faced the impossible situation we had sought to avoid in the first place with the failure of my mission war on two fronts was inevitable hess took a deep breath his face was pale and sweating nine days later i managed to get a message to the fuhrer i told him what had happened that i was alive and asked for instructions hesss face steeled with resolve i mentioned nothing of my wound and i offered to do what cowardice had not let me do on may tenthtake my own life hitlers reply came two weeks later first he awarded both myself and helmut the grand cross as a foreign national zinoviev received only the iron cross then came my orders i was to sail to brazil and there administer a massive network of assets and companies that the fuhrer had moved for safety to south america the coming twofront war had sobered him at this time he was still of sound mind and he knew the chances for ultimate victory were problematical the fuhrer was surrounded by traitors himmler plotted ceaselessly to take his place some of the partys top bankers had already fled germany hitler wantedhe neededsomeone he could trust outside the country preparing a place for him should his position become untenable hesss face glowed with pride i was that mant when the time came zinoviev killed the agent who had hidden us and he and i traveled to south america just as alfred horn had become rudolf hess to the world i became alfred horn zinoviev served as my lieutenant and bodyguard until we emigrated to south africa hess looked up at smuts and pieter assumed that position after i arrived theres one question you havent answered stern said recalling professor natterman and his obsession with the hess mystery was the duke of windsor really a traitor hess mopped his forehead who knows windsor was a fool he just wanted to be king again yes but did he knowingly conspire with the nazis to regain the throne thats what i want to know it never came to the test hess snapped dont you understand jew it was a setup a doublecross from the very beginning they used us me windsor even the fuhrer british intelligence discovered their own bloody traitors and played them back against us they lured me to england damn them of course windsor conspired with us would he really have assumed the throne as hitlers vassal would he have stolen the throne from his murdered brother no one will ever know hess shook his head in desolation lies all lies letting us hope for peace with england until it was too late hesss head swayed oddly on his neck he seemed to have forgotten his audience bormann he murmured ilse always knew abandoning the fuhrer in his hour of need smuts tried to calm hess but the old nazi slapped the afrikaner across the face borrnann terrorized my family my own wife he tried to evict my ilse from our house thank god himmler stopped him my god ilse murmured no wonder he had a fixation on me hesss eye came clear again the swine paid for his impudence in i saw him hanged with piano wire by members of the odessa i have the film in my study enough stern cried stepping in front of hess everyone stand back the time has come to bring down the curtain on this farce dr sabri prepare the weapon for detonation wait hans cried springing up to stern listen to me to hell with hess to hell with the nazis i understand your love for israel but not everyone here is a jew i am german general steyn is south african we want to live does that make us cowards if it does im a coward look at my wife shes pregnant you understand we want our child to live what right have you to take that away from us the right of the greater good stern said soffly im sorry sergeant youre sorry do you plan to murder everyone who doesnt agree with you hans pointed to the south africans gadi had shot how are you different than the nazis stern looked at ilse his face softened momentarily but he quickly turned away captain hauer he said tersely do you believe i am wrong about what must be done here with a strange sense of fatalism hauer looked down at the dead south africans he looked at general steyn bleeding steadily from his shoulder and heaving for breath he looked at hans his own son his face flushed with passion for life his innocent fervor mirrored in his wifes beautiful eyes he looked at hess cadaverous and gray a living anachronism sitting aloof on the floor beneath his afrikaner protector and finally at stern hauer had known the old israeli less than a day yet he felt closer to him than he did to many men he had known all his life stern is no fanatic he thought hes a realist hes seen enough of the world to know that giving fate one chance to beat you is one chance too many or perhaps hes just my kind of fanatic hauer didnt want to die but what choice was there to fight their way out was impossible with all eyes in the room turned to him he stepped toward hans and ilse with a heavy heart yet before he could speak an unfamiliar voice shouted from somewhere in the dark jungle of laboratory equipment behind them hullo the house hullo white flag and truce gadi jerked his rifle toward the sound hauer spun to face the darkness but he saw nothing call off your dog stern thats a british accent that doesnt make me feel any better stern retorted all right gadi he said finally stand down after the young israeli lowered his weapon a sandyhaired man of medium height rose from beneath a soapstone lab table he was wearing tattered commando gear and his left hand held a welloiled mp submachine gun hullo he said in a bit of a pinch are we who the devil are you general steyn croaked how did you get in asked hauer thats the question names burton sport exmajor in the british army too long a story to tell have the shields been lowered stern asked afraid that the libyans might already have penetrated into the inner complex dont know about any shields i came in through a bunker theres tunnels running to every one of em and they all intersect right here are you serious hauer cried the arabs didnt see you those camel bumpers not bloody likely but whats past the bunkers is there any way to get truly out of here away from this place it just so happens said burton that ive got my own personal jet and pilot waiting outside hauers mouth fell open hans and ilse ran to the englishman weve got to get out of here ilse cried now the arabs will break through any minute boarding in five minutes burton said jauntily one carryon bag per person please chapter fortyfive general steyn threw his good arm over hauers shoulder believing that burtons revelation of an escape route had resolved de facto all the argument that had gone before ilse barely had time to snatch up hesss black briefcase before hans pulled her across the room toward the englishman dr sabri also moved cautiously in that direction yet stern and gadi did not move they stood with their backs against the gleaming steel storage vault staring watchfully at the excited group gathering around the british mercenary hauer laid his hand on general steyns pistol he understood only too well what was passing through the minds of the israelis gadi stern said sharply with his rifle braced on his hip the young israeli marched past hauer grabbed dr sabri by the sleeve and pulled him back to where the three bombs waited on their carts he kicked the libyan behind the knee dropping him to the floor then shoved him down over the bomb in the middle of the cart open it stern commanded whwhat the libyan stammered open the weapon i need tools gadi swung his rifle around on smuts we dont keep any down here smuts lied gadi fired a slug into the wall beside the afrikaners head smuts didnt flinch but after a facesaving moment he stepped over to a drawer and pulled out a metal tool kit he carried it to the libyan then returned to hesss side general steyn watched all this in disbelief what are you doing now jonas our problem is solved as soon as take off i can radio the air force from this mans plane stern looked up from where dr sabri worked on the bomb this changes only two things he said quietly first you people now have a chance to get clear and second hess can go with you pieter smuts stiffened stern touched gadis sleeve hess is your responsibility youll take him out with the others the young israelis face wilted like a little boys then it hardened to stone i shall stay behind uncle he said solemnly you should be the one who takes hess to israel stern shook his head impatiently you i say there burton cut in youre not talking about setting off these bombs ive seen enough conventional weapons to know an unconventional one when i see it even if we manage to get airborne the blast wave from one of those would knock us right out of the sky stern crouchd beside dr sabri who had just gotten the cover plate off the bombs arming system whats the minimum safe distance for the aircraft that delivers this weapon dr sabri looked up at stern with wild eyes theres no way to know if the explosion breaks through the surface five perhaps six kilometers stern rose to his feet if you all leave now he said loudly you should be able to reach minimum safe distance before the libyans break through the shields i suggest you get moving hauer jabbed a finger toward the bomb cart stern that dung must have some kind of timing mechanism why not set it for thirty minutes and get out with the rest of us gadis face lit up uncle thats it stern shook his head in fifteen minutes the libyans will be inside this room theyre almost certain to have someone with them who would know how to stop the timer stern pulled dr sabri to his feet what kind of detonator does this weapon have is there a timing mechanism a timer yes but not the kind you imagine this is an airburst weapon its meant to be exploded above ground once armed its clock begins at a preprogrammed atmospheric pressure level how long does the clock run this one is set for twelve seconds but i could set it for much longer gadi jammed the barrel of his r into the terrified libyans stomach how do we know hes telling us the truth about the detonator what if you stay behind and the bomb doesnt explode youll have thrown your life away for nothing stern turned to sabri show me how the detonator works be quick while the libyan bent over the bomb casing hauer stepped up to stern do you want to throw your life away stern you have a real alternative now general steyn is rightthe south african air force can easily shoot down the libyans when they try to leave the country stern smiled wryly and if someone in the south african air force doesnt want to shoot them down sir said dr sabri looking up from the weapon hauer looked down in the libyans hands held as gingerly as if they were coiled vipers were four tricolored wires that led from a small aperture in the bomb casing two exposed copper wire ends glinted in the fluorescent light touch these together dr sabri said hoarsely and the bomb will think it has reached the preprogrammed altitude the timing mechanism will run its course and the detonator will explode a few nanoseconds later nuclear fission will be initiated there was dead silence in the room must the wires remain connected during the timers entire run stern asked the libyan nodded before anyone could stop him stern seized the two wires wrapped them together and closed them in his fist ilse screamed alan burton dived under a soapstone lab table as if it could somehow protect him from a nudlear blast hauer and gadi froze mesmerized by sterns insane act but no one reacted with the abject terror of dr sabri shrieking wildly the libyan grabbed sterns wrists and tried desperately to separate the two wires but despite the great age difference between the two men sabri failed after what stern judged to be nine secondslong enough for everyone in the room to stare death in the facehe jerked the two wires apart i think hes telling the truth gadi dr sabri fell to his knees and peered into the bombs cess panel there are only two seconds left on the clock the name of allah do not let the wires touch again not until youre all safely away stern promised hauer halfsmiled or until the libyans break into this complex right stern youd better hurry stern said tersely gadi laid a hand on his shoulder uncle please do not sacrifice yourself i am a soldier i should be the one i am a soldier too stern sighed deeply an old one but it doesnt matter im dead already what ive already been exposed to enough radiation today to kill me and if not enough to kill me at least enough to make what little that remains of my life quite unpleasant stern rubbed his eyes and sighed i can barely see you now gadi everything has a halo what are you talking about gadi cried its true ilse interjected they did the same to me or they pretended to gadi looked mystified against the wall pieter smuts shifted his body slightly away from hess xrays gadi stern explained the same way i confirmed that horn was actually hess they strapped me down and dosed me with xrays for two hours the young commando blinked what who did that to you who at that moment smuts nodded almost imperceptibly rudolf hess slid silently to the floor that man there ilse shouted pointing to smuts as her accusing finger went up the afrikaner whipped up a beretta automatic he had slipped from an ankle holster and aimed it at the two israelis no one had thoug t to searc him now he had both stern and gadi in his sights from ten feet he could not miss with a short cry gadi knocked stern down with his left hand and jerked up his carbine with his right the two men fired at the same instant outside the front entrance of horn house one of major karamis commandos leaned into the empty drivers compartment of the armscor and saw that the ignition keys had been removed he craned his neck around the seats just in time to see captain barnards bloody face appear out of the gloom like a ghost it was the last thing the libyan would ever see barnards bullet struck him right between the eyes hearing the shot two more libyans leaped through the arinscors doors captain barnard shot them both through the head struggling to breathe through the blood in his throat the south african thrust his pistol through the shattered windshield and fired wildly at the libyans grouped around the howitzer hold your positions major karami shouted the mm howitzer stood only twenty meters from the arinscor two of captain barnards bullets struck the barrel of the big gun sending several libyans scurrying for cover but major karami stood still as stone hold your positions he roared set elevation and blow that pile of shit out of my way for an artillery piece the shot was point blank everyone opened their mouths and put both hands over their ears major karami raised one brown hand high then dropped it fire pieter smutss bullet struck gadi square in the center of the chest the israeli flew backward and knocked stern down gadi had fired a burst but only one round struck the afrikaner splintering his left wrist in a spray of blood and bone before either man could move again the exploding howitzer shell shookthe ceiling of the basement like a thunderclap theyre coming hans shouted hauer saw the subsequent action in slow motion smuts steadied his pistol for a second shot gadiwho had been saved by his body armorstruggled to his feet hauer shouted a warning to smuts but the afrikaner fired anyway his second shot tore through gadis unprotected right thigh as hauer heard the second howitzer shell explode above them he raised general steyns pistol pointed it at smuts and fired four times his bullets nailed the afrikaner to the wall smuts hung there a moment wideeyed then dropped like a sack across his masters crippled legs pieter hess cried my god no another explosion shuddered through the house its now or bloody never burton shouted he too last look at hess on the floor then he turned and ran everyone out stern ordered now go hauer hustled general steyn toward the dark laboratory aisles that led to the tunnels but the wounded general collapsed after ten steps hauer started dragging him hans came back to help dr sabri glanced fearfully at gadi then darted after the others may i come with you sir he asked hauer hauer shoved the libyan down the aisle then turned back to stern give us every goddamn second you can stern these people deserve to live keep your fanatic nephew with you and hold them off as long as you can dont worry you kraut bastard gadi yelled back gripping his bleeding thigh im staying ill kill every arab up there no gadif stern insisted youre going with them you must get hess out im staying with your gadi pointed his assault rifle at the old nazi go to hell you nazi bastard stern grabbed his arm stop you must take hess to israel pick him up gadi pick him up and carry him out of here carry him all the way to jerusalem hell hang soon enough hauer and the others had paused halfway to the tunnel all eyes were riveted on the surreal drama taking place in the pool of fluorescent light before the silver storage vault even facing their own deaths those who wanted so desperately to live could not tear their eyes away from two men so ready to die without fear or regret another explosion rattled the glassware in the lab the englishmans gone hans shouted lets go dr sabri broke and ran hans shoved ilse after the libyan stern squatted astride the bomb and picked up the stripped detonator wires mother of god hauer murmured blcking toward the shadows gadi stubbornly took up a firing position behind stern stern turned around and gazed into the young commandos burning eyes his voice cracked with emotion in the name of abraham gadi take hess to israel that is not an order it is a sacred charge on the souls of your ancestors leave me a gun and get hess out a tear streaked the young israelis face with shaking hands he laid his rifle against the bomb casing and crossed to where hess lay favoring his good leg he crouched down caught the old man under the arms and lifted hess immediately began to struggle gadi punched him in the side of the head then he heaved the wasted body over his shoulder yes stern called get him out quivering beneath his hundredpound load the wounded israeli staggered after hauer and hans yet after only four short steps his savaged thigh muscle gave way he crashed to the floor screaming in agony hess fell on top of him gadi clenched his jaws shut and rolled the old man off then with his bloody thigh twitching uncontrollably he struggled to his feet again again he hoisted hess to his shoulder and tried to walk he gasped with each step fighting the searing fire in his leg like a boxer knocked senseless but still on his feet he reeled backward toward stern no gadi stern barked the other way forward the young commando tottered a moment then collapsed hess hit the floor hard this time and didnt move sobbing with rage and pain gadi got to his knees and tried once more to lift the old man he summoned every ounce of strength he had left but smutss bullet had done too much damage i cant do it uncle ill never get him through the tunnel hauer stern shouted come back and help the boy yes gadi called help me captain hauers answer flared out of the darkness hess can go to hell im saving general steyn you just hold those arabs back as long as you can you owe it to us stern shouted for munich yes i know you were there come back hauer for the jews you let die let it go stern that war is over leave him yadi stern cried angrily frau apfel has the zinoviev book and the spandau papers thats all the proof you need those papers alone indict the british then im staying with you no you must get that evidence to israel the others can do it a jew gadi a jew must do it to be sure gadi looked wildly at his uncle for a moment then made his decision he stripped the guns from the south africans he had killed and laid them at sterns feet kill as many as you can uncle i will get your papers to jerusalem stern smiled i know you will my boy now go he hugged gadis face to his own shalom shalom uncle gadi choked back a sob no jew will ever forget you go stern commanded my time has come dragging his bleeding leg behind him gadi picked up his rifle and went the barrel of major karamis howitzer now protruded through the shattered front door of horn house karami watched the leader of his search detail race into the reception hall we find only corpses and servants in the house major karami smiled clear the house taking a last look at the black shield blocking the elevator the libyan major squeezed between the door frame and the gun carriage and took up a position behind the howitzer he remembered the elevator from his first visit and he knew that at the bottom of its deep shaft lay horns basement storage facility and inside that basementa sword worthy of mohammed himself fire he shouted alan burton had been waiting in the darkness beside the bunker for a full minute when dr sabri poked his head through the jagged hatch come on then he snapped as he pulled the libyan out i heard you speaking arabic back there sport you with these blighters out here no sir those men are assassins they murdered my prime minister before burton could reply ilse squirmed out of the black hole she explained that hauer and hans were still struggling through the tunnel with general steyn burton looked anxiously at his watch we cant wait any longer he said youd better follow me he turned and trotted toward the airstrip dr sabri followed but ilse hung back clinging tightly to hesss briefcase after thirty agonizing seconds general steyns head appeared his face a bloodless mask of shock and confusion while hauer and hans pushed from behind ilse pulled hans followed the general through the hatch and finally hauer wriggled through ilse hugged hans fiercely sandwiching hesss briefcase between them only gadi had not yet appeared come on hauer said harshly either he makes it or he doesnt jonas stern squatted silently on his cylinder of armageddon and waited for the libyans to come holding the stripped wires like talismans he surveyed the shadows around him he was king in a world of corpses at his feet lay the south african counterterror troops their futuristic gas masks lethally punctured by gadis bullets behind them splayed out on his back like a broken doll pieter smuts lay in a spreading pool of blood only rudolf hess remained alive too crippled by arthrifis to drag his frail body to safety the old nazi had managed to struggle into a sitting position against the wall to sterns left his eyepatch had slipped off now a scarred empty socket stared at stern stern listened for the slightest sound from the far end of the lab he heard nothing he looked curiously at hess here was the man who had brought them all to this place hess the name carried stern back to a youth so torn by fear loss and pain that he remembered only the ceaseless throb of grief he had survived the cruelest war that ever scourged the earth and near him now lay one of the men who had unleashed it upon the world strangely he felt no personal hatred for the bag of brittle bonesonly a detached curiosity a desire to know if there had ever been some reason for what was done hess he said softly the old nazis good eye fluttered open what do you want jew tell me something have you ever come to understand what hitler did the obscenity of it the inhumanity hess looked away tell me stern insisted i want to know why why the holocaust why murder thousands of children what was it the jews ever do to him or to you hess looked back at stern another explosion rocked the ceiling above them but stern saw only hess a dark fire had come into the withered nazis solitary eye a blind animal hatred so removed from the community of man that stern felt driven to cross the room and crush the skull that conrained it it was a blindness that could not see murder a deafness that could not hear the screams of children a muteness that could speak only through violence why did i even ask he thought hopelessly its like asking a bully why he drowns a cat or a father why he molests his infant child or some reason one could understand there and hoping f is no reason stern lifted an r assault rifle from the floor and brought its barrel to bear on hesss crippled body the old nazis watery eye showed no fear you want to kill me jew he said softly you can kill me but you cannot kill what i lived for captain hauer said phoenix will be wiped out but he is wrong what united the men of phoenix exists everywhere in germany south america in the soviet union the united states and britain everywhere all governments know about our groups but they do nothing the press calls them ultraright organizations a few members go to jail now and then so what why are they tolerated because deep down people understand these movements they express something every civilized man feelsthe justified fear of anarchy of racial destruction they know that one day the great struggle will come the struggle against the schwarze and asian and the jew didnt you hear what i said this afternoon stern cried the jews dont want to destroy anyone thats the difference between us and you we have the power to vaporize our enemies yet we choose not to hess smirked ill tell you what that tells me jew it tells me that your race is weak the jew is clever enough to build atomic weapons but he lacks the moral courage to use what he has created youre mad stern said quietly hess chuckled dont deceive yourself there are individuals in israel who want to use their nuclear weapons that is why your nation must be obliterated with a profound emptiness stern dropped his rifle to the floor and turned away seeing this hess heaved himself away from the wall and began dragging himself slowly toward stern youll have to kill me jew sweating and grunting in the darkness of the airstrip hans and hauer lifted general steyn through the main door of the libyan learjet ilse and dr sabri were already aboard after laying the general on a pile of carpets at the rear of the cabin hauer leaned out of the plane to speak to alan burton the englishman had disappeared peering into the darkness further up the runway hauer saw the libyan yak several guards patrolled beneath the big airliner but as yet they had not spied the activity around the lear burton hauer called into the darkness theres no pilot in here hearing a scuffle of footsteps at the edge of the runway hauer raised his pistol help me get him in said burton my god hauer breathed spying diazs bloodsoaked shirt he slid beneath the cubans shoulder and struggled up the jets three steps it took both him and burton to get diaz to the lears cockpit hauer looked down at the cubans face hes unconscious just resting his eyes said burton hes a tough little bugger the englishman slapped diaz on the cheek arent you sport the cubans head lolled forward in something close to a nod jesus hauer muttered as hans pulled the lears stepdoor closed someone grabbed it from outside and tried to pull it down captain he shouted hauer darted back to the cabinkicked the stepdoor down and shoved general steyns pistol through the door gadi abrams stood there gasping for breath his left trouser leg soaked with blood hauer pulled the israeli into the plane and secured the door ready hans shouted forward in the cockpit burton strapped diaz into the pilots chair everyone else hunkered down in the passenger cabin ilse did her best to comfort general steyn who lay with his head propped on a small pillow hesss briefcase lay on the floor at ilses feet can that man fly she asked worriedlyif he wants to live gadi groaned as he tied a pillowcase around his torn thigh hans ducked his head and walked up to the cockpit partition over hauers shoulder he saw burton sitting in the copilots seat massaging diazs ashen face can he do it hans asked quietly hauer shrugged hes trying diazs hands floated forward and hit several switches the cockpit lights came on hans felt a soft thrumming in the jets hull burton glanced up at hauerthose camel bumpers will come running when they hear the engines mate can you handle them hauer moved back into the cabin and lifted a libyan uzi from the floor hans pulled open the rear door for him put your hand in the back of my pants said hauer then with only hans to keep him from falling he leaned out and drew a bead on the black figures beneath the libyan airliner suddenly general steyn sat up and shouted cant cant let stern detonate hell kill thousands millions ilse tried to calm the south african but he would not be comforted shut him up gadi snapped from the floor hans glared back at the israeli you shut up you fucking fanatic everyone be quiet ilse begged please the lear shuddered once then lurched forward through the open hatch hans heard distant shouts of alarm hauers uzi barked three times in quick succession hans thought he saw two libyans fall but in the darkness it was hard to tell secure that hatch burton shouted from the cockpit hauer fired twice more then he pulled the steps up into the lears belly the sleek jet gathered speed rapidly through a side window hans saw the yak flash past diaz pushed the engines to their limit everyone in the cabin clung fearfully to whatever he could hauer struggled up to the cockpit and looked out through the windshield he saw only darkness ahead gripping the back of diazs seat he heard the cuban muttering a prayer he said a silent one himself suddenly diaz pulled back hard on the stick and with a sickening boom the lear tore itself from the earths grasp the dark veld fell away beneath them they were airborne jl chapter fortysix stern peered into the darkness at the far end of the lab hess lay motionless beside him the old nazi had dragged himself too close and stern had clubbed him with the butt of his rifle he looked dead three silent minutes had passed since the last explosion thenjust seconds ago stern thought he had heard a furtive shuffle from the shadows there again he recognized the sound now the stealthy rustle of soldiers maneuvering into position herr horn called a voice from the darkness guten abend this is major ilyas karami i have come to take delivery of my weapon squatting behind the bomb with the stripped wires in his hands stern leaned his cheek against the cool metal herr horn karami shouted there is no need for more men to die we want the same thing dont we the destruction of israel stern glanced at his watch he reluctantly set the detonator wires aside and picked up one of the rifles gadi had left him herr horn karami cried i know you are there stern stared down at the exposed detonator wires they were blurred now the radiation had done its work i could touch them together now he thought and end the whole mad game but the others will barely be airborne by now if theyve reached the plane at all gadi hauer frau apfel the spandau papers stern pulled back the bolt on the r and pointed it into the darkness if you do not answer karami shouted i shall be forced to order my men forward stern rose to one knee and depressed the rs trigger the muzzle flashes seared his damaged eyes as he strafed the far end of the dark lab he fired until the clip ran out then picked up another rifle his ears were ringing like fire bells someone moaned in agony a deep voice screamed arabic in the darkness dont shoot back he doesnt want his men to hit the bombs stern realized that might buy me a few morestern froze through the groans of the wounded he could hear the rustle of the libyans edging forward through the unfamiliar darkness they were coming fighting an almost irresistible urge to ffimst the wires together he cocked the second r rose up and opened fire the lear was at seventeen thousand feet and still climbing diaz had pointed the sleek jet deadeast toward mozambique and the indian ocean it streaked upward like a bullet passing four hundred miles per hour alan burton sat in the cockpit beside diaz and did his best to keep the cuban conscious while behind them a violent argument raged in the passenger cabin gadi abrams wanted hesss briefcase he meant to obey his uncles last wish and that meant taking the papers to israel himself the briefcase lay beside ilse who was ministering to general steyn at the rear of the cabin it is my duty and my right the israeli repeated hess was a nazi and his mission was directed at the jews hauer stood up from his seat beside hans and placed himself between gadi and ilse take it easy he said the holocaust doesnt give you the right to take possession of every scrap of history relating to the nazis the papers deal first and foremost with germans we should be the ones tll youll bury them forever gadi acused hauer shook his head you idiot those papers dont hurt germany they hurt britain this is ridiculous hans snapped we could all die at any moment if you want to argue about who owns the spandau papers its me i found them so just shut up ilse will keep them until were safely away from here when will that be ilse asked dr sabri im not sure the libyan replied it depends on how al minimum distance point now listen to me gadi interrupted you may have found the spandau papers but hess gave the zinoviev book to my uncle in the belief that he was my grandfather ilse reminded him gadi wobbled uncertainly on his wounded leg fearing he might lose consciousness he raised his r threateningly tell frau apfel to pass the case to me captain or i will be forced to take it put that down hauer bellowed if you fire in here youll kill us all he took a step toward the commando stop gadi warned jabbing his rifle forward with the mesmerizing stare he had used on the russian kgb officer all the way back at spandau prison hauer took one more step then pinioned gadis wrist with a grip of iron let go gadi cried his face white with rage the muzzle of the r was an inch from hauers left eye drop it hauer said quietly lets all calm down shall we alan burton had spoken qgietly from thecockpit door but his mp submachine gun put steel in his words let the nice lad go captain he said so he can drop his weapon he wont drop it i think he will said the englishman this is a pressurized cabin captain if he fires that rifle in here he will kill us allhimself included d the papers will be destroyed my weapon on the other hand holds tefloncoated bullets they explode before they pass through a human body a rather handy innovation our israeli friend probably knows all about it hauer loosened his grip and i must tell you gentlemen burton added i rarely miss what i aim at hauer let go gadi reluctantly let his r fall to the cabin floor none of you need worry about the papers anyway said burton because i am taking that briefcase with me hauer and gadi gaped at the englishman burton grinned you didnt think i was down in that basement on vacation did you i was sent to do a job to kill a man and after very name his double gave when he parachuted into scotland how long would it take the mossad to figure that one out a week yet the story has never been made public if what stern said about israelisouth african nuclear agreements is true i can see how the israelis might have let him live hess left germany in the spring of fortyone and most of the atrocities werent committed until much later thats not true gadi argued it is ilse said softly my grandfather told me that the real crimes against humanity didnt happen until after hess left germany thats obscene gadi shouted youre crazy this is all terribly interesting burton cut in but im not much on history he turned to ilse lets have that case love take it ilse cried she hurled the briefcase at the englishman gadi tried to intercept it but his wounded thigh prevented him the case landed at burtons feet would you get that for me captain he said to hauer keeping his gun trained on gadi hauer knelt and retrieved the case open it the case was not locked hauer opened it and glanced inside a thin smile touched the corners of his mouth gadi snatched the case burton made no move to stop him the young israeli threw the case to the floor where are the papers he demanded his eyes on ilse ilse glared from one man to the other those papers have caused enough pain they should have been buried with the rubble of spandau the whole sick business should be allowed to die gadi put his face in his hands oh god no ilse raised her chin defiantly and pointed toward the tail of the lear yes she said theyre back there in the tail burton asked hopefully in hell stern had shot three libyans already but he couldnt hold out much longer if the libyans rushed him he might be hit before he could detonate the weapon he simply couldnt afford to buy the lear any more time crouching low he laid his rifle gently on the floor and took one of the bright cop wires in each hand i want to talk cried a voice from the shadows its too late for talk stern shouted back the first verbal response he had given the libyans why do you fight me herr horn karami asked listen please i know who you are deputy fuhrer rudolf hess yes you visited tripoli in i believe you have seen my people sir we have the same goal you and ithe destruction of the jews i was wrong to attack you perhaps but i need all the weapons you have here speak to me please let me finish the job your fuhrer gave to the mufti of jerusalem please herr hess i do not understand your position stern laughed silently come forward major youll understand soon enough karami considered this all right he said at length im coming i am unarmed crouched behind the bomb casing stern watched the tall blackmustached arab step from the darkness his hands raised above his head his onyx eyes blazed with fierce passion herr horn karami asked puzzled stern raised a hand and pointed to the motionless heap lying just in front of the bomb cart there he said karamis eyes searched the gloom until they settled on hess who is behind there he asked mr smuts what happened here allah took a hand in things stern said for the first time karami noticed the masked corpses of the south african commandos not far away he saw the body of pieter smuts then his black eyes lifted drawn by the gleaming cylinders behind which stern waited so there are three he said his voice shallow i knew there had to be more i knew it stern waited in silence in spite of what the xrays had done to him he felt strangely awed by the knowledge that his life was now measured in seconds his mouth felt dry as sawdust if hess is dead major karami wondered aloud and mr smuts is dead who are you stern poked his head above the bomb casing then slowly he raised his hands the exposed copper wires glinted in the dim light with a weight like a cancer in his stomach ilyas karami comprehended what the wires meant what do you want he asked hoarsely do you want gold drugs diamonds for these weapons my master will grant you a kingdom stern crouched lower he prayed to god the leet was well away by now why do you consider this mad thing karami asked genuinely puzzled you want to die you want to be a martyr martyrdom is for the sons of allah my friend not good christians for rescuing these weapons you will be a hero in my nation come out from there and let me make you the richest man in the world come out and tell me who you are stern laughed the sound was brittle as a voice from the grave were both martyrs major isnt it funny how that works out his face hardened ill see you in the afterlife my arab friend shalom in one terrible instant ilyas karami realized that the man facing him across his coveted weapons was a jew from the hot core of his being he screamed a curse of pure hatred at his lifelong enemy at the same time jerking out the pistol he had hidden in the belt behind his back but at that moment hess jerked up from the floor and clutched at the wires in sterns hands deutschland he shrieked deutschland uber alles stern swatted the skeletal arms aside wrapped the two bare wires together and clenched them in his fist he smiled sadly then closed his eyes karami emptied his pistol as fast as his finger could pull the trigger but hesss stillstruggling body shielded stern from the first bullets the old nazi danced horribly in midair and by the time a slug found stern it was too late in the blink of an eye darkness turned to noon even with the nose cone of the leadet pointed away from the blast the flash blinded everyone inside diaz lost control of the aircraft it pitched over into a screaming spinning dive hurtling earthward at over five hundred miles per hour in the cabin people slammed into each other in the terror of flashblindness general steyn screamed in pain hauer halffell past burton into the cockpit straig up he screamed level out the lears engines whined insanely as the plane plummeted earthward hauer grabbed the cubans wounded shoulder and squeezed maniacafly level out damn you the blast waves coming the blast wave somehow diaz managed to pull out of the dive he had almost succeeded in stabilizing the lear when the blast wave hit the solid wall of superheated air tossed the tiny jet like a wave throws a surfboard pitching it up and forward then dropping it into a trough of dead air hauer felt a sudden nausea as if hydroplaning a car around a curve then just as suddenly the feeling passed he heard diaz cursing ftiriously from the cockpit as he wrestled with the controls is anyone hurt hauer shouted his vision was slowly returningi cant see someone moaned holy mother of god general steyn mumbled he did it stern actually did it i cant see anything someone cried help me the blindness will pass dr sabri shouted from the floor we were lucky it could have been twice that bad the papers gadi muttered his voict cracking the spandau papers are gone jonas is dead where is that german bitch with ilse now the object of all his rage and frustration the israeli scrabbled blindly across the cabin floor in search of his rifle hauer had finally had enough when gadis hand closed around ilses ankle hauer lifted the rifle from beneath the israelis sightless eyes and struck him on the side of the head with its stock gadi collapsed in a heap quickly hauer collected every weapon he could findbeginning with burtons mpand piled them all behind some pillows at the back of the cabin then he took hanss hand and led him over to ilse its all right he said just keep your eyes closed for a minute ilses arms went around hauers neck as well as hanss were alive she said softly my god were alive she opened her eyes tears of relief welled up in them and ran down her cheeks a smile started across her face then she pulled up her hand and covered her mouth stern she said haltingly herr stern hes dead as hauer held hans and ilse in his arms he thought about that he suspected that the old israeli would have called the trade more than fair the mystery of rudolf hess would probably remain unsolved foreverr at least until the british government opened its secret vaultsbut stern had never cared much about that what mattered was that the state of israel had received a new lease on life a gift from one of its youngest fathers and eldest sons epilogue washingtonat pm eastern standard time last night a national weather office rorsat a meteorological satellite recorded an intense flash and heat bloom over the northeastern corner of the republic of south africa weather office analysts report that the event was consistent with data resulting from a large underground nuclear blast the weather office recorded many such events over the soviet union during the s and believes its opinion to be accurate both the national reconnaissance office and the pentagon have refused to comment but it is believed that this incident confirms the existence of a secret nuclear weapons arsenal in south africa a similar event was photographed over the indian ocean off the south african coast in weather office analysts do not have the equipment required to measure the release of radiation into the atmosphere but they suggest that with the prevailing winds over the northern transvaal yesterday any such radiation would likely have been blown out over the indian ocean several international environmental groups have expressed outrage over the test national weather office analysts place the probable nuclear test site less than miles from the kruger national park one of the richest preserves for wildlife on the african continent the environmental organization greenpeace intends to file complaints with both the international atomic energy agency and the united nations but the activist group expects that little will be done the white house has issued no statement on the event and government officials in pretoria and capetown have bluntly refused to grant interviews calling the charges alarmist and unfounded a national weather office analyst who refuses to be named gave this comment tell the south africans welcome to the club west berlinapiat am central european time yesterday an elite counterteffor unit consisting of gsg commandos working in concert with the us army stormed a friedrichstrasse police station and cleared it of hostile elements us army colonel godfrey rose the american commander on the scene stated that a hostage situation had been going on for some time without the knowledge of the press the terrorists inside the station had not demanded media coverage rose said and it was felt that premature press involvement could have impeded the rapid resolution of what was not a critical but rather an unpleasant situation api has no further information on the terrorists who took over abschnitt but the west berlin mayors office has indicated that several west berlin police hostages died in the assault among them was wilhelm funk the prefect of west berlin police funk along with his fellow officers will be buried on friday with full police honors colonel rose who had worked extensively with funk in the past called his death a loss that will be deeply felt but is best put behind us the funeral service at the wilmersdorf cemetery is expected to draw thousands of loyal west germans minutes of the special interallied intelligence conference on disposition of the phoenix case schloss bellevue west berlin present us colonel godfrey rose chief of military intelligence west berlin us undersecretary of state john taylor ussr colonel ivan kosov grigori zemenek chairman of kgb uk sir neville shaw director general mi peter billingsley special counsel to her majesty frg senator karl holer aide to the chancellor hansdietrich muller director of operations for the bnd west german intelligence meeting chaired by undersecretary taylor following passage excerpted from the questioning of julius k schneider kripo detective first grade taylor detective schneider is it your opinion then the russians will carry through with their purge of stasi officers who are listed on captain hauers list zemenek i strenuously object mr undersecretary i have assured this council that all appropriate measures are being taken taylor then you should have no objection to herr schneider answering the question schneider i believe the russians will vigorously pursue such a purge pause its the political members of phnix i worry about sir on both sides of the wall i doubt that captain hauers list contained a full miiller objection there is no evidence whatsoever that the phoenix cult has influence in the political hierarchy of the federal republic if there is such evidence our russian comrades should force the stasi to open their infamous blackmail files so that we may see who is vulnerable to coercion hofer i do not think that will be necessary gentlemen the chancellor has full confidence that our colleagues in the bnd can root out whatever remains of this atavistic but entirely anomalous reversion to the nazi period of germanys history unintelligible grumbling on all sides taylor gentlemen i understand the ramifications of the phoenix matter what im having difficulty accepting is that rudolf hess actually survived the war and lived until just a few days ago the man would have been over ninety years old rose laughter ever watch the today show mr undersecretary taylor i dont follow you colonel rose every morning willard scott flashes up pictures of people having their birthdays every picture he puts up is of someone over a hundred years old hell prisoner number seven only died six weeks ago billingsley clears throat gentlemen i am loath to waste detective schneiders valuable time with trivialities if i may i would like to return to the question of the hess material the security of the spandau papers the zinoviev papers and other related artifacts her majestys government is most concerned to know that all such material is now in the possession of the united states government particularly in colonel roses military intelligence office here in west berlin detective schneider schneider sir billingsley is it your opinion that all tangible evidence of rudolf hesss actual mission in has now been suppressed that no physical artifacts remain schneider artifacts billingsley photocopies photographs tapes et cetera schneider lengthy pause to the best of my knowledge that is true shaw frankly im much more concerned about the russian promise for the record i want us all to be absolutely clear on that in exchange for the list of phoenix members compiled by captain hauer the soviet government will drop all public pursuit of the rudolf hess case kosov burst of unintelligible russian zemenek colonel kosov i apologize gentlemen yes that is the agreement my signature carries the weight of the politburo billingsley thank you mr chairman and we are agreed thenunanimouslythat the israeli government will not be informed of the contents of any of these documents rose from what weve learned about the secret israeli south african nuclear agreements and the involvement of rudolf hess i doubt the israelis would make the story public even if they knew sounds of agreement taylor well then gentlemen if weve finished with detective schneider may i suggest that we adjourn for lunch we can resume at two pm abstract concluded pm martin luther hospital british sector west berlin professor natterman looked up in surprise from his hospital bed framed in the doorway was the huge hatted figure of the kripo detective whom natterman had last seen killing a russian in a south african hotel room natterman shook his head to clear the fog of pain medication guten abend professor schneider said natterman nodded you look worse than you did in south africa infection natterman explained by the time i reached a hospital here in germany sepsis had set in they say ill be cured in two weeks or so schneider smiled good for you he removed his hat and overcoat and stepped closer to the hospital bed you know professor i just came from a meeting where a lot of allied officials asked me a lot of questions about the hess case natterman looked suddenly wary they wanted to know if any evidence of the truth remained if there were any photocopies tapes anything like that you know when i thought about it i did seem to remember some photographs captain hauer had in the hotel room or negatives natterman lay still as a stone schneider sniffed the hospital air with distaste i hate these places he said whenever i come people i know seem to die he laid an arm on nattermans shoulder i told those bureaucrats nothing survived to hell with them you know natterman said nothing but ive been thinking schneider went on about what should happen to evidence like that if it really existed of course should it be trumpeted in the press or in a book rehashed for the millionth time like all the other nazi history or should it be buried like the allies want it to be after a long silence natterman said ive been doing some thinking too detective ive decided that the decision should not be up to us to germans schneider nodded slowly help me out of bed natterman said suddenly what the doctors said i couldnt visit you more than ten minutes you cant get up nattermans face contorted in pain as he pulled something from beneath his bedclothes an envelope ive got something i need to deliver he said and i want to make sure you take it where i want it to go so help me up how do we get past the doctors youre a policeman arent you schneider put on his hat and overcoat then lifted the old man out of bed as if he were a child at the wilmersdorf post office schneider took a final glance at natterman as he walked into the building the old historians face framed in the open window of the taxi was flushed by the freezing wind inside the post office schneider withdrew nattermans envelope from his coat pocket when he saw the address scrawled on the paper he smiled schneider suspected it had taken a great act of sacrifice on the professors part to give up what this envelope contained if it contained what schneider thought it did unable to resist the temptation schneider took a small knife from his pocket slit open the envelope and looked inside he saw several strips of blackandwhite photographic negatives he held one up to the light he saw what could only be latin the spandau papers the envelope also contained a note written on a piece of hospital notepaper it said to whom it may concern i imagine your superiors will know what to do with these the german who wrote these words wanted his story told but it is for your people to decide what is best signed a good german schneider folded the paper and slipped it back into the envelope then ignoring a long line he stepped up to the postal counter the clerk made an extremely rude face and motioned for him to move to the back of the line schneider pulled out his wallet threw a banknote on the counter and showed the clerk his kripo id polizei he grunted give me some tape the clerk handed schneider a tape dispenser schneider carefully resealed the envelope then he shoved it across to the clerk you make sure this gets where its going he said and no slipups its polizei business the clerk snatched the envelope and stuffed it behind his counter he acted annoyed but schneider could tell hed gotten the message schneider pulled his coat collar around his big neck and ambled out into the freezing berlin wind he nodded to professor natterman then he grinned he better now inside the post office the clerk jerked the envelope out of its slot and read the address israeli ambassador co israeli embassy bonn simrock allee bonn germany the return address was the same jews in the damned police department the clerk muttered what the hell is happening to this country
