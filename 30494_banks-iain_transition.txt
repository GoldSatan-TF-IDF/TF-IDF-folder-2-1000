iain m banks transition for alastair and emily and in memory of bec with thanks to adèle mic richard les gary and zoe prologue apparently i am what is known as an unreliable narrator though of course if you believe everything youre told you deserve whatever you get it is believe me more than a little amazingand entirely unprecedentedthat you are reading these words at all have you ever seen a seismograph you know one of those terribly delicate and sensitive things with a long spideryfingered pen that inscribes a line on a roll of paper being moved beneath it to record earth tremors imagine that one of those is sailing serenely along recording nothing of note drawing a straight and steady black line registering just calmness and quiet both beneath your feet and all around the world and then it suddenly starts to write in flowing copperplate the paper zipping back and forth beneath it to accommodate its smoothly swirling calligraphy it might write apparently i am what is known as an unreliable narrator that is how unlikely it is that i am writing this and anybody is reading it trust me time place necessary i suppose though in the circumstances insufficient however we must begin somewhere and somewhen so let me start with mrs mulverhill and record that by your reckoning i first encountered her near the beginning of that golden age which nobody noticed was happening at the time i mean the long decade between the fall of the wall and the fall of the towers if you wish to be pedantically exact about it those retrospectively blessed dozen years lasted from the chilly fevered central european night of november th to that bright morning on the eastern seaboard of america of september th one event symbolised the lifted threat of a worldwide nuclear holocaust something which had been hanging over humanity for nearly forty years and so ended an age of idiocy the other ushered in a new one the walls fall was not spectacular it was night and all you saw on television was a bunch of leatherjacketed berliners attacking reinforced concrete mostly with hammers rather ineffectually nobody died a lot of people got drunk and stoned and laid no doubt the wall itself was not a striking structure and not even very tall or especially forbidding the real obstacle had always been the barren sandy killing ground of mines dog runs and razor wire behind it the vertical barrier was always more symbolic than anything else a delineation so the fact that none of the crowds of cheerful vandals scrabbling for a perch on it could do much to destroy it without access to heavy equipment was irrelevant what mattered was that they were clambering all over this famously divisive allegedly defensive symbol without getting machinegunned however as the expression of a sudden outburst of hope and optimism and an embracing of change one could ask for no more i suppose the alqaida attack on the usa well given that a nation was invaded and occupied using this as an excuse and that this was done in the name of democracy lets be both nationalistic and democratic about it the saudi arabian attack on the usa could hardly have offered a greater contrast slung between these two widereaching levellings the intervening years held civilisation happily if ignorantly scooped as in a hammock sometime about the centre of that sweet trough mrs m and i became lost to each other we met again then parted again for the final time just before the third fall the fall of wall street and the city the fall of the banks the fall of the markets beginning on september th perhaps we all find such coincident place marks in the books of our lives reassuring still it seems to me that such congruencies while useful in fixing what one might call ones personal eras within our shared history are effectively meaningless lying here during all this time after my own small fall it has become my conviction that things mean pretty much what we want them to mean well pluck significance from the least consequential happenstance if it suits us and happily ignore the most flagrantly obvious symmetry between separate aspects of our lives if it threatens some cherished prejudice or cosily comforting belief we are blindest to precisely whatever might be most illuminating mrs mulverhill herself said that i think or it might have been madame dortolan i get the two confused sometimes i am getting a little ahead of myself so in the light of the above let us embrace rather than resist this effect you may even as we begin wish to know how my part in this ends so let me tell you this is how it ends he comes into my room he is dressed in black and wearing gloves it is dark in here just a night light on but he can identify me lying on the hospital bed propped up at a slight angle one or two remaining tubes and wires attaching me to various pieces of medical equipment he ignores these the nurse who would hear any alarm is lying trussed and taped down the hall the monitor in front of him switched off the man shuts the door darkening the room still further he walks quietly to my bedside though i ought to be unlikely to wake as i am sedated lightly drugged to aid a good nights sleep he looks at my bed even in the dim light he can see that it is tightly made i am constricted within this envelope of sheets and blanket reassured by this confinement he takes the spare pillow from the side of my head and places it gently at first over my face then quickly bears down on me forcing his hands down on either side of my head pinning my arms under the covers with his elbows placing most of his weight on his arms and his chest his feet rising from the floor until only the tips of his shoes are still in contact with it i dont even struggle at first when i do he simply smiles my feeble attempts to bring my hands up and to use my legs to kick myself free come to nothing wound amongst these sheets even a fit man would have stood little chance of fighting his way from beneath such suffocating weight finally in one last hopeless convulsion i try to arch my back he rides this throe easily and in a moment or two i fall back and all movement ceases he is no fool he has anticipated that i might merely be playing dead so he lies quite calmly on me for a while as unmoving as i checking his watch now and again as the minutes tick by to make sure i am gone i hope youre happy an ending and we have barely even begun yet so we shall begin first with something that in a sense has yet to happen it begins on a train the highest train in the world between china and tibet it begins with a man in a cheap brown business suit walking from one swaying carriage to another his gait a little unsteady as he holds a small oxygen cylinder in one hand and an automatic handgun in the other he steps onto the sliding metal plates that separate the carriages the corrugated collar linking the passenger cars flexing and wheezing around him like a gigantic version of the ribbed tube connecting the oxygen cylinder and the transparent mask round his nose and mouth inside the mask he finds himself smiling nervously the train rattles and jiggles around him moving ponderously up and down and side to side throwing him briefly against the ribs of the connector perhaps a place where the permafrost has proved less than permanent he has heard that there have been problems he steadies himself rebalancing as the train straightens and resumes its smooth progress he sticks the oxygen cylinder under one arm and uses his free hand to straighten his tie the gun is a peoples army issue k decades old and feeling worn smooth with age he has never fired it but it is meant to be reliable the silencer looks crude almost homemade still it will have to do he wipes his hand on his trousers cocks the gun and extends his fingers towards the code panel above the handle of the door leading to the private carriage a tiny red light pulses slowly on the locks display they are approaching the highest part of the line the tanggula pass still most of a day away from lhasa the air feels cool and thin here five kilometres up most people will be keeping to their seats plugged into the trains oxygen supply outside the tibetan plateau a symphony of dun beige and brown with a bitty overlay of earlysummer green has ridged and buckled over the last hour to create foothills that harbinge the crumpled parapets of low encroaching mountains in the distance the chief train guard had demanded a lot of money for the override code it had better work he taps it in quickly the tiny pulsing red light turns steady green he feels himself swallowing the train rocks the handle feels cold beneath his fingers and it begins with our youngsounding younglooking youngacting but in the end middleaged friend mr adrian cubbish waking up in his mayfair home one london morning in oh lets say late summer the routine is the same for the majority of days he is in his bedroom suite which takes up most of what used to be the attic of the town house a light rain is falling onto the slabs of doubleglazed glass which point at fortyfive degrees to the light grey sky if adrian were to have a symbol it would be a mirror this is what he says to the mirror each morning before he goes to work and sometimes at the weekends when he doesnt have to go to work just for the sheer hell of it the market is god there is no god but the market he takes a breath here smiling at his stillwaking face he looks young and fit slim but muscled he has tanned caucasian skin black hair greygreen eyes and a wide mouth which is usually fixed in a knowing grin adrian has only ever slept with one woman who was significantly older than him she chose to describe his mouth as sensuous which hed decided after a little thought was cool girls his own age and younger would call his mouth cute if they thought to describe it at all he has a shadowbeard a night old he lets his beard grow for a week or so sometimes before shaving it off he looks good either way he looks if he is being honest with himself like a male model he looks just like he wants to look maybe he could be a little taller he clears his throat spits into the glass bowl of one of the bathrooms two sinks naked he runs his hand through the dark curls of his pubic hair in the name of capital the compassionate the wise he tells himself he grins winks at his own reflection amused and here in a lowrise office suite in glendale los angeles blinds slicing the slanting late afternoon sunlight into dark and shining strips draped across carpet tiles chairs suits and conference table the noise of the freeway a grumbling susurrus in the background while mike esteros makes his pitch gentlemen lady this is more than just a pitch dont get me wrong this is a pitch but its also an important part of the movie im going to convince you that you want to help me make what im going to tell you here is how to find aliens seriously when im done youll believe it might be possible youll think we can capture an alien what well certainly be able do is create a movie that will capture the imagination of a generation a close encounters a titanic so thank you for letting me have these few minutes of your time i promise you they wont be wasted now anybody seen a full eclipse anyone been in the path of totality when the sun is just wisps and tendrils of light peeking out from behind the moon you sir pretty impressive sight yeah yeah mindblowing indeed changes some peoples lives they become shadow chasers people who track down as many eclipses as they can journeying to every corner of the world just to experience more examples of this uncanny and unique phenomenon so lets think about eclipses for a moment even if we havent seen an eclipse personally weve seen the photographs in magazines and the footage on television or youtube were almost blasé about them theyre just part of the stuff that happens to our planet like weather or earthquakes only not destructive not lifethreatening but think about it what an incredible coincidence it is that our moon fits exactly over our sun talk to astronomers and theyll tell you that earths moon is relatively much bigger than any other moon round any other planet most planets like jupiter and saturn and so on have moons that are tiny in comparison to themselves earths moon is enormous and very close to us if it was smaller or further away youd only ever get partial eclipses bigger or closer and it would hide the sun completely and thered be no halo of light round the moon at totality this is an astounding coincidence an incredible piece of luck and for all we know eclipses like this are unique this could be a phenomenon that happens on earth and nowhere else so hold that thought okay now supposing there are aliens not et aliens not that cute or alone not independence day aliens not that crazily aggressive but well regular aliens yeah regular aliens its perfectly possible when you think of it were here after all and earth is just one small planet circling one regularsize sun in one galaxy there are a quarter of a billion suns in this one galaxy and quarter of a billion galaxies in the universe maybe more we already know of hundreds of other planets around other suns and weve only just started looking for them scientists tell us that almost every star might have planets how many of those might harbour life the earth is ancient but the universe is even more ancient who knows how many civilisations were around before earth came into existence or existed while we were growing up or exist right now so if there are civilised aliens youd guess they can travel between stars youd guess their power sources and technology would be as far beyond ours as supersonic jets nuclear submarines and space shuttles are beyond some tribe in the amazon still making dugout canoes and if theyre curious enough to do the science and invent the technology theyll be curious enough to use it to go exploring now most jet travel on earth is for tourism not business tourism would our smart curious aliens really be that different from us i dont think so most of them would be tourists like us theyd go on cruise ships and would they want to actually come to a place like earth set foot or tentacle or whatever here rather than visit via some sort of virtual reality setup well some would settle for secondbest yes maybe the majority of people would but the high rollers the superwealthy the elite theyd want the real thing theyd want the bragging rights theyd want to be able to say theyd really been to whatever exotic destinations would be on a galactic grand tour and who knows what splendours theyd want to fit in their equivalent of the grand canyon or venice italy or the great wall of china or yosemite or the pyramids but what i want to propose to you is that as well as all those other wonders they would definitely want to see that one precious thing that we have and probably nobody else does theyd want to see our eclipse theyd want to look through the earths atmosphere with their own eyes and see the moon fit over the sun watch the light fade down to almost nothing listen to the animals nearby fall silent and feel with their own skins the sudden chill in the air that comes with totality even if they cant survive in our atmosphere even if they need a spacesuit to keep them alive theyd still want to get as close as they possibly could to seeing it in the raw in as close to natural conditions as its possible to arrange theyd want to be here amongst us when the shadow passes so thats where you look for aliens in the course of an eclipse totality track when everybody else is looking awestruck at the sky you need to be looking round for anybody who looks weird or overdressed or who isnt coming out of their rv or their moored yacht with the heavily smoked glass if theyre anywhere theyre there and as distracted and so as vulnerable as anybody else staring up in wonder at this astonishing breathtaking sight the film i want to make is based on that idea its thrilling its funny its sad and profound and finally its uplifting its got a couple of great lead roles one for a dad one for a kid a boy and another exceptional supporting female role plus opportunities for some strong character roles and lesser parts too thats the setup now let me tell you the story and too it begins somewhere else entirely between the plane trees and belvederes of aspherje on this clear midsummer early morning the dawnglittering dome of the mists rises splendidly over the university of practical talents like a vast gold thinking cap below amongst the statues and the rills of the philosophy faculty rooftop park walks the lady bisquitine escorted like that it begins like that too and with a slight stooped unremarkable man walking into a small room in a big building he is holding only a single sheet of paper and a small piece of fruit but he is met with screams he looks unconcerned at the only other man in the room and closes the door behind him the screams continue and it begins here now at this table outside this café on this street in the marais paris with a man dropping a tiny white pill into his espresso from a small but ornate sweetener box he looks around taking in the passing traffic and pedestrians some hurrying some flaneuring and glances at the briskly handsome young algerian waiter who is trying to flirt with a couple of warily smiling american girls before his gaze settles briefly on an elegantly madeup and coiffured parisienne of late middle age holding her tiny dog up to the table to let it lap some croissant flakes then he adds a gnarly lump of brown sugar from the bowl to his cup and stirs the coffee with a studied thoughtfulness as he slips the slim ormolu sweetener box back into a pocket inside his jacket he slides a fiveeuro note under the sugar bowl replaces his wallet in his jacket then drains the espresso cup in a couple of deep appreciative sips he settles back one hand still holding the miniature handle of the cup the other hanging by his side he has now taken on the air of a man waiting for something it is an afternoon at the start of autumn in the year ce the air is clear and warm beneath a milky pastel sky and everything is about to change patient i think i have been very clever in doing what i have done in landing myself where i am however a lot of us are prone as i am now to think weve been quite clever are we not and too often in my past that feeling of having been quite clever has preceded the uncomfortable revelation that i have not been quite clever enough this time though my bed is comfortable the medical and care staff treat me well enough with a professional indifference which is in my particular circumstances more reassuring than excessive devotion would be the food is acceptable i have a lot of time to think lying here thinking is what i do best perhaps thinking is what we do best too as a species i mean it is our forte our speciality our superpower that which has raised us above the common herd well we like to think so how relaxing to lie here and be looked after without having to do anything in return how wonderful to have the luxury of undisturbed thought i am alone in a small square room with whitewashed walls a high ceiling and tall windows the bed is an old steel thing with a manually adjustable backrest and slatted sides that can be raised clanging to prevent the patient falling out of bed the sheets are crisp and white glowing with cleanliness and the pillows while a little lumpy are plump the linoleum floor gleams pale green a batteredlooking wooden bedside table and a cheap chair of blackpainted metal and faded red plastic comprise the rooms remaining furniture there is a fanlight set into the wall above the single door to the corridor outside beyond the floortoceiling windows is a small decorative balcony with iron railings held behind these bars the view is of a strip of grass and then a line of deciduous trees with a shallow river behind them which sparkles in the sunlight when the angles are right the trees are losing their leaves now and more of the river is becoming visible on the far bank i can see more trees my room is on the second the top floor of the clinic i saw a rowing boat glide down the river once with two or three people in it and sometimes i see birds on one occasion a highflying aircraft left a long white cloud across the sky like a ships wake i watched it for some time as it spread slowly and kinked and turned red with the sunset i should be safe here they will not think to look for me here i think other places did occur to me a yurt on some endless rolling steppe with only an extended family and the wind for company some packed and noisome favela spattered across a steep hillside the smell of shared sweat and the noise of bawling children bellowing men and beaty music jangling camping out in some lofty ruin of a monastery in the cyclades garnering a reputation as a hermit and an eccentric underground with the other damaged tunnel dwellers ragged beneath manhattan in plain sight or secreted away there are always many many places to hide where theyll never think to look but then they know me and how i think so perhaps they can guess where id head for even before id know myself then there is the problem of fitting in naturally or assuming a disguise adopting a role ethnicity physiognomy skin colour language skills all must be taken into account we sort ourselves out do we not you lot there this lot here even in the great meltingpot cities we generally order ourselves into little enclaves and districts where we gain a comfort from a shared background or culture our nature our sexuality our genetic desire to wander and experiment our lust for the exotic or the just different can lead to interesting pairings and mixed inheritances but our need to group grade and categorise continually pulls us back into set arrangements this makes hiding difficult i am or at least i certainly look like a pale caucasian male and the places im least likely to hide are such because id stand out there a trucker that would be a good way to hide a longdistance truck driver beating across the us midwest or the plains of canada or argentina or brazil or at the helm of a multitrailer road train barrelling across the australian desert hide through constant movement seldom meeting people or a deckhand or cook on a ship a container vessel plying the high seas with a tiny crew turning around in twentyfour hours at vast automated nearly uninhabited container terminals far distant from the centres of the cities that they serve who would ever find me living so distributed a life but instead i am here i made my choice and i have no choice now i must stick with it i worked out my route set up the means and the funding and the personnel with the required skills to aid me on my way into obscurity and unfindability tested the ways those who might want to find me might set about doing so and worked out methods of frustrating their quest then with everything in place went through with it so thinking here i lie the transitionary others have told me that for them it happens during a blink or just at random between heartbeats or even during a heartbeat there is always some external sign a shiver or tremble often a noticeable twitch occasionally a jerk as though an electric shock has passed through the subjects body one person said that the way it happens for them is that they always think theyve just caught a glimpse of something surprising or threatening from the corner of their eye and as they turn their head quickly round experience a distressing burning sensation like a sort of internal electric shock buzzing through the neck for me it is usually fractionally more embarrassing i sneeze i just sneezed i have only the vaguest idea how long i sat outside that little café in the rd waiting for the drug to take effect sinking into the waking dream that is the necessary precursor to navigating accurately to our desired destination a few seconds five minutes i trust i paid my bill i should not care i am not him and anyway he will still be there but i do care i sit forward look at the table in front of me there is a small pile of change sitting on the little plastic tray with the bill clipped to it francs centimes not euros so so far so good i feel a pressing need to rearrange the items on the table the sugar bowl must be in the exact centre while the drained espresso cup needs to be halfway between the bowl and me aligned the bill tray i am happy to leave to the right of the bowl balancing the condiments carrier it is only as i rearrange these items into this pleasing configuration that i notice that the wrist and hand protruding from my sleeve are both deep brown also i realise that i have just formed a sort of cross on the little table i glance up taking in the design of the cars and trams in the street and the dress of the pedestrians i am where i thought in a judeoislamic reality hopefully in one particular one i immediately rearrange the pieces on the table to form what would be called a peace symbol back where i just came from i sit back relieved not that i look like some christian terrorist im sure but you cant be too careful do i look like a christian terrorist i reach into my chest bag i wear the salwar kameez like most other men and women here effectively pocketless and bring out what would have been my ipod a few secondsfive minutes ago here it is a cigarette case of stainless steel i try to look as though i am contemplating having a cigarette in fact i am studying my reflection on the polished back of the case more relief i do not look like a christian terrorist i look like i usually do when im this colour and broadly like i always do no matter what colour race or type i may be which is to say unobjectionable unremarkable not badlooking not goodlooking either but thats acceptable i look bland but bland is good bland is safe bland blends perfect cover check the watch always check the watch i check the watch the watch is fine no problem with the watch i do not take a cigarette i feel no need obviously i have not incorporated the craving into this new personification i put the cigarette case back in the bag slung over my chest from shoulder to hip checking that the little ormolu pill case is in its own internal pocket zipped still more relief the pill case has never not travelled but you always worry well i always worry i think i always worry my identity card tells me that i am aiman qands which sounds about right aiman hey man hi pleased to meet me language check i have french arabic english hindic portuguese and latin a smattering of german and also latter mongolian no mandarin at all thats unusual i sit back again adjusting my legs in the voluminous salwars so that they are precisely in line with the x of legs supporting the little table it would appear that while i have no tobacco habit i obviously do have once again some sort of mild obsessive compulsive disorder which is arguably just as annoying and distracting if less healththreatening though i should care i hope its mild ocd do i think its mild maybe its not mild after all my hands do feel a little clammy like they might need to be washed maybe its severe theres a lot about this café that could do with being tidied aligned straightened thats something to worry about so im a worrier too obviously thats annoying thats worrying in itself well cant sit here all day im here for a reason ive been summoned by herself no less i feel quite recovered from any passing dizziness associated with the transition no excuse for hesitating i need to get up and go so i do adrian ive told people im an exeast end barrow boy havent i dad ran an eel stall and mum was a barmaid but thats bollocks a total lie i only tell them that because thats what they like to hear what they want to hear thats one of the lessons ive learned isnt it you can go a long way just telling people what they want to hear of course you got to be careful and you got to choose the right people but still know what i mean course any fuckwit can just tell somebody else what they already know they want to hear the creative bit the real addedvalue bit is knowing what they want to hear before they know it themselves they really appreciate that that pays dividends its kind of a service industry thing anyway im really good at the accent highly convincing you should hear me the east end thing i mean doing the barrowboy routine im fucking good at the geezah accent thats all im saying isnt it keep up truth is im from up north one of those grim northern cities with all the grime and all you dont need to know which grim northern city on account of the fact im sure youll agree theyre all the same so it wont make any difference me telling you exactly which one will it so if you do want to know exactly which one tough do what i do use your imagination nah my dad was a miner before they joined the list of endangered species thanks to saint margaret with a little or a lot of help from king arthur depending on your outlook mum worked in a hairdressing salon im serious about la thatch being a saint too though you still have to be careful who you say that to back where i grew up which is one of the many reasons i dont go back there hardly at all isnt it i mean who the fuck wants to work all their life down a fucking hole in the ground anyway nobody in their right mind la thatch did them all a favour they should have statues to her where the pit wheels were anyway by the time i came along that stuff was all ancient history well it was as far as i was concerned it might as well have happened yesterday from the way everybody around me kept banging on about it constantly we lived in a semi so there was a family right next door obviously right well we werent allowed to acknowledge they even existed because the guy whod been one of dads best mates apparently had joined the democratic union of miners of britain or whatever and so he was a blackleg as far as my old dad was concerned and seemingly that was worse than being a paedo or a murderer only time my dad looked like he might hit me was when he caught me talking to the twins next door anyway it wasnt anywhere that i wanted to be i was off down the motorway soon as i could escape from school heading for the big bad city and the bigger and badder the better i sort of hesitated around manchester for a month when it was just getting interesting but i didnt bother staying i went on south m to london always liked the bright lights i have london was the only place for me only place this side of the pond at any rate suppose new york would have been all right but then thanks to people like yours truly london eventually became better and cooler than nyc anyway thing is i sort of understand people wanting to stay where they were brought up if they were raised in a big city anyway i mean why would you want to stay in the country you might want to stay where you grew up for sentimental reasons and your mates being around and so on but unless its a really really great place thats really seriously going to add something to your life youre kind of being a mug know what i mean if you stay in a place like that when you know you could have a go somewhere bigger and brighter with more opportunities youre giving more to it than its giving to you arent you youre in a net loss situation know what i mean i mean if you like feeling like an asset to your local community or something then fucking yahoo for you but dont pretend you arent being exploited people talk a lot about loyalty and being true to your roots and suchlike but thats just bollocks isnt it thats one of the ways they make you do things that arent in your own best interest loyaltys a mugs game so i moved to sunny london was sunny too compared to manchester or where i come from bought my first pair of oakleys day i arrived i say bought anyway london was sunny and warm and balmy even and full of totty and opportunities moved in with a mate from back home got a job behind a bar in soho got a girlfriend or two met some characters started making myself useful to the sort of people who appreciate someone with a bit of sharpness about them and the gift of the gab thinking on your feet like they say landing on your feet thats useful too better still landing on somebody elses feet long and short started providing the highflyers with the means to get them high didnt i full of creative types soho and a lot of people in the creative industries like to powder their nose indulge in a bit of nasal turbocharging dont they very big thing with the creatives certainly back then and amongst said creatives i would most certainly include the financial wizards and their highly exotic instruments and products plus of course they have the funds to really get stuck into it so i worked my way up in a sense and along sort of along in the sense of east where the dosh is east of soho to the city to be precise and canary wharf where a lot of them highest of highflyers perched follow the money they say well i did see i had a plan right from the start a way to make up for my lack of what you might term a formal education and letters after my name numbers after my name that might have been a different story but i managed to avoid that anyway what do people do when theyve had a toot or two talk thats what they do talk like fuck and boast of course if theyre especially impressed with themselves which would cover just about everybody i provided for and of course if you spend all your time working concentrating making money taking risks being financially daring and so on youll talk about that wont you stands to reason fizzing with testosterone and their own genius these guys so of course they talk about what theyve been up to the deals theyve done the money theyve made the angles theyve got coming up the stuff they know so a person who happened to be around them when they were talking about this sort of stuff especially somebody who they knew wasnt one of their own and so not a threat not a competitor but somebody they thought of as a mate as well as an always available deliverer of their chosen leisureenhancing substance well that person could hear a lot of interesting things know what i mean if that person acted a bit thicker and even less educated than they actually were and kept their eyes and ears open and their mind sharp they could hear some potentially very useful things potentially very lucrative things if you know the right people and can get the right bit of information to them at the right time just being useful really like i say im part of the service industry and once you know a few secrets its amazing how you get to know others too people trade in secrets and dont realise theyre giving themselves away especially if they trust you or underestimate you or both so i found myself in a position where i could call in a few favours use what our financial friends would call leverage to pick up some training some recommendations some patronage you might say not to mention some working capital long and short again i went from being a dealer to being a trader swapped the powder for the folding replaced the stuff that goes up the middle of the rolled note for the note itself this was a deeply smart move if i say so myself dont get me wrong drugs are great obviously they are great business to be in in a lot of ways and definitely enduringly popular in good times and bad otherwise why would people spend so much of their disposable and risk prison taking them but its all a bit of a mugs game dealing them when you really think about it certainly for any length of time you have to watch your back constantly and even the profits get eaten into keeping the boys in blue happy i mean serious fucking profits theres still a lot left but still thats exactly what attracts some very heavy and uncivilised people to the business and you cant spend fuck all when youre dead can you get in make some of the filthy and get out while you still got a set of balls and an unslit throat to call your own thats how you fucking do it if youve any sense use it as a legup to get into something just as lucrative but a lot less risky thats the smart way thats what i did amazing what you can accomplish by applying yourself and making yourself useful madame dortolan madame dortolan sat in her orangery discomfited she had been accused of being a racist and by someone she couldnt take any immediate retributive action against too of course she was not a racist she not infrequently had black and jewish people here in her town house though naturally she was always careful to keep an accurate note of where they sat and what they touched and might have used subsequently having everything so contacted thoroughly cleaned and disinfected one could not be too careful but of course she was not a racist to the contrary as she could point out in appropriate company that would be to say highly limited and avowedly discreet company had she not tasted of what she thought of as the dark pleasures with blacks on more than one occasion the epitome of such enjoyment was for her to be taken anally by such a nubian brute privately she thought of this act as going to sèvresbabylone as this was the deepest darkest and most excitingly enticingly dangerous métro station that she knew of racist the cheek of it she had taken the call here in the orangery the conversation had gone like this oui madame im glad i managed to catch you ah mrs m i trust we can return the compliment mrs mulverhill had chosen to open by speaking english always a sure sign that she wished to talk business and this was not a social call it had been some long time since either had called the other for purely social reasons may i ask where you are i suppose you might though not to any instructive consequence madame dortolan felt herself bristling a simple no would have sufficed yes but would have been inaccurate are you well i am as if you care one way or the other and you tolerably and i do care one way let me tell you why im calling do its been so long i cant wait rumour has it you intend to divide the council beyond my powers dear and anyway i think youll find it already is if it is divided oh it is if it is then it is largely due to you as i say you both flatter and overestimate that is not what the people ive talked to say people on the council who mrs mulverhill remained silent there was a pause while madame dortolan who had taken the call on the house phone on an extension with a long lead twirled the extension cord round her longest finger after a few moments a sigh sounded down the phone line and mrs mulverhill said so what is the thinking on this matter the thinking madame dortolan asked innocently what do you intend to do mrs mulverhill said voice suddenly sharp i think that matters need to be resolved there was a silence then i hope that is not settled it would be the incorrect decision is that what you think it is what a pity we did not have the benefit of your opinion earlier before the decision was made theodora mrs mulverhill said crisply dont pretend that youd have taken any notice of anything id have said and yet you have chosen to call me now my darling and i presume you are only doing so in an attempt to influence that very decision after it has been made are you not a shorter silence then i would appeal to your sense of pragmatism not morality decency justice mrs mulverhill laughed delicately you are a card theodora yes i like to think of myself as the queen of spades i have heard something to that effect and what do you think you might be the joker perhaps i could not care less id imagine something like the two of clubs yes theodora enough of this i am asking you to reconsider very well the three a silence madame dortolan would have termed tight reigned for a moment it sounded subsequently as though mrs mulverhill might be speaking through clenched teeth i am attempting to be serious theodora they do say the struggle against adversity is highly characterforming theodora mrs mulverhill first raised her voice then dropped it theodora i am asking you please do not do this do what whatever decisive divisive step it is you intend to take it would be a mistake oh for goodness sake madame dortolan was losing patience she sat forward in her cane chair flicking free the twisted phone cord from her left hand alors my sweet my pretty what do you really care about the fate of people youve already turned your back on people you oppose by opposing the council what are they to you a couple of mealymouthed grinning halfcastes and a lesbian negress a thought struck her and she beamed unless she excites you of course our crepuscular friend so well camouflaged in the dark one would hardly know she was in ones bed of a night would one well until she smiled at any rate dont tell me youre a secret admirer has one put ones finger on something another telling silence then you old racist bitch and then she put the phone down just like that the nerve of the woman madame dortolan was unsure who had come out best from the exchange for most if not all the way through she had felt that she was having the best of it but then the mulverhill woman had been the one to hang up on her which counted for something most vexing and to be called a racist not for the first time she wondered what mrs mulverhill herself might have to hide in that regard she habitually wore a veil madame dortolan had always assumed this was mere affectation but perhaps the lady wished to conceal some angle from which she looked less than racially pure when the race concerned was human who knew but still to call her a racist when it was meant as an insult and worse old and now she had to meet that objectionable and seemingly unkillable little man oh or whatever he was called for now at least they were meeting elsewhere and she didnt have to suffer his presence in the house he never looked clean and meet him not a moment too soon if the mulverhill woman had heard rumours already madame dortolan smiled to herself divide the council was that the best or the worst that shed heard ill show you divide she muttered to no one present she shooed the white cat called m pamplemousse from her lap and rose smoothing her cream skirt madame dortolan favoured her various cats according to the colour of the clothes she was wearing at any particular time had she been wearing dark grey or black the blackhaired cat called mme frenolle would have been the one allowed to warm itself on her lap though perhaps not for much longer recently mme frenolle who was eight years old now had started to produce white hairs amongst the black which was most annoying depending on how well she behaved over the next week or two mme frenolle would either have to suffer regular visits to the maison chat to have her white hairs plucked or dyed or be put down madame dortolan was she liked to think of elegant middle age though to the casual observer this might imply that she expected to live to be about one hundred and twenty of course being who and what she was this was would have been a perfectly reasonable expectation on her part had the truth not been much more complicated she used the house intercom mr kleist if you would the gentleman himself arrived a minute or so later a pale slightly hunched somehow dowdy figure despite being to all appearances quite smartly dressed in a conservatively cut grey threepiece suit he looked to be about the same age as his employer though the same dispassionate observer called upon to judge the ladys looks might have taken a second glance at him and decided he was really a decade or more her junior just wornlooking he came to her side blinking in the orangerys hazy sunlight madame mrs mulverhill she told him is rapidly approaching the stage where she will know what i intend to do shortly before i do myself mr kleist sighed we continue to search for her maam and to look for her informants im sure we do however we must start to act she looked up at him mr kleist could contrive to look only halfglimpsed in the brightest sunlight he carried his own shadows about with him she was sure i am seeing mr oh today she told him for what i have now decided ought to be the last time i think we set him on his way as fully wound as possible you catch my drift yes i do maam and we take all further steps to make sure his work is carried on after whatever point he is no longer able to do it ill have the draft orders finalised i shall leave in ten minutes thatll be sufficient maam thank you mr kleist she smiled at him that will be all for some moments after mr kleist had turned and gone madame dortolan sat where she was staring at nothing and tapping her long pink nails against each other with a hollow clacking sound the cat m pamplemousse jumped back onto her lap startling her she threw him off immediately hissing she called for her car left the orangery freshened up in her downstairs boudoir collected the orders for the objectionable mr oh from the efficient mr kleist as she walked down the hallway and then allowed the second most attractive of her egyptian footmen to place her jacket over her shoulders before she walked out to the car and instructed christophe to take her to the café atlantique the car swivelled on the ribbon of gravel looped in front of the tall town house and exited to the boulevard haussmann as the ornate black gates swung silently closed patient it is amazing what you can tell even with your eyes quite tightly closed i can tell for example what season it is what sort of day it is which nurses and orderlies are on duty which other patients have visited my room which day of the week it is and whether someone has died none of this is difficult and certainly none of it is in any way supernatural it simply requires that one keeps ones ears open and ones senses attuned to everyday reality a good memory for previous experiences helps too as does a decent imagination the imagination is necessary not to make things up that would be wrong but to come up with plausible scenarios for what ones senses are detecting theories that might explain what is going on sometimes i spend entire days with my eyes closed i pretend to sleep i do sleep longer than i would otherwise and i allow my other senses to paint the scene around me i can hear wind and rain against the window and birdsong outside i can tell from the faint draught and the definition and detail of the sounds outside that the window is ajar even if i missed the creaking scraping noise of it being opened and from the scents that reach me from it and the feel of the air i know immediately whether its a summers day or an unusually warm interlude in either spring or autumn i can smell the identifying body odours and perfumes of the nurses and doctors who attend me and so can tell who is there even without hearing their voices though i know those too of course occasionally other patients wander in and i know they are there from their institutional medicinal smell i dont mix with them sufficiently to have built up a reliable database of them all as individuals though one or two do stand out through body odour or what they do one man smells of a particular cologne one old lady carries with her the scent of violets another always runs her fingers through my hair i can peek through notquiteclosed eyelids and so see who is responsible when something like this happens one small gaunt man whistles aimlessly more or less all the time and another chubbier fellow never visits without tapping absently on the metal frame at the foot of the bed with his fingernails the rhythms of the hospital day week month and year are also obvious without recourse to sight and the place of course feels and sounds quite different at night most noticeably far quieter during the day meals are regular drug rounds too there are two drug trollies one has a squeaky wheel doctors perform their various rounds according to a certain timetable and the cleaners have an entirely predictable set of rotas that cover every temporal scale from daily dusting and wiping to the annual spring clean so very little escapes me as i lie here even with the most informational of my senses deliberately denied i can see perfectly well though this is really just a game something to help occupy my time while i wait out my selfimposed exile and bide my time before returning to the fray i will most assuredly be back the transitionary once i watched her hand move above a lit candle through the yellow flame fingers spread fluttering amidst the incandescing gas her unharmed flesh ruffling the very burning of it the flame bent this way and that guttered sent curls of sooty smoke towards the dim ceiling of the room where we sat as she moved her hand slowly back and forth through the gauzy teardrop of fire she said no i see consciousness as a matter of focus its like a magnifying glass concentrating light rays on a point on a surface until it bursts into flame the flame being consciousness it is the focusing of reality that creates that selfawareness she looked up at me do you see i nodded though i was not sure that i did see we had taken certain drugs and they were still affecting us i knew enough to realise that one could talk utter nonsense in such circumstances and that it could seem unutterably profound at the time i knew it but at the same time felt that this was quite different there is no intelligence without context she continued watching her hand go through the flame and back just as a magnifying glass effectively casts a partial shadow around the point of its focus the debt required to produce the concentration elsewhere so meaning is sucked out of our surroundings concentrated in ourselves in our minds one summer when i was a teenager some friends and i were walking into town saving our bus fares to have more money to spend on sweets burgers and slot machines our route took us down a quiet suburban street of houses with small front gardens we came to one garden mostly paved with a few mismatched pots holding dry bedraggledlooking plants where a fat greyhaired man was lying asleep in a deckchair we all stopped to look sweating a couple of the guys had taken their tshirts off and were barechested like the old man he had lots of curly grey hair on his chest somebody whispered that he looked like a beached whale the garden was tiny hed had to angle the deckchair across it to fit in he was so close that you could smell the coconut oil on his skin so close that we could almost touch him we stood there watching him sleep and somebody else said they wished we had a water pistol the sun was behind us light beating on our backs i was the tallest and the shadow of my head was putting the mans feet into shade i remembered i had a magnifying glass with me id been using it to burn holes in the leaves of my stepmothers prize flowers watch this i said and took the magnifying glass out i held it so that it focused the sunlight on the skin of his chest then moved it along and up through the forest of glinting grey hairs to concentrate the light on his little puckered left nipple some of the guys were starting to laugh already i began to laugh too which made the small bright point of light waver but i held it steady enough and long enough for him to shift a little and for a frown to appear on his face i still think i saw a faint wisp of smoke then his eyes flicked open and he bellowed sitting up suddenly his eyes wide one hand flying up to his singed nipple the other guys were already running howling with laughter down the street i sprinted after them we heard him shouting after us we avoided that street for a few weeks i dont mention this story to her either at the time or ever id have said i said instead that we give even even that we radiate emanate meaning we ascribe context to external things without us they exist i suppose do they she murmured but we give them names and we see the systems and processes that link them we contextualise them within their setting we make them more real by knowing what they mean and represent hnn she said shrugging fractionally distracted by the sight of her hand moving through the flame maybe it sounded like she was losing interest but everything requires a leavening everything she let her head fall slowly to one side watching her hand moving through the flame with a perfectly absorbed intensity that left me free to look at her she sat bundled in a crumpled white sheet her hair a brownred spill of curls across her shoulders and along her slender neck formed a quiet nimbus around her tipped head her deep brown eyes looked almost black reflecting the flickering candlelight like some image of the consciousness that she had been speculating about they looked perfectly still and steady i could see the minuscule spark of the flame reflected in them see it occluded by her hand passing over it she blinked slowly almost languorously i recalled that the eyes only see by moving we can fasten our gaze on something and stare intently at it only because our eyes are consumed with dozens of tiny involuntary movements each second hold something perfectly and genuinely still in our field of vision and that very fixity makes it disappear i love you i heard myself whisper she glanced up what her hand stopped poised over the flame she jerked it away ow madame dortolan in the main salon of the café atlantique vast and echoing with a ceiling lost in a layer of ancientlooking smoke stirred by giant wobbling ceiling fans there is a jupla band playing to the mostly indifferent crowd packing the spaces between the tables which are variously set for eating drinking and gaming stainedglass circular windows set high in the two gable walls struggle along with globular yellow lamps the size of bathyspheres to illuminate the chaotic scenes below where small sweating men wearing sandwich boards run up and down the aisles the pretty little eurasian singer wears a vibrato collar and the snare drums are doubled one set conventionally while the other is poised upside down directly above separated by about half a metre as madame dortolan enters her way cleared as best he can by christophe the chauffeur the singer on the low stage midway along one long wall hits an especially high and plangent note and uses the cable remote in her pocket to turn her collar to high speed batteries in the remote power up a tiny motor attached to unbalanced weights within the device itself making the collar burr against the girls throat just over her voice box so that she produces a sort of staccato ululation impossible to achieve without such mechanical artifice the drummer has both sticks blurring in between the lower and upper snares creating a crazed percussive accompaniment to match your table maam christophe says quickly dusting and polishing a seat with its back against the wall of a semicircular booth set almost directly opposite the band he called ahead from the car to book this small neatly placed table and the previous occupants are still arguing with elements of the management even as their halffinished drinks are being tidied away by whitejacketed waiters madame dortolan eyes the seat sceptically then sighs smooths her skirt and sits prim and upright while christophe pushes the chair in she can see the one who is probably the oh person making his way through the crowds towards her he is dressed like a peasant and has either a peasants skin tone or just that neitheronethingnortheother colour that madame dortolan finds irritating he arrives stands in front of her glancing at the towering presence of christophe he smiles at her rubbing his hands he bows sinuously madame yes aiman qands at your service sit she tells him she has already forgotten the name he has just spoken to her he is still oh there is shouting beyond the mouth of the alcove where the tables earlier occupants have noticed that their drinks have been tidied away a waiter flaps a pristine white tablecloth across the table lets it settle and turns to take her order as the greasylooking little man sits christophe standing greyly behind her divides his time between looking suspiciously at the man who has just arrived and looking suspiciously at the arguing punters now in the first stages of being shooed away by the management and a couple of bouncers who have just drifted up and who are even larger than christophe aiman qands bows from a seated position always a pleasure to see you i do not require your pleasantries madame dortolan tells him and you should not expect mine this one she recalls surveying his smiling shining annoyingly anonymous coffeecoloured face has always responded well to being kept thoroughly in his place she turns briefly to christophe and glances at her shoulder he lifts the cream jacket from her shoulders and places it carefully over the back of her seat she suspects that he lets his fingers linger just a fraction longer than fully necessary as they touch her flesh through her silk blouse and that he surreptitiously sniffs at her hair as he bends to her this is agreeable but distracting still water she informs the waiter bring it sealed no ice double espresso aiman qands says he flaps the collar of his kameez and water lots of ice he drums his fingers on the table it is hot in paris and hotter still in the café atlantique the leisurely spinning ceiling fans are largely decorative the small sweating men wearing the sandwich boards which advertise todays specials and the services of various bookmakers lawyers pawnbrokers bailbond companies and brothels as well as conveying the latest headlines and sports results are there principally to create cooling draughts as they pelt up and down the aisles they are surprisingly effective aiman qands squirms in his seat looking up and all around his hands knead each other he seems incapable of sitting still and is making madame dortolan feel even warmer fan christophe she says over her shoulder with a snap a large lacy black fan is deployed and starts to move air gently past her face aiman qands sits forward eyes glistening madame may i say no you may not madame dortolan tells him she glances about her with a look of some distaste we shall keep this to the minimum qands looks hurt he sits back looking down madame do you find me so repellent as though she spared the wretch a thought at all dont be absurd she tells him i simply have no great desire to be here she says a glance taking in the smokily cavernous space aside from all else these crowds are perversely highly attractive to bombers christians qands says looking mildly surprised and also looking round of course christians you idiot qands shakes his head ruefully and tuts the religion of brotherly love so sad just for a moment madame dortolan thinks he might be trying to make fun of her you can never be sure in how much detail these passerines remember previous encounters with things events or people could he be baiting her she quickly dismisses the thought the religion of zealotry she informs him testily the religion that loves its martyrs the religion of the doctrine of original sin so that blowing even babies to smithereens is justifiable because they too are sinners she jerks her head and makes a sort of dry spitting sound a religion made for terrorism she can see what might be a small smile on qandss unpleasantly glowing face and can feel perspiration starting to gather on her brow she leans forward and lowers her voice are you properly ambiented have you fully embedded here yet she asks any idiot ought to know this do you i know what i know maam he says quietly for all the world as though trying to be mysterious meanwhile one leg is bouncing up and down as though he is trying to follow the beat of the jupla band the fellow is preposterous well know that i wish to waste no further time here she glances up at christophe then has annoyingly to clear her throat loudly because he seems distracted by the eurasian waif warbling on stage her chauffeur collects himself follows her gaze as it flicks to the man seated opposite and sticking his free hand into his grey tunic produces what looks like a cigar tube and hands it to qands he looks at it sadly and then places it in his chest satchel also qands says i am almost out of there are supplies for a dozen journeys in there madame dortolan tells him were not stupid we can count he shrugs my apologies for so obviously inconveniencing you he sounds hurt he stands up and runs a hand through his wiry brown hair as he turns to look out into the body of the salon a sandwichboard man races past clacking the resultant breeze makes qandss salwar kameez flutter see if i can intercept my coffee sit down she snaps he turns back but you said sit he sits looking still more wounded there are certain instructions specific to this matter which have not been written down she says qands looks appropriately surprised she is already finding the way his expression seems to reflect his internal state so immediately and accurately extremely vexing worryingly unprofessional too if hes like this with everybody has he finally gone off the rails how vexing if her long campaign to destabilise the fellow has finally succeeded just when she needs him at his most implacably efficient indeed he says he looks mystified madame dortolan half expects a cartoon thoughtbubble bearing a big question mark to appear above his head indeed she tells him the written orders mention some names and actions that you may find surprising nevertheless these instructions have been subject to particularly careful scrutiny at the highest level by not one or two but several sufficiently securitycleared individuals and you may be assured that there is no mistake regarding the final action you are instructed to pursue in each case ignore that course of action as written in your orders each of the subjects concerned is not to be forcibly transitioned they are all to be elided killed expeditiously do you understand qandss eyes widen i am to ignore my written orders in that one detail yes detail the fellow looks aghast though probably more at the choice of word than the terminal severity of the action proposed in writing madame dortolan explains patiently you are instructed to find the individuals named close with them and take them away the spoken amendment i am giving you now is to do all the above except you are to kill them rather than kidnap them so thats an order yes that is an order but the written orders issue from my office madame dortolan tells him her voice acidic this verbal order is also from me has also been appropriately vetted and approved and postdates the written orders what about this sequence of events is difficult for you to comprehend there is a hurt silence while the waiter delivers their order when he goes qands says well i take it the verbal orders will be confirmed by written certainly not dont be an idiot there are reasons why this is being handled in this manner madame dortolan sits forward lowers her voice and softens it a little the council she tells him head tipped towards him drawing him in even the concern itself is under threat dont you see this must be done these actions must be carried out they may seem extreme but then so is the threat he looks unconvinced she sits back just obey your orders qands all of them she watches as christophe unseals her bottle of water wipes her glass with a fresh handkerchief and pours she drinks a little qands looks most unhappy but drinks his espresso finishing it with indecent haste in a couple of tossedback gulps she has a sudden unbidden unwelcome and unpleasant vision of his lovemaking being similarly abrupt and curtailed now where once of course he had been quite pleasantly proficient she pushes the memory away as something best forgotten and nods beyond the booth now you may go he rises gives a cursory bow and turns away madame dortolan says a moment he sighs as he looks back at her yes what did you say your name was qands maam well qands do you understand his jaw works as though he is trying to control himself of course he says voice clipped i understand she favours him with an icy smile as you might guess this is altogether of particular importance to us qands it is what one might term a hightariff matter the highest the rewards for success will be as lavish as the sanctions for failure will oh madame he says loudly holding out one hand to her his voice pitched somewhere between exasperation and what certainly sounds like genuine insult spare me he turns and leaves with a shake of his head disappearing into the tumult madame dortolan is quite shocked the philosopher my father was a brute my mother was a saint dad was a big powerful man he was what they used to call free with his fists in school he was kept back a year and hence was always the biggest boy in his class big enough to intimidate the teachers sometimes eventually he was thrown out for breaking another pupils jaw according to him it was a boy a bully from a couple of years above him it was twenty years later and he was dead before we found out it had actually been a girl in his own class he always wanted to be a policeman but he kept failing the entry exams he worked in the prison service until he was thrown out for being too violent feel free to make your own jokes my mother had a very strict religious upbringing her parents were members of a small sect called the first church of christ the redeemer our lords chosen people once i suggested that they had more words in their title than they did members it was the only time she hit me she was proud that she didnt sleep with my father until after they were married on the day she turned eighteen i think she just wanted to be free of her parents and all their restrictions and rules they always had a lot of rules before they could be wed dad had to promise the elders of the church and our local minister that he would have all his children raised strictly in the ways of the church though he only did this so that he could wash his hands of his parental responsibilities he had as little to do with me as he could while i was growing up hed usually be reading his paper lips moving silently or listening to music on his headphones humming loudly and out of tune if i tried to attract his attention hed put his paper down scowling and tell me to talk to my mother or just glare at me without turning his music down and stab a finger first at me and then at the door he liked country and western music the more sentimental the better he made no secret of the fact that he had no faith himself except that there must be something up there as he would say sometimes when he was very drunk he said it quite a lot my mum must have seen something in him perhaps as i said she also thought that she was escaping from the petty rules and regulations and restrictions shed had to accept living in her parents house but of course dad had plenty of those of his own as we both discovered my usual way of discovering a new rule was being slapped around the ear or if id been really bad dad taking his belt off throwing me across his knee and leathering me out of the frying pan and into the fire thats what it was for my mum i started out in the fire mum made me her treasured boy and gave me all the love that she wanted to give dad but which just bounced back off him dont think that she turned me into a gay or anything im not im quite normal i just had this unbalanced upbringing in this strange family where one parent worshipped me and thought i could do no wrong and the other one treated me like some pet that my mum had bought without asking him first if id thought about it id have assumed my family was typical it wasnt something i did think about though and id never have thought of asking other children what their families were like i didnt mix much with other children at school they seemed very noisy and dangerously boisterous and they thought i was quiet apparently or cold i was teased and picked on for being christian i suppose people would say it was a troubled upbringing but it didnt feel like that to me not at the time and not really since not properly just one of those things i worked hard in class and went for long walks in the country after school and at the weekends i always did my homework to the highest standard i spent a lot of time in the school library and the library in the nearest town not always reading on the bus to and from the town i used to sit looking at nothing wed probably have rubbed along not too bad together just the three of us but then my sister came along i dont blame her not really not any more but it was hard not to at the time i didnt know any better it wasnt her fault even though she caused it we lived in the country in a line of prisonofficer homes within sight of the prison id grown up listening to mum and dad arguing over the years because the walls were thin in the house though you couldnt hear mum just dad she always kept her voice right down whispering even while he either shouted or just talked in his loud voice i dont think he ever whispered in his whole life when you listened to them it was like he was arguing with himself or with somebody who wasnt there i used to wrap my pillow round my head covering both ears or if it got really loud id stick my fingers in my ears and hum to myself to shut out the sound one time i must have been humming really loudly because the light went on and i opened my eyes and dad was there over me wearing just his underpants standing at the side of the bed and demanding what i thought i was doing making all this noise he scowled at me as i lay there blinking in the bright overhead light wiping my eyes and cheeks i was sure he was going to hit me but he just made a grumbling sort of noise and left slamming the door he left the light on so i had to put it out myself i had already over the course of the preceding few years heard things i would not have chosen to hear things about sex and so on but the night mum came back from the hospital a week or thereabouts after giving birth to my sister was the thing that really made the difference for me mum had had a bad time giving birth to me and she wasnt really meant to have any more children but then she got pregnant and that was that dad would just have soon have got rid of what turned into my sister but mum wasnt having that because of her religion so she went through with it but it was an unpleasant procedure and she needed a lot of stitches down there i suppose dad must have been drunk especially drunk as he always liked a drink i tried humming but i knew they were talking about sex that evening when she came back from the hospital and because of the age i was a part of me was getting interested in sexual matters and so i partly wanted to listen so i did thus i got to hear my mother begging my father to let her take him in her mouth or even sodomise her rather than have normal sex due to the stitches and the fact that she was still very sore i had heard dad in the past demanding these favours or thought i had but from the little i knew neither had actually occurred that night though he wasnt to be fobbed off with such distractions especially not after months of being denied so not to put too fine a point on it he had his way with her and i had to listen to the gasps and gulps and then the screams a lot of screams even though despite it all you could somehow tell that she was trying to be quiet about it i shoved my fingers into my ears so hard that i thought i was going to puncture my eardrums and i hummed as hard as i could but i could still hear her it took much longer than you might imagine perhaps it was the drink or the screams but eventually the screams stopped to be replaced by sobs and shortly snores i had of course imagined myself bursting in on them and hauling him off her and beating him up and so on but i was only eleven and slight like her not big and burly like him therefore there was nothing i could have done meanwhile my sister had been set off by all the screaming and she was crying the way that very small babies do and had probably been crying like that all the time but i hadnt heard her over the screams from my mother and my own humming i heard mum getting up from her and dads bed and going over to the cot and trying to comfort her though you could hear her own voice breaking and her sobbing as she did this dad snored very loudly and mum was sobbing and breaking down and my sister was screaming in a high unpleasant whine it was only at this point that our nextdoor neighbours started hammering on the wall shouting their voices like a sort of tired distant commentary on events i am not ashamed to say that i cried quite a lot throughout the rest of that night though i still dropped off to sleep eventually and got up for school the next day because it is amazing what you can put up with and get over almost anything in fact nevertheless i think it was then that i decided i would never get married or have children patient there is a certain purity to my existence a simplicity in a sense nothing much happens i lie here gazing into space or at the view presented by the window blinking swallowing turning over now and again getting up occasionally always while they make the bed each morning and staring openmouthed at the nurses and orderlies now and again theyll try to engage me in conversation i make a point of smiling at them when they do this it helps that we do not speak the same language i can understand most of the one that they speak sufficient to have an idea what my perceived medical status is and what treatments the doctors might have in store for me but i have to make an effort to do so and i would not be able to speak much sense in it at all sometimes i nod or laugh or make a sound that is halfway between a sort of throatclearing noise and the moans that deaf people make sometimes and often i frown as though im trying to understand what theyre saying or as though i feel frustrated at not being able to make myself intelligible to them doctors come and give me tests sometimes there were quite a lot of doctors and quite a lot of tests early on there are fewer now they give me books to look at with photographs or drawings in them of everyday objects or large letters one to a page one doctor brought me a tray holding letters on wooden cubes from some childs game i smiled at them and her and mixed them up sliding them around on the tray making pretty patterns out of them and building little towers with them trying to make it look as though i was attempting to understand these letters and do whatever it was she wanted me to do whatever might make her happy she was a pleasantlooking young woman with short brown hair and large brown eyes and she had a habit of tapping the end of a pencil on her teeth she was very patient with me and not brusque the way doctors can be sometimes i liked her a lot and would have liked to have done something to have made her happy but i could would not instead i made that motion babies and toddlers make sometimes clapping with fingers fanned knocking down the little towers of letters id made she smiled regretfully tapped the pencil on her teeth sighed and then made some notes on her clipboard i was relieved i thought i might have overdone the kiddyclappy thing i am allowed to go to the bathroom by myself though i pretend to fall asleep in there sometimes i always make mumbly apologetic noises and come out when they knock on the door and call my name they call me kel not knowing my real name there was a reason something between a conceit and a joke why i was christened so but the doctor who named me thus left earlier this year and the thinking behind this name is not mentioned in my notes and nobody can remember the reason i am not allowed to bathe alone but being bathed is not so terrible once you get over any residual shame it is very relaxing one even feels luxurious i take care to masturbate in the toilet on the morning of a bath day so as not to embarrass myself in front of the nurses or orderlies one of the nurses is a big kindly woman with drawnon eyebrows another is quite small and pretty with bleached blonde hair and there are two orderlies or care workers one a bearded man with a ponytail and the other a fraillooking but surprisingly strong lady who looks older than me i suppose if one of them well just the pretty blonde if i am being frank with myself ever showed any sign of sexual interest in me i might reconsider my preemptive prebath selfpleasuring so far this looks unlikely and i am bathed with a sort of professional detachment by all of them there is a day room at the end of the corridor where other patients gather and watch television i go there rarely and affect not really to understand the programmes even when i do most of the other patients just sit there slackjawed and i emulate them now and again one of them will try to engage me in conversation but i just stare at them and smile and mumble and they usually go away one large fat bald chap with bad skin doesnt go away and regularly sits beside me watching the television while talking to me in a low hypnotic voice probably telling me about his ungrateful and dismissive family and his sexual exploits as a younger and more attractive man but for all i know regaling me with lurid local folk tales or his detailed design for a perpetualmotion machine or professing his undying love for me and setting out the various things he would like to do to me in private or perhaps his undying hatred for me and setting out the various things he would like to do to me in private i dont know i can hardly understand a word he says i think he talks in the same language as the doctors and nurses most of whom i can understand well enough but in a different dialect anyway i rarely bother with the television room or the other patients i lie here or sit here and i think about all that ive done and all that i intend to do once the immediate danger has passed and it is safe for me to reemerge i smile and even chuckle to myself sometimes thinking of these poor fools mouldering away until they die here while im back out in the many worlds living and loving an operator getting up to whatever mischief takes my fancy how shocked they would be patients and staff both if they only knew adrian funny thing is i always loved cocaine i mean obviously i loved it in the sense that i loved how rich it made me how it helped me to drag myself up from the pretty much nothing i started with but what i mean is i loved it when i took it its a proper brilliant drug coke i loved everything about it i loved the way it all seemed of a piece the cleanness of it for a start i mean look at it this beautiful snowwhite powder little yellow sometimes but only the way really brightly lit clouds are yellow though they start out looking white from the sun bit of a joke it looks like cleaning powder but even that seems right somehow it feels like its cleaning out your skull know what i mean even how you take it goes along with all this doesnt it clean sharp definite things like razor blades and mirrors and tightly rolled banknotes preferably new as big denomination as you like i love the smell of new notes with or without powderage and it energises you gives you what feels like ambition and ability in one easily snorted package suddenly nothings impossible you can talk and think your way round any problem batter down anybodys resistance see the clear clever way to make any challenge work for you its a doing drug an enabling drug back where i came from they were all into dope or h or speed which is the poor mans coke and they were starting to get into e speeds like laminate instead of real wood or faux fur not pukka or a hand job instead of proper sex itll do if you cant afford the real thing ecstasys pretty good but its not immediate you have to commit to it not as much as kosher oldfashioned acid though cos ive heard people old enough to be my dad talk of these trips that lasted eighteen hours or more and just turned your whole world inside out not always in a good way and you needed to organise everything too like where you were going to spend the time you were tripping and even who with support staff practically like carers how the fuck did hippies ever get that fucking organised eh anyway compared to that timeconsuming nonsense e isnt that bad like drinking spritzers instead of whisky sodas or something but you still need to organise everything to come up at the right time and it really is mostly about dancing being lovedup in amongst lots of fellow travellers and boppers fine for that long drawnout moment of collective euphoria but its more like part of a sort of rite a ritual what was that song that went this is my church something like that like a service bit too collective too chummy for my taste cannabis was sort of similar in some ways in that it made you mellow didnt it though how that squares with the fucking hashisheen ive never quite understood but its all that lying around like old hippies wreathed in smoke and talking bollocks that i could never take all that claggy brown tar gumming up the cigarette papers and your brains and making you choke and splutter and wrecking you to the point where it seemed like a great idea to drink the old bong water for the final hit thatll really take you over the edge into some other realm of understanding what a load of bollocks i can see it was a great sixties drug when everybody wanted to smash the system by having loveins and painting flowers on their bum but its all too hazy and vague and sort of aimless know what i mean h is proper hardcore got to respect that its a serious lifestyle commitment for most people and its like discovering the motherlode of pure pleasure that all the other drugs including the legal ones like drink have all come from like finding something utterly pure beyond which there cant possibly be anything better but its a selfish drug it takes you over it becomes the boss everything else becomes about the next hit and it takes you away from the real world seems to say that the one where the h is is the real world and the one youve lived in all this time and where everybody else still lives the poor fools and where the money is sadly annoyingly is just a sort of game a kind of grey grainy shadowplace where you have to go back to far too often to make these sort of robotic responses thatll let you get back to the titsout technicolor of the wonderful and enchanting world of the h proper commitment h is and the way its served up is potentially lethal too bit like joining the army or something plus all that melting the muckylooking stuff in ancientlooking spoons and searching for a vein and pulling ligatures tight with your teeth and having to draw your own blood out to mix it up in the syringe messy you dont need that not clean like coke exact opposite and you need a bucket by you cos the first thing that happens when it hits is you chuck your guts up call me oldfashioned but i thought drugs were supposed to be about fun what sort of fucking fun is that like i say respect to people prepared to suffer that sort of degradation for the sake of the river of warm bliss you end up submerged in but fuck me its not a drug you take to make your life better which is what im looking for its a drug that empties you out of one life and pours you wholesale into another one completely where its all very fucking wonderful but the drug is the only way into it and the only way of staying there its like becoming a deepsea diver in one of those old brasshelmet jobs with the porthole grilles and the air hose leading back to the surface the h is the air hose the h is the air total dependency no give me coke every time not crack though not cos its instantly addictive thats another load of bollocks its just overrated thats all and because you smoke it its got that messiness factor again know what i mean something a bit sordid about crack frankly its like coke for junkies proper pukka coke is clean sharp accelerating and like a smart drug a precision munition you take exactly when you want it and need it and delivering for as long as you keep taking it of fucking course its the drug of choice of your masters of the universe your financial wizards your highfinanciers its like justintime exhilaration isnt it a toot in both barrels and suddenly youre a fucking genius and totally invincible just what you need when youre juggling telephone numbers of money about and making bets with everybody elses dosh not without its downsides obviously though for most people these days loss of appetite is brilliant i mean who wants to be fat collateral benefit kind of but the runny nose and paranoia and risking losing your septum and so they say having a heart attack thats all a bit toss still no gain without pain and all that so its funny that i hardly ever took the stuff myself given that i loved it and still do and i had access to the purest supplies at the best prices still do too through my contacts of course just being cautious basically also proving to myself whos the boss know what i mean its called keeping things in proportion keeping things balanced i treat drink the same i could guzzle vintage champagne and ancient cognac every day but thatd be giving in to that particular monkey so that has to be rationed too same with the girlies i do love the ladies but i wouldnt want to be totally beholden to one of them would i true love and wanting kids and settling down and all that its fine for most people and it makes the world go round and all like my old man said but apart from the fact no it doesnt its gravity that does that well all right maybe it does make the world go round in the sense of creating the next generation but it works just fine and dandy thanks as long as most people do it not all doesnt need to be compulsory doesnt require every single person to take part just most just enough what was that song love is the drug never a truer word know what i mean just another temptation another way of losing yourself making yourself vulnerable thats what its doing giving in to all that romantic guff just putting your head on the chopping block isnt it dont get me wrong im not stupid and i know it can happen to anybody and maybe one day itll happen to me and ill be giving it all that it just feels right and shes the one and this time its different and if it does then i just hope i dont make a complete cunt of myself excuse my language but you know what i mean even the mighty fall they say nobodys invulnerable but you can at least show yourself the respect of holding out as long as possible know what i mean the transitionary temudjin oh mr marquand ys snr marquan dise dr marquand emesere m marquan demesere mark cavan aiman qands i have been called many things and i have had many names and though they sometimes sound very various they tend to gyrate round a certain set of sounds clustering about a limited repertoire of phonemes my name changes each time i flit never predictably i dont always know who i am myself not until i check i tap a tiny white pill into my espresso rearrange the table condiments a little drink my coffee in two gulps and sit back waiting another part of my mind isnt waiting at all its concentrating furiously darting down a single filament of purpose within an infinitude of possibilities a lightning strike zigzagging its way through a cloud searching im outside another pavement café in the th looking out across a branch of the seine to the ile st louis just entering the trance that will guide me to exactly the right place and person meanwhile space to think to review and evaluate my meeting with madame dortolan was most unsatisfactory she was sitting asquint in the booth and the tablecloth was offcentre hanging down twice as far on one side as on the other the only way i felt able to compensate was by jiggling one leg up and down which was really no help at all and then she treats me like an idiot selfsatisfied salope plyte jésusdottir krijk heurtzloftbeiderkern obliq mulverhill i find myself muttering for these things must be fixed in the mind a waiter scooping change from the next table turns and looks at me oddly plyte jésusdottir krijk heurtzloftbeiderkern obliq mulverhill i mutter at him smiling in theory a security failing but so what in this world essentially these are nonsense words meaningless to anybody who knows only this reality or any single world for that matter the little aluminium tube lies inside my chest bag amongst other things it holds a tiny mechanical onetime reader a metal device like two miniaturised measuring tapes joined by a short collar a sort of slide with a glass window in it one of the spools has a little pullout handle on it you deploy this wind it up and let it go it starts to pull the paper strip from the other spool past the little window you need to watch this very carefully you can read about a dozen letters at a time before theyre gone into the other spool where the specially treated paper comes into contact with the air and turns to dust its message for ever unreadable the clockwork mechanism once started cannot be stopped so you need to pay continuous attention if you miss any part of the message well youre stuck you will need to go and ask for another set of instructions this does not go down well i read my orders in the toilet it was a little dim so i used a torch taken with the highly irregular verbal changes to the instructions it would seem that certain elisions as we call them in the trade are called for i am to elide rather a lot of eliding required in fact interesting a sneeze and when i open my eyes again i am a dapper gent in a frock coat with a hat cane and grey gloves my skin is a little darker a language check reveals mandarin is back and farsi is my third language after french and english then german then a smattering of at least twenty others a muchdivided world paris has changed once more there is a canal through the breadth of the ile st louis the street is full of gaily dressed hussars on clopping headtossing horses being politely applauded by a few passersby who have stopped to watch and everything smells of steam i look up hoping for airships i always like it when there are airships but i cant see any i let the troop of horsemen pass then hail a sleeklooking steam cab to take me to the gare waterloo and the tgv for england plyte jésusdottir krijk heurtzloftbeiderkern obliq mulverhill i mutter once more and wink at the uncomprehending look of the cabbie there is a mirror in the buttoned lining of the cabs passenger compartment i look at myself i am well turned out with a very neat haircut and an exquisitely trimmed little goatee but i am otherwise undistinguished as usual the cab is number these numbers add up to whose own numbers then add up to which as any fool knows is by convention the luckiest of lucky numbers i adjust the sleeves of my chemise where they protrude from my coat until they are exactly equal in length i allow myself a deep sigh as i settle into the plush of the cabs seat positioning myself as centrally as possible still with the ocd then the perineum club sits on vermyn street off piccadilly it is late afternoon by the time i arrive and lord harmyle is taking tea mister demesere he says holding my card as though it might be infected oh well how unexpected i suppose youd better join me why thank you lord harmyle is a gaunt spare figure with long white hair and a face that appears halfway to being bleached from his skull his thin lips are pale purple and his small eyes rheumy he looks ninety years old or more but is apparently only in his early fifties the two schools of thought regarding this anomaly cite either predisposing familial genes or an especially outré addiction he eyes me beadily from the far side of the table the perineum is as calm reserved and sparsely occupied as the café atlantique was frenetic rowdy and crowded it smells of pipe smoke and leather madame dortolan the good lord enquires a servant wafts to our side and dispenses weaklooking tea into an almost transparent porcelain cup i resist the urge to swivel the cup so that the handle points directly towards me she sends her regards i tell him even though she did no such thing lord harmyle sucks in his already hollow cheeks and looks as though somebody has laced his tea with arsenic and how is that lady she is well hmm lord harmyles fingers hover thinly like the claw of a predatory skeleton over some crustless cucumber sandwiches and you do you bring a message the claw retreats and lifts a small biscuit instead there are seven of the small anaemiclooking sandwiches on one plate and eleven biscuits on the other both primes added together eighteen which is not a prime obviously and making nine the throwaway number really this sort of thing could be both distressing and distracting over time yes i take out the little ormolu sweetener case and shake free a tiny white pill it disappears into the tea which i stir i lift the cup to my lips lord harmyle appears undisturbed one is supposed to lift the saucer and cup together to ones mouth lord harmyle observes distastefully as i drink my tea is one i ask i replace the teacup on the saucer i do beg your pardon i lift both saucer and cup this time the tea tastes diffident whatever flavours it might possess holding back as though ashamed of expressing themselves well harmyle asks frowning well i repeat permitting myself a look of polite puzzlement whats the message you bear sir i hope i shall never lose my sincere admiration for those able to invest the word sir on the face of it a genuine honorific with the level of brusque contempt that the good lord has just achieved ah i put cup and saucer down i understand you may have expressed some doubts regarding the direction the central council might be taking i smile concerns even harmyles already pallid complexion appears to lose whatever blood it previously contained which is rather impressive really given that all this is basically an act he sits back glances around he puts his own cup and saucer down rattled what on earth are you talking about i smile raise one hand firstly sir have no fear i am here to ensure your safety not threaten it are you indeed the good lord looks dubious absolutely i am as i have always been attached inter alia to the protection department this is actually true never heard of it one is not supposed to unless one has need to call upon its services i smile nevertheless it exists you may have been right to feel threatened that is why i am here harmyle looks troubled and possibly confused i understood that the lady in paris was unflinchingly loyal to the current regime he observes at which i look mildly surprised indeed i was under the impression she herself formed a significant part of that regime at its highest level really i say i ought to explain in terms of central council politics lord h is a onetime waverer who is now a dortolan loyalist but who has been instructed by madame dortolan to seem to grow remote from her and her cabal to speak out against her and by so gaining their confidence try to draw out the others on the central council who would oppose the good lady she would have a spy in their midst however lord h has been conspicuously unsuccessful in this endeavour and so fears he is caught between two very slippery stepping stones and is in some danger of skidding and falling no matter which way he tries to go aleaping yes really id have thought he continues cautiously still glancing around the quiet highceilinged woodpanelled room that if she heard i was that i had any doubts regarding our prevailing strategies that she would have been my implacable opponent not my concerned protector i spread my hands for a moment my brain chooses to interpret this movement as one hand diverging into two different realities i have to perform the internal equivalent of a mindclearing shake of the head to dispel this sensation my mind is in at least two different places at the moment which even with the rare gift i have and the highly specialised training ive benefited from requires a deal of concentration oh she is quite placable i hear myself say the good ladys loyalties are not entirely as you might have assumed lord harmyle looks at me curiously perhaps not sure how good my english is and whether he is somehow being made fun of i pat my pockets appear distracted i am distracted but im holding it together i say dyou think i might borrow a handkerchief i think i feel a sneeze coming on harmyle frowns his gaze shifts fractionally towards his breast pocket where a white triangle of handkerchief protrudes ill ask a waiter he says half turning in his seat the halfturn is all that i need i rise quickly take one step forward and while he is still swivelling back to look at me his eyes just beginning to widen in fear slash his throat pretty much from ear to ear with the glass stillete i have been concealing up my right sleeve a pretty venetian thing murano i believe bought on bund street not ten minutes ago the good lords earlier alabaster appearance deceived in fact he held quite a lot of blood i ram the stillete into him directly underneath his sternum just for good measure i have not lied i feel i must point out as i have already stated i am indeed attached to the protection department though i may have just constructively dismissed myself i admit it is simply that said department is concerned with the protection of the concerns security not the protection of individuals these distinctions matter though possibly not here stepping delicately away as lord harmyle tries with absolute and indeed nearcomical ineffectiveness to staunch the bright blushes of blood pulsing and squirting from his severed arteries while at the same time seemingly attempting to wheeze a last few bubbling breaths or who knows words through his ruptured windpipe he doesnt seem to have noticed theres a pencilthin knife protruding from his chest though perhaps he is just prioritising i sneeze suddenly and loudly as though allergic to the scent of blood now that really would be a handicap in my line of work patient a small bird came and sat on my window ledge this morning i heard it first then opened my eyes and saw it it is a fine clear day in late spring and the air smells of last nights rain on new leaves the bird was smaller than my hand beak to tail mostly a speckle of twotone brown with a yellow beak black legs and white flashes along the leading edges of its wings it landed facing me then jumped and turned so that it was facing outwards again ready to fly off it rotated and dipped its tiny head to observe me with one black sparkling eye somebody passed the open door of my room shuffling down the corridor and the bird flew away it fell initially disappearing then reappeared performing a series of shallow bounces through the air fluttering energetically for a few seconds to buoy itself up then bringing its wings tight into its body so that it resembled a tiny feathery bullet dipping down like some falling shell on an earthbound trajectory before deploying its wings again and fluttering busily to gain height once more i lost sight of it against the bright green shimmer of the trees we live in an infinity of infinities and we reshape our lives with every passing thought and each unconscious action threading an everchanging course through the myriad possibilities of existence i lie here and ponder the events and decisions that led me to this point the precise sequence of thoughts and actions that ended for now with me having nothing more constructive or urgent to do than think about those very eventualities ive never had so much time to think the bed the room the clinic its setting all are highly conducive to thinking they impose a sense of calmness of things remaining unchanged and yet being reliably maintained without decay or obvious entropy i am free to think not abandoned to rot in detroit i played pinball in yokohama pachinko in tashkent bagatelle i found all three games enthralling fascinated by the randomness that emerged from such highly structured precisely setup machinery knocking shining spheres of steel from place to place within a setting where in the end gravity always won the comparison with our own lives is almost too obvious yet still it gives us an inkling into our fates and what drives us to them it is only an inkling because we are submerged within a vastly more complicated environment than the clicking bouncing steel balls and the pins and bands and buffers and walls they collide with our course is more like that of a particle within a smoke chamber subject to brownian motion and we are at least nominally possessed of free will but by reducing simplifying it allows us a grasp of something otherwise too great for us to comprehend in the raw i was a traveller a fixer for the concern that is what i was what i made myself into what i was groomed for and made into by others what life made me across the many worlds i roamed surfing that blastfront of everchanging everbranching existence dancing through the spectra of plausibleimplausible hermeticconnected banalbizarre kindcruel and so on all the ways that wed worked out a world or deck of worlds could be judged evaluated and ranked this world here is plausible hermetic banal kind yours is the same except closer to the cruel end of the relevant spectrum quite a lot closer you had the misfortune to have a singular ancestral eve and i guess she just wasnt a very nice person blame volcanoes or something of course i cannot tell anybody here this though i have thought to i could talk to them in my own first language or even english or french which were my adopted tongues and operational languages and the chances are high that nobody here would understand a solitary word i said but that would be foolish it would be an indulgence and i am not sure that i can afford even so modest a one i have even been reluctant to think about my past life until this point which is now starting to seem almost a superstition at some point i suppose i will have to i wish the little bird would come back adrian i suppose mr noyce was a sort of father figure to me he was a decent bloke what can i say old money which made him unusual among the city people i knew at the time come to think of it so did the beingdecent bit too id supplied his son barney with enough dust to sink a cruiser though im not sure mr n ever knew this i mean he certainly knew barney did toot by the sackful or he must have guessed because he was sharp nobodys fool thats for sure but i dont think barney ever told him hed got so much of it through me getting introduced properly to barneys dad was one of the favours i called in when i decided to make the transition to relative respectability barney owed me money and instead of taking it in folding i suggested that he might like to invite me to the noyce family pile for a weekend in the country id thought barney might resist this idea but he jumped at it made me think id priced the deal far too low but there you are sure sure theres a bunch of people coming down next weekend come down then yeah why not we were glugging bolly in a newly opened champagne bar in limehouse all glitzy chrome and distressed leather both of us coked to the eyeballs jittery and voluble much drumming of fingers and overquick nodding and all that sort of shit id taken a lot less than he had but ive always had this thing where i start behaving like the people im with even though im technically not in the same state they are ive been a designated driver once or twice and drunk nothing stronger than fizzy mineral water all night with no drugs at all and people have taken one look at me and tried to take the car keys off me because im slurring my words and have gone all giggly and smiley same with the white stuff i would take a little with clients just to be chummy while they got stuck in up to their eyebrows but id end up just as high and wired and frenetic as them thing is i can always snap out of it pronto know what i mean id be sober the instant after somebody accused me of slipping vodkas into my perrier which once theyd realised i was straight meant they were happy to let me drive but that came with its own problems cos you look like an actor like youre taking the piss just pretending to be drunk know what i mean people resent that especially drunks of course caused a few arguments i never was taking the piss though it wasnt something i did deliberately it was just something that happened anyway i learned to tone down this getting drunkwhatever on the atmosphere effect but it still came into play what sort of people i asked suspicious i dont know barney said looking round he smiled at a table with three girls there was a fair amount of talent in the place barney was tall and blond to my average and dark he worked out but there was a sort of pudginess to his face that made you think hed be a bloater if he ever stopped gyming every day or gave up toot ive been called wiry just people he frowned at me trying to smile at the same time he waved one arm people you know people sorry mate i said i dont fink i can cope with this level of detail can you be a bit more vague i was doing the barrowboy bit then which was why i said fink barney struggled just i dont know tramps kings i suggested annoyed that we still werent getting anywhere oh for fucks sake barney said people i cant say people like me people like you well maybe not like you but people he sounded frustrated and glanced at the door to the gents it was only about fifteen minutes since his last toot but i sensed he was getting ready for more people i said people barney agreed he patted the pocket where his wrap of gear was and nodded emphatically barney never was very good on specifics it was one of the things that made him not very good as a trader that and the overfondness for the coke this weekend i asked this weekend sure therell be room he snorted course therell be fucking room there was lots of room cos it was a fucking mansion wasnt it spetley halls in suffolk near bury st edmunds one of those places where you pass a nice but desertedlooking gatehouse like something out of a fairy story and start off down the drive and begin to wonder if its all a giant windup cos the gentle rolling parkland and distant vistas of follies and herds of deer just seem to go on for ever with no actual dwelling in sight then this cliff of stonework dotted with statues and urns and tall windows with ornate surrounds and looking like a barely miniaturised version of buckingham palace heaves into view over the horizon and you suspect youre finally nearing the gaff still didnt get greeted by no butler or footmen or anything though had to park me own car didnt i though actually there was a servant of some description who did help me with my bags once id tramped up the steps to the front doors he even apologised for not being there to greet me just taken some other guests to their room it was all the wifes mrs noyces really she was something doublebarrelled and a proper lady with a capital l and had married mr n and theyd inherited the place there were at least twenty guests that weekend im still not sure i saw all of them all together in the one place at any one time mrs n was a lovely old greyhaired girl not stuckup but seriously posh and she tried to get everybody to dinner and breakfast at the same time but what with one couple needing to stay the friday night in london somebody having a cold a couple of children to be got ready for bed early and all that sort of stuff i dont think we were ever totally quorate know what i mean plus i wasnt even that far off with the meanttobefacetious question to barney about there being kings there as one minor royal and his lady friend were present id left my own current main girl back at the flat she was lovely a dancer called lysanne and all legs and gorgeous long real blonde hair but she had a scouse accent you could have etched steel with plus shed have been a distraction frankly and also lysanne was one of those girls who never really managed to hide the fact she was always on the lookout to trade up i was definitely a catch compared to her earlier boyfriend another dealer a level or two down the chain of demand but i never fooled myself that she thought i was the best she could do bringing her somewhere like spetley hall when it was full of our richers and betters would be too tempting for her no matter what she might tell me about how much she really loved me and how she was mine for ever shed have made a nuisance of herself probably a fool of herself too and me and ended up getting hurt worst of all of course she just might have succeeded skipping off with some doolally trustafarian and leaving me ditched looking like a wanker couldnt have that either could i it was through touching on this sort of stuff over a game of billiards late on the saturday night that i got to know mr noyce it was just us two by this time everybody else had gone off to bed all done without chemical aid on my part too billiards is what the toffs play instead of snooker you really see it so coldly do you adrian he asked sketching the tip of his cue with green chalk he blew the excess off and smiled at me mr n was a biggish twinkly sort of guy light on his feet for a portly gent he had greying strawcoloured hair and bushy black eyebrows he wore the bigframed glasses that were still just about fashionable at the time give him a cigar and hed have looked like groucho marx wed both hung our proper dinner jackets over chairs hed loosened his bow tie id unclipped mine id made a mental note to buy a proper bow tie even if i couldnt be bothered going through the whole rigmarole of tying it up at the start of the evening i could keep it in my pocket wear the clipon and just replace the fake one with the untied real one at the end of the evening leave it hanging looked much classier like mrs n barneys dad had that way of looking perfectly relaxed in the sort of ultraformal gear most of us feel dead awkward in the rich love dressing up id realised that weekend it has to be within a strict sort of framework though they have specialist clothes for morning afternoon eating dinner riding hunting actually different sets of clothes for different sorts of hunting not to mention fishing boating general tramping around the country popping into the local town and for going up to london they always went up to london even if theyd started far north of it something to do with trains apparently seen in this light even their casual clothes became like casual clothes rather than just stuff you liked knocking about in or that made you feel comfortable what relationships mr n please call me edward yes relationships he had a soft deep voice posh but not fruity thats a terribly unromantic outlook dont you think i grinned at him cued up whacked a white ball around a bit id picked up the rules of billiards easily enough though it still seemed a pretty pointless game to me well they say everythings a market dont they edward hmm some people do didnt think youd disagree in your position i told him mr n was senior partner in one of the citys bestknown stockbroking firms and allegedly worth a mint i treat the market like a market he agreed he took a shot stood admiring it for a moment perverse to do otherwise he smiled at me probably expensive as well i imagine yeah but lifes like that too isnt it i said dont you think i mean people tell themselves all these fairy stories about true love and stuff but when it comes right down to it people have a pretty good idea of their own value on the marriage market or relationship market or whatever you want to call it know what i mean ugly people know better than to go up to beautiful ones and expect anything else but a knockback beautiful people can grade themselves and other people spot the pecking order like a squash ladder i grinned you know where you are and you can challenge somebody a bit above you or be challenged by somebody a bit below but its going to end in embarrassment if you outreach yourself bit like that a squash ladder mr n said he sighed took his shot point is i said people start from whatever social level they get born into but they can trade up with looks cant they or a bit of looks and a lot of face a lot of selfconfidence or some sort of talent footballers do that film stars rock stars superstar djs whatever gets you money and fame but the point is that looks are liquid know what i mean specially for girls looks can take you anywhere but only if you use them a girl like my lysanne shes very aware of her looks she knows how to use them and she does use them bless her she thinks she can do better than me better than where i am at the moment anyway so shell take any chance she can to trade up do a bit better for herself well fair play to her though there are risks obviously its a bit like mountaineering the trick for somebody like her is checking out the next holds firm before you leave the security of the one youve been depending on until now that is a lot of face indeed i grinned to show id got the joke obscure though it might have been cant blame her for it though can i i mean if i found somebody betterlooking or as goodlooking but better educated a bit more sophisticated than lysanne i suppose id ditch her for them i shrugged gave him my cheekychappie grin fairs fair and up always means up to more money i take it course edward moneys what its all about in the end isnt it lifes a game and whoever dies with the most toys wins dont ask me who said that but its true dont you think well mr n said drawing the word out you have to be careful one of the wisest things anybody ever said to me was that if all you ever care about is money money is all that will ever care for you he looked at me i smiled back he sighed as he surveyed the table meaning i suppose that if you care nothing for people then when youre old and fading only hired carers and maybe what we used to call golddiggers will still be around to look after you yeah well ill worry about that when it happens edward mr n went to the side table where our drinks were and sipped from his whisky well i suppose as long as you both know where you stand he tipped his head to one side do you both know where you stand is this something youve talked about together i grimaced its tacit tacit mr n smiled i nodded its understood and is there no room for love in this terribly transactional view of human relationships adrian oh yeah of course i said breezily when it comes along kind of thing theres no allowing for another level boss level who knows he just smiled took his shot thing is i said with all due respect edward you can afford to think the way you think and feel the way you feel because youve kind of got it all know what i mean i smiled broadly to show there was no edge here no jealousy involved just an observation lovely wife family important job country estate flat in london skiing in klosters sailing in the med everything you could ask for you have the luxury of observing the rest of us from your olympian heights havent you me im still scrabbling up the foothills kneedeep in scree down here me he laughed at that most of us are we need to be clearsighted we need to see things the way they really are to us i shrugged looking after number one its all were doing and how are things for you adrian theyre fine thanks i took my shot lots of aimless clacking and movement good im glad for you barney talks very highly of you what is it you do again web design got my own company which was nothing but the truth without being remotely like the whole of it well i hope you do well but you ought to know that no amount of success frees you of all problems he stooped evaluating well we all have our crosses to bear edward no doubt about that he took his shot stood up slowly what do you think of barney he watched the balls click and clack across the baize not looking at me he rechalked his cue brows furrowed ahha i thought i didnt reply too quickly took a shot in the meantime hes a great guy i said brilliant company i put on a slightly pained expression when edward looked at me i took a breath and said he could choose some of his friends better i laughed lightly present company excluded obviously mr n didnt smile he bent to size up another shot i worry that hes enjoying himself a bit too much ive talked to the people at bairns faplish this was the broking company barney worked for mr n having thought it would look bad to bring the boy straight into his own firm after graduation barney had told me himself that hed needed intensive tutoring to blag his way from eton into oxford and had barely scraped a whatever that is i thought it was an airgun pellet theyre a little concerned mr n continued hes not bringing in what he might they cant let that situation go on for ever its not like the old days once any idiot could be a stockbroker and a lot were not good enough these days he flashed me a mouthonly smile no eyes involved at all theres a family name at stake after all were all a bit wild when were young arent we i suggested edward looked unconvinced hell pull straight in time i told him looking serious i could say this sort of shit fairly convincingly on account of being a bit older than barney i put my cue down on the table folded my arms look mr n edward its always more pressure on a guy when hes got a successful father know what i mean he looks up to you he does i know that but youre you know youre a lot to live up to its bound to be intimidating being in your shadow you might not see it but thats you being up in your olympian heights again isnt it he smiled a little sadly perhaps well as you say he could do with some better friends he said leaning on his cue and surveying the table i dont want to sound like some victorian paterfamilias but a little more of the straight and narrow would do him no harm youre probably right edward i picked up my cue my theory is that hes too nice too nice had it all too easy thinks the worlds a nicer place than it really is expects everybody else to be as relaxed and goodnatured as he is i shook my head i bent to my shot dangerous perhaps youd care to instruct him in life according to you oh good shot thanks i could i agreed i mean i have already but i could make more of a point of it if you liked dont know that hell listen to me but i could try id be very grateful mr n smiled itd be my pleasure edward hmm he looked thoughtful were off to scotland next month shooting barney and dulcima have said theyll be there for the first week though i expect hell find an excuse not to come at the last minute again i think he finds us boring do you shoot adrian great i think i can make barney come along by promising him the whole weeks my treat cokewise and then ill be right in with mr n never tried edward you should would you like to come along madame dortolan mr kleist thought the lady took the news remarkably well considering he had done something hed never thought to do in the several years he had been employed by her and disturbed her while she was at her toilet she had called him in and had continued to apply her makeup while she sat at her dressing table with him standing behind her they looked at each other via the tables mirror madame dortolan had donned a peignoir before receiving him however he found that if he let his eyes stray downwards he could see rather a large portion of both her breasts he took a halfstep backwards to save both their blushes there had never been anything of that nature between them nevertheless when the cat called m pamplemousse unentwined itself from beneath the stool its mistress sat upon and gazed up at him it was with what looked like an accusation madame dortolan sighed harmyle im afraid so maam dead quite entirely our boy has jumped the rails then indeed maam he might be said to be on the opposite track heading in precisely the wrong direction and at some speed madame dortolan regarded mr kleist with a look of desiccated withering that most men would have flinched at mr kleist was not the flinching sort hes still being tracked just two of the five report they managed to hang on by their fingernails metaphorically however his next transition ought to be much easier to follow apparently bring him in she told him hurt but unharmed mr kleist nodded understanding and address all the correct targets individually and concurrently he nodded immediately she told him taking up her hairbrush of course maam mr kleist did his best to kick m pamplemousse accidentally on purpose as he turned away but the creature easily avoided his foot and mewed with what sounded like selfsatisfaction the transitionary i sniff blow my nose look round i am in another version of the building which housed the perineum club back where lord harmyle is at this very moment i should think lying on the floor kicking and gurgling his way to a rather bloody death in this reality the vermyn street building contains a parfumerie the dark wood panels are mostly hidden by exquisite wall rugs and creamy gently glowing light panels illuminating a smattering of tearshaped perfume bottles arrayed on glass shelves the air is laced with enchanting female scents and no one looks in the least surprised that i have just sneezed the wellheeled clientele is composed mostly of ladies one or two are with gentlemen and there are a couple of other unescorted men besides myself it is the men i find myself looking at the shop assistants are mostly very goodlooking young men one especially chiselled specimen tall and dark smiles at me i smile back a little thrill running through me ah well i never fully appreciate being gay but at least i havent hit the ground counting the cracks in the parquet flooring i seem to have left the ocd behind for now at least my languages are english spanish portuguese french german and cantonese plus smatterings i quickly review my attire in a fulllength mirror i am dressed similarly to the way i was with lord harmyle i wonder if he is the late lord harmyle yet my hair is long and dark and ringleted in what would appear to be the fashion here though it looks particularly good on me i must say no wonder the young assistant favoured me with a smile i check my hands for any signs of blood it would be unusual and alarming if there were any but one always looks spotless i have very pale hands beautifully manicured and sporting two silver or white gold rings on each hand i have no time to dally one further regretful smile at the handsome young assistant and i make for the door checking my wallet papers and ormolu pill box as i go i am mr marquand ys according to my british passport that is all in order the wallet is full of large white banknotes and several importantlooking bits of plastic with silvery chips embedded into the street still no airships dommage however above the relatively lowrise buildings a very large aircraft sails serenely overhead heading west i wave my cane at a cab a whirring hunchbackedlooking thing which id surmise runs off electricity and order the lady cabbie to take me to the airport in the mirror the womans brow creases which one ah a large london londres grande how splendid wheres that aircraft heading i ask pointing with my cane she cranes her neck out of her window squinting eafrow i should fink there then itll cost ya im sure now do drive on we set off plyte jésusdottir krijk heurtzloftbeiderkern obliq mulverhill i mutter it feels pleasing to me just saying it it has a become a mantra i suppose the girl cabby glances askance at me in her mirror plyte jésusdottir krijk heurtzloftbeiderkern obliq mulverhill i repeat smiling wottevah mate i sit back watching the relatively quiet traffic and rather loud architecture glide past my heart has been beating rather rapidly since my transition well since lord harmyles murder i suppose now it begins to slow allowing me the luxury of reflection of course i think about whatever poor wretch ive left behind to deal with the aftermath of my actions especially when it is something as dramatic and unpleasant as a murder what must it be like for them i wonder allegedly they know nothing about what has happened until after i have gone though i always wonder if this is really true might they not be aware of what i am making them do even as i do it are they not perhaps along for the ride when i take over their body observing doubtless terrified and frustrated as i perform whatever actions i deem to be necessary to fulfil whatever orders i have been given or are they genuinely oblivious and effectively wake up to be suddenly confronted with in the case of the operation just concluded a dying man blood on their hands and the stares of shocked witnesses what could one possibly do in such circumstances flinch back horrified exclaiming but it wasnt me scarcely supportable one would do best to run id imagine it might be better for the poor bastards to collapse quite dead the instant i leave them i have asked about this kind of thing but the concern is by its nature very conservative and secretive and even the researchers technicians and experts whose business it is to know of such matters are not inclined to divulge the relevant answers there are those who assuredly do know the answers to all these questions and more madame do would know mrs m would too and dr plyte and professore loscelles and all the others on the central council there is in all likelihood an entire division of the hmm for some reason i dont want to think of it as the concern this is one of the worlds where it is thought of as lexpédience anyway indeed there is an entire cadre of experts who have studied what happens when someone like myself takes over a previously existing person in another reality and then leaves them again but lexpédience does not deem me to be one of those who needs to know the results of their research id love to know i have carried out my own modest experiments attempting to rummage round in the memories i find or the feelings i discover trying to find some trace of the personality i have displaced but so far such vicarious introspections have produced nothing except a lingering feeling of foolishness at having undertaken them in the first place plainly i inherit something of the character of the person whose being i usurp that must be where the ocd comes from and ones sexual inclination as does the taste for variously coffee tea chocolate spiced milk hard liquor bland or spicy food or prunes i have found myself over the years surveying the reality i find myself in with the eyes of somebody who is plainly a general medical practitioner a surgeon a landscape designer a mathematician a structural engineer a livestock breeder a litigation lawyer an insurance assessor an hotelier and a psychiatrist i seem to be at home amongst the professions once i was a sewerage system designer who was also a serial killer yes i know but i would beg the indulgence of being regarded rather as an assassin i will even accept paid killer so long as it is understood that i do what i do through informed choice rather than due to some grubbily psychotic urge though ill allow that the importance of this distinction might escape my victims on that occasion i had to suppress the urge to strangle prostitutes in order to carry out my mission which was to track down and kidnap ha you see not kill my quarry on the other hand i have never been a woman which is slightly odd and even a little disappointing obviously there are limits and are these bodies i inhabit ever used more than once i have never visited the same body twice indeed i rarely visit the same reality twice these takenover persons will have had perfectly full lives before i invade them they have pasts careers networks of relationships both personal and professional all that one would expect i have had my wives partners girlfriends my children and my best friends greet me without a trace of discomfiture or any sign that i am behaving oddly or out of character i seem to know how to behave when i am somebody else as naturally as the most gifted actor and when i search mytheir memories i find no trace of earlier exposure to the concern or whatever it might be called locally or preparation for what has happened i extract my little ormolu pill case from my coat and study it i shall probably next take one of the tiny capsules it contains while ten kilometres above the atlantic or over the alps or while looking down at the sahara or i could wait until i arrive wherever it is i decide to go in any event how do these little white pills small enough for one to fit three or four on the nail of ones smallest finger actually work who manufactures them where who invented them tried and tested them i work the sweetener case conventionally causing it to produce a perfectly normal sweetener such as any dietconscious person might slip into their tea or coffee while often of course tucking ones snout into a glistening cream bun it is almost identical to the special pills lacking only a tiny blue dot scarcely visible to the naked eye in the very centre of one face i slide open the end of the ormolu case and replace the sweetener the little case itself is quite an exquisite piece of work used as one would expect it to be used it will happily dispense sweeteners and nothing but sweeteners all day until they run out only by holding and pressing it just so may one access the small compartment concealed within that contains its real treasure so that it releases one of the little pills which lead one to flit bringing about a transition flicking one into another soul and another world questions questions i know how i am supposed to think i am supposed to think that one day i might rise to the level of madame dortolan and her ilk and discover some of the answers eliding everybody on the list my orders contained might well be quite enough by itself to ensure just such an elevation and i should think so too such a closepacked sequence of elisions would require my best work and success would by no means be assured anyway sadly as far as madame dortolans purposes are concerned i have no intention of killing the people on the list on the contrary i will save them if i can with any luck in a sense i already have no i intend to go quite diametrically offmessage in this matter i already have of course lord harmyle wasnt even on the list patient ah our profession mine and those who will now be looking for me my peers i suppose though i was peerless if i say so myself there was especially at the more colourful end of the reality spectrum an insane grace to my elisions a contrived but outrageous elegance as evidence the fiery fate of one yerge aushauser arbitrageur or perhaps you would prefer the brainfrying exit of mr max fitching lead singer of gun puppy the first true world band in more realities than we cared to count or the painful and im afraid protracted end of marit shauoon stunt driver businessman and politician for yerge i arranged a special bubble bath at his nevada ranch replacing the air feed to the nozzles in his hot tub with hydrogen the cylinders hidden under the wooden decking around the tub were controlled by a radioactivated valve i was watching from the other side of the world through a digital camera attached to a spotting scope a sunlightpowered computer and a proprietary satellite uplink all sitting disguised by sage bushes on a hillside a mile away a motion sensor alerted me that the hot tub was in use while i was asleep in my hotel in sierra leone when i gazed blearyeyed into my phone i saw yerge aushauser striding up to the tub alone for once i swung out of bed woke the laptop for a higherdefinition view and waited until he was sitting there in the frothing water all hairy arms and furious expression probably another expensive night at the gaming tables he usually brought home a girl or two to knock around on such occasions but perhaps this morning he was tired the view was quite clear through the cool morning air untroubled by thermals i could see him put something long and dark to his mouth then hold something to its end a spark his fat fingers would be closing round his gran corona his throat exposed as he put his head back against the cushion on the tubs rim and blew the first mouthful of smoke into the clear blue nevada sky i punched in the code for the valve controlling the feed from the hydrogen cylinders seconds later half a world away the water frothed crazily briefly seemed to steam as though boiling hiding first yerge and then the tub in a ball of vapour this erupted almost immediately into an intense yellowwhite fireball which engulfed the tub and all the nearby decking even in the early morning sunshine it blazed brightly amazingly after a few seconds while the pillar of roaring flame piled towards the heavens like an upsidedown rocket plume yerge stumbled out of the conflagration and across the decking hair on fire skin blackened strips of it hanging off him like dark rags he fell down some steps and lay there motionless minus his cigar but still in a sense smoking until the decking itself caught fire yerges servants had run out from the house and dragged him away by then there was little smoke oxygen and hydrogen burn perfectly producing of course only water most of the initial burst of smoke now drifting and dissipating in the cool morning breeze and heading towards the distant grey sierras would have come from yerge himself he had ninetyfive per cent burns and lungs seared by flame inhalation they managed to keep him alive for nearly a week which was remarkable max fitching was a god amongst mortals a man with the voice of an angel and the proclivities of a satyr i killed max while he sat in a seriously pimped opentop halftrack in jakarta waiting for a roadie to return with his drugs max never did get the hang of dressing down or going incognito the israeli laser weapon was originally an experimental device designed to bring down iranian missiles while they were still over syria or better still iraq i fired it from a container truck a block down the street from maxs idling halftrack even attenuated to the minimum it was grossly overpowered for the job and rather than drill a neat hole straight through maxs fashionably pale heavily sunglassed wildly dreadlocked head it blew it to smithereens windows shattered three storeys up this was not elegant far from it the elegance came from the fact that the laser burst was not a single brutally simple pulse but one which had been precisely frequencymodulated to mirror the digitalised information of a highsamplerate mp signal compressed into a microsecond what hit max was effectively an mp copy of woke up down gun puppys first worldwide hit and the song that had made max truly famous marit shauoon was a populist politician in the perón mould and like the others i had been reliably informed that he would if left alone take the world to a very bad place in his case starting with south and central america as if any of this really mattered to me craft my trade was all i let those who handed me my orders worry about the morality of it he had been a motorcycle stunt rider the most famous in brazil and then in the world he crashed a lot but that just added to the excitement anticipation and sense of jeopardy in the crowd all four of his major limbs were pinned and strengthened with extensive amounts of surgical steel and even without those there were enough metal implants in the rest of his body to set off airport security scanners while he was still walking stiffly from the car park i found an induction furnace for him he heated up quite slowly from the inside to the sound of vastly thrumming magnets all around him and his own screams what why why and why i would have had no idea if i had not been told and even once i was told frankly i still didnt care i am mildly surprised i recall any of the reasons given below at all so yerge would have started a political party to rid the usa of nonaryans bringing chaos and apocalyptic bloodshed max would have given all his hundreds of millions in royalties to an extremist green movement who taking an arguably rather drastic approach to harmonising the planets natural carrying capacity with the size of its human population would have used the windfall to design manufacture weaponise and distribute a virus that would kill ninety per cent of humanity and marit would have used his vast communications network to i cant remember broadcast pornography to andromeda or something as i say it didnt really matter i had by then entirely stopped enquiring why i might be committing such terminally grievous acts all i cared about was the artistry and elegance involved in the doing the carrying out the commission the execution the philosopher screams too many screams they have kept me awake at night woken me from dreams and nightmares i do not enjoy what i do though i am not ashamed of it and it would not be an exaggeration to say that i am proud of it it is something that has to be done and somebody has to do it it is because i do not enjoy it that i am good at it i have seen the work of those who do enjoy our mutual calling and they do not produce the best results they get carried away they indulge themselves rather than stick to the task in hand which is to produce the results which are desired and to recognise them when they are produced instead they try too hard and fail i torture people i am a torturer but i do no more than i am told to do and i would rather that the people i torture told the truth or revealed the information that they carry and which we need to know as quickly as possible both to spare themselves and to spare me the unpleasantness of the task because as i say i take no pleasure in what i have to do nevertheless i do all that i am asked to do and will always work long hours and take on extra duties if required this is conscientiousness and a sort of mercy because at least when i do it only the minimum is done i have had colleagues the ones mentioned above who enjoy what we do who have been impatient to cause the maximum amount of pain and damage they are in the end inefficient the clever ones pretend not to be psychotic and only indulge themselves rarely opting for routine efficiency for the majority of the time theyre the dangerous ones my favoured techniques are electricity repeated nearsuffocation and hard though this may be to believe simply talking the electricity is the crudest in a sense we use a variable step resistor attached to the mains and a variety of commonorgarden car jump leads sometimes some water or conducting gel the crocodile clips on the end of the jump leads hurt quite a bit without any current flowing through them the ears are good sites and fingers and toes the genitals obviously the nose or tongue with the other terminal inserted into the anus is a favourite with some of my colleagues though i dislike the resultant messiness repeated nearsuffocation involves gaffertaping the subjects mouth and then using a second small piece of tape to close the nostrils removing it just before or just after the onset of unconsciousness this is a useful technique for lowlevel subjects and for those who must be returned to some other department or security agency or even to normal life without any signs of injury talking involves telling the subject what will happen to them if they do not cooperate it is best done in a perfectly dark room talking quietly and matteroffactly from somewhere behind the chair they are secured to first i describe what will happen to them anyway even if they tell us everything because there is a certain minimum a kind of callout fee level of torment that we have to inflict once people have been referred to us this is to maintain our reputation and the sense of dread that must be associated with us fear of being tortured can be a highly effective technique for maintaining law and order in a society and i believe that we would be in dereliction of our duty if we did not do our bit then i describe what i might do to them the voltages used the symptoms of suffocation and so on i have studied the relevant physiology in some depth and am able to elucidate with the use of copious medical terminology then i describe some of the other techniques used by some of my colleagues i mention the man whose code name is doctor citrus he restricts his torture instruments to a sheet of a paper and a fresh lemon using numerous usually several dozen to start with paper cuts distributed all over the subjects naked body which then have a drop or two of lemon juice squeezed into them or salt sometimes like repeated nearsuffocation this does not sound so terrible to most people but statistically it is one of the most effective torture techniques that we employ of course our friend doctor citrus does not use just one sheet of paper as any single sheet will grow moist with sweat and small amounts of blood over time he always has a box of paper to hand there are colleagues who prefer to use the tried and trusted tools of torture thumbscrews pincers pliers hammers certain acids and of course fire flame or just heat supplied by gas burners blowtorches soldering irons steam or boiling water these are sometimes the techniques of last resort when others have failed the subject will usually be scarred for life should they survive and the survival rate even if full cooperation is achieved is not high another of our colleagues likes to use cocktail sticks hundreds of wooden cocktail sticks inserted into the soft tissues of the body he talks too softening the subject up psychologically by sitting in front of them and using a small penknife to slit the cocktail sticks producing little barbs and curls of wood which will increase the pain caused both when they are inserted and when and if they are removed he sits there for an hour or more with a big pile of sticks using the tiny knife on these hundreds of little wooden slivers and detailing to the subject precisely where they will be placed he too has some medical training and describes to the subject the thinking behind his technique as being in some ways the opposite of acupuncture where the needles are inserted with the aim of causing little or no pain on entry and alleviating pain thereafter this preparatory dialogue can in itself be sufficient to produce full cooperation from the subject though as i say there is a minimum level of pain which has to be inflicted in any event just to be sure that full cooperation really has been achieved and to ensure that we as an agency are taken seriously my own talking technique is in some ways my personal favourite i like the economy of it i have found it is especially useful on artistic people or those of an intellectual persuasion as they tend to have their own very active imaginations and thus this technique lets these imaginations do my work for me over the years some of them have even mentioned said phenomenon themselves though this recognition would appear to make the process no less effective i do not like to question females the rather obvious reason would be that their screams remind me of those of my mother when my father raped her on that nevertobeforgotten night following her return home after the birth of my sister however i would prefer to think that it is simply good oldfashioned manners a gentleman simply does not wish to subject a female to anything unpleasant this does not stop me torturing women it is still something that has to be done and i am a professional and conscientious but i enjoy the process even less than i do when working with a male subject and i am not ashamed to admit that i have on occasion begged literally begged a female subject to exhibit full cooperation as quickly as possible and i am also not ashamed to reveal that i have felt tears come to my eyes when i have had to work especially hard with a female subject the use of tape across the mouth regardless of what other technique is being employed is good for cutting down the sound of screams which must then all exit the subject via the nasal passages more than somewhat reduced in volume i am relieved to be able to report i do draw the line at children some of my colleagues will happily oblige when a child must be tortured to force a parent to talk but i think this is both morally objectionable and suspect in principle a child ought not to have to suffer for the follies or beliefs of his or her parents and to the extent that the techniques we employ on the subjects are in themselves a kind of punishment for subversion treachery and lawbreaking they ought to be applied to the guilty party not visited upon their family or dependants everyone talks eventually everyone using a child to shorten the process is in my opinion sloppy lazy and simply bad technique largely due to this scruple and perhaps also because i find it interesting and illuminating to discuss or at least attempt to discuss with my colleagues subjects such as those enumerated above my code name within the department is the philosopher the transitionary i live in a switzerland the indefinite article is germane the particular switzerland i live in is not even called switzerland but it is a recognised type a place whose function and demeanour will be familiar to all those we number amongst the aware aware means being au fait with the realities of the realities aware is a term applied to those who understand that we live not in one world singular settled and linear but within a multitude of worlds forever exponentially and explosively multiplying through time more to the point it applies to those who know how easy it is to travel between these disparate everbranching and unfolding and developing realities my home is an old lodge in the pines on a ridge looking out over the small but sophisticated spa town of flesse beyond the town to the west is high rolling ground clothed with trees to the east behind my lodge the hills rise in craggy increments culminating in a serrated massif of mountains high enough to hold snow all the year sufficiently compact for one to take all of it in with a single glance from my terrace flesse nevertheless boasts an opera house a railway station and junction a medley of fascinating and eccentric shops two superior hotels and a casino when i am not on my travels working for madame dortolan or some other member of lexpédience the concern i am here reading in my library during wet weather walking in the hills on the finer days and in the evening frequenting the hotels and the casino when i am as it were away flitting between other worlds and other bodies i still have a life here a version of me remains living on inhabiting my house and my body and going through all the appropriate motions concomitant with existence though by all accounts i am in the shape of this residual self quite astoundingly boring according to my housekeeper and a few other people who have encountered me in this state i never leave the house i sleep a great deal i will eat but not cook food for myself i am reluctant to get dressed properly and i show no interest in music or conversation sometimes i try to read a book but sit staring at the same page for hours either not really reading it or reading it over and over again art books paintings and illustrations appear to pique my interest as much as anything which is to say not very much at all as will a television programme though only if it is visually arresting my conversation becomes monosyllabic i seem happiest just sitting in the loggia or staring out of a window at the view im told that i appear drugged or sedated or as though i have had a stroke or been lobotomised i maintain that i have met several allegedly normal persons and not a few students who exhibit a lesser degree of daytoday animation i exaggerate only slightly however i have no cause to complain i dont get into trouble while im away from myself well i dont get into trouble here and my appetite is not sufficient to cause me to gain weight perish the thought that i might go for a walk in the hills and fall off a cliff or head for the casino and incur vast debts or start an illadvised affair while my back is turned on myself the rest of the time though i am entirely here living fully attention undivided in this world this reality on the seemingly singular version of the earth that calls itself calbefraques my name in what is for me at least this base or root reality is nothing like the ones i usually end up with when transitioning here i am called temudjin oh a name of eastern asian origin the earth i came from is one of the many where the influence of the mongolian empires especially in europe was more profound than the one in which you are reading these words i live an orderly even quiet life as entirely befits somebody who spends potentially highly disorienting amounts of time flitting between one world and the next too often for the unfortunate purpose of killing people murder is not all that i do however sometimes i will be a positive angel a good fairy an imp of the benign showering some unfortunate who is down on their luck with money or granting them a commission or pointing them in the direction of somebody who might be able to help them on occasion i do something almost unbearably banal like trip somebody up in the street or buy them a drink in a bar or once fall down in front of them while apparently suffering a fit that was one of the few times when i glimpsed what i might really have been doing the young doctor hurrying to an appointment but who nevertheless stopped to tend to me was thereby prevented from entering a building that promptly collapsed in a great burst of dust and mortar and smashed wooden beams lying there in the gutter seeing this just a few dozen strides down the street i feigned a partial recovery thanked him and insisted that he hurry to treat the many wailing unfortunates injured by the tenements collapse no thank you sir he muttered face grey not just with dust i believe your fit saved my life he disappeared into the growing crowd while i sat there trying not to get fallen over by those rushing to help or gawp i have no idea what that young fellow then went on to do or achieve something good i trust sometimes i simply introduce one person to another or leave a particular book or pamphlet lying around for them to discover sometimes i just talk to them generally encouraging them or mentioning a particular idea i relish such roles but they are not the ones i remember they are certainly not the ones that keep me awake at night perhaps this is simply because geniality is conventionally a little insipid havoc rocks most of my colleagues and superiors choose to live in cities it is where we are most at home and where one can most easily make the transition from one reality to another i do not pretend entirely to understand either the theories or the mechanics spiritual mechanics if you will but still mechanics behind such profoundly disconnected travellings but i know a little regarding how these things work some of it gleaned from others and some of it the result of simply working matters out for myself practically rather as i was able to work out what the true purpose of my appearing to faint in front of that young doctor was when the building he had been about to enter fell down flitting from here to there to anyoldwhere requires a deep sense of place and some sort of minimum level of societal complexity it would seem it is as a result of this that cities are by far the easiest places in which to slip between realities aircraft work too though if one has the skill something about the concentration of people i suppose i sip my gin and tonic and look down at the clouds the peaks of some of the higher mountains in the norwegian coastal range protrude like jagged ice cubes floating in milk i am taking a direct great circle route from london to tokyo cosseted within a giant aircraft coasting high above the weather where the sky is a deep dark blue i may flit from here within the plane i may not it is not an easy thing to do many of us have wasted our drug by trying to effect transitions from remote places or especially moving start points the way it appears to work is that if a successful flit cannot be made then nothing at all happens and one remains where one is there are rumours however that people who have tried such manoeuvres have indeed ended up in another reality but without the benefit of whatever mode of transport they left behind in the source reality being there to greet them in the target one one pops into existence over open water if one flitted from a liner splashing into an empty ocean to drown or be eaten by sharks or if the attempted transition is from an aircraft like this one materialises in midair twelve thousand metres up with no air to breathe a temperature of sixty below and a long way to fall i have had successes flitting from aircraft and failures obviously failures where nothing happened i take the little ormolu case from my shirt pocket and turn it over and over on my folddown table to flit or not to flit if i do vacate the aircraft then i will cover my tracks more completely than if i wait until my arrival however i could waste a pill and i just might discover the hard way that the rumours are true and find myself blastfrozen and gasping my way to unconsciousness as i start the long fall to the sea or the land there is also the welldocumented complication that sometimes one ends up in an aircraft going somewhere quite different to the destination of that one started from usually there is a reliable commonality between a roughly aligned group of worlds regarding the placement of continents major geographical features such as mountain ranges and rivers and hence big cities and therefore the air routes between them so that leaving one aircraft results in a transition to a similar craft on a parallel course but not always there appear to be limits to the maximum displacement in space and time that people have made in such circumstances a few kilometres up or down a few dozen laterally and some hours later or earlier and it is as if some aspect of ones will or visualisation is guiding one to the nearest approximation its possible to find but sometimes the influence of this ghostly presence goes quite awry or just accepts something that it hopes will do but which will not once flitting while flying over the alps bound for napoli from dublin i ended up on a flight from madrid to kiev thats practically a rightangle it took me a day and a half to repair the damage to my itinerary and i missed one appointment i had and have no idea why this happened when i mentioned this little adventure to someone from the transitionary office the primary body of lexpédience which at least in theory oversees all the actions of those like myself and madame dortolan the bureaucrat concerned just blinked behind his rimless glasses and said how interesting this was and hastened to record a note i mean really the drug we take to effect our travels is called septus some take theirs in liquid form from tiny vials like medical ampoules others prefer to snort their travellers medicine or inject it some like it to be in the form of a suppository or pessary madame dortolan was always said to have favoured the latter option i tap the little ormolu case gently on one corner rotate it a quarter turn tap it again and repeat most of us take septus in pill form it is simply less of a bother i regard most of the other methods as being rather like showing off a clear patch of sea gleams up at me a ship made tiny by the vertical kilometres between us slides slowly north across the ruffled grey surface drawing a feathery white wake after it i imagine somebody on that ship looking up and seeing this aircraft a bright white dot leaving its own thin trail inscribed across the blue perhaps some of those who are said to have disappeared are gone to other earths entirely where pangaea still holds man never evolved and sapient otters or insectile hiveminds rule in our place who can say when we flit we go to where we imagine and if distracted disoriented we imagine something too far away from what we know and where we wish to go to we may end up somewhere it is somehow impossible to imagine ones way back from i dont know how that could be what saves people like myself sometimes is how intensely we long for our home but you never know i have quizzed the theorists technicians and general functionaries of the transitionary office regarding just how all of this works and have yet to receive a satisfactory answer i am not supposed to know because i have no need to know still i would like to know my being sent to save that young doctor from being crushed in that collapsing building in savoie for example does that not imply foresight must we i mean the concern not have some ability to look ahead in time or be able to use realities otherwise similar to another but separated only by being slightly displaced in time so that having observed what has happened in the leading one one is able to affect events in the trailing one this would amount to the same thing of course maybe it was complete happenstance that the tenement collapsed pure chance i find this unlikely however chance is rarely pure it was at the casino that i encountered mrs mulverhill again for the first time in a long time or at least so i thought not that i realised immediately cities are as ive said the best places to flit between realities nexuses of transportation in our multiple existence just as they are in any given single world the principal embassy of lexpédience in the world i have tended to travel to and within partly though chance and partly through some affinitive predisposition on my part i dare say is in what is called variously byzantium constantinople konstantiniyye stamboul or istanbul depending it is an ideal focus for our interests and abilities straddling continents linking east and west and evoking the past and its manifold legacies in a way that few other cities do on this metaearth i deal with ancient modern a furious mix of peoples faiths histories and attitudes poised above and threatened by myriad fault lines it exemplifies both heritage jeopardy division and linkage all at once we have another office in jerusalem there used to be another in berlin but that city has perversely become less attractive for our purposes since the fall of the wall and the reunification of germany one of those distributed straggling metaevents that resonated through the sheaved realities for all the many worlds like some coordinated spawning phenomenon so the office was closed a shame in a way i liked the old divided berlin with its wall the greater city was a vast open airy place enfolded with lakes and sprawling tracts of forest on both sides of the divide but still at its core there was always a forlorn air about it as well as a faint feeling of imprisonment on both sides and a slowly spinning plate if you know what i mean we look for spinning wobbling plates places where it feels that matters could go either way where another spin another input of energy might restore stability but where equally just a little more neglect or even a nudge in the rightwrong place could produce catastrophe there are interesting lessons to be gleaned from the wreckage that results sometimes you cannot tell everything about a thing until youve seen it broken there ought to be a certain point in ones training for the post of transitionary our official job title clunky i know i prefer the sobriquet flitter or transitioner or transitioneer at a pinch when one realises that one has discovered or acquired an extra sense it is in a sense the sense of history of connection of how long a place has been lived in a feeling for the heritage of human events attached to a particular piece of landscape or set of streets and stones we call it fragre part of it is akin to having a sharp nose for the scent of ancient blood places of great antiquity where much has happened over not just centuries but millennia are often steeped in it almost any site of massacre or battle will have a whiff even thousands of years later i find it at its most pungent when i stand within the colosseum in rome however much of it is simply the layered result of multifarious generations of people having lived there lived and died certainly but then as most people live for decades and die just the once it is the living part that has the greatest influence over the aroma the feel of a place certainly the entirety of the americas has a significantly different fragre compared to europe and asia less fusty or less rich according to your prejudices im told that new zealand and patagonia appraise as terribly fresh compared with almost everywhere else myself i love the fragre of venezia not the fragrance at least not in summer anyway but very much the fragre i prefer to arrive in venice by train from mestre as i disembark at santa lucia station i can if i declutch my senses and memory fool myself into thinking that i have arrived at just another big italian railway station one more terminus amongst many one walks between the towering trains crosses the indifferent commercialism of the rather brutalist concourse and expects to find what one would find anywhere a busy road or square another bustling vista of car and truck and bus a pedestrianised piazza and a few taxis at best instead spreading beyond the sweep of steps and the scatter of people the grand canal light green choppy water the churning wakes of vaporetti launches water taxis and work boats reflected light slicing off the waves to dance along the façades of palazzos and churches spires domes and invertedcone chimneys ranged against a sky of cobalt shine or against milky clouds their mirrored pastel tones softening the restless waters of the canal or against dark veils of rain cloud the canal flattened and subdued under a downpour the first time i visited the place was for the carnival in february i discovered mist and fog and quietness and a chill in the air that seemed to rise from the water like a promise my name was mark cavan my languages were mandarin english hindustani spanish arabic russian and french the berlin wall was already history though still mostly standing it was your world some way down the grand canal on its west bank sits an imposing nearcubical palazzo its walls are a glacial white the shutters shielding its many windows matt black this severely formal and symmetrical building is the palazzo chirezzia once the home of a levantine prince later that of a cardinal of the roman catholic church then for a hundred and fifty years an infamous brothel it belonged then as now to professore loscelles a gentleman who knew about and was sympathetic to the concern back then he simply made himself his money and connections useful to us and equally gained much through the association he has since risen to join the ruling central council though on that cold february morning twenty years ago this was still an ambition of his i had been invited to the city and the carnival as a reward for my services which had lately been energetic if not onerous there were no other transitionaries present though there was a gaggle of concern apparatchiks and officials all of whom were polite to me despite the rather generous amount of blood i had on my hands even then i was still not yet used to the idea that people who knew of my role within lexpédience might find my presence intimidating alarming or even frightening professore loscelles is a modest figure of a man verging on short though with a stately bearing which belies this he is one of those who grow in isolation alone one might swear he is as tall as oneself in a small group he seems to shrink by comparison and in a crowd he disappears entirely he was balding then losing thin brown hair like seaweed dropping back from a rock with a receding tide he has a splendid hook of a nose prominent teeth and eyes of a frostylooking blue his wife was dramatically taller than him a statuesque calabrian blonde with a large honestlooking face and a ready laugh it was she giacinta who taught me the dances which would be required at the series of balls to which we had been invited happily i am a quick learner and apparently i move well the palace contained a ballroom where one of the great masked balls of that years carnival was to be held this took place the day after i arrived i was appropriately entranced by the fabulous masks and costumes and by the sumptuous decor of the ballroom itself a hymn of ancient polished woods glossy marble and extravagantly giltframed mirrors all lit entirely with candles imparting a distinct mellowness to the light and a smoky scent to the air like incense it mingled with the odour of perfumes and the smoke from cigarettes and cigars the men were peacocks the women whirling dazzling belles in glittering gowns a small orchestra in antique dress filled the space with melody three enormous chandeliers of red glass oversaw it all great swirling abstract shapes looking like vast surges of glistening blood caught in the act of spinning within an unseen whirlpool but were reduced to mere pendulous sculptures reflecting candle flames their bulbs unnecessary and unlit breathless gripping a glass of tokaj i stepped out onto a little terrace bounded by fat white marble balustrades shaped like tears a small crowd of partygoers stood quietly watching snow descend against the lights of the few passing boats and the lightflecked buildings on the canals far side the spiralling chaos of flakes appeared from the darkness overhead as though created by the lanterns of the palazzo and disappeared silently into the oily blackness of the gently moving waters before it i went out early the next morning into that cold encasing whiteness my breath spreading into the dark narrow spaces in front of me and found some untrodden stretches on the sestiere dorsoduro i strolled the ancient hidden stones breathing in the cool clear salty scent of the place and soaking up the worlds fragre it tasted of course of all the things that all the other worlds taste of but the identifying highlights spoke of a kind of seductive cruelty an orchidaceous venality so infinitely sweet it could only be redolent of corruption and decay here in the eternally sinking city with that odour of glamourous savagery filtering through my mind like mist off the lagoon into a room it all felt spent here but only paused elsewhere like something waiting to resume the snow lay across the city for the next few days creating a starkness beneath those seawide skies draining colour from the passing clouds water and buildings and promoting the views of that city of canaletto and fractious colour to a ravishing monochrome the final ball was held in the doges palace in a vast and splendid room built half a millennium ago to house two thousand milling princes merchants ambassadors captains and dignitaries an airstream originating in africa had pushed up over the heel of italy and the adriatic melting the snow and bringing mists and fog as it collided with and was slowed by contesting winds spilling down from the mountains to the north the city seemed to submerge beneath the resulting vapours cloaking itself in veils and shrouds of moisture i met my masked woman there then i wore the costume of a medieval orthodox priest topped with a mirror mask i had danced some dances sat at the loscelles table and taken part in some slightly stilted conversations with my fellow house guests and the professore who was too interested in the details of my assignments for the health of either of us had i answered him honestly one of the nonconcern guests of the loscelles a tall pretty brunette who was a distant relation of the professore and whose lissom form had been squeezed most attractively into the garb of a renaissance lady had rather taken my eye that evening however she seemed to be equally captivated with a dashing cavaliere and so i had put any thoughts involving her to one side i took a break from the eating and drinking and dancing and talking and sought to explore what i could of the palace strolling through some of the lesser chambers being shooed out of others and finally ending up back in the hall of the great council while a dance processed like a gaudy vortex in the centre of the vast room i stood staring up at the frieze of paintings depicting the sequence of doges my gaze eventually fastening on one which appeared to be missing or at least covered by a black veil i wondered if this was some tradition of the carnival or just of this particular masked ball his name was doge marino faliero a female voice announced at my side in lightly accented english i looked round to discover that i was being addressed by a pirate captain chunkily highheeled boots brought her almost to my height her jacket hung attached like a hussars from one shoulder the rest of her uniform appeared motley arranged to look thrown together baggy breeches brassbuttoned an extravagantly frilled blouse a halfundone waistcoat worn like a bodice a tricolour sash plus beads and various chains and some sort of brass plate like a halfmoon slung around her neck which looked pale and slender her mask was black velvet misted with what looked like tiny pearls set out in spirals beneath the mask her mouth looked roseate amused a few locks of black hair escaped a crumpled cap of navy blue surmounted by a cocky burst of gaudy feathers i glanced back up at the veiled space in the succession of doges is it now he was doge for a year in the mid thirteen hundreds my informant told me her voice sounded young melodious confident hes covered up because hes in eternal disgrace he tried to make a coup to sweep away the republic and have himself declared prince but he was already doge i said she shrugged a prince or a king would have had more power doges were elected for life but with many restrictions they were not allowed to open their own mail it had first to be read by the censor too they were not allowed to conduct discussions with foreign diplomats alone a committee was required they had much power but they were also just figureheads she gestured with one hand blackgloved silver rings over leather her sword or at least a scabbard for a sword swung at her left hip i thought perhaps he was only veiled for the ball i said she shook her head in perpetuity he was condemned to damnatio memoriae and mutilated and beheaded of course of course i nodded gravely she might have stiffened a little was i talking to a local the republic took such threats to its existence seriously she said i executed a fraction of a bow smiling and tipping my head you would appear to be an authority maam hardly merely not ignorant i thank you for relieving me of some measure of my own ignorance you are welcome i nodded to the swirl of people care to dance she moved her head back a fraction as though appraising me then bowed a little further than i had why not she said and so we danced she moved with a lithe grace i sweated beneath my mask and robes and understood the wisdom of having masked balls in winter we talked over the music in the rhythm imposed by the dance may i ask your name you may she smiled slightly fell silent i see well what is your name she shook her head it is not always the done thing to ask someones name at a masked ball is it not i feel the spirit of the late doge looks down upon us and demands due reticence dont you i shook my head probably not even if i knew what you were talking about this appeared to amuse her as the soft lips parted in a smile before she said alora for a moment i thought she was telling me her name but of course it is simply an italian word nearly identical to the french alors i found her accent impossible to place perhaps we come to names later she said as we danced around each other otherwise ask what you will i insist ladies first well then what do you do sir i am a traveller and you the same indeed you travel widely very you oh extraordinarily do you travel to a purpose a series of purposes yourself always only with one and what would that be well you must guess must i oh yes let me see then your pleasure i am not she said so shallow is it shallow to seek pleasure exclusively yes i know people who would disagree so do i may i ask what youre smiling at the scorn in your voice when you mention those people well they are shallow she said this proves my point no it certainly proves something you are smiling again i am aware that my mouth is almost all you can see do you think it is all i need to see of you i would hope not she tipped her head to one side are you flirting with me sir she asked curtly im fairly sure im trying to i said how am i doing she appeared to think then moved her head sidetoside like a nod rotated ninety degrees it is too early to tell yet later the music echoing down stairwells and through chambers and corridors we stood in front of a great wallwide map of the world it looked reasonably accurate and therefore late though of course in some ways i would be the last to be able to judge we stood close both a little breathless after the last dance we still wore our masks and i still did not know her name does it all look present and correct to you sir she asked as i gazed up at the configured continents and cities we return to my ignorance i confessed geography is not my strongest subject or does it then look wrong to you she asked then seemed to drop her voice a little or too limited too limited i asked it is after all just the one world she said calmly i looked at her startled she returned her gaze to the map i recovered my composure i laughed gestured indeed a starry vault or two would not go amiss she stood still looked at the map said no more for some time i divided my attention between her and the map while various individuals couples and groups of people passed to and fro chattering and laughing then in a lull i reached out to take her gloved hand she moved away and swivelled walk with me would you she asked where to must it be to anywhere might we not just walk i think youll find that when you stop walking youll have arrived somewhere she fixed me with a stare i thought geography wasnt your strong point we collected our cloaks outside in the piazzetta and then the piazza a misty rain was falling blurring the lines of lights set high on the great squares walls between the lines of dark windows she led me north through a succession of narrow twisting calles and across small bowed bridges over dark narrow canals quickly leaving behind the scatter of people in and around san marco our steps echoing from overhanging buildings our shadows unbearably dramatic in our outbelling cloaks dancing around us like ghostly partners sometimes ahead of us sometimes behind to one side or just a pool of darkness at our feet she found a tiny bar off an illlit calle which would have been too narrow for us to walk down side by side the establishment was shady almost empty save for a couple of workmen sitting near the back nursing beers we were given slightly contemptuous glances and a diminutive blonde bar girl in jeans and a baggy jumper my companion ordered a spritz and a bottle of still water i accepted a spritz as well our hostess disappeared into a storeroom clutching a clipboard and pen we remained standing at the bar i took off my mask faced my pirate captain and smiled expectantly there i said she merely nodded made no move to remove her own mask she did take off her hat the moment might have called for a shake of the head coquettish or not but she just let her long black curled hair fall about her shoulders without ceremony the workman facing us glanced up nodded to his fellow who turned both eyed her for a few moments she put her head back and glugged half the bottle of water in one go exposed throat moving she wiped her mouth with a couple of fingers then sipped delicately on her spritz back to ladylike dim though the bar was the angle of a light above the gallery of bottles gave me the best view id had so far of her eyes behind the almondshaped piercings in the black mask they glittered hinting at lightness pale blue or green or a delicate hazel would it be time for names yet i asked she shook her head i could tell you mine i said like it or not she put one finger to my lips very carefully and gently her finger was warm and smelled of a dark oily perfume i hadnt even seen her take off her glove the finger pressed my lips very briefly then withdrew i might have made to kiss it equally gently but there had hardly been time she smiled do you know the word emprise she asked i sighed thought i dont believe i do it means a dangerous undertaking does it it does do you partake of dangerous undertakings sir i leant forward my gaze going to one side then the other am i partaking in one now i asked quietly she tipped her head forward not yet she murmured no more than you would usually less so you would be off duty now yes off duty i asked confused not travelling ah yes in that sense then i suppose so one of the workmen walked up and stood behind her rapping his knuckles on the bars wooden surface the blonde girl reappeared from the back room my companion seemed to be about to say something then checked herself she turned and looked at the workman behind her who had just asked the barmaid for two beers his mouth was still open the workman and the barmaid looked straight at each other then she shivered and he twitched and that was that they were changed their bodies and their faces appeared identical but were not their stance balance body language what you will that changed in an instant and almost more than id have believed possible as though every muscle in their bodies had flicked instantaneously to a completely different setting carrying their skeletons and organs with them i was still in the process of realising what had just happened when my pirate captain stepped back away from me the bar and the workman just as the barmaid grabbed at something under the bar and the workman kicked out savagely my companion folded back from the mans kick which roundhoused past and would have caught me on the thigh if i hadnt jumped away too the sword was in her hand with a noise like the wind through a fence flashing in the light as she lunged forward the workman was still turning from the momentum of his kick the swords blade seemed to slip into his neck and his own rotation opened a line across his throat in a pink spray as his booted foot finally connected with the bar his right hand started to go up to his throat as the masked girl swung one leg to knock both of his from under him he started to fall to the floor clutching his neck the barmaid brought the club up only a little too late a scything stroke from the thin sword caught her laterally across both breasts and one arm making the baggy jumper flap like wet rags as her face screwed up with pain and she thudded back against the gallery bringing bottles crashing down my pirate captain meanwhile was stamping one heavy heel into the groin of the workman who had just hit the floor shoulders first she barely glanced at him as he rolled into a ball she did glance at the other workman who was sitting where he had been all the time openmouthed she peeked over the bar where the barmaid was lying also curled up blood spreading from an arm slashed to the bone bottles and glasses still falling and crunching and settling around her i had stepped back from all this mayhem closer to the door my pirate captain glanced again at the remaining workman who looked like he was trying to decide whether to rise from the table or not i was guessing hed decide not she sheathed her sword and went to take me by one arm time to go sir i moved to take her by the arm instead and started to move with her to the door then i was hit by a sudden feeling like a kind of sideways vertigo a sensation instantly identifiable to any transitioner as slew the result of ones consciousness having been dragged into a fractionally different world nothing visible had altered and the fragre of the place seemed the same but something had effectively changed around us something small but concentrated hard and important during my field training id been particularly bad at identifying slew but it was one of those skills that had improved with experience and id never had it as strongly as now something told me that whatever it was had changed it was behind us i felt the hairs on the back of my neck start to rise my little pirate captain stiffened and jerked as though she had felt the same thing her hand darted to her sword as she began to turn the shot filled the small room in an instant ending all other sound but for ringing in the ears the flash from the table where the other workman sat seemed almost to come after the noise my pirate captain was spun round thudding into my chest she started to go limp as i went to hold her i tried to grasp the pommel of her sword glancing at the man who had shot her the workman who had been sitting in the back all this time carried himself quite differently now he held a small flatlooking gun and was rising from the table his free hand spread out to me as he shook his head hunting in packs now the dying girl in my arms muttered motherfuckers i looked down into her eyes she was a dead weight now and her sword was unreachable as the workman started towards us weakly she brought one hand up and for a moment i thought she was about to remove the mask it looked as if moving that arm and keeping her head from flopping forward was taking all her remaining strength then i saw that she held something like a tiny gun in her hand she put it under her jaw near her neck another time tem she murmured the second workman had almost reached us dont i had time to say then something clicked and hissed and a second later she went perfectly slack sagging in my arms fuck the second workman said kicking the tiny device from her hand i caught the heel of his boot and swung him round and down so that he whacked into the floor even more heavily than his comrade i rolled the pirate captains body on top of him unsheathing her sword as i stood i had one foot on her bloody back so pinning him beneath her and the swords tip just breaking the skin of his wrist on the hand still clutching the gun ready to skewer him to the floorboards if necessary before he got his breath back cavan he gasped your name is mark cavan were on your side were concern the bar girl made a sound that might have been meant to be a confirmation of this the other man foetal on the floor just moaned were concern the man with the gun repeated lexpédience we were sent my little pirate captain or whoevers body she had inhabited for the evening bled to death on top of him while i thought about this perhaps inspired by such memories i squeeze the little ormolu box just so releasing a tiny white pill i swallow it with the last of my g t and promptly order another for the sport of seeing whether itll arrive in time for me to take a first sip i look down watching for more breaks in the cloud going dark as the horizon seeps to oranges and reds above the sinking sun now but the cloud is unbroken i start to slip into the transitioning trance already half disconnected from this world the steward is approaching with my gin and tonic when i feel the sneeze coming on i achoo when i open my eyes my first thought is i was in seat a that is a type of paper in europe a class of steam locomotive from midtwentiethcentury britain and as far as the white players queens rooks pawn can travel on its first move though it blocks an obvious diagonal for the queen or the queensside bishop to apply pressure on the centre of pressure yes pressure i feel pressure pressure on my knees and on each shoulder the interior of the plane is darker and it is full night the windows are all either black or closed by plastic shutters the airy spacing of first class is gone i am crammed in with ranks and rows of people mostly sleeping in slightly reclined seats a baby is crying the engines sound a little noisier and i have a lot less leg room my knees touching the tilted seat back in front i look to each side already knowing that something is wrong the pressure on my shoulders is coming from two very large tanned caucasian men one on each side of me each half a head taller than me and much broader they both have crewcuts and wear dark suits over white shirts the one on my right encloses both my wrists in one gigantic hand under his grip i am wearing handcuffs gesundheit mr dise the other one says welcome to wherever you think you are he reaches into my jacket pocket and removes the little ormolu pill case before i can do anything about it what the i splutter well take that he tells me smoothly sliding the pillbox into a shirt pocket my wrists remain crushed inside the other ones locked fist i try to lift my arms even though i would still be handcuffed to no avail i am strong but i feel like a small child gripped by an adult who the hell do you i have time to say before the one who has relieved me of my pills brings an absurdly massive fist sailing up into my face patient beyond the beginning nothing at the beginning a torrent of universes in a single timeless blink that is the mother and father of all explosions and is the opposite of an explosion destroying nothing destroying nothing but nothing but purely creating snapping into existence the first semblance of order and chaos and the very idea of time all at once this takes both the entirety of for ever and precisely no time whatsoever after the beginning all else expansion beyond expansion an explosion that does not dissipate or slow or lose energy but instead does quite the opposite bursting out for evermore with increasing power intensity complexity and scope we were taught to envisage it close your eyes we were told and we did i lie here eyes closed listening to the sounds of the clinic a clank of pans a patient in a distant room coughing the tinny gabble of the radio at the nurses station down the echoing hall and i think back to that day and that lecture hall my eyes closed along with those of everybody else in the class listening imagining trying to learn attempting to see from far enough away it would look like a sphere like a world with a troubled everchanging and expanding surface or a vast growing star within the limits of our understanding it was simply the idea of roundness in as many dimensions as you fooled yourself into thinking you could imagine this is the true universe the universe of universes the absolute beyondwhichthereisnothing foundation of all utterly ungraspable of course though if you had envisaged it as above you had in a sense already transcended it because youd thought of looking at it from outside when there is and could be no outside which could be seen as a victory of sorts though the idea of clutching at straws always came to my mind when that was suggested some things mean too much to matter this was the exemplar of that for any sort of usable meaning you had to look closer at the surface of that unstoppably burgeoning immensity keep your eyes closed envisage this our tutor told us we sat in a lecture theatre in the speditionary faculty of the university of practical talents in the city of aspherje calbefraques our tutor had instructed us to close our eyes to remove distractions and make the envisioning easier there were a few giggles yelps and hisses as those students not taking the matter entirely seriously used the fact that those nearby had their eyes closed to tickle prod or grope our tutor sighed theatrically yes my apologies to the rest of you there may be a delay while the last percentile present mature beyond primaryschool behaviour she changed her voice became more businesslike just keep imagining that ultimate roundness she told us and think yourself closer to it imagine a surface highly complex wrinkled ridged fissured with continually growing structures like trees bushes covered in tendrils and filaments maam a male voice said already amused with itself im looking at a giant crinkly hairy ball youre looking at a punitive essay if you speak again meric be quiet another loud sigh keep looking closer she told us closer still she said sounding amused and serious both those of you with memories and imaginations beyond the insect stage may wish to invoke the idea of fractals at this point because that would help assuming that you have successfully imagined a maximally complex surface on mr merics giant hairy ball she paused for a smatter of amusement you need to keep on imagining just more of the same no matter how much further in you zoom the tiniest hair the most microscopic tendril reveals on closer inspection that it too has a surface composed of ridges and wrinkles and tree shapes and filaments and so on effectively identical to what you were looking at before you zoomed in thatll be your fractals made real that will the closer you go the deeper you look and the higher you turn your magnification the more of the same you see only the scale has changed im struggling to imagine this maam said one of the girls good if youre struggling youre still trying you havent given in keep trying youll get there and do try to keep in mind that this is not really happening just in three dimensions or even four but many more how many more maam asked one of the boys a lot just a lot maam yes for now just a lot she paused you might almost have called it a hesitation this is one reason that extremely wise intelligent and knowledgeable people like myself bother to teach unutterably ignorant and callow people like yourselves when we could be happily feetup in front of a big log fire reading a book or talking urbanely amongst ourselves about the latest exciting idea or faculty gossip there is despite all the many many appearances to the contrary just a sliver of a chance that one of the better minds in this class might answer one of the questions that no one of my generation despite the aforesaid wisdom intelligence et cetera or any previous generation has been able to answer definitively like why is calbefraques unique why is a transitioned soul unique where is everybody where did septus come from originally and precisely how does it work that sort of question a few people quietly went ooo yes do let it go to your heads she said drily youre not here to learn how to memorise stuff youre here to learn how to think a few voices chorused you could hear the smile in her voice well memorised she said then raised her voice of course if youre really smart youll be imagining all this complexity that youre looking at zooming out to meet you as you zoom in to meet it the surface growing explosively exponentially all the time excuse me maam i was already imagining that and i imagine your handwritten essay on oh the history of fractal theory will contain spelling mistakes meric in fact probably the closer i look the more ill find aw maam aw maam nothing fifteen hundred words on my desk by tomorrow morning what do we say meric we say thank you mrs mulverhill just so adrian scotland is wet and dreary dont let anybody tell you different even the hills are mostly just big mounds not proper mountains like the alps or the rockies people will tell you its all romantic and rugged but ive yet to see the evidence even when its nice its covered in a cloud of these bastard little insects called midges so you have to stay inside anyway plus its full of scots case rested i endured the week we spent in glen furquart or whatever it was called thats what i did i endured it i did not enjoy it even the shooting was a bit shit i dont know why but i thought wed be shooting rifles at deer or moose or highland cattle or something but no it was shotguns at birds shotguns like we were in a fucking guy ritchie movie or something they were very nice shotguns with scrolling or whatever and engravings and stuff and they were heirlooms and blah blah blah but still just shotguns shooters for the hard of aiming and we were shooting them at birds lots and lots of birds pheasants if theres a stupider bird on the fucking planet i wouldnt like to see it pig shit would get an honours degree by comparison when we were driving up there we saw a pheasant standing on the grass on our side of the road halfway up a long straight on the a few hundred metres ahead of us there was this long stream of cars heading the other way towards us just coming level with the bird suddenly the pheasant ran across the road almost like it was aiming for the front car we were all convinced the silly fucker was going to get hit miraculously it didnt maybe the driver braked though he couldnt brake hard not with that line of traffic behind him but anyway the bird got across to the other side with about a millimetre to spare when it skidded to a stop on the grass verge on the far side you could see it get rocked sideways with the slipstream of the car passing then once the first car had whooshed past it the stupid fucker of a bird changed its mind and started running back across the road in the direction it had just come the third or fourth car in the big line of traffic hit it full on and the thing exploded in a cloud of feathers everybody just drove on obviously but i mean how stupid can you get anyway they breed them just to shoot them which also seems a bit shit though whether they do the same with the deer too i dont know cant imagine the deer are as stupid as pheasants though id taken plenty of coke with me for the week but i was actually trying to pull barney off it i was wanting to get well in with mr noyce senior and being his boys dealer maybe wasnt the best longterm position to be in barney wasnt a cunt but he was a bit of a fuckwit know what i mean sooner or later hed have used my dealing him stuff against me threaten to tell his dad on me basically i couldnt be having that i had plans mr noyce was part of them barney wasnt we drank well i was letting mr n teach me about wine and i did develop a taste for single malts properly watered so at least something good comes out of scotland we ate well too not too much pheasant thank god the house was a sort of fake castle a victorian take on what they thought the scots ought to have been building with decent plumbing and nononsense central heating i was definitely with the victorians there once again i hadnt brought lysanne the girl friend along shed have hated it all that rain and no shops dulcima barneys girl hated it too but i think she just wanted to keep close to barney at the time i thought it was cos he might be having second thoughts about her and his eyes had started roving again but later i decided she just liked that he always had lots of drugs and never asked her to help pay for them dizzy bint even tried it on with me once in the back of a land rover coming back from a shoot can you believe it hand on me tackle through me moleskin plus fours or whatever theyre called and whispered did i want her to come to my room that night after barney had conked out her wearing a pair of waders and nothing else i mean shes a gorgeous girl and id certainly had thoughts about her and my cock definitely liked the idea this was towards the end of the week and it was getting to know my palm like the back of my hand know what i mean but fuck me really dangerous ground too dangerous a complication i devoutly didnt need i told her i thought she was the most humpable thing id seen all year and if i wasnt such a good friend of barneys she took it pretty well all told maybe just after a bit of reassurance that she was still lusciously fuckable some girls are like that long week but worth it we escaped eventually back down the long long road to civilisation id got on extremely well with mr n id dropped a hint that i was looking to take on a proper job something serious like what mr n did nothing too obvious but still a hint next time i saw mr and mrs noyce i took lysanne we went up to his familys place in lincolnshire on the coast near alford the place was called dunstley but they called it dunstable because it was right on the edge of the sea standing at the end of a road on a sort of sandy cliff above a wavewashed beach they were on their third garden fence because the other two had disappeared into the north sea during storms and the garden had shrunk by twothirds nearly ninety feet according to mr noyce in the last forty years this time barney and dulcima werent there other things to do so it looked like id made it to friend not just friend of son en route to protégé with a bit of luck excuse my french mr n thought lysanne was a laugh which was a relief i could see her weighing him up soon as we arrived and could almost spot the point at dinner on the first night when she looked from him to mrs n and realised that there was no opening there for her to exploit that was a relief too no play that a girl like her could have made for a guy like him could have lasted longer than a night but she could have messed things up for me mrs n exchanged a look with me over coffee that made me think shed had pretty much the same feeling re lysanne as id had the house was young compared to spetley hall edwardian built at the turn of the last century whitewashed brick and painted wood compared with mossy stone and polished panel great big saltstreaked draughty windows instead of tiny little leaded draughty windows very light by comparison full of morning sunshine coming in from the sea and sparkling its all about confidence mr n told me we were standing in the garden after dinner looking at the latest fence while the waves breaking on the beach below glowed in the last of the evening night lysanne and mrs n were further down the garden i could hear lysanne shrieking with laughter at something mrs n had said mr n was slurring his words just a little and at first i thought hed said conference but actually it was confidence what like a trick i asked edward laughed maybe a little harsh but maybe confidence is what keeps the whole show on the road you need confidence faith even to keep putting one foot in front of the other arguably if you just stopped the whole edifice would collapse he glanced at me its also about value but theres the rub what is value value is what people think it is a thing is worth what somebody will pay for it but then somebody pays what everybody thinks is an outrageous price for something a price everybody knows is idiotic and yet if they can offload it for even more to somebody else then it really was worth at least what they paid for it wasnt it the profit is the proof though of course if they get caught with it when it becomes horribly clear that it wasnt worth anything like what they paid then they were wrong and everybody who knew they were wrong gets proved right he sipped his whisky the difficult thing is to spot reliably whos right and whos wrong by buying in before a stock gets too expensive and get out before it becomes clear its actually like somebody in a cartoon whos just walked over the edge of a cliff and only doesnt fall because they havent realised yet you know like tom and jerry id been thinking road runner myself but i knew what he meant we both watched the waves for a moment is that the invisible hand holding them up then i asked mr n laughed again the invisible hand well thats just an article of faith thats another myth like were a twentyfourhour society no were not the markets arent they close at teatime every day in whatever city theyre in theres nothing between new york and sydney and theyre shut the whole of the weekend and holidays just as well too or id never get any time off what do you think of the whisky i shook my head frowned im not sure its quite sweet and a bit peaty i sort of want to say an islay but i dont think it is could be a talisker that i havent had before but im still thinking about it i shrugged and looked bashful leave it with me mr n grinned and nodded looking almost proud of me this uncertainty was all bollocks by the way it was a highland park from the orkney islands i knew cos even though mr n had poured it while i wasnt looking id spotted the bottle on the sideboard with the dribbly bits running back down the inside when hed handed it to me so i knew but i needed to go through the charade to make it look good didnt i it is a confidence trick edward said staring out to sea again all banks are technically insolvent and all plcs are oneway bets or they bloody should be if you handle them right if they work you keep the profits and if they dont you close them down and the money they owe to other companies or other people is just left hanging you dont go bankrupt not if youve arranged things right shareholder director md thats what the limited bit of public limited company means you see limited liability not the same as a partnership or being a name at lloyds he waved his arm at the waves spilling a little of the whisky there had been quite a few g ts and bottles of wine before the whiskies really i said i wasnt sure this sounded right i guess i must have looked dubious there you are you see edward said a civilian a very naive person might think that if a group of people got together borrowed a lot of money to start a business ordered lots of plant and equipment and raw materials without paying for them and then made a complete mess of it and lost everything they would somehow still owe all that money but they dont if what they started was a plc then the company becomes a sort of honorary person do you see it owes the money not them if it goes under then it goes into administration and its assets are sold off and if those dont cover what was owed then thats too bad as long as they stayed within the letter of the law throughout you cant touch the directors or the shareholders the moneys just gone of course if its all a great success then hurrah all shall have prizes see what i mean oneway bet jesus edward youre starting to sound like a commie rightwing marxist adrian mr n said briskly he nodded once still staring out to sea as a matter of fact i did flirt with socialism in my youth that when you were at university was it he smiled yes university but then i saw how much more comfortable life could be as one of the exploiters rather than one of the exploited plus i decided that if the proles were so stupid as to let themselves be exploited who was i to stand in their way he smiled at me his sparse sandy hair ruffled by the wind so i went over to the dark side cheers he drank i laughed that must make barney luke skywalker he shook his head im afraid i dont know star trek well enough to say who hed be not doctor spock thats for sure i almost didnt correct him but it was such an obvious one he might say it to somebody else who would and then id look like i was being what do you call it obsequious or something so i said youre getting your stars tangled and explained yes well he said airily waving his glass again he turned to me and which side are you on adrian im on me own side mr n always have been always will be he looked like he was studying me for a moment best side to be on he nodded and drained his glass ensemble it began with dr seolas plyte the good doctor was asleep in the withdrawing room off his study in the speditionary faculty of the university of practical talents in aspherje when it happened his favourite mistress still lying on top of him on the chaise longue in a haze of postcoital torpor jerked once exactly as she might have had she too been in the act of falling asleep she reached down took him purposefully in her arms and before he could properly wake they were both gone ms pum jésusdottir was hiking in the himalayan hills when they came for her a longlaggard world this one where the indian subcontinent had barely begun its slow crash into asia here the highest point in the himalayas was treecovered and less than thirteen hundred metres above sea level she was walking alone along a recently blazed trail beneath tall plane trees dripping from a recent shower stepping from side to side of the track to avoid the stream of water that it carried reflecting that if you made a path in an environment of high precipitation without also making ditches then really you just made a stream bed when she saw the girl sitting hunched hugging her knees staring ahead a short way up the path she couldnt have been more than thirteen or fourteen one of the native tribal girls dressed conservatively ankle to neck in a black caftanne her hair gathered in a net fingers glittering with rings the girl didnt look at the older woman as she approached she just sat staring straight ahead across the path from a few metres away jésusdottir could see that the girl was shaking and had been crying hello she said the girl looked at her sniffing but did not reply ms jésusdottir tried hindic the girls expression changed she rose standing unfolding herself and smiled at the older woman who only then felt the first pang of fear in her gut oh ms jésusdottir i have some bad news brashley krijk disappeared from his yacht while cruising in the eastern middlearthean off chandax on the isle of girit der graf heurtzloftbeiderkern heard somebody come into the opera box behind him he assumed it was one of his sons returning they had both left earlier to indulge their cigar habit in the corridor outside and to flirt with any young ladies they happened to encounter whoever it was they slipped in while the coloratura soprano was just launching into her final and most heartrending solo but for that he might have looked round commandante odil obliq peril of the orient as an admiring enemy had once described her was dancing with her new lover the admiral of her ekranoplan assault squadron in the moonlit ruins of new quezon while a blindfolded orchestra did their best to outvoice the howler orangs that were ululating from the tumbled stones and twisted metal frames of the most recently destroyed buildings across the plaza from which the wreckage had been cleared by chain gangs of defeated royalists came a waiter carrying a tray with their champagne and cocaine they stopped dancing both smiling at the fat old eunuch waddling towards them with the tray commandante he wheezed admiral thank you obliq said she picked the silver straw from the tray at the ends of her long ebony fingers her nails were painted in swirling green camouflage as a joke she handed the straw to the admiral after you we shall never sleep the admiral sighed bending slightly to the tray and the first two lines of powder glowing white in the moonlight she handed the straw to the commandante who had taken the opportunity to sip some of the champagne then the admirals expression changed she gripped obliqs hand and said theres something wrong obliq stiffened her hand dropping the silver straw and going to her holstered pistol her earpiece crackled commandante her adc radioed his voice desperate the eunuch waiter hissed twisted his hand under the tray so that it began to fall taking the champagne flutes and the rest of the cocaine with it while the pistol revealed underneath pointed straight at the commandante obliq had already started to drop going limp in the admirals arms and falling as though in a faint but it meant only that the chest shot the eunuch had aimed at her became a head shot the admiral stared on blankly as the first shot was followed by two more before the nearest guards finally woke up and started shooting the assassination teams sent after mrs mulverhill could find no recent trace of her anywhere the transitionary when i wake i am in some pain and tied to a chair altogether this is not a satisfactory turn of events i underwent some training to cover such situations and know enough to wake slowly without one would hope giving any sign of having woken this is the theory in practice i have never been convinced that this is really possible if youre unconscious youre unconscious so by no means in full control of what your body is doing and if youre unconscious youre probably unconscious for a good reason like some gorilla in a suit smacking you so hard in the face that your nose seems to be broken you cannot breathe normally you have bled copiously down your naked chest two of your front teeth feel loose and the whole forward portion of your face feels swollen and suffused with bruised blood i am hanging forward in the seat as far as my bonds will allow my chin nearly on my chest my gaze falling naturally on my own lap im naked my thighs are bloodstained brightly lit i become more fully aware wallowing my way to consciousness like a nearly waterlogged lump of wood rising slowly to the surface of a cold and sluggish stream i have taken the most immediate and rudimentary stock of the situation and am just starting carefully without giving any outward signs of movement to flex the appropriate muscle groups to test precisely how tightly i am tied to the chair when a male voice says dont bother temudjin we can tell youre awake and dont waste your time testing the wires and the chair either youre not going anywhere we know what youre doing because it was us who taught you to do it i think briefly about this my captors seem to know exactly how i am trained to react in such a situation and they appear to be claiming that they are my own people or at least that they helped to train me the individual addressing me is probably not of firstrank education i bring my head up stare into the darkness between a pair of lights pointed at me from a couple of metres away and say with all the fluency i can muster it was we who taught you to do it im expecting a what or a huh but he just pauses and then says whatever the point is well know what youre trying to do at every stage youll save us both a lot of time and yourself some pain if you drop the tradecraft stuff an ominous phrase at every stage of what is the obvious question i can see nothing beyond the lights as well as the two to each side of straight ahead there are two more i can see one level with each shoulder and from the shadows beneath my chair i guess there are another two behind me i am encircled with brightness the voice talking to me is male and i do not recognise it it might be that of the wideshouldered man who talked to me on the aircraft but i dont know his voice is coming from directly behind me i think listening to it i get the impression that i am in a large room i dont seem to be able to smell anything except my own blood a sharp metallic scent the fragre of the place the information from that extra sense that people like myself have indicates a world i have not visited before and a place which feels confused somehow full of clashing competing historical and cultural sensations i check my languages english nothing else that is unprecedented i do not have even the language of my home or my base reality in the house in the trees on the ridge looking out over the town with the casino where my original self wanders round the place deadeyed and monosyllabic now i feel fear at every stage of this interrogation the mans voice says as though in reply to my earlier thought interrogation i repeat even to my own ears it sounds as though i have a heavy cold i try to snort back some of the blood blocking my nose but succeed only in producing a sensation akin to somebody having just stuck a large metal spike in the centre of my face interrogation the man confirms to determine what you know or what you think you know to discover who is controlling you or who you think is controlling you to find out what it is you think youre doing or what i think i think im doing i offer silence i shrug i was spotting the pattern i tell him yes he says sounding tired be clever about it give cheek be defiant and even insult the intelligence of the interrogator so that when you are put to the question your collapse will be all the more abject and your apparent degree of cooperation all the more complete as i said temudjin we did train you so we know how youll respond i let my head drop so that i am looking at my bloodstained thighs ah the infinite cowardice of the torturer i mutter what he says i did mutter very quietly i raise my head again i try to sound tired and worldweary how easy it is to be so confident and to sound so in charge when the person youre talking to is tied down utterly helpless and at your mercy none of that annoying freedom of action for the other party that might let a person fight back or just leave or speak as they want to speak rather than as they hope in their desperation and terror you want them to speak does all that make you feel good does it give you that sensation of power people always denied you in normal life so unfairly does it give you what you always missed when you were growing up did the other children bully you did your father abuse you overly strict potty training really id love to know whats your excuse what aspect of your upbringing fucked you up to the point that doing this seemed like such a promising career do tell i didnt really expect to get to the end of this speech i thought hed appear out of the shadows and start laying into me that hes done no such thing may be a very good sign or a very bad one i have no idea ive somewhat gone offpiste here oh temudjin you must have made that bit up yourself he says sounding amused my heart sinks are you trying to get beaten to a pulp he gives a snorting laugh what in your past made you such a masochist it may be time for a change of tack i sigh nod hmm i see your point serves me right for extemporising thats another thing were going to be asking you about extemporising yes ah ha i have not been entirely open with you i suppose there should be a way out of this a way that they dont know about a way that this faceless unseen interrogator doesnt know about but i think it might have been taken from me i have hardly dared to make sure until now and it has not been as immediately obvious as it would have been had i not been punched so hard in the face i put my head down again and move my tongue around in my mouth probing there is a hole in my lower left jaw where a tooth has been removed it feels gaping and very fresh that would be my last hope of escaping with a single bound gone yes the man says i suppose he saw some movement about my mouth or jaw we took that too thought we didnt know about it didnt you so did you know about it we might have he says or maybe we just found it it was a partially hollowedout tooth the space within concealed beneath a tiny hinged ceramic crown i kept one of my little transitioning pills in there an emergency dose of septus in case i ever miscounted and ran out of them or had the little ormolu box stolen or it failed to make a transition with me or i found myself in a situation like this well so much for that i lift my head up okay so what do you want to know i had been here before in a minor key i hadnt been tied to the chair with wire and the light hadnt been in my eyes but there had been a chair and a man asking me questions something had certainly gone wrong and there had been at least one death didnt you suspect suspect what that she might be one of us yes it crossed my mind i thought when did it cross your mind when we were standing in front of a map of the world in the doges palace she said something about it being just the one world and that being limiting what did you think then i thought she was one of the guests staying here somebody from the concern i just hadnt happened to bump into late arrival maybe we were back in the palazzo chirezzia the black and white palace overlooking the grand canal you didnt think to ask her this outright i could have been wrong i might have misheard or misunderstood trying to discover whether she was aware or not by just asking her would have been an unnecessary risk dont you think you were not intrigued i was very intrigued masked ball mystery woman the back alleys of venice im not sure how much more intriguing something can get why did you leave the ball with her i laughed because i thought she might want to fuck me of course there is no need for coarse language mr cavan i sat back and put my hand over my eyes oh for fucks sake i breathed i was talking to the man who had shot and killed my little pirate captain he was called ingrez and did not appear to have forgiven me for getting the better of him in the bar an hour or so earlier he wore a neat bandage over his right wrist where id punctured it with the pirate captains sword he was no longer in the workmans clothes hed changed into a black suit and grey polo neck he certainly didnt carry himself like a workman now he looked like somebody used to giving rather than taking orders he also had to be something of a specialist transitioner a real adept if he was able to take something as substantial as a gun between worlds with him few of us could do that i could just but it took a lot of effort it was his effort doing just that that had been responsible for the hit of slew id experienced a second or two before hed shot the girl he had a broad tanned openlooking face with a lot of laughter lines that looked possessed haunted by something much darker and without humour after id withdrawn the sword from his wrist and helped him to his feet there had barely been time for any explanations before two of professore loscelless larger servants had burst through the door of the bar their right hands rather ostentatiously inside their jackets they had looked like they were spoiling for a fight and seemed disappointed that they had arrived too late having instead to act as nurses to the two injured members of the team ingrez got one of them to walk us to the canal a minute away where the launch that had brought them sat idling its engine loud in the narrow spaces between the darkened buildings it sat lightless its driver wearing what looked like a pair of binoculars strapped to his head it brought ingrez and me back to the palazzo chirezzia then sped away again it kept its light on while it was on the grand canal i was asked to wait in a secondfloor bedroom there was a stout black grille over the window and the door was locked no telephone so that when i was escorted here to the professores study i was still wearing my priestly fancy dress ingrez cleared his throat were there any other points at which you thought she might be aware he asked just before you arrived i told him when she said something about not travelling about me being off duty any other points no i said she mentioned the word emprise said it means a dangerous undertaking does that mean anything to you i know the word ingrez admitted after the tiniest of hesitations what does it mean to you id never heard it before now im not sure what it should mean is it important i couldnt say but she did not try to recruit you into what i asked mystified she made you no offers not even the one i was hoping she might make mr ingrez i tried a regretful smile i might have spared myself the effort what offer would that have been i sighed the one involving she and i having sex i said quietly as one might explain something obvious to an idiot i paused for fornications sake i added ingrez just sat looking blankly at me how did you know about all this i asked him who was she what was she doing why did she want to contact me in the first place why were you trying to stop her or catch her or what he looked at me for a while longer i am unable to answer any of those questions at this moment in time he told me it didnt even sound like he was trying to keep the tone of satisfaction out of his voice madame dortolan and i walked amongst the tombs and tall cypresses crowding the walled cemetery isle of san michele in the venetian lagoon the bright blue sky was strewn with ragged clouds in the southwest already turning pale red in the lateafternoon sunset her name is mrs mulverhill she told me i sensed her turning her head to look at me as she told me this i kept my eyes on the path ahead between the rows of marble tombs and dark metal grilles she was one of my tutors i said i tried to say it as matteroffactly as i could inside i was thinking it was her something sang within me indeed madame dortolan said pausing to pick a lily from a small vase attached to the wall of one of the tombs she handed the flower to me i was about to say something grateful but she said remove the stamina would you i looked at her puzzled she pointed into the heart of the flower the stamens those bits with the orange pollen would you pinch those out for me please id do it myself but this bodys fingers are so chubby madame dortolan was inhabiting the body of a middleaged lady with bright auburn hair and a tall powerful body she wore a twopiece suit of pink with purple edging and a white silk blouse her fingers did look a little thick i reached into the bell of the flower trying to avoid the pollenladen ends madame dortolan leant in watching this intently careful she said almost whispering i removed the stamens two of my fingertips were turned orange by the operation i presented her with the flower she snipped the stem with two long fingernails and inserted the bloom into a buttonhole in her jacket mrs mulverhill has been many things in the concern she told me an unaware enabler an arrangements officer a theatrelogistics supervisor a transitionary a lecturer as you have pointed out a transitioneering theorist in the speditionary faculty itself and now suddenly a traitor no i thought she was always a traitor what is it that you think we do temudjin she asked me quietly stroking my belly with one slow and gentle hand my god i breathed is this a heavily disguised tutorial she pulled at one of the light brown hairs that grew in a fluted line beneath my belly button i drew a breath in through my teeth smacked at her hand yes she said raising one dark eyebrow do answer the question okay then i said and stroked the stroking hand we are fixers i was talking very quietly the room was bathed in shadows lit only by the embers of a neardead fire and a single candle still burning the only sounds were our voices and the soft susurration of rain on a window slanted into the ceiling we fix what is broken i said trying to paraphrase trying not to repeat what she had told me told us told all her students or stop things about to break from breaking in the first place but why she tried to smooth down the hairs on my belly why not yes but why why do this she slicked her palm with saliva and attempted to make the hairs stay flat like that because its worth doing i said because we feel its worth doing and we can act on that feeling but all else aside why is it worth doing when we are only so many and there is an infinitude of worlds she rubbed my belly as though it was a puppy and then gently smacked it because there might be an infinitude of people like us too an infinite number of concerns we just havent met them yet though the further we expand without encountering anybody else like us the less likely the chances of that being true become well thats infinity for you good she said drily and traced a circle round my belly button with one finger though you skipped a bit before that you are supposed to say that it is still worth doing some good rather than choosing to do none simply because it seems of so little significance futility is selfimposed ah so you werent asleep after all she cupped my balls very gently she began to knead them working her hand round them in a soft continuous curling motion maam you always had my full attention it had been an enjoyable if strenuous few hours here in her dacha id thought we were finished for the evening and id have guessed so did she but maybe not under her hands caress i began to feel the first stirrings once again there is a grain to the fabric of space time she said a scale on which there is no further divisible smoothness only individual irreducible quanta where reality itself seethes with a continual effervescence of submicroscopic creation and destruction i believe there to be a similarly irreducible texture to morality a scale beyond which it is senseless to proceed infinity goes in only one direction outward into more inhabited worlds more shared realities in the other direction on a reducing scale once you reach the level of an individual consciousness for all practical purposes a single human being you can usefully reduce no further it is at that level that significance lies if you do something to benefit one person that is an absolute gain and its relative insignificance in the wider scheme is irrelevant benefit two people without concomitant harm to others or a village tribe city class nation society or civilisation and the benefits are scalable arithmetic there is no excuse beyond fatalistic selfindulgence and sheer laziness for doing nothing absolutely let me do this i reached over the golden scoop of her back and slid my hand down between her legs she shifted bringing herself a little closer so that i didnt have to stretch she opened her legs a little scissoring across the crumpled bedclothes my thumb pressed lightly on the tiny dry flower of her anus while my fingers caressed her sex already half lost in its moistness and heat there you are she said sounding amused i am experiencing some benefit already she became quiet for a while moving her backside rhythmically up and down a little and pressing back against my exploring hand she brushed some hair from her face shifted up the bed to kiss me fully luxuriantly one hand behind my head cupping then settled back again her head down hair veiling her face as i worked my fingers further into her her other hand closed round my cock thumb stroking its glans side to side the question she said a little breathless now is who determines what is done and to whom on whose behalf and precisely why to what end perhaps i suggested we are working up to some sort of climax a consummation her body trembled in what might have been a silent laugh or not perhaps we are she said then caught her breath ah yes do keep doing that that was my intention who benefits she murmured perhaps more than one group does i suggested perhaps those producing the benefit for those most in need also benefit why should it not be mutual that is one view she said she brought the hand not supporting her upper body the one that had been stroking me up to my mouth half cupped spit she said through her dark fringe of hair i drew more saliva into my mouth raised my head and let it dribble into her palm she brought the hand carefully down to her own mouth and did the same worked the fingers into the glistening fluid on her skin just seeing that made me harder still when id have thought i couldnt be then she set her hand around my cock once more gripping it more firmly moving her hand more forcefully now i did the same watching the sweet mounds of her buttocks shake as my fingers moved in and out of her there is another view i asked there might be she said each breath a gasp now i was impressed that she could still concentrate on speaking at all with sufficient knowledge if we were able to delve deeper into matters one should i said swallowing always explore as thoroughly as possible i cleared my throat you taught me that i did she agreed through her hanging fringe of hair i could just make out that her eyes were tightly closed we do some good she said her voice raw now her words clipped bitten off but do we do as much as we might is not some of any good we do merely collateral benefit created as we follow unwittingly at our level perhaps perhaps quite deliberately by those in possession of more knowledge and power some other and greater greater greater agenda such as who knows she said the point is that by now we might be blind to such subterfuge we trust our own forecasting techniques so fully that those in the field charged with doing the doing the dirty work blindly obey orders without a second thought even though there is no obvious immediate or even mediumterm benefit to be observed because they have come to trust that genuine good will always accrue in the fullness of time thats whats always happened and thats what theyve been taught to expect so its what they accept and what they believe thus they do less than they think but more than they know it is if i am right an astonishing trick to conjure the symptoms of zealotry from those who believe they are being merely pragmatic even utilitarian when i first saw her she was half sitting on a stone parapet one slim trousered leg extended in front of her the other drawn up beneath her rear her face and body turned to one side as she talked to one of a group of men all but surrounding her she held a glass in one hand and was in the act of laughing as she raised her other palm towards the chest of the tall man standing also laughing by her side she was slim compact and still seemed even sitting seemingly cornered her back to the drop beyond the terrace edge to dominate the company with a confident ease this was on a wide balcony of the speditionary faculty main building on the outskirts of central aspherje the view led the gaze out across the exquisitely terraced valley beneath to the forested undulations of the great park on the far side and then over the encircling outer reaches of the city hazily indistinct in the low evening rays to the misty foothills guarding the still snowbright peaks of the far massif it turned out that from her dacha in the hills you could see the universitys dome of the mists on a clear day though you had to stand on the cabins roof to see over the trees i didnt know that on the evening when we first met of course then it was close to sunset the goldleafed dome shining like a second setting sun and the blond stones of the building and the multifarious skin tones of the faculty members senior students and undergraduates all appearing rouged with that silky light she wore a long jacket and a highcut top ruched but tight across her breasts like an infinite set of electron shells she was saying to one of the surrounding academics as i approached the set is still infinite but there are measurable imaginable and innumerable spaces in between that cant be occupied she grasped my hand when we were introduced mr oh she said one eyebrow flexing she wore a small white pillbox hat with an attached veil which seemed an absurd affectation though the material was white light as gauze and showed her face within it was a face of some beauty broadly triangular with large hooded eyes a proud nose dramatically flared nostrils and a small full mouth the expression was harder to read you could have believed it was one of charmingly casual cruelty or just a sort of amused indifference she was maybe half as old again as me yes i said temudjin oh i could feel myself colouring id long got used to the fact that my mongolianextraction surname could cause some amusement amongst english speakers determined to extract a toll of discomfiture from anybody whose name was not as banal or as ugly as theirs however there was something about the way she pronounced it that immediately brought a blush to my cheeks perhaps the sunset would cover my embarrassment i was no innocent had known many women despite my relative lack of years and felt perfectly comfortable in the presence of my supposed superiors but none of this appeared to matter it was frustrating to feel reduced again and so easily to such callowness the handshake was brief and firm almost more of a squeeze you must make many a partner jealous she told me i yes i said not entirely sure what she was talking about i wanted her immediately of course i did i fantasised about her outrageously over the next year and im sure i did significantly worse in my finals because i spent so many lectures distracting myself imagining all the things i wanted to do to her there draped over that lectern against that blackboard across that desk when i should have been listening to what she was telling us on the other hand i tried especially hard to impress her in tutorials with immaculately researched and devastatingly wellargued papers so maybe it balanced out been thinking about this i asked her her hand sliding up and down my cock was just starting to be less than perfectly blissful becoming too hot and dry reached any conclusion she let go raised her head blew hair from her face and said breathing hard yes i think you should fuck me now later we sat at the table she in a sheet me in my shirt sharing some food drinking water and wine ive never asked is there a mr mulverhill she shrugged im sure there is somewhere she said tearing bread from the loaf let me rephrase that are you married no she glanced up you no so you were married no she said smiling and sitting luxuriously back stretching i just like the sound of the name i poured her more wine she ran her hand fingers spread across the candle flame madame dortolan adjusted her cropped lily blossom until it lay just so on her pinkjacketed breast we paced the uneven flagstones between the gracefully looming tombs and wanly shining mausolea the parched faded flowers left lovingly to adorn vases in front of some of the sepulchres contrasted with the motley green scrub of vigorously healthy weeds pushing up between the stones mrs mulverhill has gone renegade madame dortolan told me she has lost her wits and found a cause which appears to be attempting to frustrate us she has used that famously imaginative mind of hers to concoct a lunatic theory so deranged that we cannot even grasp exactly what it is but at any rate she thinks we take a wrong course or some such idiocy and opposes us it is irritating and ties up resources we could employ to more actively beneficial effect elsewhere but so far she has done little real damage she glanced at me that might change obviously should she grow more aggressive through frustration or recruit any others to her cause do you think thats what she was trying to do with me probably madame dortolan stopped and we faced each other why do you think she would approach you particularly she smiled not entirely unconvincingly why has she singled me out i asked she just looked at me and raised her eyebrows has she approached other people i asked her if she has were they all transitioners madame dortolan looked up at the sky hands behind her back i imagined the chubby fingers clasped awkwardly tight it may not be in your best interest to know the answers to those questions she said smoothly we would simply like to know if there is any special reason she may have had to choose to approach you perhaps she finds me attractive i suggested smiling it was if nothing else a more sincere smile than madame dortolans she leaned closer a swirl of breeze brought a hint of her perfume to my nose something flowery but cloying do you mean she said sexually or just attracted to my sunny character in general or attractive in the sense that she thought you one of those more likely to go over to her cause madame dortolan suggested smile gone now head tipped to one side evaluating her expression was not unkind but it was intent i cant imagine why she would have thought that i said drawing myself up in her heels madame do was as tall as me i would not expect or appreciate to be under any sort of suspicion just because that lady chose to approach me you cant think why she did no for all i know shes working her way through whatever group shes chosen alphabetically madame dortolan looked to be about to say something then didnt she snorted and turned we resumed walking for a while nothing was said a jet stroked a double strand of white across the sky ploughing heaven you are one of the first she told me as we approached the landing stage where the palazzo chirezzias launch waited we think she is targeting transitioners alone we have people and techniques able to predict her movements and we have we believe been able to prevent her doing any real mischief so far we shall need the full cooperation of all concerned to propagate that fortunate trend onwards into the future as im sure you are entirely able to appreciate of course i said i left a pause then said if the ladys cause is so arcane and her threat so trifling why is it necessary to oppose her with such force she stopped suddenly and we turned facing each other our eyes never truly flash of course we are not the luminously grotesque inhabitants of the deep sea well i certainly wasnt i wouldnt vouch for madame dortolan however evolution has left us primed to notice when somebodys eyes widen suddenly showing more white due to surprise fear or anger madame dortolans eyes flashed mr oh she said she opposes us therefore she must be opposed in return we cannot let such dissent go unchallenged it would look weak you could try ignoring her i suggested that might look more confident stronger even an expression crossed her face that might have been exasperation then she smiled briefly and patted my arm as we resumed walking i dare say i could tell you more of the ladys corrupting theories and you would be both more horrified at her and more understanding of our position she told me with what sounded like forced amusement her accusations are more alarming and damaging than it is necessary to reveal but centre as far as we can gather on the whole course and purpose of the concerns activities she fantasises some vast ulterior motive in all we do and so takes issue with us existentially such madness absolutely requires treatment we cannot let it pass her charges against us must be defended her argument broken she flashed this time a smile you must trust us as your superiors those with a broader more knowledgeable and encompassing view to do the right thing in this she was watching me as we walked i smiled at her where would we be i asked if we did not trust our superiors her eyes might have narrowed a tiny fraction then she smiled in return and looked away very well she said sounding like somebody who had just made her mind up about something there may be another debriefing there was not you may be under moderately enhanced surveillance for a short time it was occasionally highly intrusive enhanced surveillance and it lasted a long time a couple of years at least your career which we are happy to note has already met with some success precocious success in the eyes of some of my more conservative colleagues though i hope we may dismiss their opinions is still at its beginning i hope and would expect that this incident has not harmed it in any way it would be such a tragedy if it did it was harmed i harmed it still i became the best and most used of my peers we reached the jetty coming out of the shadow of the islands encircling walls madame dortolan accepted the hand of the boatman as he helped her into the launch we sat down in the open rear well of the launch we hope that our trust in you is both wellfounded and reciprocated she said smiling entirely maam i said this was a lie as the boat gunned away from the isle of the dead madame dortolan detached the flower from her lapel they say these things are unlucky outside of a cemetery she said and let the gelded blossom fall into the restless waters of the lagoon patient we change things for the better we would hope obviously what would be the point of trying to change things for the worse we do what we can we do all that we can we do our very very best i cannot see how anyone could disagree and yet still we encounter disagreement people take issue with us our views and prescriptions are not accepted as being definitive and correct and desirable by certain people this has to be regarded as their right and yet it does seem also to be their conceit perhaps even their indulgence i suppose we have to take these things and these people and their views into account we are not however obliged to indulge them we work to make the many worlds better there thats the official line the saying goes that aspherje would be a great city even without the university of practical talents but then so would the upt without aspherje to me coming from the background i came from it looked like a crunched piledtogether collection of several dozen cathedrals all domes spires elongated windows and flying buttresses with the great central dome extravagantly clothed in gold leaf so that even in dull weather it seemed to shine like something not entirely of that or any other world plonked on the rough summit of the whole chaotic frozen storm of brick stone concrete and clad steel like a gloriously irrelevant yet sublimely triumphant afterthought there we learned our trade first though we had to learn ourselves discover where the motherlode of our talent truly lay the transitionary office had developed its techniques for detecting likely candidates for training at the upt over many centuries and one of the talents that it found most useful was that of rapidly and reliably identifying those with any sort of talent that might prove of subsequent use to itself so spotters as they were generally called travelled amongst the many worlds looking for those who might be recruited to the cause a few could take themselves there the vast majority could not the most widespread talent or at least the one that it was easiest to find was the ability to transition that is to shift oneself preferably with a high degree of willed accuracy between the many worlds it was unheard of to find somebody already doing this only the signs of a potential future proficiency were obvious to somebody attuned to such indicators not naturally occurring instances of the applied talent itself as far as we knew that came only once the subject had been trained generally in the techniques of transitioning and instructed specifically in the use of the drug septus beyond that extraordinary but in a sense basic skill the most useful additional talent was that of being able to take somebody else with you when transitioning a tandemiser could do that this meant that the ability to flit became separated from any other talent that it might have been deemed would be useful on the target world rumour had it that the ability to take another with oneself between realities had been discovered fortuitously if not perhaps entirely accidentally when a certain transitioning adept had willed the standard transitioning process while in the act of coition with their lover adept and lover both discovered themselves in the bodies of another sexually joined couple on another world entirely this was a shock obviously but allegedly not so great a one as to prevent the couple from being able to return successfully to their home world or complete the act they had been engaged in nor was this pioneering transitionary shy about exploring the possibility that they alone had caused the event rather than it being a function of the specific combination of qualities embodied by that specific first couple further gossip insists that it was some time before our adventurous virtuoso informed the transitionary office of this innovation the individual concerned claiming that they wanted to ensure this novel ability was not the result of some freak oneoff stroke of luck they had carried out further research and established that the ability was controllable and the process both repeatable and probably transmissible a teachable skill rather than a unique and freakish abnormality allegedly that same adept discovered how to bring an act of sexual congress to a fully successful conclusion in one world and then transition to another world to experience the whole thing again in some versions with or without their partner in the first world most strands of these rumours hold that it was madame dortolan who discovered this ability and that she did so some two hundred years ago thereafter using the influence and power that the discovery of this innovation provided her with both to fulfil her ambition of being elevated to the central council of the transitionary office and to gain the particular privilege the central council granted its most distinguished and illustrious members that of being allowed to skip back a generation or two every now and again when ones original or presently occupied frame grew old so that reemplaced in a succession of younger bodies one might never grow truly old or save by violent chance die it is said that for those perverse souls for whom the prospect of travelling throughout an infinitude of worlds is somehow not incentive enough to undergo the training that the transitionary office requires the rather more base promise of serial sexual transitioning makes all the difference even if the practice is both frowned on and made difficult by the offices tightly controlled monopoly of septus equally for those for whom power stretching across unnumbered realities is not enough effective immortality helps provide an extra spur to aspire to a place on the central council subsequent research has revealed that for most people capable of the technique it is not necessary to penetrate or be penetrated a tight hug over as much of the body as possible with a minimal amount of skintoskin contact preferably about the head or neck is all thats required a few blessed individuals need only encircle or nearly encircle both wrists or just one and an even tinier number need only hold the other persons hand foreseers are those who can see into the future though usually only for a brief moment as they transit from one world to another and hazily it is a highly limited skill the least well understood of those we know about and the least reliable and consistent of those of interest to us but it is the most highly prized nevertheless for its rarity apart from anything else trackers may or may not be a specialised form of foreseer the foreseers claim this the trackers deny it trackers are those who are able to follow individuals or more unusually specific events or trends between the worlds they are spies essentially a semisecret police force that the transitionary office uses to keep its transitionaries under some sort of control that the trackers services are required to the degree that they undeniably are is due to a quality of character shared by most transitionaries the people who turn out to be capable of flitting amongst the many worlds are almost without exception selfish selfcentred individuals and individualists people who think rather highly of themselves and exhibit or at least possess a degree of scorn for their fellow humans people who think that the rules and limitations that apply to everybody else dont or shouldnt apply to them they are people who already feel that they live in a different world to everybody else in other words as a specialist from the upts applied psychology department expressed it to me once such individuals are some lopsided distance along the selfless selfish spectrum and clustered close to the latter hardsolipsism end clearly if left to their own devices such rampant egoists might misuse their skills and abilities to pursue their own agendas of selfglorification and selfaggrandisement such individuals need to be controlled and to be controlled they need to be watched and that is what trackers do they spy on and help to police the transitioners trackers and transitionaries are as a result kept as far apart from each other as possible to prevent them concocting their own little conspiracies or drawing up plans of benefit to them but not to lexpédience and its aims as a result the general demeanour of the transitionary office the university of practical talents the speditionary faculty and the concern itself their own collective fragre if you like is one of some watchfulness a degree of suspicion and outright paranoia both unfounded and entirely justified an entire department the department of shared ideals exists to attempt to ameliorate this unfortunate and if only at a low level debilitating effect and investigate further how it might be both treated and prevented the departments success however might be fairly if sadly judged by the fact that the overwhelming preponderance of those it ventures to assist in the course of its duties are absolutely convinced that it is itself simply another part of the whole rigidly proscriptive controlling apparatus whose baleful influence it is supposedly there to mitigate there is a smattering of other categories of skills all of them essentially negative in their effects blockers who by their presence usually they have to be touching can prevent a transitioner from flitting exorcisers who can cast a transitioner out of their target mind inhibitors who can frustrate the abilities of the trackers envisionaries who can see albeit indistinctly into other realities without going there and randomisers whose skills are almost too wayward to categorise fully but who can often adversely influence the abilities of other adepts around them randomisers are severely restricted in what they are allowed to do where they are allowed to go and who they are permitted to meet rumours exist to the effect that some of them are imprisoned for life or even disposed of transitioners tandemisers trackers foreseers blockers exorcisers and the rest are in effect the frontline troops of lexpédience it does have proper troops too the speditionary guard rarely mobilised and never in the thousandyear history of the concern yet used thank fate they are outnumbered ten or more to one by the backup grades of support staff who provide all the logistical and intelligence services they need and who plan oversee record and analyse their activities bureaucrats basically and as loved for their activities as bureaucrats everywhere these days lexpédience also has its own transitioneering research facilities controversially as far as the upt is concerned its speditionary faculty believing that it ought to hold a monopoly regarding such matters the central council has made noises about the wasteful duplication of effort involved but seems unwilling to act to resolve the issue either because it believes the competition might be fruitful plausible if unprovable the redundancy a safety feature safeguarding against what has never been made clear or because it was madame dortolans idea in the first place and it provides her and the central council with the ability to pursue avenues of transitioneering research as they see fit without having to appeal to and wait on the approval of the notoriously staid and conservative professors and other members of the research council senate of the speditionary faculty itself adrian cubbish adrian cubbish i told her i grinned call me ac why are you cool i was impressed usually i have to make the acairconditioning thing clear myself this was a clever one course i am doll course you are she agreed looking like she wasnt sure she agreed but still smiling she was tall and blonde though her face had a hint of asian about it that made the tall blonde part look odd and meant it was hard to be sure how old she was id have said about my age but wouldnt have wanted to swear to it she wore a black suit and a pink blouse and carried herself like somebody who was even more of a stunner than she actually was know what i mean confidence ive always liked that so youre connie sequorin connie sequorin pleased to meet you sequorin sounded like sequoia which is those big trees in california and she was tall or there was that cs gas they use in northern ireland but i thought better of saying anything clever ones need careful handling and usually its better to say nothing and stay silent and mysterious than try to make jokes that probably wont impress them probably heard it all before anyway good to meet you connie ed mr noyce said you wanted a word did he she looked a bit surprised she glanced over to him we were at the housewarming party for eds new gaff a loft conversion in limehouse with views upriver hed sold the house on the coast in lincolnshire after another bit of garden fell into the sea still got a tidy price from some arab he vaguely knew who never even bothered to go and see it some sort of investment or tax dodge or whatever the loft was tidy all tall ceilings white walls and black beams and timber walls on the outside like a yachts deck with stanchions and cables round the balconies smallfortune territory the area was still getting gentrified but you could smell the smart money moving in this would have been midnineties now i suppose i was working in eds brokerage firm which was a private company these days rather than a partnership this made sound business sense according to the lawyers the boy barney had been living on a farm in wales for the last year with some hippies or something but had recently turned up in goa and was running a bar that his dad had helped him buy bit of a disappointment really but at least hed tamed the coke habit seemingly i was almost clean myself just took the occasional toot on special occasions and had stopped dealing entirely healthier id clocked that the real currency involved in making money out of money is knowledge info the more people you knew involved in a business and the more you knew of what they knew the better informed you were and the better the judgements you could make about when to buy and when to sell that was all there was to it really though thats a bit like saying all there is to maths is numbers still enough complications involved to be going on with thanks mr noyce speaks very highly of you connie told me something about the way she said this made me think she wasnt my age at all but a lot older confusing does he thats nice i moved round her a bit as though making room for somebody passing nearby but really getting her to turn more fully into the light no she really did look quite young what do you do yourself connie im a recruitment consultant i laughed youre a headhunter i glanced over at ed if you like she looked over at mr n too oh im not trying to entice you away from mr noyces firm youre not i said thats a pity isnt it it is she asked youre not happy there she had an accent that was hard to pin down maybe middle european but spent some time in the states perfectly happy connie though mr n and me think the same way i glanced over at him again he knows if i got a much better offer from somebody else id be a fool not to take it i looked back at her i did that glance thing where you sort of flick your gaze over a woman certainly as far as their tits if not their waist too quick to really take in anything you havent already seen through peripheral vision but enough to let them know youre whats the best way of putting it alive to their charms shall we say without actually ogling them like a classless wanker know what i mean no i just meant we could all do with a bit of enticement now and again dont you think connie i should explain that lysanne was history by now the barmy scouse bint had stormed out once too often and id changed the locks on her she was back in liverpool running a tanning salon i was playing the field as they say which meant i was seeing a few girls at a time on my terms plenty of sex no commitments fucking holy grail isnt it she smiled well then maybe i can entice you to meet a client of mine she handed me a card whats it in connection with they would have to explain that themselves she glanced at her watch i have to go she reached out and touched my arm it was good to meet you adrian call me and off she fucked i asked mr n some people that i know adrian he told me he was standing under a really bright light his whitesand hair shining like a halo theyve been helpful to me in the past im on a consultancy for them i hold myself ready to help them if and when they need it they rarely do apart from some very trivial matters frankly so far ive been able to hand everything over to my secretary to deal with he smiled i frowned what sort of people ed people its very useful and lucrative to know adrian he said patiently they italian i asked or american or italianamerican i was already thinking mafia or cia or something he laughed lightly oh i dont think so do you know so i know theyve been very helpful and generous and have asked for next to nothing in return im quite certain theyre not criminals or a threat to the state or anything have they asked you to talk to them ive to call connie well perhaps you should there was a minor fuss at the door ed glanced over ah the minister fresh off channel four news excuse me adrian he went over to greet him i think i was supposed to think about it but i called her moby right then hello connie adrian we were just talking of course all right ill see your client whens good well possibly this saturday if thats good for you yeah all right there was a slight hesitation you have the whole day free could do would i need it pretty much yes and your passport i thought about this i had a date on saturday night with a girl who owned a lingerie shop in deepest chelsea a proper sloan and a lingerie shop i mean fuck i watched mr n gladhanding the minister for transport yeah why not i said okay let me call you back which was how i found myself at a cold rainy retford airport in essex two days later on the saturday morning and then in a proper executive jet heading out across the channel pointing due east as far as i could tell connie had met me at the airport dressed the same apart from a purple blouse but she wasnt saying where we were heading she had a bundle of newspapers with her and seemed determined to read them all even the foreignlanguage ones and didnt want to talk after i stopped checking out the luxury fittings i started to get bored so i had to read too id dozed off i only woke when we touched down the plane slowing along a bumpy runway with a lot of weeds at the edges flat country with lots of bare trees which looked like they were ready for winter a bit early i checked my watch four hours in the air where the fuck were we the place looked deserted there was a passenger terminal in the distance but it looked rundown and abandoned concrete all stained a couple of big dark hangars even further away streaked with rust the air here was a bit less chilly than in essex and smelled of grass or trees or something no customs or other officials about just a big militarylooking tanker truck which started refuelling the plane immediately and a long black saloon both the vehicles looked eastern european to me and the two guys dealing with the fuelling sounded russian or something not that i got much of a chance to listen to them as we were shown straight into the limo and it tore off across the runway and out through a halfcollapsed boundary fence in a cloud of dust so where are we connie you have to guess she told me not looking up from the newspaper shed brought from the plane i give in where the hell are we i put just a little edge into my voice set your watch forward two hours she told me seriously i said seriously she said nodding at my wrist two hours i gave her a look but she wasnt paying attention i left my watch alone i checked my mobile no reception not even emergency numbers fucking marvellous there was a partition between us and the driver he looked old wornlooking uniform open shirt no cap connie lifted up what looked like one of those very early mobile phones with a separate handset and looked at a dial on its top surface then she put it back on the floor of the limo and went back to the newspaper we sped down this weedy highway no other traffic at all there was what looked like a big town or a small city off to one side we turned towards it hurtling along a fourlane road still with no other traffic the buildings looked pale blocky very fifties or sixties and all the same i caught a glimpse of what might have been a helicopter low over the horizon it was a bit stuffy in the car there was a big chrome rocker switch by the window that looked like it might lower the glass i tried pressing it didnt work dont bother connie said she clicked another switch on her side and spoke to the driver via a grille id thought was for ventilation again sounded like russian the drivers voice crackled back at her and i could see him gesticulating as he looked at us in his rearview mirror the car wove from side to side a bit as he did this which would have been even more alarming than it was if there had been anything else on the road connie shrugged the airconditioning is not working she told me and went back to her paper the filters are okay window on your side work no she said not looking up from her paper i bent forward studying the sun roof i wouldnt bother she said i looked out at the deserted city whistling past long tall lines of identical apartment blocks all abandoned connie where are we she looked over the paper at me she said nothing is this fucking chernobyl i asked her pripyat she said and started reading again i reached over and pushed the front of her paper down she glared at my hand holding the newspaper whatehat pripyat she said she nodded the city near chernobyl what the fuck are you doing bringing me here i actually felt quite angry no wonder we couldnt open the windows to all that dusty air the big mobilephone whatsit would be a geiger counter i guessed its where my client would like to see you why they have their reasons im sure she said smoothly is it one of these fucking oligarchs or something connie appeared to think about this no she said we came up to a big shed of a building that looked like it had been a supermarket once a wide metal door rolled partway up and the car drove straight in we got out inside this brightly lit loading area that held a couple of other cars and a small militarylooking truck with big wheels and lots of ground clearance the air was cool a couple of very large bald guys in shiny suits greeted us with nods and walked us up some steps through a couple of those transparent plasticcurtain doorways between the two plastic curtains there was a bit with a big circular grating in the ceiling and another in the floor a blast of air was roaring out of the overhead grating and down into the one beneath our feet then we went down a hushed woodpanelled softcarpeted corridor to a door which opened with a sucking noise there was a very big plush office inside all bright lights and potted plants and desks and comfy leather sofas one whole wall was a giant photo of a tropical beach with palm trees shining sand and blue sky and ocean a very pretty roundfaced girl with a bit too much makeup smiled from behind a desk with a couple of computer monitors and said something in russian or whatever connie fired something back and we sat down on two of the plush leather couches facing each other across a glass table covered in the sort of magazines you only seem to see in posh hotel rooms before i had time to get bored there was a buzzing noise from the receptionists desk she said something to connie who nodded at the wall of beach photo there was a door in it that had been concealed until now it was opening all by itself mrs mulverhill will see you now she told me ensemble a man bursts into a booklined room on a chaise longue theres an old man lying underneath a younger woman they both look groggy and confused lyingkneeling on the chaise the man who has just burst in hesitates because the old man looks like the person he is supposed to kill but he seems vacant like a husk or something and when the old guys gaze meets his the man who has just broken into his private study and caught him mostly naked in flagrante with his mistress the old fellow doesnt seem outraged ashamed or embarrassed he just stares up blinking at the younger man and looks confused the young woman straddling the older man is staring fascinated but unconcerned at the gun he is holding the younger man remembers what he is supposed to be doing and shoots them both in the head twice they found the woman sitting against a tree just off the hill path she was humming and making little chains of flowers three of them held her while the fourth garrotted her she offered no resistance and they knew something was wrong there followed some debate regarding how much they ought to tell the people who had hired them the body washed up on the beach near chandax was patently still smiling despite having been nibbled by various aquatic fauna a small crowd was gathering on the morningcool sand a man standing at the back looked at the expression on the body and frowned hed known it had been too easy on the yacht the night before he thought about lying to his superiors the woman whod sunk a razorchisel between two of the grafs vertebrae conscientiously reported that her target had stopped humming along with the aria a moment or two before shed struck though she was adamant that she had been so silent and so mindful as shed entered the box of giveaway drafts not to mention careful of where her shadow might fall and her reflections might lie that he could not possibly have realised she was there it was agreed that the admiral had been staring ahead rather blankly in the instant before she was shot despite the fact her lover had just been cruelly cut down in front of her under pressure the team agreed that perhaps the admiral had been transitioned just before her death under further pressure they agreed to consider the possibility that so had the commandante the assassination teams still could find no trace of mrs mulverhill the transitionary i set some chips down on a green square changed my mind and pushed them over to blue i sat back as the last few gamblers placed their own bets and the croupier looked expectantly impatiently around he announced no more bets and spun the wheel it whirled glittering forever if banally like a ferris wheel from a funfair through its whirring gilt spokes i saw the woman approaching the table the ball inside the wheel clacked and rattled around the vertical spinning cage of spokes battering off the blurred edges like a fly trapped in a bottle the woman girl moved with an easy swinging step almost like a dance she was very tall and slim dressed in flowing grey and wore a small hat with an attached grey veil i thought of mrs mulverhill immediately though the woman was too tall and seemed to move differently not that that meant anything at all of course veils were just about still common enough at the time for her not to look out of place wearing one though she still attracted some looks it was spring here in the southern hemisphere of calbefraques perhaps five years had passed since that night in venice when my little pirate captain had tried to talk to me and had died for it i had been asked perhaps twice a year at first later once a year or so by my concern superiors if any other attempt had been made to recruit me to whatever paranoid cause mrs mulverhill espoused i had been able to answer honestly that no neither she nor anybody else had tried to do so i had by now become a trusted agent of the concern spending a slim majority of my time in other worlds doing whatever was asked of me it was mostly the very banal stuff the delivering of objects the couriering of people not that i was especially good at that the pointed conversations the leaving of pamphlets or computer files the tiny usually mundane interventions made in a hundred different lives i had since made only one other intervention as dramatically salvationary as the one with the young doctor in the street when the building fell down i was sent to one of the topmost floors of a tall building in a manhattan to buttonhole a young man who was about to step into a lift he was a physicist and the world was a fairly laggard reality so engaging him in a conversation featuring an idea or two that he and anybody else there for that matter had never heard of was not difficult this stopped him from entering the lift which promptly plunged twenty storeys and killed everyone aboard there were two other occasions when i was asked to take rather more violent action once in a sword fight in a sort of unevenly early victorian greater indonesian reality leaping in to defend a great poet and hack off the limbs of a couple of his attackers and once when i transitioned straight into the mind of a very brilliant very handsome but very headstrong young chemist who had made powerful enemies in a zimbabwean united africa i became him for just the few seconds required to turn aim and fire his duelling pistol blowing his much more experienced opponents brains out before exiting again my handlers were most impressed i got the impression that ever since the affair in the venetian bar they had had me marked out as a natural thug i did ask not to have to do too much of that kind of bloodsport stuff in future but i was also quietly proud to have acquitted myself so well still every now and again i was asked and i obliged meanwhile i had been learning i knew more about the history and organisation of the concern now and had studied it the way it studied other worlds mrs mulverhill id learned through rumour rather than any official channel was the latest of the very small number of concern officers who had gone bad mad or native over the centuries she had somehow evaded the network of spotters and trackers and foreseers who were supposed to guard against this sort of thing and might even have had her own supply of septus the transitioning drug though this probably just indicated that she had access to a stockpile shed somehow built up while still in the fold as it were rather than a way of making it from scratch she was regarded as a strange remote almost mythical figure and given her patent irrelevance and powerlessness one to be pitied rather than reviled though of course one was supposed to report immediately any contact with anybody who might be operating in a manner similar to that of lexpédience but who was doing so outwith its control and oversight and that would certainly cover her and her behaviour i was in any case still not sure my little pirate captain really had been her the woman in grey in the flesse casino came up to the table and stood watching the play the ball clicked and clacked inside the slowing wheel and settled into its trap when the wheel finally swung to a stop gold i comforted myself that my first instinct putting the chips on green had been no more prescient than my later change of mind favouring blue the game went on she refused a seat when one came free i tried to see her face but the grey veil hid it effectively she turned and left ten minutes later disappearing into the crowd i lost fairly steadily then won moderately and finished a fraction down over the evening i tested the air in the outside bar on the terrace under the trees by the side of the river the town centre a buzz of music and traffic under the lights on the far side it was warm enough under the hissing table heaters i had met some people i knew and sat with them for a drink the greyveiled woman was standing by the stone wall a couple of tables away looking out over the river at one point i was fairly sure she turned and looked at me as i talked with my friends then she turned slowly away again i excused myself and went up to her excuse me i said she looked at me she put the veil up over the front of the little hat it was a pleasant unremarkable face sir temudjin oh i said pleased to meet you i put out my hand she took it in one greygloved hand and i am pleased to meet you i hesitated waiting on a name then said would you care to join me and my friends she looked over at our table thank you much talk all very congenial she said her name was joll and that she was a civilian not part of the concern an architect making a submission to the local authorities in the town in a couple of days the evening drifted on people drifted away finally only we two were left we had got on terribly well and shared a bottle of wine i invited her to see the town from my house on the ridge and she accepted with a smile she stood on the terrace of the house gazing at the lights i put my hand on the smooth grey surface covering the small of her back and she turned to me setting her drink down on the balustrade and removing her hat and veil entirely we repaired to bed with the lights out at her request we had fucked once and she was still holding me in her arms and inside her when she took me suddenly i was sitting at the corner of another gaming table in a different casino she was in the next chair just round the corner of the table from me so that we could talk easily the game was under way the wheel in this version was horizontal sunk into the tables surface it was spun by what looked like the top of a giant golden tap the only colours on the table appeared to be red and black though the baize was green hmm i said my companion was looking much more glamorous and more heavily madeup than she had been though the face was not dissimilar better cheekbones maybe her hair was blonde where she had been auburn she wore a lot of jewellery i appeared to be heavier than i was used to being nice black suit though i went to smooth my hair down and discovered i didnt have any there was a polished cigarette case lying by my icefilled drinks glass and an ashtray that would account for the gurgling feeling in my chest when i breathed and the slight but insistent craving for tobacco i looked at myself in the reflective metal of the cigarette case not a prepossessing figure of a man my languages were french arabic english german hindi portuguese and latin a smattering of greek this is ah interesting i told her best i could do she said you did say you were a civilian i reminded her a little reproachfully she flashed me a look so a lie then the last time somebody else had couriered me taking me on a transition i was not controlling had been back in upt when i was still being trained that had been over ten years earlier what she had just done was impolite at least though i suspected this was beside the point have we met before i asked it was time to place bets we had some plastic chips in front of us she had more than me we both chose nearby numbers most recently here she said quietly this world or as good as venezia italia five years ago we discussed restrictions on power and the penalties associated with trying to evade them ah yes that didnt end too well for you really did it have you been shot yet tem i looked at her yet hurts she said the way the shock of it spreads through your body from the point of impact waves in a fluid fascinating her eyes narrowed fractionally as she watched the horizontal wheel spin its centre glittering but painful i looked round some more the casino was gaudy overlit expensively tasteless and full of mostly slim and beautiful women accompanying mostly fat and ugly men the fragre was not so much of too much money as of too intense a degree of concentration of it in too few places its not uncommon id thought id recognised it can you remember your very last words i asked from that earlier occasion what she said brows furrowing attractively you want to check its really me really who i never said so say now she leaned right in to me as though sharing some intimacy her perfume was intense musklike unless im much mistaken i said some other time tem or another time tem something like that youre not sure she frowned i was in the process of dying in your arms at the time perhaps you didnt notice anyway hence i was a little distracted however the interception team might have heard me use those words more to the point before my violent but dashing end i used the term emprise only you heard that which was true i recalled though i had told the debriefing team from the questionary office this fact as well so that didnt really prove anything either and so you are mrs mulverhill she nodded forward as we were asked to bet again i hadnt even noticed wed lost the last gamble good to see you again she added had you guessed soon as i saw you coming really how sweet she glanced at a thin glittering watch on her honeytanned wrist anyway we dont have for ever you must be wondering why im so keen to talk to you again not just the sex then wonderful though it was obviously uhhuh consider any latent male insecurity dealt with carry on briefly madame theodora dortolan is a threat to more than just the good name and reputation of the concern she with her several accomplices on the central council of the transitionary office will lead us all to disaster and ruin she is a threat to the very existence of lexpédience or even worse if she is not and instead represents all that it most truly stands for proves beyond any doubt reasonable or otherwise by her past actions and present intentions that lexpédience itself is a force for evil that must be resisted contended with brought down and if its possible replaced but in any case reduced entirely levelled regardless of what may or may not come after it in addition there may well be a secret agenda known only to the central council and perhaps not even to all on it which we or at least you and your colleagues given that i am not one of you any longer are unwittingly helping to carry out this secret agenda has to stay secret because it is something that people would reject utterly perhaps violently if they knew about it i thought about this is that all its enough to be going on with wouldnt you say i was being sarcastic i know i was seeing your sarcasm and raising you deadpan literalness she nodded forward time to bet again we both placed more chips have you any proof of any of this none youd accept nothing that would convince you empirically i turned to her and what was it that convinced you mrs m one instant youre a lecturer bit truculent bit misfit but a star of common room and lecture hall and marked for greatness according to the rumours the next youre some sort of bandit queen an outlaw wanted everywhere wanted everywhere she agreed beneath a flexed brow unwelcome throughout so what happened she hesitated gaze flicking restlessly across the table for a few moments you really want to know well i thought i did why am i going to regret asking another uncharacteristic hesitation she sighed tossed a chip to a nearby square on the table and sat back i placed some chips on another part of the table she kept looking at the table while she talked quietly i had to sit closer to hear her hunched over the giant ball that was my borrowed belly there is a facility at a place called esemier she said i was never privileged with the exact world coordinates i was always tandemed there by somebody with impeccable security clearance its on a large island covered in trees on a big lake or inland freshwater sea wherever it is its where madame dortolan used to carry out research and test some of her theories especially on those transitioners with an abnormal twist to their talents both the official line and what you might call the top layer of rumour have it that its gone now the remaining research decentralised distributed but esemier is where the important programmes started maybe where theyre still going on one day i might go back there find out ive never heard of it that would please her go on as you say i was seen as promising a future highflyer madame dortolan likes to have such people on her side or at least brought before her so that she can test them evaluate them while they think theyre the ones doing the evaluating i was invited to take part in a programme investigating amongst other things the possibility of involuntary transitioning the theoretical possibility that changes in the structure of an adepts mind might let them flit without septus or at least without a specific preenabling dose i thought that was completely impossible well quite and if you ever ascend to the clearance levels that allow you access to the results of the research im talking about youll learn it was this programme thats credited with determining that and did it after a fashion it was more thorough and wideranging than just that though the full programme was aimed at establishing what randomisers were capable of removing the myths and superstitions associated with their weirdshit powers and giving the field a proper scientific grounding but septusfree transitioning was the pinnacle the platinumstandard goal we were never likely to achieve but should never quite lose sight of either what did it involve torture she said fixing her gaze on me for a moment in time it involved torture she looked back at the gaming table as the chips wed placed were raked away she reached out placed another on the same square i placed some of mine nearby the randomisers ranged from the cretinous through the educationally subnormal and the socially awkward to the odd disturbed genius initially it was harmless we were convinced we were helping these misfit people and it was fascinating enthralling it was a privilege to be spending a vacation researching something that was almost certainly impossible but which would be simply astounding if it proved to be a viable technique the sort of breakthrough that resounds across the many worlds and down the centuries the kind of achievement that means your name is known for evermore even if it proved to be an entirely mythical talent as we suspected we were finding out lots of stuff it was the single most exciting time of my life when the autumn came and i was supposed to resume work at upt i volunteered to take a years special leave so that i could stay on at the facility and keep working on the problem madame do herself smoothed away any problems the faculty might have offered for most people that was when i disappeared she looked at me im sorry i never did say goodbye to you not properly i thought i would see you at the start of the new term then well im sorry she looked away again quite i had no intention of telling her how much i had missed her throughout all these years or that i had felt at the time as though my heart had been broken or that i became a different person thereafter and became so specifically because of that abrupt abandonment turning from a prospective career in academia or research to the training required to become a transitionary an operative an agent eventually an assassin it would only have sounded maudlin and what good would it have done i think she continued theodora mistook my fascination with the theoretical side of the research for outright zeal a shared passion she glanced at me and a smile soon gone flickered across her face she stared at the chip on the table again it was scraped away too and she replaced it with another it was during that year after the people whod just been there for the vacation had gone back to their studies that we started to make real progress just the hard core were left we had our own septus techs on the staff seconded from wherever they actually formulate the stuff experts in its manufacture use and side effects that was a privilege in itself you never get to meet these people did you know there are trace elements put into septus to make transitioners easier to track she glanced at me long enough to see my eyes widen trackers would have a much more difficult job if those trace elements werent present they would have to rely on something like pure instinct as it is with the elements there in every standard dose of septus its as though they see a puff of smoke left behind where somebody has just transitioned and can follow a faint line of that discharge to the next embodiment seriously i asked absolutely seriously mrs mulverhill nodded slowly still staring at the gaming table and madame dortolan was absolutely serious about what we were doing too she spent a lot of time at the facility directing our research guiding our enquiries even helping to refine some of the abstract speculative stuff i spent a few evenings doing nothing but talk with her about transitioning theory she has quite a fine mind for a psychopath at the time i didnt know that was possible however she was overenthusiastic wanting what she did so much she took risks cut corners overextended herself she let transitioners and trackers and septus chemists get together properly for the first time in centuries and some of us learned things we were never supposed to know like the traceelements thing like the traceelements thing she nodded again i think she assumed my hunger to know was directed solely at the problem in hand finding out what the randomisers were really capable of and grasping after septusfree flitting i dont think it occurred to her that i might just have a general urge to find out all i could about everything especially whatever was being kept purposefully hidden more of our chips had disappeared some people left the table to be replaced by others mrs m put another chip on the same square i placed mine on the square next to hers the randomisers were troublesome socially inept highly neurotic riddled with problems and often medically challenged continence seemed to be a particular problem it was possible to grow to despise them certainly to dismiss them to forget their humanity one began to feel that they kept their secrets locked away inside them deliberately just to spite us we were encouraged never to fraternise to treat them as experimental subjects in the name of objectivity they were broken mostly useless people a threat to themselves as well as society we were doing them a favour almost ennobling them by containing their awkward undisciplined powers and giving them a purpose making them a part of a programme which would benefit everybody we began to stress them it was quite easy to do they were like uncooperative children wilful perverse often knowingly obstructive sometimes aggressive stressing them severely rationing their food and water depriving them of sleep giving them impossible puzzles while they were forced to listen to painfully intense noise felt like a necessary discipline like a sort of small collateral punishment they had already asked for yet at the same time it seemed perfectly excusable because it was for research for science for progress and the good of all and we werent enjoying it in fact we suffered maybe as much as they did because we knew more fully what we were doing they were something like brutes while we were properly functioning human beings educated cultured sensitive only the best could be asked to do the worst as madame dortolan liked to say when i went to theodora with some misgivings after watching what was basically a torture session when a man strapped to a bed was injected with a mixture of psychotropic drugs and corrosive chemicals she told me about the menace we were all facing shed convinced herself that the concern and every world it could reach was under some terrible threat from outside that there was some diabolic force forever pressing at its boundaries wherever they were supposed to be and we had to prepare ourselves for onslaught i pressed as much as i thought i could get away with to get her to be more specific but whether she was talking about a sort of anticoncern some equally worldsspanning shadow organisation opposed to everything we tried to do or was hinting at space aliens or supernatural demons from unglimpsed dimensions it was impossible to tell all that mattered was that it they posed an unmitigated and existential threat to the concern in that cause nothing was too great a sacrifice and no action was inexcusable our inescapable duty and solemn obligation was to explore without stint absolutely everything that might help us prevail when our time of testing came entirely regardless of any petty and irrelevant qualms we might feel we could not afford to indulge our own squeamishness we had to be brave she talked to me for a long time during that hour or so i calmed down i relaxed a little and i realised that i no longer felt quite so distressed i accepted a handkerchief from her and dried my tears i took a few deep breaths i nodded at what she said i clutched at her hand when she offered it to me and i hugged her when that seemed like the right thing to do i thanked her for listening and for suggesting that i take the rest of the day off which i did i did all this and i felt relieved in that way because id realised she was mad and that soon this would all be over or at least my part in it would soon be over because i had to get away from that place for my own sanity my own peace of mind and if as i suspected madame dortolan would rather have had me imprisoned or even killed than let me go from there while i might be harbouring any doubts about what was being done then at least making the attempt would bring an end to it one way or the other it hadnt occurred to me that she was more likely to turn me from one of the investigating to one of the investigated if shed caught me id have been the one in the padded cell or the strapdown bed i heard that happened to a couple of other dissenters later our chips were removed mrs m leant forward to replace hers with another almost colliding with the retreating rake removing the previous one she hesitated then she nodded at our two piles of chips shall we put them together you have more to lose i pointed out even so then certainly i used my hand as a blade pushing my small pile into hers she took all our remaining chips and stacked them onto the square she had been favouring theodora had miscalculated she continued i knew people id made friends with some of the trackers and the septus chemists taken a few as lovers some of them had misgivings too some just needed somebody to talk to some only wanted sex when i left very suddenly and without warning despite the fact that theodora was having me watched by a team of spotters and trackers brought in specially immediately after our talk it was without a trace without the traditional puff of smoke and with a plastic drum the size of my head containing a supply of untraceable septus in micropill form that will last me into my dotage or until theodora finally captures me or has me killed i even have enough to share around tem she told me glancing at me i am a bandit queen with a following these days i have my own small band of outlaws care to join i sat back took a deep breath put a hand to my bald head and smoothed my hand over my naked scalp what would i be supposed to do nothing direct yet just keep what ive said in mind keep your eyes and ears open and when youre asked to jump jump the right way is that all you could have sent a note youll remember tonight tem she said with a wintry smile ive risked a lot to come and see you like this that emprise is a signifier of both my seriousness and that of the situation and why me anyway youre theodoras golden boy arent you am i have you had to fuck her yet no i havent astonishing she must actually like you so why do you think i would act against her because i know that shes an evil old fuck and i hope that youre not what if youre wrong and youre an evil old fuck too i meant about her but either then we are lost because i am not wrong about her hmm i said in response to somebody nudging my elbow i looked round and saw a substantial pile of chips being pushed up the table towards us like an untidily clacking wave of gleaming plastic isnt that just the way she breathed and swung herself onto my lap draped herself over my paunch threw her arms around me and in the midst of a deep kiss with her legs wrapping around mine under the table we transitioned back to the dark bedroom of my house just in time for her to slip off me and me out of her she placed a single straight finger across my lips and then rose dressed and left she had left two tiny pills on my bedside cabinet they were exactly like septus micropills except that each had an almost invisibly small red dot rather than the standard blue one centred on the top surface the philosopher i met gf in the doctors surgery gf were her initials as well as being what she was she was one year below me in school i had seen her a few times in town at bus stops and in the library she was tall and skinny and had thin brown hair she always walked with her head down and shoulders hunched as though she felt she was too tall or was always looking for something on the ground she wore braces and cheap glasses and always dressed in long dark dresses and longsleeved tops even on hot days often she wore a sort of shapeless hat which looked like it had been pulled down hard over her ears her face and nose were both elongated her eyes looked quite big until she took her glasses off i had left school that spring and was in a training college even though i was now a young man i didnt know how to approach girls so i followed her home from the surgery and got up very early the next morning so that i could be waiting at her bus stop when she got the school bus when she arrived at the bus stop i said hello and left it at that burying my face in my newspaper i had intended to engage her in conversation but decided that it would be better to take things more gradually two other girls in school uniform turned up but they didnt talk to her the bus came and they got on i couldnt of course because it was a school bus and i wasnt in school any more the next two days were the weekend and i hung around places in town where id seen her before but she didnt show up at the start of the next week i went back to her bus stop this time i smiled and said hello and attempted to engage her in conversation but she was very quiet and looked embarrassed when the other two girls appeared she stopped talking altogether and stood at the far end of the bus shelter the other two girls looked at me strangely i took the next ordinary bus that came along even though it wasnt the one i needed i returned the next day undaunted i spoke to her again she wore sunglasses even though it was a dull day i thought perhaps she imagined that i would not recognise her though this was wrong the other two girls huddled together and glanced at her and giggled and sniggered one of them asked if she had walked into a door and she ran away in the direction of her home and appeared to be crying she missed the school bus which the two girls boarded she had left her school bag behind i looked in it and found school books pencils and pens and a girls magazine as well as some sweets something rattled inside her pencil sharpener which was of the type that comes contained in its own cylindrical wasteshavings bin i unscrewed it and discovered four spare blades for the sharpener though no small screwdriver with which to facilitate the replacement of one blade by another two of the spare blades had what looked like dried blood on them i kept one and replaced everything else as it had been save for a sugar cherry which i ate i remained awaiting my own bus and she reappeared i said hello again and handed her the school bag and asked if she was all right she muttered something and nodded she got on the same bus as me but sat elsewhere the next day she still wore the dark glasses she stood in the bus stop and stared at me though she ignored my attempts at polite conversation when the two other girls appeared to be joined later by another she ignored them too when the school bus came she ignored that also the driver shrugged and drove off when my bus came she got on it with me and asked to sit beside me i of course said yes and was happy at this unexpected turn of events i was beside the window she was by the aisle when the bus was moving she turned to me and hissed wheres my other blade what have you done with it where is it i was sitting so close to her and the light fell in such a way that i could see that behind the dark glasses she had bruises around her eyes and the top of her nose i had meant to study the blade that i had removed from the pencil sharpener perhaps using an old microscope i knew i still had at the back of a cupboard however there had hardly been time it had been a busy day at the college yesterday i had forgotten about an exam which was not like me and i had been involved in a fist fight with another boy this was also not a common occurrence certainly not since mum had left and id renounced her idiotic sect and taken up the true faith the tiny blade had slipped my mind until that morning id looked at it while walking to the bus stop but this had revealed nothing initially i denied all knowledge of what she was talking about but she was adamant that the blade had been present before she had left the house the morning before and she knew that i must have looked in the bag when she had left it behind and removed the blade she accused me of stealing a sugar cherry too i remember that i started to panic realising that she did indeed know what had happened and that i was guilty but then a strange calmness seemed to descend on me and i thought about what i could say that would be convincing and yet leave me relatively blameless in her eyes i told her that now i remembered the two girls had looked inside her bag and had been messing around with the stuff inside for a while and one of them must have removed it then they had found a dead mouse in the bus shelter and put it in her bag but when they had gone on their bus i had taken the dead mouse out again though i hadnt wanted to say anything because i felt bad about looking inside her bag even if it was just to search for the mouse and remove it the girls must have taken the sweet too i didnt even like sugar cherries she frowned and the bruised skin above her nose trembled i knew then that i had convinced her and i felt a sense of great relief and victory i was especially pleased with the bit about the mouse it was one of them she asked still sounding suspicious i nodded which one i said i didnt know i hadnt actually seen either of the girls take anything from her bag but nobody else had touched it so it had to be them she appeared to accept this i introduced myself she told me her name too her initials were gf i pointed out that if she was somebodys girlfriend then she had the right initials and she seemed amused at this though she did not actually laugh when she smiled she would always put her hand to her mouth to hide her braces and teeth i threw the tiny sharpener blade down a drain outside the college i started to meet her after school at a café i told her jokes and amusing things that had happened at the college she talked of pop stars and other celebrities and sometimes we listened to the music she liked sharing one earphone each she had no brothers or sisters and her mother was dead so she lived alone with her father i told her she was lucky to have no annoying siblings but she did not seem to share this view it was very hard to get her to talk about her father or her life at home at all gf first let me kiss her at a bus stop while she waited for a bus back home her braces proved less of an encumbrance than id anticipated though it still felt odd we went to a dance for young people at the town youth club and danced very close throughout the closing songs of the evening i think she could feel my erection through our clothes but far from holding back as id feared she pressed herself amorously against me later in a shop doorway we kissed very passionately and i was allowed to put my hand up her blouse to feel her bra and breasts one day on a weekend she came to my house when my family were away visiting a dying relation i had been expected to go as well but id claimed i was supposed to go on work experience that day she brought a quarterbottle of spirits with her and we got a little drunk she had also brought some of her music and so we danced in my parents lounge which felt odd this time when we danced and kissed she let me undo her bra inside her blouse and put my hands on her behind through her long skirt allowing me to cup her buttocks and tease them apart and slide my hands as deeply into the space between her legs as the skirt would allow her fingers dug into my back through my shirt and she made a cage of her fingers and clutched at my head ramming my mouth against hers do you want to fuck me she asked she looked and sounded very serious i felt extremely nervous i had meant to say nothing would give either of us greater pleasure which was a line id heard in a film but in the end i just nodded and said yes i did wheres your room she asked taking me by the hand well have to close the curtains i had kissed a few girls and one since gone away to university had put her hand into my pants and wanked me off but i was otherwise still a virgin i had hoped to see things to get to look at a girls body properly in closeup in soft sunlight or full moonlight but she wanted the curtains closed and no lights on i had a packet of condoms id stolen from my mothers bedside cabinet but she assured me there was no need for these i came very quickly the first time she wanted to be taken from behind her holding onto the headboard of my narrow bed me kneeling behind her later she took me in her mouth i thought this was a bit dirty at first but she just gave a single snorting laugh when i mentioned this i had become very hard again and could feel against the skin of my cock the braces imprisoning her teeth i began to pull out as i felt myself approaching orgasm gasping and telling her this but she kept me in her mouth and let me come there later again we made love face to face though her eyes remained tightly closed throughout her nails drew blood on my back though i only realised this later at the time the pain was not so bad and i remember thinking this was interesting she laughed at the fact that i always wanted to clean up immediately with tissues the room was dim but nowhere near fully dark and i had already noticed the various scars and burn marks distributed over a large proportion of her body even if the room had been pitch black or i had been blind i would have felt the welts of raised scar tissue on her arms and thighs and torso i had already half guessed and one or two boys i knew i would hardly call them friends but we hung around together sometimes had suggested that there was a reason she always wore long clothes and was excused gym classes and swimming lessons we had sex whenever we could my dads garden shed was probably where we did it most usually at night it was hidden from the house and it was easy to get the key from near the back door sometimes we would pretend to do things to each other with items like the saws and hammers and the heavy vice that sat clamped to the workbench we were invited to a party at the flat of some of her friends and had sex in a bedroom that had been set aside for just this activity there was a queue gf had long been in a girls organisation called the girl foresters and had risen to the rank of junior officer one time i got to fuck her while she wore the uniform of this organisation and that felt especially good i fantasised that one day she would become a police officer and i would get to fuck her while she wore that uniform one time for nearly a week we had the run of a house belonging to an old lady who she cleaned for sometimes when the old lady was in hospital we fucked until we were both sore she had bruises on her arms and the backs of her legs that i had not caused of course its my dad she said one evening lying on the floor if we did lie down to have sex we always did so on a sheet spread over a quilt on the floor she would not use the beds in the old ladys house i had asked her if the bruises came from her father i had wanted to ask her this for some months now but had never felt the time was right in all honesty i wasnt sure the time was actually right then and perhaps if id thought about it more deeply id have realised the time would perhaps never be right but i did want to know and i felt we were in a relationship of sufficient longstanding and even commitment that i deserved the prerogative of being able to enquire regarding such matters i asked whether he had always hit her long as i can remember she replied ever since mum left i said i thought her mum was dead he says she is she told me wont say where she went or where she ended up before she died if she is dead she rolled over onto her front i stroked her buttocks which were very firm and round and smooth and one of the few places on her body that she had never marked with the various implements she used to cut herself i wanted to ask her if her father had abused her in other ways if he had abused her sexually as well i had already guessed that he had but i wanted to be sure however i was worried that this might prove a rather difficult subject gf could be very nervous and highly strung and was liable when faced with a conversational subject she felt uncomfortable with or a line of questioning she objected to to burst into tears fly into a rage or storm out of a room i know what youre thinking she said as i gently caressed her behind and she pushed back the cuticle on each finger to inspect the pale moon of nail beneath before biting on the ragged edges of her fingernails i hesitated wondering if she really had guessed what i was thinking i decided with a disturbed feeling that she probably had guessed correctly however i did not say anything i kept on stroking the glossy skin of her backside it is what youre thinking about him isnt it what else he might have done to me if he does this to me thats what you want to know isnt it she said still i said nothing she continued to worry at her fingernails biting them and tearing at them she still didnt turn round to look at me well what do you think she asked i could tell from her voice exactly what i should think but i told her i didnt know what to think i said this partly to be completely sure and partly because i felt that doing so kept me in a better situation well he did she said from when i was nine there was a long pause during which she slapped my stroking hand away from her behind he still does she turned and stared back at me then with a fierce and terrible look on her face she rolled over onto her back drew her legs up and let them fall apart so that her genitals were fully revealed still moist and glistening from our last bout of lovemaking ten minutes earlier still want to fuck me now she asked her expression and tone of voice both defiant and desperate i looked at that raw wound then into her eyes i told her to stay where she was then got up and went through to the utility room where i found a clothes line i went back to the room where she lay just as id left her i asked her if she trusted me and she thought about it and then said that she did i told her to roll back onto her front which she did i brought her hands together behind her back and tied them at the wrists i could hear her crying but trying not to make too much noise about it i moved an old heavy chair into position and tied each of her feet to its two front legs so that she could not move them then brought the companion chair round in front of her and carefully raised her by the shoulders and laid her chest and head across the seat i told her that of course i still wanted to fuck her and i did so though not aggressively or hard instead i fucked her very gently and slowly until i came later i untied her and held her while she cried and i told her that she wasnt to let her father fuck her ever again but that was the wrong thing to say because she went into one of her rages and tried to slap and punch and bite me screaming that she couldnt stop him we tied each other up occasionally after that i did not enjoy being immobilised though and so we stopped i like to think that she stood up to her father and he abused her less after this time but he did not stop altogether and i always knew when he had done so either from the bruises or from the reopened cutting sites on her body i shall be completely honest and record here that i think people make too big a fuss about incest these days im sure it has always gone on however i had grown to hate mr f gfs father and this was as much about the physical damage he did to her and the physical damage that he caused her to do to herself as about the fact that he had raped her from the age of nine taken her virginity made her distrust everybody and had treated her like a sex toy rather than a person or a daughter it seemed to me that he had done something quite literally unforgivable even if gf had been inclined to forgive him i rather lost the plot with mr f i went too far i got carried away it was not so much that i had let it become personal as that it started out as nothing but personal because i knew nothing else back then i broke into their house when gf was away at a camp with the girl foresters she would be absent for a full week i crept out of our house took my bike down the lanes and dark backroads to their house and used the key that i knew lay under a particular flowerpot to let myself in i had never been to her house but i had a rough idea of the layout of the place i knew that mr f would be drunk and fast asleep that night after his weekly chamber of commerce dinner he was in the bedroom with the light still on he was lying on top of the bed face down half undressed he was a tall man gone to fat about the upper chest and belly but not as well developed as my old man id grown up and become quite strong id made myself a cosh from a pair of old socks and a load of piggybank change i whacked him on the back of the head and did it again when he started to rear up roaring he went down gurgling breath spluttering from his mouth as though he was trying to snore i gagged him with thick tape right round his head twice and tied him up then dragged him down to the cellar feet first with his head thumping off each step and tied him to the centralheating unit i made sure he was well secured and properly gagged then went up to ransack the house so that it would look like it had been a burglary gone wrong i was wearing charityshop gloves and a woollen ski mask that looked like an ordinary hat until you pulled it down on my feet i was wearing a pair of old sneakers id found hanging from a tree in the forest a couple of months earlier id padded them with socks because they were far too big for me in my rucksack id brought another pair of shoes ones my dad thought hed thrown out and which were even bigger i changed into them and walked around in them for a bit opening drawers and pulling stuff out and pulling back carpets and using a crowbar to prise up a few floorboards i went into what was obviously gfs room and treated that just the same i couldnt not even that felt oddly good when i thought i heard a muffled noise below i went back to the cellar and mr f i would have liked to have done something to him like hed done to his daughter but that would have been to leave a clue so i just used kettles of boiling water an oldfashioned blowtorch and a hammer when i used the hammer i covered his feet or his hands as appropriate with a towel so that no blood would splash on me though there wasnt actually that much probably the most blood came when i used a cheese grater on his knees he screamed through the gag so much that i had to cover his whole head in a sack and then with a bin bag just to try to shut him up i think that he suffocated because i tied the bin bag too tight i hadnt really intended to kill him not at the start not until i really got into it i think but as i worked on him i think he somehow became less human to me more just this thing that reacted in a certain way to a certain stimulus a set of workings that produced a set of noises and a set of muscular contractions and a set of blisterings and discolorations on the skin according to what i subjected him to i think also that i started to feel i had done so much damage to him that it would somehow be tidier to kill him off i dont mean that i wanted to be merciful to put him out of his misery his misery was what was interesting to me but that he was so badly compromised as a human specimen he had stopped being entirely human im not putting this very well he was all too clearly human but he was he had become less than human i would even resist the obvious conclusion that it was i who had done this to him i had the nagging perhaps illogical but quite inescapable feeling that he was doing this to himself that despite my total and absolute control over him he was still somehow responsible for his own torment im still not entirely sure why i felt this but i definitely did i think that i developed a sort of contempt for him despite the fact that i knew i had surprised him and left him with no chance of escaping or resisting me id clubbed him while he was asleep drunkenly asleep but still what chance had he had none but thats just the way things are sometimes in any event i did kill him obviously partly it was because i got distracted when i found an old car battery at the back of the cellar when i was looking for new things to use on him and i believe he expired from lack of oxygen while i was still trying to get the acid out of it i thought he might be pretending at first he was completely limp and there was no pulse in either wrist or under his jaw but you could never be sure i used pliers on his fingernails the fingers were all loose and granularfeeling because id already smashed them with the hammer but he did not react so i concluded he really was dead i tied the bin bag back round his head tied tightly reckoning that if he was dead i ought to be sure of it the thing is i had thought my heart could not have beaten harder and faster than when id been breaking into the house in the first place but id been wrong it thrashed in my chest like something wild as i tortured mr f and although i wont pretend that i was in any way professional i felt powerful and in charge and as though i had finally found something that i just naturally knew how to do what i had not done of course was actually put any questions to him i hadnt asked him whether hed raped his daughter or what he might have done with his wife id thought of it but in the end i was too frightened that my voice would betray my nervousness or hed scream loud enough to attract a neighbour i suppose i could have got him to respond to questions through simply nodding or shaking his head but that didnt really occur to me i just wanted to inflict a lot of pain on him for what he had done to gf and as the night went on i suppose yes i thought i might as well kill him even though he hadnt seen my face i hadnt spoken to him and i was fairly sure hed never be able to identify me it just seemed like the right thing to do the tidiest i unlocked the front door and put the key back under the flowerpot where i had found it the last thing i did was break the window in the spare room from the outside to make it look like id come in that way id left enough of a clear area on the carpet beneath the window for it not to be obvious this had happened after the ransacking i got home and back into bed unseen i didnt sleep the rest of the night the next day i went for a walk in the woods i took the rucksack with all the clothes id worn that night far into a dense plantation and burned it then i dug a hole nearly a metre deep and buried the ashes a business colleague of mr f found him two days later the day before gf was due back from the camp relatives came to look after her and took her away for nearly a month the police said they were looking for one or two burglars and announced that it was probably a robbery gone wrong everybody in town apart from myself slept very badly for the next few weeks i slept like a baby all i had to do to cover my tracks was keep the swagger out of my walk and the sneer from my lips i knew what i had done and felt proud and manly and in control i was even more proud that i had been able to see through to the end what i had done to mr f than i was of getting away with murder when i heard they were fingerprinting all the men in the town i went along to the police station without grumbling not one of the first to go but not reluctantly either i was never even questioned the police concluded the ghastly crime had been committed by an unknown person or unknown persons from out of town and gradually life returned to normal nevertheless what i had done had been amateurish and out of control and i had acted like policeman jailer judge jury and executioner i admit that this did seem wrong to me i had discovered something that i was good at and even in a sort of righteous but i hope not perverse way had enjoyed but this was not altogether right there have to be limits there has to be some sort of apparatus of judgement and rightful jurisdiction an oversight if you will that gives the torturer proper authority i had got away with what i had done but if i hoped to do anything like it again then i felt i could not repeat my actions i certainly was not about to start murdering people in their cellars like some seedy serial killer mr f had deserved what had happened to him and i had been the means of delivering justice to him but that was that i had to accept that through sound preparation good judgement and good luck i had succeeded in my mission and been able to walk away gf came back and stayed with one of her aunts in a towncentre hotel until the funeral i left a message and we met in our usual café she seemed distant and yet relaxed and i realised she was probably on some sort of medication she no longer wore the braces on her teeth and said that she had missed me and had stopped cutting herself for now at least i didnt go to the funeral she didnt ask me to she started at the same college i attended and got a flat with another girl i moved into a place nearby with a couple of guys gf and i started going out again and soon became intimate once more though neither of us ever again suggested any bondage games she never talked about her father but then she rarely had one day we both had time off and had gone to bed in my flat remember these she asked producing a packet of sugar cherries from her bag confiscated them from a junior forester she popped one into my mouth and another into her own we chewed on them noisily for a while i tried to remember the last time i had eaten one i used to love these i said then she sat upright in the bed and stopped chewing and looked down at me her face looking drained one of her hands stroked her other wrist and forearm where the old marks were she got out of the bed and took the sticky mess that was all that was left of the sugar cherry out of her mouth and threw it into the waste bin she started to dress i asked her what was wrong she didnt answer she just shook her head i could tell that she was crying i kept on asking her what was wrong but she would not reply and left soon afterwards we were never intimate again and she refused to engage in any proper conversation thereafter not quite ignoring me but treating me very coldly had i written this two or three years ago i would have concluded by admitting genuinely mystified that i never understood why this happened why she suddenly left me however now i think that i do know why i was betrayed by a remembered taste no i must be honest my betrayal was revealed by a remembered taste considering all that i have seen and done it is remarkable that it is this such a tiny trivial thing so many years ago before our relationship had even properly begun that brings a blush of blood to my face when i think about it and makes me feel ashamed i have done things most people would be ashamed of and watched things done i would be ashamed of yet it was for the taking of one sweet not even that perhaps for not owning up to that petty theft and the implication that it had been me who had stolen her pencilsharpener blade as well that i was condemned then and still feel soiled now i joined the army later that year and was posted abroad becoming a military policeman after much study the hardest bit was passing the psychological test they didnt really want people who had done what i had done to another human being in the force at least not then anyway but i was smart enough to know what they wanted to be told and told them what they wanted to hear knowing how that process works from the inside as it were is in itself an important part of my line of work so even then i was learning and adding to my skill set patient most worlds are closed a few are open most people are not aware a few are aware an open world is one in which most people are aware and there is no need to dissemble regarding the business of flitting or transitioning between worlds where i am now lying in this bed in this clinic is a closed world a reality where possibly nobody except myself knows that the many worlds exist let alone that they are connected and that travel between them is possible this is as it should be for my purposes this is what i wanted when i came here this is my protection i opened my eyes to find the fat bald man sitting staring at me the same man with the bad skin who makes a habit of sitting beside me in the television room during my rare visits there and talking continually in his incomprehensible dialect or accent there is mist outside and the weather feels cold for the first time this year though i am still warm inside my hospital bed the fat man wears the same white and pale blue pyjamas that we all wear and a faded blue dressing gown that has seen better days he is talking to me it is midmorning and the usual midmorning cup of fruit juice is sitting on my bedside cabinet i was not aware of the orderly leaving it the fat man is talking quite animatedly to me as though he expects me to understand what hes saying actually he may be making an effort for me i get the impression he is trying to talk more slowly at least initially also his skin condition appears to have improved recently too he may be talking more slowly than usual but he seems to be compensating by talking more loudly and with greater emphasis he gestures quite a lot too and his upper body moves as he does so and i can see tiny specks of spittle arcing from his mouth to fall on the bedclothes between us i am a little worried that some of his spittle might land on my face even on my lips i might catch something i frown sit up in bed and cross my arms enabling me to put one hand up to my mouth so that it looks like i am listening or at least trying to listen to what hes saying but really im just shielding my mouth from any errant spit i frown some more as he jabbers on i put a pained expression on my face and sigh deeply generally trying to give the impression of wanting to understand what he is saying but failing he doesnt appear to be paying much attention anyway frankly just talking away in a machinegun flurry of sound within which i can barely make out one word in twenty i suppose if i concentrated i might understand more but from the little i can make out hes complaining about another patient stealing something from him or insulting him or taking his place in some queue or all three and the medical staff either being responsible in the first place or being complicit or guilty of not listening or all three and to be perfectly honest i dont care he just needs to talk to somebody preferably somebody who might be neutral regarding whatever petty nonsense this is all about and preferably i suspect somebody who is not likely to answer back or ask any pertinent questions or actually engage with him and his concerns at all hes just offloading depressingly i am the perfect choice its strange this need to talk to express ourselves even when we know or strongly suspect that the person seemingly listening isnt really or cant understand or doesnt care or couldnt do anything anyway even if all the above did not apply some of us just like the sound of our own voice and most of us need to vent sometimes to get things out to release pressure occasionally too we need to articulate vague but powerful feelings and so make them less frustratingly vague the act of expressing them itself helping to define what it is we feel in the first place i suspect the fat man just now hovers between the loveofownvoice and lettingoffsteam explanations he nods emphatically falls briefly silent and sits back hands on knees having apparently just come to some conclusive break in his oration he looks expectantly at me as though im supposed to respond i move my head in a sort of circular motion something between a nod and a shake and spread my hands he looks annoyed at this and i feel i need to say something but i dont want to attempt anything in his own language as this will just encourage him i cant let slip that i can speak languages which are quite simply not of this world vanishingly small though the chance may be that this could materially affect my security or threaten my anonymity so i decide to make up some gibberish i say something like bre trel gesem patra noch cho lisk esheldevone and nod as though for emphasis the fat man rocks back eyes wide he nods too enthusiastically and comes out with a barrage of quickfire sounds not one of which i comprehend he looks like he actually understood what i said but thats not possible bloshven braggle sna korb leysin tre epeldevein ashk i tell him when he stops to draw breath kivould padal krey tre napastravodile eshestre chroom i shrug krivin i add with a nod for emphasis for good measure he nods so hard that i expect to hear his teeth rattle he slaps his knees blah blah blah blah blah he replies not actually that one repeated nonsense filler word obviously but a stream of noise it is almost as though he does understand me this is becoming alarming i can feel myself getting rather hot i determine to say no more but he lets loose such a tirade of sound complete with wild gestures and more spitting that i feel it is impossible not to respond if nothing else at least when i am speaking he is not and so i am in no danger of being splashed with flecks of saliva lethrep stimpit kra zho ementeusis fla jun pesertefal krin tre halulavala i respond he nods again talks quickly and incomprehensibly then holds up one hand and gets up grunting disappearing into the corridor i would like to think he has gone for the day or for good but something about his last gesture holding his hand up like that leads me to believe he is going to reappear all too soon while he is away i fan my face and flap the bedclothes to cool myself down he comes back a couple of minutes later shepherding into my room another patient a skinny slackjawed fellow i recognise but have never talked to in fact hes one of those i thought didnt talk to anybody his thin worn face looks too old for his body he has lank black hair an expression of no expression and a straggly beard that never seems to grow he shows no sign of acknowledging me the fat man plonks him down in the seat he has just vacated and gibbers a stream of language at him i think i catch a word or two about listening and talking but he is talking too fast for me to be sure the younger man looks at me and in a low voice says something i do not catch the fat man standing behind him gestures expectantly at me i signal back a twohanded what motion the fat man rolls his eyes and makes a sort of circular hurrying signal with one of his hands while the other taps the younger man on the shoulder and then points at me skib ertelis byan grem shetlintibub i say to the younger man bolzaten glilt ak etherurta fisriline hulp i feel my face grow hotter still and fear that i am blushing sweat is gathering on my brow this is perfectly absurd but both men now seem rapt and i feel it is easier to go on talking even if it is utter gibberish than it is to fall silent and wait for them to reply or just burst out laughing danatre skehellis ro vleh graampt na zhire sko tre genebellis ro binitshire nasko voross amptfeniran har finally i can go on no longer and as my throat dries up i simply run out of nonsense to speak the younger man narrows his eyes and nods slowly again as though he understands this absolute rubbish he looks slowly away from me to the fat man and says something the fat man nods and makes a hand gesture that might mean i told you so the young man leans forward and says quite slowly poldi poldipol pol pol poldipolpol poldi poldi he sits back smirking well of course they are simply making fun of me i smile thinly look him in the eyes and say poldi poldi polodi plopolpopolpopilploop i expect him to smirk again or laugh but he doesnt instead he sits back as though struck his expression changes to that of somebody who has just been profoundly insulted he looks me up and down and then rises smartly to his feet angrily shrugging off the hand of the fat man who appears to be trying to placate him the fat man starts to say something sounding soothing but the young man interrupts him shouting him down in what sounds like a stream of invective the only word i can make out is the nonsense one poldi he turns imperiously spits at the floor under my bed and storms out head held high the fat man says something plaintive to him goes to the door and says something after him then gives a deep sigh shakes his head and looks in at me his expression regretful hurt and disappointed he scratches the back of his head with one chubby hand and expels another resigned sigh he says something inflected to be a question i think i am definitely not saying anything else from this point on and i just sit there glaring at him he shakes his head once more asks another similarsounding question then when i still do not reply but glare even more pointedly at him he rubs one thickfingered hand over his bald pate and stares down at the floor possibly at where the younger patient spat i doubt he will have the manners to do anything about that particular outrage i bet i shall have to wait for an orderly or the cleaners to clean it up i suppose i could do it myself but i feel the gesture was both rude and uncalledfor and i dont see why i should he mutters staring away as though talking to himself and rubs his hands together looking and sounding worried he sighs theatrically shakes his head one more time and leaves shoulders drooped still muttering he stays away this time filled with relief i reach for my thin plastic cup and the watery fruit juice as i drink it i notice that my hands are shaking the transitionary did you kill lord harmyle yes why i was ordered to by whom madame dortolan i know that not to be true lord harmyle was not on your list really must have misread it please dont affect flippancy no okay now did you have you seen the list what have you seen the list not relevant did you have orders to kill anybody else yes who dr seolas plyte ms pum jésusdottir mr brashley krijk der graf heurtzloftbeiderkern commandante odil obliq and mrs mulverhill the younger a pause i got the impression this was being written down as well as recorded the circle of lights surrounded me my questioner was still behind me unseen my information indicates that you were asked merely to forcibly transition the people you mention with the exception of lord harmyle who as already indicated we know was not on your list i was given verbal orders from madame dortolan that all those on the list were to be killed not transitioned quickly as possible verbal instructions yes in a matter of such importance yes to be confirmed in writing subsequently no i asked specifically definitely not to be confirmed in writing subsequently that would be unprecedented i take it yes i see i would like to ask a question another pause go ahead who are you we were speaking a version of english which had separate yous for singular and plural i had used the plural version we are officers of the concern the calm male voice said what did you think who do you answer to no pause were your orders delivered to you in the usual fashion yes a onetime mechanical microreader did you question your orders yes as ive said but you still accepted them including the unprecedented alleged instruction to kill individuals who according to your written orders were only to be forcibly transitioned for their own safety yes had you received orders to kill so many people before no were you aware that they were unusual orders in requiring such a such a glut of killing yes and yet you did not think to question them i did question them and in the end i did not obey them you were not able to you were captured before you could but i had be quiet plus you took it upon yourself to kill at least one more person in addition to the already significant number you falsely claim you had been instructed to kill as i be quiet i take it you were aware of the seniority of the persons you claim you were instructed to elide save for the mulverhill woman they are all on the central council of the transitionary office answer of course are all on an interesting choice of verb tense inadvertently instructive i hope and yet still you did not think to question the orders as weve established i did question them and i did not carry them out i see is there anything you would like to add i would like to know who you answer to under whose authority do you operate i would also like to know where i am a pause i think that concludes the preliminary part of our investigations the voice said there was a hint of a question in the tone and i got the impression that he had turned his head and was talking to somebody else not to me i heard another younger man speak then the voice that had been conducting the interrogation said quietly no well call that stress level zero the young mans voice came again then the older mans once more patient and instructive a teacher to a pupil well it is and it isnt absolute to the level per individual but individuals differ so zero provides headroom i was starting to sweat the man cleared his throat very well he said i heard him rise from a chair and sensed him walking towards me my heart had been beating quickly anyway now it started to beat even faster shadows twisted on the concrete floor i sensed the man behind me i heard the deep rasping tearing noise of thick sticky tape being unrolled he reached over me and put the tape over my eyes and right round my head blinding me i was breathing short and shallow my heart thrashing in my chest more tearing he put another long line of tape round across my mouth and again right round my head i had no choice but to breathe through my nose now i tried to calm myself to take fewer deeper breaths imagine that you could simply flit away i thought imagine that just by thinking you could be elsewhere yes and imagine that you are any different from any other poor helpless doomed wretch about to suffer as poor helpless doomed wretches have suffered across the many worlds and down the countless ages an infinitude of times with no escape and no choice and no hope a final brief noise of a short length of tape being ripped from a roll then torn a very short narrow piece of tape i felt him reach over me his clothed chest pressing on my naked back and sweating head the last thing i smelled was an antiseptic scent from his hand he pinched my nose with one pair of fingers wiped my skin with a paper handkerchief and stuck the tape over my nostrils smoothing it down now i could not breathe headache he has a headache he is not certain for a few moments which way up he is indeed initially he is not entirely certain what up even means pressure there is pressure on one side and not on the other this reminds him of something and he feels frightened he was lying on his left side his head was on the floor his arms lay just so his left side was taking most of his weight his left leg lay here and his right ankle and foot lay on the floor too the right knee lying supported by the left knee he supposes he ought to get up he needs to get up the people who have applied or who might apply pressure to him might be here might be in pursuit of him he cant remember why then with a feeling of some astonishment he realises that he does not know who he is he is a person a human a man a male lying here on this cool floor wood in darkness with darkness beyond his eyelids he tells his eyes to open and they do with what feels like reluctance still dark but with some light a soft grey light off to one side bars of light a sort of grating of light canted across the floor some distance away there is a faint breeze i can feel it on my exposed skin i realise that i am naked i shift rearranging my limbs i am that he he is me i am the person who woke up but i am still not sure who he is and i am i feel a sense of meness all the same i am confident and sure regarding my self now it is simply my name i am unsure about the same may be said for my history and memories but that too is not that important they will be there they will come back when they need to when they have to if the pressure is on this side then applying increased pressure reacting against that gravity replying to it should lift me up i apply that pressure and lever myself up unsteady trembling breathing hard breathing fast and shallow heart thrashing bringing on a feeling of panic and a sudden shiver the feeling passes i force myself to breathe more slowly and more deeply my arm supporting me is still trembling the floor beneath my hand feels wooden and cool the grey light spills in from the far end of a long room i turn my head as far as i can in both directions then tip it up and down then shake it this hurts but is good nothing shiny to look at my reflection in languages mandarin english hindustani spanish arabic russian and french i know that i know these but right now im not sure i could muster a word in any of them i have never had such a rough disorienting transition not even in training the light seems to increase the bars of grey laid across the floor in the distance shine they turn to silver then a pale gold i cough that hurts too this is a large room and i feel i have been here before just looking at it i feel this but the fragre of the place is familiar too i know this room this space this place i feel that of course i know it i feel that my knowing it is precisely why i am here i feel this but i do not know why i feel this or what it is i am really feeling ballroom palace a sudden rush of sensation as though dry conduits throughout my body are flooded with glittering water the palace in venezia the unique city in so many worlds and the ballroom the great space a map and a studied beguilement and the sudden flash of seamy violence leading to interrogation a chair and a certain madame i am in the palazzo chirezzia overlooking the grand canal in venice this is the ballroom quiet deserted out of season or decaying years later or decades later or centuries later or millennia for all i know i came here from who knows where as i was about to be tortured did i could i have its the last thing i remember i can still smell the antiseptic scent of his fingers i shiver again look around a great rectangular space three enormous shapes like inverted teardrops hang from the high ceiling covered in grey wrapped ghosts of chandeliers little sign of any furniture but what there is also appears to be wrapped in dust sheets the draught is on my back and legs too now i am quite naked i touch my mouth and nose look at my naked wrists unfettered using my tongue i feel for the hole in my gum where a tooth used to be there is an intact tooth instead i prise open its hinged cap with one fingernail it is empty it is empty but it is there the tooth remains as though it was never extracted in the first place something more than just my sense of self was carried over what has happened to me i raise my head and moan and then force myself slowly up from the floor going briefly on all fours and then standing staggering and swaying unsteady this cannot be i think i must still be there still suffocating in that chair this is an hallucination a waking dream or the selfdeceiving fantasy of somebody deprived of oxygen because their mouth and nose have been taped up this is not possible i stumble to the nearest tall window and scrabble ineffectually for a while before seeing and feeling how to open the shutters i barely crack them just enough to see out the grand canal stares brightly back at me grey and cool beneath what looks like an earlymorning summers sky a water taxi passes a workboat laden with bagged garbage creases down the waves in the opposite direction and is narrowly avoided by a clattering vaporetto crossing from one side of the canal to the other running lights still greasily bright in the halfdawn a few sleepy commuters sitting hunched on seats inside i bite on a knuckle until i make myself cry out with the pain of it but i do not wake up i shake my bitten hand and stare out at a place where i have no right to be and yet i am here adrian bint was wearing a veil not a muslimtype burka veil i mean an oldfashioned sort of blacklacewithspotsonit thing hanging from a tiny little hat actually the hat looked like an afterthought only there to support the veil the office was as big as the reception area lined in very fancylooking wood panelling that had silver or some other metal inlaid into it id never seen anything like it she sat behind a big desk some sort of computer screen was just sort of flattening itself out of the way and becoming part of the surface of the desk as i went in she stood up and said hello but didnt offer to shake hands she waved me to a seat on the far side of the desk she wore a sort of weirdlooking suit thing like shed been wrapped in black bandages actually looked quite tasty especially with the veil for some reason but still like shed just paced off a catwalk rather than being in a converted warehouse or whatever in the middle of one of the most poisoned places on the planet i wondered if this was some sort of radiationproof suit or something though it seemed unlikely youre adrian adrian cubbish pleased to meet you im mrs mulverhill i am glad to meet you adrian another confusing accent i supposed it was from somewhere round here ukraine russia eastern europe whatever hints of us english too we both sat down she opened her mouth to speak but i started first well mrs mulverhill i really hope youre going to tell me why im here cos otherwise this is just going to be a big waste of my time and frankly my time is quite precious to me plus i dont appreciate being brought into this place what do they call it the zone no one said anything about this know what i mean i mean technically im not here against my will cos i got on that plane of my own free will didnt i but if id been told where we were coming then maybe i wouldnt have so legally you could be on dodgy ground if i start growing a second head any time in the next few years there will be lawyers im telling you now she looked surprised at first then smiled the face behind the veil looked asian i thought maybe chinese though less flat than chinese faces usually are sort of triangular eyes too big to be chinese too cheekbones too high as well actually maybe not asian at all youd need more light or just that veil off to tell for sure you should be safe she told me the cars air is filtered and the atmosphere in here is healthier than it would be in a hospital operating theatre any dust on your clothes and shoes was removed before you entered here i nodded consider me mollified for the moment now about the why bit of me being here in the first place perhaps mr noyce has given you some idea of what we offer and what we might require he said you paid well and didnt ask for much not normally anyway that would be accurate id say okay keep going let me set out the basics adrian shouldnt you be calling me mr cubbish i said seeing as ive got to call you mrs mulverhill or would you like to tell me your first name so far this was all still too much on her terms frankly and i wanted to unsettle or even annoy her how sensible this was is another matter of course as when you think about it i was in the middle of a fencedoff nowhere where nobody with any brains wanted to be anyway a thousand or two thousand miles away from home having got on a plane and as good as disappeared as far as anybody back in the uk was concerned with no forwarding address or destination or nothing and with no reception on my moby didnt care i really was annoyed at them bringing me here even if it was eventually going to be in my own interests who did these people think they were anyway hence the remark about her calling me mr cubbish or telling me her first name no she said sounding not in the least insulted i wouldnt like to tell you my first name mrs mulverhill is what i answer to if youre uncomfortable with me calling you adrian ill happily call you mr cubbish i shrugged adrian is fine you were saying that we will pay you a retainer monthly plus an extra annual payment for your services as a consultant and for other services we may occasionally require you would be free to terminate this arrangement at any time without notice consultant me yes consulting on what general cultural economic and political matters i laughed oh yeah yes she said the veil made it hard to see what was going on with her expression mrs m i said im a trader i trade stocks i know a lot about that though probably not as much as mr noyce also i know about some computer games oh and snowboarding though im what they call an enthusiastic amateur not an expert know what i mean im not the person to consult on cultural and political matters tell me what you think about the political parties in your own country tories are toast labour are going to get back in at the next election and people like me may have to leave the country i should point out that mr n doesnt think theyre going to be so bad labour he means hes met this blair geezer and reckons theyll leave us alone to make money but im not convinced there you are the lady purred youve started work for us already course i have mrs mulverhill what were the other services you were thinking of liaison with individuals helping them out if they need help what sort of help getting them on their feet obtaining funds documents the ear of officialdom that sort of thing now it so happened that i could help with some of that stuff through contacts i had some got through dealing and some through trading but i hadnt thought that mr n would know much about that and it must have been him who recommended me to whoever this mulverhill woman worked for these would be serious capable people adrian but they would be starting out with very little when they make themselves known to you once they have a start theyll rapidly make their own way but they need that initial boost do you see are you smuggling immigrants i asked you peopletrafficking is that it not in the manner you mean i suspect these people would not be foreign nationals as your government would understand it were they to come to its attention which they almost certainly never would it is quite possible though that all youd ever be asked to do would be to provide guarantees for bank accounts references letters of recommendation that sort of thing all expenses would be repaid to you and any loans reimbursed expeditiously expeditiously i pretended to be impressed expeditiously she pretended she hadnt noticed so i said is this what mr noyce does already thats a good question fortunately mr noyce has already precleared me answering it honestly the answer is yes i could see the smile through the black veil so if its good enough for him it should be good enough for me is that the idea yes it is and of course hell be retiring in a few years i should think i should think so too mrs m tipped her head to one side more to the point so does he and what sort of sums would we be talking about here for this um consultancy and services unspecified the same as mr noyce receives eight and one half thousand united states of america dollars per calendar month paid into a bank account in your name in the cayman islands the extra annual payment would be twice that monthly amount payable at the commencement of the last month of the year and i can quit any time without notice yes and without penalty yes the monies will stop being paid thats all call it ten k a month and ill think about it that is more than mr noyce receives well if you dont tell him neither will i i said she was silent for a few moments i spread my arms thats my price mrs mulverhill very well the first payment will be delivered forthwith well mail you the account details like i say ill think about it i wanted to talk to mr n some more this was too weird to just jump in on given what i knew so far of course decide in your own time is that it i asked this had all been too easy i strongly suspected id underpriced myself thats it she said she just sat there didnt go to shake my hand or produce a contract or a letter of agreement to sign or anything our agreement to be reviewed annually i said if you like uhhuh i nodded for a bit still just sitting there i sat forward in my seat so mrs m adrian tell me who you work for the concern she said smoothly you can call us the concern adrian and who are you really were travellers what like gypsies i said with a fake smile i dont think so well maybe a little russian no no definitely no cia no some other american organisation no i took a breath this time she jumped in on me before i could speak dont bother adrian youll never guess you reckon oh im pretty certain she flashed the veiled smile again we should celebrate she said that youre thinking of joining with us would you like that where shall we go i cant imagine theres much happening in this pripyat place it is a little quiet she agreed shall we go to moscow the plane will have been refuelled by now yes i want to show you something seemingly my watch had to go forward yet another hour though i still left the rolex alone adrian mrs m said as we settled into the jets plush seats connie and i have much to talk about can you amuse yourself certainly no wait a minute what connie asked what if you keep me up past my bedtime i smiled connie looked at me i understand there are hotels in moscow what a relief i said they started talking some language i couldnt even begin to unscramble i left them to it and watched the ground slide by beneath id hoped to see chernobyl itself from a safe height obviously but didnt it was only another hours flight but by the time we arrived in moscow it was almost dark outside on the tarmac of the airport the wind felt cold enough for snow and smelled of jet fuel a big black merc was waiting this time the driver had a cap and tie and everything we went straight to a tall wire gate with a small guardhouse a uniformed customsimmigration guy took the briefest look at our passports exchanged a few words with connie s and waved us through to join chaotic traffic on a packed fourlane road my moby was happy again reconnected to civilisation i texted a couple of pals back in the big smoke to say where i was and felt happier too the novy pravda was a club housed in a newbuild block within sight of what i guessed was the red river or whatever big river it is that runs through moscow frankly i had no idea where we were in something called the central administrative okrug which was not a vast amount of help if we hadnt driven through what was obviously red square with the big disney church and stuff id only have had mrs ms word for it that we were even in moscow the club was in a big black cube of a building lots of uv and dark purple lights on the outside outlining it the air shook with muffled music valet parking front of the line two big bouncers with armpit bulges straight in greeted by some guy in a very flash suit who took mrs ms long fur coat fakekissed connie on both sides and gave me a small bow i was in what id been wearing since id got up black converse black s a purple prada shirt and a peachsoft thin black leather jacket i felt underdressed for the first time that day kliment how are you connie said as the guy kept pace with us down a broad corridor lined with mirrors and what looked like blobs of mercury running down bronze mazes behind plates of glass i am well madam kliment said sounding very russian you are well too i hope very this is mrs mulverhill my employer she told him an honour madam and this is adrian hes from london adrian welcome i love london he said smashing i said this is kliments club connie told me i looked round the sounds were getting loud and the light level dropping as we entered a big space with slowly flashing lights on the ceiling a flunky came up bowed to kliment and took mrs ms coat and connies jacket as well as my own to a coatcheck counter staffed by two astoundingly beautiful girls all high cheekbones long black hair and sultry unimpressed looks the thudding music and faster flashing lights were coming from a big fluted archway ahead tasty i said smiling at kliment he nodded appreciatively i think please he said we have your table vodka and champagne caviar and blinis we proceeded to get very drunk in our semicircular table facing a giant multilevel dance floor i danced with connie then with mrs m who had a weird allovertheplace way of dancing in her blackbandages outfit and veil yep still with the veil she got a lot of looks appreciative ones too and i could see why she danced like she could move bits that other women didnt even have connie was a lively bopper too the two of them kept turning away bottles of bubbly from distant tables connie leant over as they were opening our third bottle of salon come to the toilets well do some coke yeah by this time id drunk enough for this to seem like a good idea and for the prospect of some white stuff to have taken on a sort of sensible even medicinal quality ie if i took some itd sober me up a bit not to mention the fact that both connie and mrs m had only got even betterlooking and more devastatingly attractive as the evening had gone on and here was one of them inviting me to the loos well why not i looked from the gorgeous blondely shining connie to the shadowy mrs m connie grinned and shook her head mrs mulverhill must have overheard or guessed she waved one hand enjoy she said watching the mass of people pulse and surge around the dance floor no eyelids were batted when we entered an extremely posh ladies and commandeered a cubicle we took turns snorting from a handily placed glass ledge good gear almost uncut we stood up grinning from ear to ear at each other another dance connie suggested i leant back against the wall gave her a long look up and down we in a hurry she laughed shook her head too sordid lets away i thought she might have meant lets away to somewhere quieter but she just meant back to the dance floor and then the booth and the table where mrs m was knocking back another deepchilled vodka and looking as sober as when wed walked in she nodded at me we dance now she told me rising can i catch my breath i asked she shook her head and took my hand it was quite a sexy dance there were slow bits in the tune and she moved round me curling and uncurling and rising and falling circling about me like she was caressing my personal space im not a bad dancer many compliments received know what i mean but mrs m was something else maybe it was the booze and toot but i seriously felt i was in the presence of bopping royalty she sidled up pressing herself against me i felt the heat of her body through her blackbandage outfit and my own clothes she was half a head shorter than me she put her veiled lips close to my ear as i leant down to her adrian she said loudly just audible over the music i want to take you somewhere will you come with me i pulled back showed some amused pleased surprise and then bent to her ear really really she said then added yes thats a way of putting it which seemed unnecessary follow me to the ends of the earth mrs m i said as she took me by the hand she laughed strange noise almost like a bark her hand was very warm but perfectly dry we slunk through the press of dancing people she let go of my hand once we were clear of the dance floor and were heading for some cordonedoff steps not the loos again then another pair of bouncers nodded to down some wide spiralling steps this is called the black room apparently she said as a large door was opened for us by another wideshouldered gent this one in dark glasses fair enough it was nearly black inside from what i saw as we walked through it was a fuck club lot of humping and humpingwatching going on inaroundonover tables and big comfy seats warm it was we walked on through to the far wall and another door yet another bouncer lady this time she was much bigger and wider than me she handed mrs m a key we entered what looked like a dark hotel corridor mrs m let us into a dimly lit bedroom and closed the door behind her people come here to have sex adrian mrs mulverhill said you dont say i said from the way shed said what she just had i was already starting to guess that wasnt why we were here i felt some disappointment and just a tiny bit of nervousness still ive always had right from the first days when i started dealing a completely reliable alarm system in my head for situations that might be about to turn genuinely nasty and threatening know what i mean and so far the alarm bells hadnt gone off i do say but you and i are not here to have sex i hope you are not disappointed if that was what you were expecting devastated mrs m you are i think joking not entirely from somewhere in those bizarre clothes mrs m produced two little pills smaller than any e pills id ever seen nearer to sweeteners or something she popped one herself held the other out to me please take this what is it it is a form of lifebelt well thats a new one i shrugged popped it she watched my neck to see me swallow again just a little worrying she reached up and put her veil up at last the light wasnt great but i could see a little more of her face a very beautiful strong semiasiatic semiicouldnttellwhat face with big wide eyes and with catlike slits for pupils not round ones ahha id heard you could have contacts like that and a few weirdos had even had eye surgery to get the same effect music thudded very distantly she looked into my eyes and said quietly nothing should go wrong adrian but if we become separated i want you to think yourself back to here to this room she waved one hand take a good look round i looked around the place humouring her do it for real adrian she said as though guessing i was only pretending to look at it remember its visual details remember the smell and the sound of this place will you be able to envisage it accurately again the light in the room was amber like sunset subdued the bed was queen or kingsize with black satin sheets there was a black couch one ornate chair of red and gold a mirror on the ceiling a tv set into the wall and in one corner a black cube with the one word minibar on it in blue neon there was one other door presumably leading to a bathroom the bed had those unnecessary bedposts that are handy for tying people to with furry handcuffs or whatever i guess i said separated what was she talking about still no actual alarm bells but i was starting to think that i needed a second set to go off to tell me when the first lot had mysteriously stopped working now mrs m produced what looked like a tiny cigarette lighter i shall apply this to myself first then to you it must happen in rapid succession she said bringing the device up to her neck and putting her free hand behind my head fingers spread over my sweaty hair like some giant spider please try not to flinch when i apply it to you then i will hug you tightly do you understand got you must confess my mouth was dry the music stopped briefly its thudthudding gone leaving only my heart then here we go she stepped up to me her body tight against mine i could feel her small firm breasts pressing into my chest and smell a scent somewhere between antiseptic and a musky perfume she pushed the lighter up into her lower jaw and it clicked a hiss her hand swooped from under her chin and came up to my neck pressure another click and a hiss and a cold sensation in my neck and jaw like an infusion of ice she wrapped her arms tight around my back then wrapped her legs around mine too rising a little on her feet and pressing her head side to side against mine i put my arms around her she felt good there were stirrings down below i was getting wood i wondered if she could feel it she would soon if she hadnt already then very suddenly it felt like my head turned itself inside out i must have closed my eyes i swayed and staggered as i opened them again there was a grey light all around us and the air was suddenly chill and fresh mrs m was releasing me from her grip but holding one of my hands so i didnt fall over and saying over and over its all right adrian its all right its all right but it wasnt all right because not only was there was no dark amberlit room around us there was no fucking building around us the novy pravda was gone and here we were in the grey light of a dawn that was hours too early on a low hill surrounded by marshes with a big river coiled across the landscape in the direction of the stillcloudobscured rising sun great not just the room not just the novy pravda the whole of fucking moscow had gone scattered all about stretching to the horizon lay ruins i felt like i was going to keel over and we did a bizarre dance for a few seconds as mrs m still held my hand and tried to stop me falling onto my bum and i sort of staggered and revolved around her trying to get my balance back and gasping as my shoes slipped on the tussocky grass on the cold hilltop finally i got my legs spread far enough apart to stop gyrating and mrs m pulled me to a stop taking me by both shoulders while i bent breathing hard and fast and not believing what i was seeing whenever i took a look out across this deserted landscape of grey marshes and black ruins im okay i said im okay i straightened up she kept one hand on my elbow i took a few deep breaths holding them a handful of seconds each i looked around couldnt see another soul there was a dot on the distant river under the light patch of sky where the dawn was it might have been a boat the ruins spread in every direction a few were on the horizon darkly jagged towers and bits of domes bitten slumpedlooking squared things that might once have been tower blocks or big office buildings there were some dressed stones sitting halfovergrown by longer grass a few steps away down the slope towards the nearest marsh lets sit mrs m said she sat me down on the cold hard stones where the fuck is this i asked when i had my breathing back to something like normal another earth another moscow she said she sat beside me half turned to me the veil was down again had been ever since we got here i rubbed my neck was that the pill did this or this did this she said showing me the little lighter gadget the pill was for if something went wrong you had to visualise the room we left from remember i nodded that was your way back you shouldnt need it now though we can go back together the first transition is always the most problematic were well attuned she smiled patted my arm reassuringly fuck i said shaking my head and standing up again and looking desperately around i found a fistsized lump of stone and threw it as hard as i could towards the stillrising spread of light where the dawn was it disappeared into the grass downhill with a barely audible thud i turned back to mrs m no just give me a minute okay ill stay here she said smiling behind the veil and clasping her hands over one raised knee i ran down the slope skidding in places jumping over a few more of the piles of dark brown stones lying in heaps within the grass when the slope levelled out the marsh began and i squelched into muddy water i put my hand down brought up some greybrown mud stared at it then stared out over the grey landscape and let the mud dribble back through my fingers a bird made a lonely mewling cry in the distance and another answered from even further away it all looked and felt and smelled real as fuck the surface of dark water pooling between my shoes black slipons what happened to my converse was going still looking at my face reflected in it i didnt even look like myself my trousers felt coarser and were more like very dark brown than black no nokia nothing in the pockets at all no rolex on my wrist either i studied my hands they looked a bit different too they had freckles i didnt have freckles did i suddenly i wasnt sure any more fuck me it turned out that i didnt even know the back of my hand like the back of my hand i turned and saw the small black figure of mrs mulverhill sitting where id left her i trudged back up i am able to tandem she explained as we sat side by side on the stones a hint of pale yelloworange sun had peeked out between two layers of cloud to the east some people can a tandemiser can take one other person with them when they transition usually just one most people cant transition at all but of those who can few can take anything other than themselves from world to world transition from one world to another uhhuh and you need a pill or something there is a substance called septus both in the pill you took and in the spray in here she brandished the little lighter thing then secreted it away in the black bandages again somewhere under her ribcage i closed my eyes rubbed my face when i looked out again everything was just as it had been grey skies rising sun gleaming all watery wide marshes distant black ruins so is this like another dimension or something i asked fuck i was struggling i almost wished id paid attention in physics lessons the whole total bizarre weirdness of this was still affecting me in waves of dizziness unless it was the drugs id swallowed or been injected with had there really been no blackout phase we seemed to have come here from the novy pravda between heartbeats with only that rush of headturninginsideout to lead up to it and that had felt like part of the experience itself rather than something properly separate from it but had there really been no time to get me properly drugged and able to be shipped out to wherever we were now it didnt feel like it but it still had to be more likely i mean logically than what mrs m was telling me she shrugged this is one of the many worlds she said there are infinities of them the people i represent travel between them sometimes they might need help transitioning travelling between worlds is not a perfected process we would like to employ you to be there to help any travellers blown offcourse into your world as it were or who would otherwise need help in it minor help would you do that for us what exactly do you do why are you doing all this travelling anyway mrs m made a clicking noise with her mouth nothing that bad but nothing i can tell you about either nothing that we are doing ought to get you into any legal trouble with your authorities in the highly unlikely event that they ever find out you must have heard of the idea of needtoknow yeah well you dont need to know so its best for you not to a pause while she looked out over the chilly landscape before turning back to me though i suppose i should say that its not unknown for people to start out doing what were asking you to do and them then going on to become more actively and operationally involved and even eventually becoming transitioners themselves that smile behind the lace and dots again not unknown but one thing at a time eh what do you say do you think you might accept our offer i stared at her i was going to need time to think anyway i said now i i think i mean this has given me i thought she looked disappointed behind the veil i sighed oh fuck who am i trying to kid sure yes of course either ive gone fucking nuts or youve got the keys to the universe in a pill or now in a handy spray version well the keys to different versions of earth she said no other planets not as such yet she said no true time travel either what about untrue time travel there is an apparent phenomenon called lag though i suppose it could equally justly be called lead where otherwise nearidentical worlds differ only in one being ahead or behind the other by any interval up to several million years but its not a real phenomenon any more than a celestial constellation is they remain intrinsically separate and nothing occurring in one directly affects the other sorry i asked no aliens were still looking i paused you look a bit alien yourself mrs m no offence none taken you ready to go back i think so you may still feel a little disoriented you reckon you will be finding out something about yourself over the next few days weeks and months adrian oh yeah what i said about the pill you took was true but its other purpose is to give you an excuse to dismiss this as some sort of druginduced hallucination i must have looked sceptical mrs m spread her arms right now you know that this is real and all this has definitely happened but when youre back in your own body and back in your own world and country and house and job and so on with life going on as usual you will start to doubt that any of it was real at all you may well determine that it did not happen in which case that is probably what you need to believe to protect your sanity or you may accept that it did either way this will tell you something about yourself cant wait i paused anyway so long as the moneys real know what i mean she laughed a high tinkly kind of laugh this time we try to choose pragmatic selfish people for such positions adrian selfish am i of course you know you are its not high praise adrian but its not criticism either its just an acknowledgement all our best people are highly selfcentred its the only thing that holds them together in the chaos she grinned anyway i think you will do very well time to go back we both stood up a low breeze ruffled my hair and some of her black bandages i took a last look round this landscape of watery ruins what happened here anyway i asked she looked round briefly i dont know she said something terrible i should think yeah i said i should think so too even i knew enough history to think of napoleon and hitler and what might have happened in a third world war oh she said clicking her fingers i should warn you what the selves we left behind back at the novy pravda i stared at her theyre still there oh yes on standby if you like our minds our true selves are in these bodies the ones that we happened to find here but the husks remain where we left them i looked at my freckled hand again then at her but you look just like you did she smiled behind the black veil well i am very good at this and there are infinitudes of worlds to work with there are even an infinite number where we are having exactly the same conversation as this right now worlds differing only in one tiny detail which might be an atom of uranium in a deposit deep underground in venezuela decaying a microsecond earlier than it did here or a photon in the university of tasmania taking one slit not the other in another running of the twoslit experiment there may even be an infinite number which are utterly indistinguishable from this one and which are taking place precisely contemporaneously where the divergence has yet to occur though there may not partly it depends how you look at it she gave me a big smile id been looking at her blankly i guess further research is required she said anyway about our other selves the barely aware husks we left behind yeah we may get back to find they are having sex i stared at her seriously when you leave two physically healthy adult humans of each others preferred gender alone in such close proximity and theyre effectively morons it tends to happen how romantic yes though it depends was it something on your mind before we left what you and me having sex yes the idea had crossed it she tipped her head to one side well youre not my usual type but i was finding you moderately attractive possibly due to the disinhibiting effects of alcohol dont you get carried away there now know what i mean she shrugged there are couriers who can only take another person with them when they are penetratively conjoined i have to embrace my fellow traveller one or two can cotransition just by holding the others hand anyway well see all im saying is dont be alarmed if we flit back and thats what were doing okay i said ill try not to be alarmed she stepped up to me now we embrace yes my brain felt like it was turning inside out again or outside in this time whatever but when we got back i was lying curled up on the floor of the amberlit room and mrs m was sitting crosslegged by my side patting my shoulder and making sorrowful comforting noises and i had tears in my eyes and a sick feeling in my gut nursing what felt like a pair of badly bruised testicles exactly as though somebody had kneed me in the balls a few minutes earlier ah she said sorry sometimes that happens too patient infinities within infinities within infinities the human brain quails when confronted with such proliferating vastness we think we have a grasp of it brandishing our numbers natural rational complex real unreal in the face of all thats inestimable but truthfully these resources are mere talismans not practical tools a comfort no more nevertheless the doorways into that inexhaustible wilderness of forever multiplying worlds had been opened to us and we required the means to at least try to understand as much as we could of their hidden mechanisms and how they might be comprehended and navigated learning about the many worlds occurred appropriately in layers one was history in at least three categories there was history that we knew we were allowed to know history that we knew we were not allowed to know and history that allegedly didnt exist but that we that is the students of this effectively measureless subject suspected did exist but was never talked about not at our level and perhaps not even at the level of the people who taught us we were aware from the beginning that the concern had many more levels than were immediately visible from the lowly strata where we existed in its tortuously convoluted hierarchy and it was hard even to guess at how far beyond us it extended given both the irredeemably complex nature of the many worlds themselves and the seemingly quite deliberate opacity of the organisations structure we knew there were various levels and classes of executives within lexpédience with at the apparent pinnacle of this structure the central council itself composed of people who knew all there was to know about the concerns provenance internal configuration extent operational methods and aims and some of us were of the opinion always perverse in mine that there might be one central authority figure at the head of all this tiered knowledge and power a kind of organisational autocrat to whom everybody else was obliged to defer but for all we knew that final single neargodlike emperor of the realities if he or she did exist was little better than a foot soldier in a still greater grouping of other concerns and metaconcerns extending further and higher out across and through the furiously expanding realities and numbered in millions billions trillions who knew for us lowly foot soldiers though mere trainees that we were the centre of our world the centre of all our many worlds was the speditionary faculty of the university of practical talents aspherje on an earth that almost uniquely did not call itself earth but calbefraques calbefraques was the ultimate open world the mirror image of one of the numberless perfectly closed earths where nobody knew about the many worlds a place where possibly every single adult soul who walked its surface knew that it was merely one world within an infinitude of worlds and a nexus at that a steppingoff point for as much of that infinitude as it was possible to imagine and a world an earth that was close to unique logically there had to be other versions of this earth that were close to the calbefraques that we knew but we seemed to be unable to access them it was as though by being the place that could act as a gateway to any other version of earth calbefraques had somehow outpaced all the other versions of itself that would otherwise have existed it seemed that in the same way that the true consciousness of a transitioner could only be in one world at a time there could only be one world that was perfectly open and that world that unique earth was this one called calbefraques it was here that almost all the transitioners lived when they were not on missions to other worlds and here too that the vast majority of theorists of transitioning experts in transitioning researchers into transitioning and experimental practitioners of transitioning both made their home and plied their trade in its globally distributed factories and laboratories all the multifarious paraphernalia of transitioning was manufactured and somewhere allegedly the ultimately precious substance we called septus the drug that made flitting possible in the first place was brought into being exactly how and where this was done and exactly what septus really was nobody seemed to know the secrecy surrounding the drugs creation was of an order more intense even than that associated with the severely securityconscious operations of the transitionary corps naturally this meant that the speculation regarding this piece of arcana was to put it mildly unrestrained there were strict rules about the use and exposure of septus within this world or any other restricting its use to its flittingenabling purpose and absolutely nothing else but it was rumoured that if one did try to have some of it analysed in the most advanced laboratories one could find the sample itself simply vanished or appeared on inspection by chemical analysis mass spectrometry microscopes working on a variety of wavelengths or any other technique available to be nothing more complicated than pond slime or even pure water here in the university that was a city within a city within its piled pyramids ziggurats towers and colonnades and in the profusion of outlying buildings distributed all across the greater city an evermultiplying number in a fit image of what was studied within them millions of students like myself had over the years learned as much of that proportion of the truth as it was thought appropriate for us to be allowed to comprehend what some of us really wanted to know naturally was the size of that proportion and what was concealed in the fraction of it being denied us the transitionary it was the septennial festival of death in aspherje calbefraques and the central council of the transitionary office had arranged a particularly extravagant party and ball to celebrate both the formal cultural event and the latest expansion and reconstitution of the council guests arrived on a specially constructed narrowgauge railway which ran in a loop round the closed city centre picking up guests from a variety of temporary stations manned by servants dressed as ghouls which were dotted around the periphery of the cordonedoff area where the guests own transport had deposited them the track was lit by tall smokily guttering torches and by burning braziers hanging from gibbets and made to look like ancient roadside punishment cages the skeletons of starved miscreants visible through the smoke and flames inside at the final terminus the station seemingly made entirely of dinosaur bones where the guests were deposited a wide moat had been dug across the park in front of the entrance to the universitys great hall beneath the water lay a system of pipes which fed marsh gases and flammable oils to the surface where they were lit or detonated by floating bundles of burning rags containing clockwork mechanisms that made them jerk and move and appear briefly human guests proceeded across a bridge bowed out across this waste of sporadic conflagration and entered the great hall through a recently constructed illlit tunnel of sootblackened stone enormous iron doors creaked open to admit guests to a tall circular space containing another nearcircular moat of unpleasantsmelling water lying at the foot of a great steep bowl of curved walls running with liquids across a bridge ahead stood a great wall of what appeared to be slate its slick surface running with water cascading down its imperfectly vertical surface in fast hissing waves beyond the far end of the bridge where one might have expected to see a door there was only this wall of water nothing else the great iron doors behind swung shut on each batch of two dozen or so guests leaving them looking nervously round unable to see a way out streamers of fire appeared twenty metres above them all around the top of the vast bowl they found themselves trapped within while the small bridge that had led them from the tunnel behind was drawn quickly back up to clang and echo against the rustpitted surface of the doors the burning oils quickly covered most of the bowls curtain wall and started to pool on the surface of the water at the foot spreading slowly towards the low island of dry stone in the middle where the nowfearful group of guests huddled beginning to wonder if something had gone wrong with one of the various mechanisms large parts of the university had been closed for months while all this had been set up and there had been rumours of cost overruns technical problems project delays and lastminute panics or if it was all some horrendously complicated and involved plot directed at them personally and they were to be cruelly put to death for some real exaggerated or entirely imaginary crime just when the guests could feel the heat from the wall of flame around them starting to become uncomfortable and were genuinely beginning to fear not just for their costumes but for their lives the vast wall of slate covered in spilling water ahead of them cracked vertically to reveal itself as a pair of enormous doors which began to open with a crushingly ponderous grace their burden of water still crashing down their faces undiminished while a broad tongue of stone levered smoothly down between them to provide a bridge over the encircling noose of fire servants dressed as ghosts and the risen dead a few of them equipped with fire extinguishers just in case beckoned the by now usually highly relieved and indeed cheering partygoers over the stone bridge and into the throat of another dark tunnel which led via almost disappointingly conventional cloak and restrooms into the main body of the great hall where the ball was to be held under a vast black tent of a roof studded with high and distant lights arranged in starlike constellations a short walk away down a corridor lined with skulls gleaned from catacombs across the continent another only slightly smaller hall held a collection of circular drink food drug and smoking bars around which people milled like magnetic particles ricocheting within some colossal game further away up some wide steps turned into an uphill slalom slope by dense wavy lines of antique funeral urns the way led to the great circular space underneath the dome of the mists itself this space too had been waterproofed and filled with a little artificial sea a metre deep a circular lake over a hundred metres across was covered with fragrant floating plants and dotted with tiny islands covered in food and tinkling fountains of wine skiffs rowing boats and barges rowed by exotically uniformed children plied the placid waters while above tumbling and highwire acts were performed surrounded by makebelieve shooting stars composed of great fireworks raining sparks and running on lines suspended across the darkly glittering lake an orchestra on the largest island situated in the centre of the waters filled the space with music while the wildly decorated lanternlit vessels sailed serenely around a porcelain coracle rowed by a preposterously dressed dwarf bumped very gently into the rushesbundle fenders lining the wooden quay near the halls entrance the miniature man toked on a tube sticking out from a frill on one of his sparkling concentric collars mr oh he asked in a heliumhigh voice good evening madame dortolan awaits sir he nodded at the other mans shoes boats a bit delicate squire youll have to take those off oh undid his shoes he had dressed conservatively in his old speditionary faculty dress uniform having no particular intention of joining in the ball and slightly to his own surprise no desire to dress in a fancy costume you can leave them with the quay master sir the dwarf said when oh went to take his shoes with him you wont be needing them on the barge oh handed his shoes to the cadaverously dressed man in charge of the little pier he stepped carefully into the furlined interior of the bizarrely fragile craft the ceramic hull was so thin that where the furs did not cover it you could see the shadow of the waters lapping around its waterline from inside the dwarf took a breath from a different tube and said in an unfeasibly deep voice off we go sir please do sit still and dont touch the sides oh sat patiently where he was legs and arms crossed and let the dwarf row him slowly out over the gently chopping water towards the most extravagantly decorated vessel on the whole lake it was made of ice and glided unhurriedly across the waves in its own surrounding skirt of curling mists it was sculpted to look like an ancient royal barge its carriagelike superstructure was covered in gold leaf and it bore at its centre a great square sail on which was projected a filmed performance of a famously sensual and erotic ballet the air grew noticeably colder as the dainty coracle approached the ice barge the dwarf used one oar to prevent his frangible craft hitting the larger vessels hull servants dressed like skeletons helped oh up to the deck and the dwarf rowed slowly away again the barges deck covering looked like some form of dark skin and felt as warm madame dortolan reclined with a few other members of the central council in a nest of glistening bloodred cushions inside the main cabin of the craft surrounded by canted gilt poles holding furled curtains of goldthreaded purple material the tented ceiling of the enclosure appeared insubstantial made from thousands of little black and white pearls threaded on silver wires the raised airy cabin afforded views out across the lake its tiny jewellike islands and the flotilla of slowly swirling vessels oh recognised the others of the council who were present and greeted them individually mr repton bik madama gambaracilleon lord harmyle professor prieska dottlemien comptroller lapsalinehregge captain yollyi suyen and of course madame dortolan herself who with the latest changes to the council was now its acknowledged if unofficial head she was dressed in some ancient wildly complicated costume all frills and ruffles and floaty films of material the outer layers of which which seemed barely heavier or less transparent than the air jewels glittered on the lacy extremities of her pooled skirts and on her fingers ears throat forehead and nose she had lately been accorded the privilege of moving from her earlier aged body already her second since she had been invited to join the council and was now a curvaceously beautiful whiteskinned creature ravenhaired with icy blue eyes and fabulously nearspherical breasts which she had chosen to reveal in all their considerable glory her extravagant costume stopped at her amazingly thin waist and only resumed again at her shoulders where a little lacy thing like a voluptuarys idea of a bedjacket covered her shoulders and arms a ruby nestled in her belly button and her breasts were strung with lines of tiny diamonds a diamond choker encircled her long slim neck young mr oh she said patting a plump of pillows beside her do come and sit two other council members like the others fabulously attired though in no case as opulently or as revealingly as madame dortolan adjusted themselves where they lay to accommodate him oh kissed her hand when she offered it madame i feel underdressed he told her to the contrary she said i am so and you are positively swaddled in your schoolboy uniform ah i see your feet are naked that is something a tray held outstretched by one of the skeletally dressed servants appeared between them madame dortolan waved her hand at it and oh lifted a globular glass with a double skin and several tiny fish swimming in the watery space surrounding the drink itself which was warm and highly spiced i am some opera costumiers version of a slave girl she told him looking down at herself and spreading her arms what do you think its very spectacular she cupped her diamondrashed breasts in her hands as though weighing them im particularly pleased with these i imagine everybody else is too maam she looked up at him and smiled exasperatedly mr oh temudjin if i may you sound like an old man listen to yourself she nodded at the globular glass drink up you obviously need it he drank oh wondered at madame dortolans startlingly young and vivacious new body it was generally held that one had a physique one had grown up with and grown accustomed to and that trying to stray too far from this template when transitioning or even more so when reembodying as madame dortolan had done was both difficult to accomplish and disagreeable to maintain especially over extended intervals he knew from his own transitions that unless he made a particular effort to avoid doing so he tended to end up in quite plain rather averagely sized bodies whereas his own real body this body the one that stayed in calbefraques in the house on the ridge overlooking the town of flesse was taller more pleasingly proportioned and altogether betterlooking than those he naturally gravitated towards in the course of his missions for the concern of course expressing oneself into quite plain unremarkable forms was a positive benefit in his line of work as it made it easier to slip in and out of situations and worlds without attracting undue attention but he had always wondered why his transitionary selves always seemed to be so short and bland without him intending them to be so maybe deep down that was just his physiology of choice though he could not see why they did say that for those with transgender issues transitioning into bodies quite different from that one had grown up within was a positive boon almost a treatment and solution in itself madame dortolan had always been a slightly dumpy if still elegantly turnedout lady according to both gossip and the photographic records of the concern to have chosen the body she was displaying so luxuriantly before him now must indicate she was prepared to make a considerable sacrifice of her own future comfort taking on that very feeling of not being happy in ones own skin that sufferers found so objectionable for the sake of looking like she had obviously convinced herself she ought to look it indicated a singlemindedness and determination that many people would find admirable oh supposed but also a sort of ruthlessness against the self that did not speak of a wholly healthy and untroubled personality she made an allembracing gesture with one arm what do you think of the party he made a show of looking all around i have never seen anything quite like it he told her truthfully i cant imagine what it must have cost or how long it must have taken to arrange a fortune she told him smiling broadly and for ever she produced a corded mouthpiece joined to a giant water pipe situated some metres away and carefully tended by another of the skeletally dressed servants she took a little sip of the smoke passed the mouthpiece to him do do be careful she told him archly putting one ringheavy hand on his knee and leaving it there its frightfully strong oh put his lips to the mouthpiece she had left it a little moist he drew in a mouthful of the greypink smoke which smelled and tasted like a cocktail of different drugs he let the fumes touch just the top of his lungs and then blew them decorously out again rather than hold them in and get too stoned he got the impression that madame dortolan had already smoked quite a lot she was still smiling fixedly at him one of her hands played with one of the strings of diamonds curved over her breasts i do hope youre here quite determined to enjoy yourself tem she told him it would be such a terrible waste of time and resources otherwise madame i feel entirely obliged to please call me theodora thank you theodora yes i intend to enjoy myself he held up the halfdrained glass of warm liquor and presented the hookah mouthpiece back to her he did his best to smile with all the warmth he could command indeed i have already begun to she tapped his knee so she said for a moment slightly more businesslike how did the questionary office treat you after your meeting with mrs m oh had told the concern about his encounter with mrs mulverhill at the casino in flesse their subsequent flit and something of their conversation quite humanely theodora there had been a lot of questions and they had hilariously he thought tried to hypnotise him plus he was sure they had people listening and watching him while he answered their questions who would be attuned to any degree of falsity or evasion but there had been no threat of unpleasantness and he had been as open as he felt he could and mrs m herself madame dortolan purred did she treat you humanely she certainly treated me like a human madame dortolan tapped his knee with one ringed finger i heard she said seemingly addressing his knee or her finger that she took you to another world while you were inside her she looked up at him wideeyed is that true it is theodora ah she said with what sounded like wistfulness the transport of delight just after actually i hope it was worth it that would be impossible to judge he said aware he was being gnomic still it seemed to satisfy her she stroked his knee tell me tem what did she say about me well theodora i cant entirely remember really really are you sure youre not just trying to be gallant fairly sure i think you are you are trying to be gallant she brought herself confidentially closer to him leaning so close that one of her nipples pressed gently against his jacket level with his heart you are trying to be gallant well its just that having talked about it all at such length with the questionary people the recollection feels worn stripped out if you like as though i have the memory of a memory not the memory itself she looked at him unsteadily as though dazzled i do hope youre not trying to be too gallant tem she said her voice quite firm theres nothing you need spare me he was sure that madame dortolan had either read the transcript of what hed told the questionary office or seen a recording of his interview at the very least she would have had full access to any records so could have learned all she needed to know from those mrs mulverhill he began and instantly sensed the three faces nearest to them flick their attention in his direction he brought his mouth closer to madame dortolans ear and lowered his voice accordingly said that you would lead the concern to disaster and ruin he told her and that you or some part or faction of the central council might have a hidden agenda though she was not sure what that might be madame dortolan was silent for a moment beyond her feet two of the other council people who had not overheard what hed said earlier were sharing a hookah mouthpiece and a joke the two men laughed suddenly and uproariously in a spluttering cloud of greypink smoke you know madame dortolan said quietly and there was a steely edge to her voice that made him think that she had not been drunk or stoned in the least we have tried so hard to protect you tem she looked steadily up at him he chose to say nothing we have watched you so very very carefully and surrounded you with so many people charged with making sure that you come to no harm from this woman and put our best people onto the job of monitoring all your flits and every world you go to and everything you do there we have been so impressed with everything youve done but so disappointed that we seem unable to stop this woman finding you or prevent her taking you wherever she wants once she has or backtracking where youve been with her subsequently i find it almost unbelievable that she can do that all by herself dont you think its unbelievable she played with a strand of her curling black hair twisting it round one finger again looking up at him wideeyed no theodora i dont he told her it happens to me i take no part in it but it happens nevertheless so i find it perfectly believable you would too he drank from his fishily inhabited glass she took the mouthpiece of the water pipe and used it to stroke his leg lightly from upper thigh to midcalf i believe you tem of course she said absently as though not paying attention to herself however there are those who feel that we may be being a tad too lenient in all this it does just seem so very strange that she can do what she can so terribly easily and all without any help or cooperation from you perhaps we need to check how how easy it is to flit with you like that you mean so embraced so contained well yes she was still watching her hand holding the hookah mouthpiece he waited until she brought the mouthpiece back up and then took it from her and sucked on it if you are saying what i think you are theodora then it would be both a pleasure and an honour she looked up with an open vacant expression i do beg your pardon what was it you thought i was saying i may have misinterpreted maam oh said on an inbreath waving the mouthpiece through a greypink cloud perhaps you ought to say what it was you were actually saying to spare the blushes of us both she looked at him knowingly and took the mouthpiece back sucking daintily on it i think you know exactly what i was saying tem he bowed as best he could given that he was reclining maam i am at your disposal she smiled you are amenable temudjin you consent she reached out and took hold of one of his hands you see i ask your permission rather than just take you i think to do that is simply rude a violation even i am entirely amenable theodora she gave a little tinkling laugh still so formal she squeezed his hand come then let us do this without further ado they were suddenly somewhere else she was dressed just as she had been he was not now he wore fancy dress some sort of blueandsilverstriped puffedout outfit with shoes whose toes turned up and a giant hat shaped like an onion everything else felt very similar same fragre same languages they appeared to be lying on a collection of pillows and cushions similar to those they had just left but situated on a little circular island surrounded by a wide pool of water lit from below by slowly changing lights of green and blue the walls and ceiling were dark or invisible the air was warm and smelled of strong heady perfumes there was nobody else within sight madame dortolan moved herself closer to him there we are just beneath the floor of the dome of the mists our vacated selves are floating somewhere just overhead this seems agreeable to you there was a kind of slightly delayed natural amplification behind her voice that made him suspect they were right in the centre of a perfectly circular space her words echoing off the totality of the circumference around them oh felt round the perimeter of his giant hat im not sure about this he said and took it off his voice too sounded strange the echoes overemphatic lagging behind his words just enough to clash with them but otherwise yes its perfectly agreeable she smiled smoothed a hand over his hair let us make it more agreeable she whispered and slid to him embracing him bringing her mouth up to his he had wondered if this would prove awkward or difficult but it did not he remembered mrs mulverhill asking him if hed fucked madame dortolan yet or had she even expressed it as her fucking him he couldnt recall and deciding at the time that his pride would not let that happen even that he ought to feel some sort of loyalty some fidelity to mrs mulverhill both sexual and what ideological despite feeling even at the time that this was preposterous almost perverse at the very very least hed thought over the last few minutes he would be cold or difficult to persuade or rouse or perfunctory and hinting at contemptuous but faced with such flattering attention from on high confronted with such a powerful regard from somebody who had taken such trouble to make themselves so formidably if ostentatiously attractive there was no part of him that was not responding enthusiastically there might he supposed have been something in the drug smoke or the drink but probably he admitted to himself not madame dortolan was a highly capable lover dextrous smooth and with a sort of restless almost impatient touch forever moving her hands and mouth and attention from one place on his body to the next as though while never exactly dissatisfied with what she had uncovered already she was still searching for something even better both their costumes seemed to have been designed to provide easy sexual access without having to take any part of them entirely off when he entered her she let out a great satisfied sigh and hugged him tightly to her with all four limbs throwing her head back to expose her long white neck and giving a sort of growling laugh ah now she said half to herself just there just there there was a virtuosic skill in what happened a few minutes later when they both achieved orgasm at once this was such a cliché in itself and so relatively unusual that oh found even in the course of it time to be unashamedly impressed as the sensation was beginning to ebb the echoes of his cries and hers starting to fade around them she took him transitioning them together into another pair of coupled bodies then moments later into another and another and another he had no time to evaluate each passing body and world was barely aware of more than a riffling sequence of fragres glimpses of different amounts or qualities of light eyes open or not and the feel of larger or smaller spaces around them cooler air warmer air varying smells of perfumes and bodily musks even their physical state in the shape of different sexual positions all flickered past him in a strobe of elongated ecstasies he did recall despite the pulsings of such concentrated extended pleasure that there were people who existed in a state of perpetual sexual arousal coming to orgasm continually through the most trivial ordinary and frequent physical triggers and experiences it sounded like utter bliss the sort of thing drunk friends roared with envious laughter over towards the end of an evening but the unfunny truth was that in its most acute form it was a severe and debilitating medical condition the final proof that it was so was that many people who suffered from it took their own lives bliss pure physical rapture could become absolutely unbearable mrs m was right in everything a leavening but it finished the final few transitions into other heaving sweating trembling bodies taking longer and longer in each each time and synchronised so that it was just the last few spasms on each occasion then the exhausted dregs of climax that were experienced and finally a long extending afterglow the sum of it like some absurdly exaggerated romanticised ideal of perfect physical and spiritual lovemaking when it was finally over and oh was able to open his eyes clear his head and take stock of his surroundings he was still inside her and they were sitting together facing each other in some sort of tall vshaped love seat its velvety components and cutouts arranged just so to offer the occupying lovers access support purchase and leverage they were in a great flat desert of pale golden sand beneath a plain black canopy flapping in a steady wind the air warm as it flowed across their entirely naked bodies there was nobody else around that he could see beneath them his feet were just touching the surface of a thick abstractly patterned carpet a small table nearby held some decorated ceramic pots and a tall elegantly worked jug a pile of their clothes lay folded on a wide footstool a short distance away a couple of large tawnypelted animals that he didnt recognise lay asleep on the sand little fragre to sense languages as before this body was leaner and more muscular than his own thinking about it they all had been looking down he saw that he was as shaved as she was madame dortolan yawned and stretched she smiled at him she looked just as she had though bereft of her clothes and jewellery she ran a hand through his hair her gaze flicking about his face so tem she said lazily and gave a little shiver squeezing him inside her your investigations are complete i take it oh said his words sounded a little more cold than hed meant she gazed levelly at him i suppose they are tem it was hard to read her voice she stroked his face and very pleasant they were to perform too wouldnt you say her smile appeared engagingly tentative he took one of her hands and kissed it gently with dry lips i would he said but stalled there and could not even look her in the eye confused he felt a need to say more to make light of this or perhaps instead to behave in an overtly and overly romantic grateful manner to reassure her even to compliment and flatter her and declare his admiration and appreciation yet at the same time he wanted to dismiss her deflate her hurt her just get away from her he felt caught poised between these conflicting urges as balanced on their cusp as he was on this absurd fucking chair i trust something of the ladys spell might now be broken yes she asked bringing her mouth close to his ear as she stroked his cheek with the back of her fingers im sure she has her own naive charms but further experience offers us greater richness dont you think it offers us some extra perspective we compare contrast measure and judge initial impressions however enchanting they may have seemed at the time are evaluated again in the light of something more accomplished what might have seemed matchless becomes revalued hmm she levered herself away a little and smiled her hand still stroking his cheek the young wine serves its purpose and seems well enough when one knows no better but only the fine wine brought patiently to the summit of fruition where it may reveal all its complexities and subtleties satisfies all the available senses wouldnt you say he stilled the stroking hand folding it in his own well he said forcing himself to stare into her eyes indeed there was no comparison he felt her gaze pierce him and knew immediately that the remark which had been meant to deceive which he had thought cunning and which was supposed to mean one thing to her and another entirely to him had failed to mislead her he felt something in her change she pursed her lips said well go back now and they were back back to the ice yacht and the corpuscular landscape of pillows and cushions they shared with the others she just letting go of his hand and looking away her expression bored she lifted the mouthpiece for the hookah and drew deeply on it then glanced back at him her face looked closed composed fascinating mr oh she said she waved one hand dismissively ill let you get back to the party good night he felt silenced by his own clashing emotions as much as by her he hesitated then decided that there was nothing he could say or do that would not make the situation worse he nodded rose and left a drunk singing dwarf in a spunsugar dinghy rowed him back to shore breaking off a bit of gunwale as they approached and offering it to him tastes of rum sir go on try it try it try it the philosopher i must concede that i was lucky in a sense on my return from abroad and my quitting the army i found employment immediately during a time of high unemployment having been recommended to the national police force by one of the specialforces liaison officers i had worked with overseas my skills and abilities had been recognised at quite high levels and i will not pretend that i did not feel a degree of pride on realising this i met with some ill feeling from a few of my new colleagues in the police force at first perhaps because i had been brought in at a relatively senior level however i like to think that i soon won the respect of almost all of them though of course there will always be those in any organisation who will find something to be resentful about and one simply has to live with that fact i found myself in the civilian police albeit the more senior and serious national police force at a moment in time when the full extent of the christian terrorist threat was just beginning to become clear even to those not least our own government who had persuaded themselves that such people could be dealt with effectively by negotiation and the occasional slap on the wrist i think the first airport massacre ended that policy of folly the cts sent in a small suicide team of big welltrained men who simply overpowered one of the twoman armed police teams who patrolled our illdefended airports at the time the two officers stood no chance they were bundled to the ground by three or four fanatics of substantial physical size their throats were cut without mercy and their machine guns and ammunition clips taken from them and turned on the nearest checkin queue the members of the suicide team not firing the guns set about slashing at as many of the screaming fleeing holidaymakers as they could chasing down women and children and slitting their throats too without mercy nearly forty innocent people of all ages were butchered in this orgy of violence when the machine guns ran out of ammunition everyone in the team was meant to kill themselves but two of them were overpowered by angry citizens before they could take that cowards way out one did not survive their summary justice but the other did and it was on him that i had what i will freely confess was the pleasure of working subsequently with the aim of discovering as much as possible about the organisation and aims of the ct organisation i felt intense pride that i had been chosen to conduct this interrogation i took it as a compliment both to my technical skills but also to my reputation for the measured and considered application of my techniques such was the national outrage at the attack at the time that a more hotheaded operative might have botched the assignment it is a myth that the police and other security personnel are immune to emotion both their own and that of the lawabiding populace at large we may be trained to combat the deleterious effects of acting on such emotions but we are not inhuman i too felt a cold fury towards the wretched individual who had carried out such a cowardly attack but i would not let that emotion however understandable cloud my professional judgement regarding the task in hand or allow any rashness or overreaction so caused to effectively offer this animal of an extremist an overly quick escape from the torments he so richly deserved the specific operational details of the interrogation need not detain us here the desire to know of such things can be almost prurient at times in my opinion my colleagues and i are paid to do such things and are trained to cope with the psychological fallout of our actions and there are good reasons why a veil is drawn over such matters to protect the general populace who do not deserve to have to confront the realities that we have to face every day to keep them safe suffice to say despite the subjects attempts to convert me to his bizarre perverted and cruel religion with its emphasis on martyrdom cannibalism and the alleged ability of their holy men to forgive all sins no matter how horrendous and barbaric i did not reconvert to become a christian and let me just say that i do not even concede that he was displaying any real bravery or strength of will in trying to do so fanatics are driven purely by their own fanaticism and anyway it is a common technique used by subjects trained to resist interrogation to try to turn the resultant discourse back upon the questioner not so much in any realistic hope of altering their views or causing them to cease or go easier in what they are doing of course but simply as a way for the subject to take his mind off the process itself in any case i am satisfied that while the cell system of the terrorist organisation sadly protected the identities of its other members apart from the six in the suicide team itself i along with my colleagues extracted all that there was to be extracted from the subject and thanks to our restraint we were able to deliver him alive if not intact and certainly not unbroken to the justice ministry for his trial and subsequent welldeserved in my opinion execution adrian i made a lot of money for mr noyce not like that dingbat son of his barney lost mr n a lot of money soaked it up pissed it away and snorted it he would reappear from his bar in goa every couple of years and announce he was coming back to stay in london and do something useful but he never did always ended up going back to the bar he thought his dad ought to bail him out by giving him a job with his own firm but mr n wasnt having it blood might be thicker than water but its no match for liquidity know what i mean money is serious you fuck about with it at your peril barney was always at mr n to give him the bar too to turn it over to him legally but mr n was too clever for that as well he knew barney would just sell it or lose it in a poker game or use it as collateral to fund some shitwit scheme that hed make the usual unholy fucking mess of and be back at mr and mrs ns with the begging bowl shortly after frankly i think ed found his boy a bit of an embarrassment he was glad he was mostly arms length away in sunny goa barney and me werent getting on so well any more either i found him a bit of a moaner always on about how tough things were for him when this was clearly a load of bollocks little cunt had had a charmed life with all the advantages hadnt he not my fault or his dads that hed fucked it and i mean running a bar on a beach thats the fucking jackpot prize for most people that is thats what your average geezer would regard as a brilliant retirement hard done by my arse and he had the nerve to blame me for this at least partly good as told me this when we were drunk together once during a weekend at spetley hall like it was all my fault because id replaced him in mr and mrs ns affections so what if i had i was a better friend to them than he was a son i mean the soft git but i was the golden boy wasnt i never mind that the noyces were like a second family to me mr ns firm was like the first national bank of ac i made a fucking mint most of it went to the firm but a lot came back to me in the way of a decent salary but especially in bonuses mr n and i had some heated discussions on the subject of bonuses on a few occasions but we always came to an agreement in the end i suppose we both always knew id be leaving and going elsewhere eventually but in the meantime the good times rolled with no hard feelings bought a bigger flat in delightful docklands and a succession of less and less practical cars thought about a yacht but decided they just werent me you could always charter if you really needed to took me hols in aspen the maldives klosters the bahamas new zealand and chile not to mention majorca and crete doing a bit of oldfashioned raving in the big hot loud clubs and the girls oh bless their little cotton gussets the girls saskia and amanda and juliette and jayanti and talia and june and charley and charlotte and ffion and jude and maria and esme and simone there were lots of others but those were the noncasual ones the ones i took the trouble of remembering their names and was happy to have stay over more than once i loved them all in my own way and i guess they returned the favour most of them wanted to take things further but i never did theres no us in commitment id tell them theres just a me they couldnt complain i was generous and if there were ever hard feelings then it wasnt my fault and every month that k in us greenery appeared in my main spending account and every time i saw it on the statement i got a little leap of the heart remembering what had happened or what had seemed to happen that night in chilly moscow at the novy pravda after our visit to the room with the black furniture and the amber light mrs m and i went back to the table where connie sequorin was chatting to two large russian guys they didnt look very pleased to see me and mrs m especially me but they left their cards and a bottle of cristal and fucked off soon enough we ate more blinis and caviar drank more champagne and mrs m and connie both danced with me i was still in a daze though not really paying attention to very much at all soon enough mrs m paid the bill we got our coats and walked straight to the waiting merc that had brought us here snow was swirling from the orangeblack sky we went to this massive very bright and warm hotel and i was handed the key to my own room mrs m said shed be in touch and pecked me on the cheek connie said the same and did the twocheek pretendkiss thing they had a suite and i wondered as i padded down a very broad tall corridor to my room if they had something going together i slept till midafternoon the next day and found an envelope had been shoved under my door with a thousand roubles in it and a firstclass ba ticket to heathrow on a flight leaving four hours later the room had been paid for mrs m and connie had checked out hours earlier a note left behind reception by mrs m just said welcome abroad mrs m welcome abroad not welcome aboard welcome abroad i couldnt tell if this was a mistake or a bit of cleverness i went back back to moscow and back to the club the following month i made friends with the manager guy kliment after a bit of suspicion he didnt really remember me or mrs m or connie sequorin and probably thought i was police or a journalist or something and got to have a look round the place one day i found the room the bedroom where mrs m had taken me and wed seemed to go on the weirdest of weird trips to a marshy wasteland where there was no moscow just ruins it hadnt occurred to me at the time to bring back a flower or a pebble or something id been too fucking freaked out i suppose not that that would have proved anything anyway i knew something bizarre had happened but i didnt know exactly what i had the use of the room and the run of the place for the afternoon until the staff arrived in the early evening to make the club ready for the nights fun and i had a good look round the room the rooms on either side and even the cellar underneath and the little private bar directly above but it all looked plain and kosher just slightly seedy in the cold strip light of day and i couldnt see how the trick assuming it was a trick obviously had been pulled drugs i supposed or hypnosis suggestion and all that know what i mean no i didnt know what i meant either it had just been too fucking real i left the place no wiser than when id arrived and even turned down the offer of vip entry a nice table and a free bottle of bubbles from my new friend kliment tired i said some other time flew straight back to dear old fuckoff blighty that night i looked into travelling back to the zone around chernobyl but it was properly difficult to arrange and i never really felt happy with the whole idea the more i thought about it the more sure i was id go back at some risk to my future health find the place where mrs m had been hanging out and discover oh wow it was empty and deserted and it was as if it had all never been no office just an old supermarket or warehouse or whatever the fuck tried asking ed about it but he claimed he knew nothing never met or heard of a mrs mulverhill connie s was just a woman hed vaguely heard of recently at the time when she asked to be introduced to me he swore hed never heard of anything called the concern and he certainly wasnt getting any mysterious dosh every month eight and a half k or otherwise id have pushed further but he was just on the edge of getting annoyed with me i could tell and i was pretty sure i knew when mr n was telling the truth by now i hadnt told him any more than id needed to but he was obviously intrigued just from the little i had said and started asking me questions i stonewalled him told him he didnt want to know any more connie herself seemed to have disappeared off the face of the fucking earth phones disconnected business address a briefly rented office in paris unheard of by anybody who might have known somebody in her line of work checked the account saw the money waited for the call that never came all that happened was that a couriered letter arrived from a c sequorin in tashkent uzbekistan with a bunch of weirdlooking names that were codes apparently i was to commit them to memory if i could otherwise just keep the letter safe for future reference i put it in my safe i hired a private eye in tashkent because you can do that sort of thing these days in the wonderful new globalised world providing only that you have access to piles of dosh nothing another deserted office no joy tracing the source of the funds in the cayman islands either well of course not if governments cant trace anything in tax havens how the fuck was i supposed to when i thought about this it was actually highly fucking reassuring a week after the letter with the codes a padded envelope arrived with something the size and weight of a brick inside it was a black box of thick plastic and inside that was a steel box with a sort of dial on the top made of seven concentric rings of different metals arranged around a very slightly concave button in the centre these rings circled round and back with a sort of smooth clickiness if you know what i mean and if you looked carefully they had lots of little patterns of dots on them but they didnt seem to do anything there was a thinnerthanhair fine line around the middle of the box like it was meant to open maybe if you got the dials on the top arranged just right like a combination lock on a safe i suppose but with the box came a note from mrs mulverhill saying i was to keep this metal box safe guard it with my life and only give it to somebody who knew the codes from the letter i tried having it xrayed via a pal who works in airport security at city but the box wasnt having it in fact my mate thought his machine must be broken cos the thing didnt show up at all how fucking weird is that if you could make a gun out of this stuff you could saunter onto any plane in the world totally tooled up my guy pointed this out and i told him itd be very unhealthy indeed for both of us if he breathed so much as a syllable about it id barely finished telling him this when i got a very terse text message on my mobile telling me never to xray the box again or even think about trying any other method of looking inside keep it hidden keep it safe that was all how the fuck had they known anyway i lobbed the fucker into the back of the safe with the letter and did my best to forget about both of them quite successfully months years passed left mr ns firm when he retired in became a hedgie working out of an ultrasmart property in mayfair with another dozen or so guys left nyc the day before the towers came down and was never sure if id had a narrow escape or had missed something it would have been worth being there for despite all the nastiness of it just to be able to say id been there know what i mean anyway i was on a beach in trinidad so it didnt matter didnt see much of the noyces after ed retired though they kept inviting me to spetley hall for years afterwards made more money lost some of it opening a restaurant with a couple of mates when each of us thought one of the others must be the one who actually knew what he was doing still live and learn eh me and half a dozen other guys broke away from tangible topiary that was the name of the hedge fund and started up a new one a few doors down from our old office we called it fms it was registered at companies house and in the cayman islands as just fms ltd with no further detail though we told people who insisted on knowing that the letters stood for financial merchant securities or future market superstars or some such tosh but really it stood for fuck me sideways as in fuck me sideways look at the amount of money were making our mayfair office was even grander than tts deliberately we had a pool put in in the basement a gym in the attic and a games room with wraparound monitors for driving and shootemup games oh and a flotation pod each all taxdeductible as youd expect even the computer games were there to help us work off all that testosterone and aggression werent they the place usually contained more people there to advise us or tutor us on stuff than it did us actual hedgies we had personal trainers an inhouse masseur finewine advisers bespoke personalscent consultants grooming and presentational experts lifestyle and diet gurus yacht brokers fencing instructors and personal shoppers arriving from harrods or jermyn street every couple of hours or so with stuff they thought would suit us no time or inclination to actually go to the shops or mix with the plebs not to mention an account with a very discreet topoftherange escort service based a couple of streets away for when all that testosterone needed another sort of outlet we had a special room for that too that we called the canteen though the joke was some guys took it at their desk i was slow to start using that particular service never paid for it before so it was like a pride thing only thered be times when youd be sitting there in front of the screens and feeling suddenly horny and knowing a fabulouslooking girl who needed absolutely no chatting up or dining or alcoholic lubrication or talk of where do we think this is going or even cuddling was only a phone call and maybe ten minutes away and even though it was a weeks wages for some wanker it was only petty cash given what we were making daft not to really know what i mean like fast food only really quality fast food lot of toot taken too not so much by yours truly but the other guys got wired into it i was like the sommelier of the office though know what i mean we had very good contacts though mostly the dealers werent people id mixed with the turnover being what it is in the industry but i was always the one they came to to check it was good stuff which it almost always was stamp of authority me i should have issued certificates charged when chas the other senior guy from tt whod left with me to set up fms in the first place retired to raise kids and thoroughbred racehorses i realised i was actually the oldest of the people in the office and i was only in my early thirties fms indeed and we had our own financial advisers believe it or not we could make it and we could spend it with a bit of help see all the above but putting it to best use saving for a rainy day that was another area of expertise i mean obviously we had a pretty good idea what to do with the loot hundred times better than your average joe mug in the street but there were people who specialised in that sort of stuff so you listened to them tax shelters writeoffs offshoring all you could putting stuff in trusts which in theory were controlled elsewhere and just doled out what you needed if you asked nicely ha ha cayman islands bahamas channel islands luxembourg liechtenstein switzerland in the end we were paying less tax than our paki cleaners id drive through the clogged and teeming streets of west london and look at all those passing faces thinking you mugs you fucking mugs some of us were genius mathematicians not me obviously we split into two lots really there were the instinctive hedgies like me who just had a feel for what was going on and put ourselves about keeping eyes and ears open and calling in and doing little favours here and there and the quants the pure numbers guys the mathematics wizards who in another stupider age would have been mouldering away in some ancient pile of stones in oxbridge inventing new numbers and burbling on about fuck knows what and doing nothing useful for society we put them to work and paid them more money than even they could count then there were the programmers they were a sort of subset of the maths guys working on stuff that none of the rest of us even started to understand but that made everything work even more efficiently and let us make even more money the lease on the property next door came up we bought that knocked through upped the numbers place became a computer centre had to install industrial airconditioning plant to get rid of all the heat that the machines produced guess what made even more money cars flats mayfair townhouse a nice little eightbed newbuild in surrey lots of hols and girls girls girls still no call to make me start earning that k a month not that i needed the money of course but it was sort of a tradition by now know what i mean still it always gave me an ever so slight funny turn whenever i saw it on the statement patient i think it was our philosophy tutor at upt who said something which i took for granted or just as likely didnt bother to think about at the time and have only lately begun to find worrying now that i have had all this time to think about it it was this any argument or point of view that makes solipsism look no less likely may be discounted solipsism he told us was in a sense the default state of humanity there was arguably a kernel of us that always believed that we personally our own individual consciousness was the only thing that really existed and that nothing else mattered that feeling we have certainly that behaviour we exhibit of utter selfishness as a child absolutely demanding beginning as an infant when we are paradoxically allpowerful due to our very helplessness transfigures into the common adolescent intuition that we are invulnerable almost certainly marked out for something special but in any event simply not capable of dying not in our present gloriously fresh state of youthful primacy armed forces at war our tutor pointed out are full of barely mature individuals who are perfectly convinced by the proposition it wont happen to me and that significantly this applies to many who have no serious religious faith predisposing them to such wildly optimistic and irrational selfcentredness this is not to say that there arent plenty of others who know perfectly well that it can happen to anybody or that somebody who started out feeling special and invulnerable cannot change into somebody who is rightly terrified by the randomness and capriciousness of fate especially military fate but the vast majority are convinced despite the evidence all around them of that essentially uncaring arbitrariness that nothing bad will happen to them it might be said that we never entirely shake off this feeling no matter how many of our illusions we lose in later life or how let down abandoned and irrelevant we may feel as age extracts its various tolls from us of course this persistence did not in any way mean it might actually be true we had to assume that solipsism was nonsense because otherwise everything else around us was nonsense and irrelevant and the result of a kind of selfinflicted deceit the tutors point though was to provide a kind of check on the wilder excesses of philosophical investigation of course it was always interesting and sometimes worthwhile to speculate on highly outré propositions and explore exquisitely rarefied and unlikely ideas but that ought not to distract one overmuch from the mainstream of philosophical thought or indeed reality whenever one was struck by a previously unlikelyseeming idea that had come to appear plausible or even sensible one ought to apply that test was it inherently any more likely than solipsism if solipsism seemed to make just as much sense then the idea could be dismissed of course the proposition that nothing or at least nobody else in the universe really existed could never be disproved from first principles no evidence that might be produced was capable of convincing somebody fully and determinedly holding this idea that they were not the only thinking feeling thing in existence every apparently external event could be consistently accounted for through strict adherence to that central hypothesis that only ones own mind existed and that one had therefore made up simply imagined all apparent externalities now our tutor pointed out that there was a weakness in the hardline or extreme solipsists position which came down to the question why if they were all that existed they bothered to deceive themselves so why did it appear to the solipsistic entity that there was an external reality in the first place and more to the point why this one specifically why did the solipsist appear to be constrained in any way by that supposedly physically nonexistent and therefore utterly pliable reality often in practice one would be talking to the solipsist concerned in a sheltered institution or outright lunatic asylum why did they appear to be there with all the restrictions such establishments tended to involve rather than living some life of maximally efficient hyperpleasure a god a superheroic masterfigure capable of any achievement or state of bliss through the simple act of thinking of it how this argument affected the individual solipsist apparently depended entirely on their degree of selfdeception and the history and development of their delusional state our tutor informed us but the depressing truth was that it pretty much never resulted in a eureka moment and the solipsist now happily convinced of the existence of other people returning to society as a rational and useful part of it there was inevitably some underlying psychological reason why the individual had retreated to this deceptive bastion of selfish untouchability in the first place and until that had been successfully addressed little real progress towards reality was likely but do you start to appreciate my concerns here i am lying in my hospital bed relatively powerless and certainly obscure unheeded by almost everybody of merely passing interest even to those charged with my care and yet i am convinced that i am merely hiding biding my time before i resume my rightful place in the world indeed in the many worlds before this i had a life of adventure and excitement of great risk and even greater achievement of unarguable importance and prominence and yet now i am here an effectively bedbound nonentity who spends a lot of the time asleep or lying here with my eyes closed listening to the banality of the clinic going on all around me day after almost unchanging day remembering or imagining my earlier life of dashing daring feats of elegance and style and positions of importance and great power attained how likely really is it that these memories are real the more vivid and spectacular they are the more likely perhaps that they are dreams mere notions not the setdown traces of actual historical events what is most likely that these things happened threaded through my life like some charged conducting wire spun through the drab fabric of my existence or that doubtless under the influence of some of the drugs prescribed by the clinic seemingly as a matter of course i have used a febrile undemandedof mind with too much time to think and too little happening in the common weft of reality to distract it to conjure up a theatre of colourful characters and exciting events that flatter my own need to feel important i could easily believe that i am mad or at least selfdeceiving or at the very least that i have been so and that only now am i beginning to grasp the reality of my situation my plight perhaps these very thoughts are the start of the process of me dragging myself out of this pit of lies that i have dug for myself and yet where did all these traces come from where could they have come from whether they are genuine memories of actual events which occurred in the real world or even several real worlds or whether they are stories i have told myself where must they have come from could i really have made them all up or is it not more likely that their very variety and dazzle indicated that they must genuinely have happened if i am so banal and ordinary where did these absurd fancies appear from i must have had some life before i ended up here why should it not be as i appear to recall i think i can remember a common enough upbringing in a world no more exotic than any might appear to an outsider a city a house and home parents friends schooling jobs lusts and loves ambitions fears triumphs and disappointments all seem present and correct if a little vague perhaps due to their very ordinariness all in a minor key though all humdrum everyday unremarkable thats all then my true life as i think of it commenced my entry into the many worlds and lexpédience my dealings with persons and events that were anything but ordinary that was when i became the me i was even if i am temporarily a pale reflection of that person now i shall be that person again i know it but you can see why i might be worried you who might be a part of me or a future self the transitionary did i do what i think i just did surely not if i did id be the first or not of course maybe it happens all the time but they keep it secret this is the concern were dealing with here secrecy comes as standard but wouldnt there be rumours could i have just flitted without septus that isnt supposed to be possible you must have septus the drug is absolutely necessary even if it is not entirely sufficient if an individual is to transition between realities i was out of the stuff theyd taken the emergency pill out of my hollow tooth and taken the tooth itself for good measure i was unconscious but it must have happened because the tooth was gone or it occurs to me i swallowed the pill in a lucid interval between the smack in the face in the plane and waking up tied to the chair which i dont remember or maybe it went down my throat by pure chance when they punched me the punch in the face could easily have dislodged it i swallowed it and they didnt know i had theyd have needed a bulky piece of kit like an nmr scanner or something to have a chance of locating the pill inside my body so even after they found the hollow tooth but they said they had found the hollow tooth and removed the pill why lie about that didnt make sense and why the postflit hangover i didnt even know who i was for the first few seconds and my head still hurts never had that before not even in basic training still even with bits that didnt add up right that was a far more plausible explanation than somebody accomplishing a septusfree flit i had to go with the musthaveswalloweditbyaccident scenario id just got lucky once again anyway whatever i am naked hardly presentable to the outside world so the first thing to do is find some clothes i try the light switches by the door as i pad out of the great ballroom but nothing happens pausing at the tall double doors to the anteroom beyond i listen for any sound that might indicate i am not alone in the palazzo chirezzia quiet as a tomb i shiver as i cross the anteroom and hall making for the central staircase the air is cool but it is the air of ghostly desolation all these rolledup carpets this sheetwrapped furniture and gloomy light and smell of long abandonment that truly affects me i try one of the grand bedrooms on the first floor but the wardrobes and cupboards in the dressing room are empty save for mothballs sitting in little nests of twisted paper or rolling around with dull and lazy clicks in drawers my reflection stares back at me through the shuttered gloom another blandlooking man of generally medium build though reasonably wellmuscled on the second floor one room holds a wardrobe with various sets of clothing some of which might be my size but the clothes look antique i go to the window crack the shutters and look out the people i can see in the calle running along the side of the palace look to be dressed in colourful relatively slimfitting moderately heterogeneous clothes i would guess i am in a fairly standard latetwentieth or earlytwentyfirstcentury degenerate christian highcapitalist reality a greedist world to use the colloquial the fragre certainly feels right probably the same earth i visited before when my little pirate captain tried to recruit me or near as dammit if i did flit away from torture without septus through sheer desperation then a familiar world one id visited before and felt comfortable in but not one theyd expect me to resort to is where i would head for automatically calbefraques might have seemed the obvious destination you might think why didnt i just wake in my own body in my own house in the trees looking out over the town beneath because for years i have known i might turn traitor in deed as well as thought and prepared for it mentally telling myself that in any transition under duress or in a state of semiconsciousness the place i thought of as home would be the last place i ought to aim for all the same i would not have thought id end up here the clothes in this wardrobe are fancy dress i realise ancient costumes for balls and masquerades three rooms later i discover mens clothes of the appropriate era and that fit just dressing makes me feel better there is no hot water in the palazzo chirezzia i wash myself from a bathroom cold tap there is no electric power either but when i remove the sheet from the desk in the professores study and lift the telephone i hear a dialling tone but what to do next i stand there until the phone starts making electronic complaining noises at me i replace it on the cradle im here without money connections and a supply of septus conventionally the first thing i ought to do is establish contact with an enabler or other sympathetic and aware cluedin soul to put myself back in contact with lexpédience and to locate a source of septus but id only be putting myself in jeopardy handing myself back to my earlier captors and my gently talking friend with his sticky tape if i do i have been faced with the choice mrs m always said i would be faced with and i have made my decision it is a big thing that i have done and i am still not entirely certain i have jumped the right way but it is done and i must live with the consequences however the point here is that i will play into the hands of those i oppose if i take the most obvious route and attempt to contact a normally accredited agent of lexpédience in this world the most important thing is to get my hands on some septus without that probably theres little i can do certainly i appear to have flitted once without the aid of the drug however it was in extremis uncontrolled impromptu a surprise even to me when it happened it was to a semirandom location and it resulted in considerable discomfort as well as a state of profound confusion i did not even know who i was initially that lasted quite long enough to have made me extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of the flit had there been anybody who wished me ill present at that point i would have been in their power or worse for all i know i had that one spontaneous flit in me and no more perhaps some residue of septus had built up in my system that allowed me to make that single transition but is now cleared out exhausted and even voluntarily putting myself in another situation as terrifying and threatening as being suffocated while tied to a chair would fail to result in anything more remarkable than me pissing my pants so i need septus and the only supplies of it in this world as in all worlds are supposed to be in the obsessively wary and inveterately paranoid gift of the concern however there ought to be a way round this i run my hand over the sheet covering the seat by the telephone very little dust i sit and start entering short strings of numbers at random into the telephone keypad until i hear a human voice i have forgotten almost all the italian i learned last time so i have to find somebody who shares a language we settle on english the operator is patient with me and finally we establish that what i require is directory enquiries and not here but in britain the concern has boltholes safe houses deepplacement agents and cover organisations distributed throughout the worlds it operates most frequently in as far as i was aware i knew about all the official concern contacts in this reality though of course it would be naive to assume there would be none that had been kept from me however i also knew of one that wasnt an official concern contact because it had been set up by somebody who wasnt part of the concern proper at all the ubiquitous and busy mrs m so she had assured me anyway which town krondien ungalo shupleselli i tell them i ought to be remembering the name correctly we are solemnly assured in training that these emergency codes should be so ingrained within us that we ought still to remember them even if we have through some shock or trauma forgotten our own names this one has been thought up probably by mrs mulverhill rather than some namebadged concern techies in an emergency procedures field operatives steering group committee meeting but like the official codes it ought to work across lots of worlds and languages it will probably sound odd in almost all of them but not to the point of incomprehensibility and it should be far enough removed from the name of any person or organisation to avoid accidental contacts and resultant misunderstandings with possible security implications sorry where it may be a business or a person i dont know the town or city oh i think about it but try london i suggest there is indeed a business answering to that name in the english capital putting you through hello says a male voice it sounds fairly young and just that single word spoken slowly and deliberately had been enough for a tone of caution even nervousness to be evident im looking for krondien ungalo shupleselli i say no kidding now theres a name i havent heard in a while yes i say sticking to the script perhaps you might be able to help well thats what this is all about isnt it may i ask to whom im talking a laugh my names ade aid i ask this seems a little too obvious short for adrian what about yourself i assume you know the procedure what oh yeah im supposed to give you a name that right okeydoke how about fred fred is that common enough as muck mate common as muck trust me indeed i do adrian brill consider yourself sorted what can i do for you mate madame dortolan madame dortolan sat in the rooftop aviary of her house in paris listening to the flurrying of a thousand soft wings and looking out over the darkening city as the street lights came on the view graphed by the bars of the aviary showed deep dark reds and bruised purples towards the northwest where a recently passed rainstorm was retreating towards the sunset the city still smelled of latesummer rain and refreshed foliage somewhere in the distance a siren sounded she wondered how big a city had to become and how lawless and dangerous in this sort of reality for a siren always to be heard somewhere here the siren was like an audible signature of fragre madame dortolan took a breath and said no he must have had another pill hidden somewhere mr kleist stood in the shadows behind and to one side of her seat which was an extravagant work in bamboo with a great fanshaped top he looked about at the various birds still flying within the aviary his head jerked as one flew too close and he ducked involuntarily he shook his head he did not maam i am sure nevertheless he was fully restrained maam it could only have been in his mouth and that was checked very thoroughly both before the interrogation began and afterwards even more thoroughly subsequent to his apparent transition madame dortolan looked unconvinced thoroughly mr kleist produced a little transparent plastic bag from one pocket and placed it on the small cane table standing at the side of her seat she leant over looked at the thirty or so bloodstained teeth inside they are all present he said they are just teeth she looked at them the false one with the cavity was there room inside it for two pills no and the septus pill was removed from it and the tooth itself extracted while he was still unconscious some residue of septus left with the mouth or throat i have already asked our most knowledgeable experts such an effect is next to impossible send these to be analysed all the same of course mr kleist picked up the plastic bag and replaced it in his pocket some sort of osmotic patch or a subcutaneous implant again maam we did check both before and after perhaps up his nose madame dortolan mused more to herself than to mr kleist that might be possible illbred people sometimes make that ghastly snorting pullingback noise with their noses one might ingest a pill in that manner mr kleist sighed it is a theoretical possibility he conceded though not in this case did he make such a noise no maam in fact he was probably incapable of doing so or of performing the action you mention because his nose and mouth were both tightly secured by tape no air movement would have been possible you checked for some infusionary device perhaps something concealed within the rectum activated by she could not think how you would activate something like that we checked the subjects clothing and performed a second internal examination there was nothing an accomplice the septus delivered by a dart or some such thing impossible maam you were alone with him no an assistant was present the assistant is completely trustworthy maam madame dortolan turned to him then unless you were somehow complicit yourself mr kleist it could only be that he was able to ingest a slowrelease pill some time before mr kleist displayed no reaction the arresting interception team assure us this would not have been possible also we took blood samples before and after and there was no sign they must be wrong all the same the results must be wrong have everything analysed again yes maam madame dortolan turned and gazed out over the city as it subsided into darkness strings of street lights curving into the clear distance of rainwashed air after some time she put one hand to her lower lip pinching it and if they are not wrong maam mr kleist said eventually when he began to think that perhaps she had forgotten he was there then she said we would have the most severe problem because we would be faced with somebody who can flit without septus and if they are capable of doing that they could be capable of doing almost anything madame dortolan stopped and thought for a moment that would be a perfectly terrifying prospect even if the individual concerned was utterly loyal she turned and looked at mr kleist she could hardly see him however i do not believe that to be the case it might be wise to act as though it is he suggested provisionally at least there was a small light on the table by her side she clicked it on mr kleist still looked dark dressed in black or something near black his face paler but still in shade that had occurred to me she told him have the husk killed and a full and i do mean full postmortem carried out the person is not a husk maam i dont care i understand maam what about the trackers we have another two teams on him in addition to the one that found him after lord harmyles murder there has been nothing reported so far are they optimistic mr kleist hesitated if they are theyre being unusually reticent about it well never mind how we lost him initially now that he is lost what if he stays lost what will he do next he may already have warned those who were on the list marked for assassination we think somebody must have the backup teams have yet to report a success not even obliq madame dortolan asked pronouncing her name with the sort of acidic tone she usually reserved for mrs mulverhill i thought they definitely got her ah mr kleist said the team report they now think she may have been flitted an instant before the hit so he did warn them somebody did we doubt he had time personally she frowned your assistant heard the names on the list didnt he as i say maam he is above suspicion that is not what you said and nobody is above suspicion then let me rephrase i have complete faith in his loyalty and discretion would you vouch for him with your life mr kleist hesitated i would not go quite that far for anyone maam as you say nobody is entirely above suspicion hmm that list then the people on it we are watching them as closely as we are able to waiting for an opportunity but it is not easy and it is not looking promising obliq and plyte disappeared entirely untrackable and the rest are awkwardly located or staying too firmly in the public eye for us to strike the relevant teams are still primed and in place ready to resume action on your command the moment we have a clear shot he left a pause though of course we have lost the advantage of surprise and concurrency even if we are able to pick one off the rest will become even more suspicious and hard to get at the moment they hear madame dortolan nodded to herself she took a deep breath thus far this has not worked out as we intended no maam she was silent for a few moments a bird cooed somewhere overhead and wings rustled sometimes when one of the birds in the aviary was unwell or had been injured and was hopping about on the floor of the structure brokenwinged or too ill to fly madame dortolan would let the cats in to dispose of the creature she always enjoyed the resulting kerfuffle brief though it usually proved to be she twisted in her chair and looked at kleist what would you do mr kleist if you were me without hesitation he said we find ourselves fighting on two fronts maam that is not supportable i would indefinitely postpone the actions against the council members and withdraw all but the basic tracking teams involved throw everything at oh hes the greater threat madame dortolan narrowed her eyes mr kleist i have worked for decades to get to just this point with the central council if we dont act now there is every chance they will approve the sort of invasively damaging policies that the mulverhill woman has obviously been insinuating into the vacuous heads of an entire generation of students technicians and agents for a decade or more there are too many mulverhills out there and their influence is growing i cant keep swatting them away from all positions of influence for ever we have to act now we may not get another chance kleist looked unimpressed maam i think the moment has passed for now another may present itself in time in the meantime nobody seems to have any proof that you were behind the actions against the other council members or be prepared to speculate openly on the matter so we have established as it were a stable front there mr oh especially if he is allied with mulverhill is an immediate and dynamic threat also once hes dealt with we may be able to make it look as though he and mulverhill were behind the attacks on the council members madame dortolan unwound herself in her seat to sit forward again looking away from him she released a long deflating sigh sadly annoyingly she said in a quiet voice i think youre right mr kleist was silent for a few moments his expression did not change he said shall i issue the relevant orders please do he turned to go mr kleist he turned back maam madame dortolan had turned to look at him again i take this very personally and very ill i shall expect mr oh to pay for this in person once he has served whatever other purposes we require of him i think i might ask you to tutor me in some of the techniques you employed in your earlier profession so that i might apply them to him and mulverhill for that matter i severely doubt shes innocent in all this mr kleist gave a small bow i am at your disposal maam there was a small smile on madame dortolans thin lips her papercut smile as he thought of it the image brought with it as it always did the memory of the scent of lemons and the echo of longfaded screams she waved one hand thank you thatll be all he turned again and had walked more two steps when she said mr kleist he turned and looked back still untroubled the lady was known for using this little technique yes maam the birds were almost silent now settled in for the night what was it they used to call you the moralist was it the philosopher maam ah yes so was it agreeable to be taking up your old profession again he looked at her for a moment why maam he said quietly we barely began he regarded her a moment longer but no not especially he bowed and walked away the pitcher mike esteros is sitting at the bar of the commodore hotel venice beach after yet another unsuccessful pitch technically he doesnt know its unsuccessful yet but hes developing a nose for these things and hed put money on another rejection its starting to get him down he still believes in the idea and hes still sure itll get made one day plus he knows that attitude is everything in this business and he must remain positive if he doesnt believe in himself why should anybody else but well all the same the bar is quiet he wouldnt normally drink at this time of day maybe he needs to adjust the plot make it more familyoriented focus on the boy on the father son thing cute it up a little more a dusting of schmaltz never did any harm well no real harm maybe hes been believing too much in the basic idea assuming that because its so obvious to him what a beautiful elegant thing it is itll be obvious to everybody else and theyll be falling over themselves to greenlight it and give him lots of money and dont forget goldmans law nobody knows anything nobody knows what will work thats why they make so many remakes and part twos what looks like lack of imagination is really down to too much as execs visualise all the things that could go wrong with a brand new untested idea going with something containing elements that definitely worked in the past removes some of the terrifying uncertainty what mikes got here is a radical leftfield idea the central concept is almost too original for its own good thats why it needs a generous helping of conventionality slathered over it hell rework it again its not a prospect that fills him with joy frankly but he guesses that it has to be done and he has to struggle on its worth it he still believes in it its just a dream but its a dream that could be made real and this is the place where that happens your dreams not just of your idea but of your future self your fortunes get turned into reality here he still loves this place still believes in it mike leaves the bar goes outside and sits on a bench watching the ocean watching the people pass on the tarmac strip and on the sands themselves roller skating boarding strolling playing frisbee just walking a girl comes and sits on the bench too well woman she might be mikes age he starts talking to her shes cute and friendly and smart rangy and dark nice laugh just his type a lawyer on a day off just relaxing monica he asks does she want a drink and she says maybe a herbal tea and they sit in a little café still within sight of the beach then they go for dinner in a little vietnamese place a short walk away mike gives her the pitch because shes genuinely interested she thinks its a great idea it actually seems to make her thoughtful later they walk on the beach in the light of a halfmoon then sit and theres some kissing and a modest amount of fooling around though shes already told him she doesnt go any further on a first date him too he tells her though strictly speaking thats nonsense and he guesses that she guesses this but doesnt care then in the middle of a tight embracing kiss something changes he feels it happen and when he opens his eyes the moon has gone the air feels cooler and the beach looks narrower and steeper and leads down to a sea thats much calmer than the one that was there just seconds ago there are islands out there dark shapes under the stars covered in trees he shakes his head looks at monica he starts back instinctively crabbing away from her on all fours shes changed completely too white blonde shorter face quite different there are a couple of guys the only other people on the beach standing massively about ten feet away watching them she dusts her hands and rises standing in front of the two men mr esteros she says welcome to your new home patient i have been violated my worst nightmares have come true well not my worst but some pretty bad ones fondled grabbed molested in my own bed thankfully i woke in time and was able to defend myself and shout and scream to summon help but all the same it was day afternoon an hour after lunch and i was in that state it pleases me to remain in for much of the time now neither awake nor asleep but lying with my eyes closed listening a little and thinking a lot i heard somebody come into my room and though i did not hear the door close i noticed a diminution of the sounds from outside in the rest of the clinic that ought to have alerted me but i suppose i had grown complacent since the bizarre turn of events with the nonsensetalking and so on i have spent less time traipsing the corridors and day rooms of the institution and more time in bed it seemed to me that the other patients and inmates were looking at me oddly and a few even tried to engage me in conversation in what certainly sounded like the start of more of that gibberish language often with big smiles on their faces that obviously meant they were in on the joke and just wanted to join in and make fun of me i would turn aside from them and walk away with all the dignity i could when that fat fellow came into my room a couple of days ago the one who brought the skinny young man in when i was making words up i hid under the bed sheets and wrapped the pillow over my head he spoke to me gently trying i could tell from the tone of his voice to get me to come out but i wouldnt when he tried to lift up the sheets to look in on me in my little impromptu tent i slapped his hand away and hissed he sighed heavily one of those verymuchforpublicconsumption sighs and left shortly afterwards the medical staff continue to care for me they make me get out of bed each day and have me sit by the side of it and once or twice they have insisted that i accompany one of them on a walk up and down the corridor though i draw the line at entering the day room with them they seem happy enough that i am still mobile i suppose i shuffle a little more than i did not really picking my feet up properly but that is all part of my disguise as well the less fit and able and the quieter i appear the more i seem like just another patient i fit in better the doctors still call in occasionally and the lady doctor who has shown interest in me before came and sat with me for almost half an hour last week she talked slowly to me i understood most of what she said i think and shone bright lights into my eyes then today the violation i did not open my eyes to see who might have come into the room i felt the bedclothes being shifted and thought that perhaps a doctor was going to examine me though whoever it was didnt smell like a doctor probably not an orderly or a cleaning assistant either for the same reason they sometimes tidy me up if ive eaten messily or ive slumped awkwardly in my bed if id had to guess id have said it might be another patient though not one of the more unpleasantly scented ones i foolishly thought that whoever it was might take the hint that i was asleep or pretending to be asleep and therefore did not want to be woken up but then i felt the sheets being pulled out somewhere down near my hip i could feel air enter the warm mustiness of the bed just there what was going on i wondered then a hand touched my hip the fingers seeming to prod at first then lifting and clutching at the material of my pyjamas as though trying to tug them up what did they think they were doing did they think i was wearing a nightgown i still did not open my eyes thinking that whoever this incompetent was it would only embarrass them if i confronted them one ought always to keep the medical staff on ones side and so should avoid making them feel awkward the hand gave up the vain attempt to pull my pyjama bottoms up and reached out over my crotch and slipped into the open fly of the pyjama bottoms fumbling for and closing on my manhood squeezing it once and then reaching down to hold my testes i opened my eyes an instant after the light clicked out it was not afternoon at all it was dark now with the light out late evening or night i felt confused disoriented the hand withdrew immediately from my private parts and the shadowy barely glimpsed figure at the side of my bed rose hurriedly with a grunting distressed noise and was gone before i could glimpse who it might have been leaving the door swinging still further open as they ran down the corridor slippers they were wearing slippers from the sound of it and they could not run very fast i thought of getting up and giving chase but it would have taken too long i shouted for help instead but the cheek the nerve the banal sordidness of it is this what im reduced to being the sexual plaything of some drooling subsentient inmate of a benighted cretin depository like this the shame of it with my past my achievements my status and i swear my still unfulfilled promise the philosopher there was only one occasion on which i intervened when technically i should not have i used my seniority to take a subject from the operative they had been assigned to he was supposedly just subject to us but i had seen his name and details on the system and had been intrigued it was partly because of him that i had offered my services to the police and security service when id left the army he was something of a hero to me and a lot of other people what was he doing in our clutches his case file spoke of an assault on a prominent person and suspected membership of a terrorist group or a related organisation the second part of the charge might mean almost nothing some wit in our office had pointed out that the law regarding related organisations and having some sort of connection to terrorist groups was so vaguely and widely drawn that technically it included us it was the sort of thing you charged people with when you didnt know what else to charge them with but didnt want to let them go when you just suspected them generally this man had been in the police ten years ago when the terrorist threat was just starting to become serious hed been in a unit that had captured a couple of terrorists who had been planting bombs in various public places in litter bins in railway and bus stations and in busy thoroughfares killing a few people and injuring dozens when they were picked up there had been some sort of breakdown in communication between different parts of their terrorist cell and detailed warnings had been sent for the latest batch of bombs before all of them had been planted a quickthinking officer had sent police to the sites relating to the warnings and both men had been caught though not before they had already planted at least one other bomb not covered by the original warning the suspects were split up and one was questioned conventionally the other one who had been in the charge of the police officer who was now our subject had been questioned rather more forcefully by him and had revealed the location of the bomb that he and his accomplice had already planted police officers dispatched to the location were able to evacuate the area and prevent any deaths or injuries when the bomb detonated just a quarterhour later it was one of the few unqualified successes of those early years the identity of the officer who would become our subject was discovered by the press and he was acclaimed as a hero both in the papers and by the mass of the public as a man who had done something distasteful but necessary the means he had employed to produce the lifesaving results were also discovered he had been tearing out the terrorists fingernails with a pair of pliers there was no detail on how many hed had to remove like this before achieving cooperation this is one of those amateurish but fairly effective techniques you hear about sometimes despite the fact that lives had been saved and the terrorist himself was still very much alive certain sections of the press and some politicians nevertheless wanted the man to be prosecuted and thrown out of the police force for what he had done eventually as i recalled he was hounded out of the force and was charged with criminal assault he refused defence counsel saying he would defend himself then at the trial he said nothing he was jailed for only a couple of years but things went badly for him in prison and he spent nearly ten years inside in that time his children grew up and his wife divorced him moving away and remarrying he had slipped from public consciousness in the intervening decade filled as it was with so much violence and treachery he had been released earlier this year and now had ended up in the hands of the police again scheduled to be questioned i felt there was an untold story here and there were puzzling details that i had never heard had been cleared up i was unable to contain my curiosity and took over the case myself this was not actually against regulations but it was highly irregular the sort of thing you could get away with once or twice but which done consistently would be noted in your file he was an ordinarylooking man medium build pale skin short receding brown hair and a resigned beaten look on his face there might have been some defiance in his eyes though perhaps that was just my own prejudice he had been beaten up at some point in the last few days judging from the bruising on his face he was still dressed and his hands were handcuffed and chained to the floor behind him though he was otherwise unrestrained and was seated normally i sat in front of him in another chair i even put myself within kicking distance of his feet with nothing in between which i would never normally do a junior officer sat to one side monitoring the recording equipment but took no part in the subsequent proceedings i began by asking subject if he was who i thought he was he confirmed that he was we used his real first name throughout it was jay i asked him why he thought he was here he laughed bitterly i hit the wrong person i asked who that might have been the son of the justice minister he gave a sour smile i asked why he had hit him because im sick to the back teeth of vicious ignorant dickheads telling me what a fucking hero i am i asked him if he meant because of what had happened with the terrorist he had tortured to discover the location of the bomb jay shook his head and looked away oh let me guess im a hero figure to people like you would that be right i said that many people admired what he had done amongst them certainly myself yeah well you would wouldnt you he replied i asked if he meant because of what he obviously and correctly took to be my role he nodded because youre a torturer he said he looked straight into my eyes as he said this i am well used to staring people down but he would not look away i told him that even if i was not i would still admire him because of what he had done you and every other idiot he said he said it more with resignation than defiance thought there was an understandable hint of nervousness too he swallowed conspicuously i asked if he didnt feel proud of what he had done no he said no i fucking dont but he had saved lives i pointed out i did what i thought i had to do jay said would he do the same thing again knowing what he did now i dont know why not i asked because i dont know what might have happened differently if i hadnt done it probably nothing would have been any different so i suppose i might as well have done what i did a few people may still be alive who wouldnt have been otherwise but who knows we havent got a time machine what did he think might have happened differently we might not live in a society where people live in fear of people like you he told me he shrugged but like i say probably it would still all have worked out just like it is now i dont kid myself that what i might have done differently would have made any difference i said i thought he was wrong to assume the current state of our society was somehow his fault the fault lay with the people who threatened our society terrorists radicals leftists liberals and other traitors those who would like to tear down the state either through direct action or through using words and propaganda to influence the more gullible sections of the masses to do their dirty work for them yeah you would think that too jay sounded tired i told him i thought it was tough that hed ended up in prison he should never have been prosecuted in the first place and certainly should never have been found guilty he should have been given a medal not sent to prison that had probably ruined his life especially as they had kept him in for so long here we go he said sounding tired again you dont understand anything do you if he thought that i said perhaps he ought to tell me what he thought i ought to understand i insisted that i should be prosecuted i demanded that i be prosecuted i refused a defence because id wanted to plead guilty but they wouldnt let me they threatened my family so i had to plead innocent but then i offered no defence and so i was found guilty they sentenced me to two years but the correct sentence the least anybody else would have got would have been nine years so i made sure i stayed in prison for that amount of time having time added is not difficult jay smiled without humour and when i got out i told anybody who accused me of being a hero that they were an idiot and people who said i should have got a medal to fuck off finally when one guy got too insistent about how big a hero i was and how he could make sure that i did get a medal i hit him only it turned out he was the son of the justice minister like i said and thats why im here i told him i didnt understand why had he wanted to be prosecuted why had he wanted to be found guilty why had he wanted to be locked up for nine years jay sounded animated at last he held his head up because i believe in justice he spat that word out i believe in the law that word too i did something wrong something against the law and i needed to be punished for it it was wrong that i was going to be let off for it even more wrong that people wanted to give me medals for it but he hadnt done something wrong i suggested he had saved innocent lives and helped defeat those who would bring society down it was still against the law he shouted dont you see if the law means anything then i couldnt be above it not just because i was a police officer or because my breaking it had resulted in some lives being saved thats not the point torture was illegal id broken the law cant you see any of this he shook his the chair rattling the chains attaching his handcuffs to the floor its even more important to prosecute police whove broken the law than it is to prosecute anybody else because otherwise nobody trusts the police i pointed out that the forceful questioning of suspects was now entirely if unfortunately legal even if it hadnt been then forceful questioning you mean torture if that was what he wanted to call it but why hadnt he made his feelings clear to all these newspapers that wanted to talk to him or at his trial where of all places he was guaranteed a fair hearing jay looked at me scornfully do you really think the papers print what people actually say i mean if its not what their proprietors or the government want everybody to hear he shook his head same at the trial i said that i still thought he was being too harsh on himself he had done the right thing he looked tired and defeated now and we had as i have made clear applied no physical pressure whatsoever to him up to this point the thing is he said maybe in the same situation even knowing what i know now id still do the same thing id still tear that christian bastards nails out get him to talk find out where the bomb was hope that the plods got the right street the right end of it the right fucking city he looked at me with what might have been defiance or even a sort of pleading but id still insist that i was charged and prosecuted he shook his head again dont you see you cant have a state where torture is legal not for anything you start saying its only for the most serious cases but that never lasts it should always be illegal for everybody for everything you might not stop it laws against murder dont stop all murders do they but you make sure people dont even think about it unless its a desperate situation something immediate and you have to make the torturer pay in full there has to be that disincentive or theyll all be at it he raised his head and looked about him his gaze obviously being meant to take in not just the room we were in but the whole building maybe even more than that or you end up with this he looked at me with you whoever you are i thought about this it seemed to me that the fellows mind had been broken in prison probably but that he had also probably always been an idealist he certainly sounded like one now almost like a fanatic nevertheless had it been up to me id have released him frankly however it was not up to me there was highlevel interest in this case for one thing and an accusation of having aided terrorist groups could not simply be ignored he was right in that the law had to be obeyed i thought of handing him over to one of the younger people who would not have heard of him but decided on reflection to question him myself determining that i would be more lenient than they given that i knew the unfortunate circumstances that had led him here accordingly we employed the gagging tapesuffocation method jay admitted nothing regarding membership or support of clandestine or illegal organisations or even any sympathy with them or indeed any outright criticism of the state until approximately the average degree of pressure had been applied whereupon displaying all the standard and expected signs of distress he informed us that hed admit to anything of course he would this was what hed meant he claimed people would admit to anything the only real truth that torture produced was that people would admit to anything to get the torture to stop even if they knew that the admissions they were being called upon to make would eventually prove fatal for them or others the whole process was pointless and cruel and a waste he claimed a state that allowed or condoned torture lost part of its soul he said he then pleaded directly with me to stop and reiterated that he would admit to anything we wanted him to admit to and sign anything we put in front of him i chose not to point out that what he had just endured was not true torture by my definition as it had not involved any actual pain or physical damage just great discomfort and distress that notwithstanding i terminated the interrogation at that point with i will own no small degree of relief before he could admit to anything specific that we might be obliged to follow up jay was released the following day i filed a report that implied we had been considerably more severe with him than we had in fact been guessing that this was all that had been desired by the powers that be in the first place and our skills and facilities had in effect been used as a means of punishment rather than as they were supposed to be to discover the truth a use of our time and resources concerning which i need hardly emphasise i was in some disapproval if of course powerless to prevent sadly a month later we read that jay our subject the onetime police officer who had been a hero to many of us had taken his own life throwing himself underneath the wheels of one of the trucks that deliver giant rolls of paper to newspaper printing presses one of my colleagues pointed out that suicide too was technically illegal which to me seemed ironic as well as very sad subject only one person was ever truly kind to her it was one of the brush ladies there were various brush ladies they were all small and dark and hunched they had brushes that sucked at the air or that swallowed dust from the floor and from lights overhead the brush ladies only came at night a man who was taller than them came with them and told them what to do she liked the brush ladies because they did not hurt her they left her alone she had been afraid of them at first because everything that happened here hurt her or confused her and they obviously belonged to this place and so she was scared of them but in time she stopped being frightened and started to look forward to seeing them because they were not like the others the others hurt her the others had clipboard things and electrical things and torches they shone in her eyes and small hard heavy things they spoke into they had glass things that they used to put liquids into her these were called syringes also they had wires that they attached to her lots of wires some tubes too mostly wires the tubes hurt more than the wires but the wires could hurt as well they all wore white coats or pale blue uniforms the hurt came from fire in her veins usually though they had other sorts of pain they could make her feel it depended some of the others did not wear white coats or pale blue uniforms but dressed like ordinary people did these ones just sat around and stared at her she got the impression that they could do things inside her head this was because when she tried to think herself away from here to escape the way she had escaped from things before before she had been brought here the sitting people would close their eyes or bunch their fists or sit forward suddenly and she could feel them in her head pulling her away from anywhere she might find safety or at least a temporary numbing of the pain even when she was awake she heard voices and saw ghosts when they put the liquids into her at night she went to sleep and had bad dreams as well at first there had been little time to watch the brush ladies or try to talk to them before sleep rose up within her and dragged her down to where the nightmares waited then she had thought that the brush ladies were a part of the bad dreams but gradually she found that each night she stayed awake a little longer before falling asleep or perhaps the brush ladies came earlier she wasnt sure sometimes after they had put the nighttime liquids into her one of the others would come to check on her she would pretend to be asleep the next morning when they wanted her to wake up and be washed and fed before they started to do things to her she would pretend to stay asleep gradually they put less liquid in the syringe each night before the lights were dimmed she still pretended to be asleep in the evening but she woke up on time in the morning they seemed satisfied with this she was happy because now she got to watch the brush ladies she tried talking to them but they ignored her or when they did come over to talk to her they did not speak the same language but then one of them seemed to change and appeared to understand her and talked to her the brush lady who talked to her always wore a grey cloth tied round her head she was sure that this brush lady had been one of the ones who had not been able to talk to her in her own language so she was surprised that now suddenly she could still that was good even so she still didnt understand everything the brush lady said sometimes it sounded as though she was talking to herself or using the sort of complicated mysterious words that the others did the ones who hurt her sometimes the brush lady with the grey cloth went back to not talking to her or seemed not to be able to understand her again that was confusing the greycloth brush lady seemed different on the nights when she did talk to her compared to the nights when she didnt she walked differently stood differently she was the same all the time when the man who shouted was there then when he had definitely gone she became slightly different if she was going to talk to her perhaps nobody else would have noticed what changed in the brush lady with the grey cloth but she did she was able to see these things she was special and could see things other people didnt that was just one of the special things that she could do one of the things that had made her different and worse compared to everybody else these things had made her a problem child and educationally special and developmentally and socially challenged before theyd decided she was disturbed and a delinquent and a danger to herself and others the others would always try to protect themselves she understood that finally these things had caused her to have a breakdown and so she had to be committed into indefinite nonelective longterm institutional care with immediate effect and so here she was in this longterm care it had led to a hospital like a prison and then to another one which was the same but different and then to this place which was worse than either of the hospitalprisons because here even the people supposed to be looking after her hurt her worse she couldnt even use the things that made her special to get away from the being hurt also she couldnt retaliate she could not hurt people who hurt her because they had these people in plain clothes who sat around her the ones who sat watching her and did the eyesqueezing fistpumping hunchedover thing or maybe it was because they put the liquids into her using the syringes these things put her to sleep or made her just too woozy to think or aim straight here are some of the things that the greycloth brush lady said to her hello how are you what have they got you on what do they call you subject seven well thats caring remember me how are you what have they done to you evening me again i dont even recognise this what the hell is it oh hey subject seven been a while hows things shit what are they pumping are you with us seven are you anybody left in there fuck you poor kid yes theyve seen something in you havent they something they think they can use mmhmm fate help us all what oh i wish i could what are they doing to you now you poor and so on and so on she replied by saying things like these i spy montys video rent me a sunder ill have that child frashed so elp me crivens mr givens youll be the deaf of me swear i never heard of such a thing on me muvvers grave theres a thing oi sat in a satin stain spot of block and truckle never hurt nobody alignment ill show you alignment you arrant plopinjay bend over so help me hold fast there bothers and cistern we shall not face such girlsterous times alone clunch can you can you hear me listen i cant get you out of here seven not in any way physically or otherwise minor miracle im here never thought id work so hard to get back in i dont think you can understand a damn thing can you but for the record in case you somehow can or one day will youve made it worth it all by yourself just to get to see what theyll do what they want what risks theyll take how low theyll stoop but look maybe things will change now listen kid you do whatever you need to do to make things easy on yourself okay go along do you understand do something of what they want but keep a true core inside you a soul of rebelliousness an anger not a fear one day youll be free and then well see what we can do i might be there then if i am remember me good luck well met by sunlight well greet by sinlight stroke me a clyper the greycloth lady often touched her she would stroke her hand or pat her arm or smooth her hair off her forehead she did that again now brushing hair from her brow liquid in the light she could see that there was liquid on the greycloth brush ladys cheek tears that was strange for some reason shed thought that only she made tears not anybody else then the greycloth brush lady went away with the rest of the cleaners she never came back the transitionary after the great septennial extravaganza under the dome of the mists i was no longer madame dortolans golden boy i was not at all sure that i ever had been despite what mrs mulverhill might have believed but certainly i was no longer i must have passed whatever test she had arranged around that consummately bizarre serial twoperson orgy she took me on because i survived in the immediate thereafter and there were no further interrogations but she felt that i had insulted her obviously and now i would be made to pay i was still convinced that the whole point of the exercise had been to test how easily i could be couriered and to give the trackers spotters and foreseers who were undoubtedly in attendance nearby something to work on like handing a sniffer hound a piece of clothing belonging to the person you wanted to track and if there had been any personal component madame dortolan feeling some curious form of jealousy regarding myself and mrs mulverhill perhaps then surely that had been entirely subordinate to the infinitely more important business of ensuring the security of the concern nevertheless i knew i had insulted her and she had taken it very badly i had not reacted as i had been expected to required to i had shown some distaste even arguably some disgust certainly not the awed stunned perhaps embarrassed perhaps humbled respect i believe she had anticipated and was convinced should be rightfully hers in the end on any absolute scale it had been no great hurt the average person must endure absorb and forget a hundred equivalent or worse insults and denigrations each year but for a person of madame dortolans unparalleled importance and continually reinforced pride the very unexpectedness of it had magnified the offence and made it loom all the larger set against the otherwise smoothly functioning progressions of her remorselessly flourishing life for a few months afterwards i was rested and given no assignments at all but from then on i was sent on gradually more difficult and hazardous missions for lexpédience i was allowed to spend less and less time in my house in the trees on the ridge above flesse i spent my days instead spread serially far across the many worlds engaging in feats of derringdo closequarter assassination and outright thuggery gradually even the house at flesse stopped seeming the sanctuary it had been and when i had discretionary use of septus i would holiday if that is the right word in the world containing the venice where i had met and lost my little pirate captain wandering like a lost soul across its historyscorched face becoming familiar with that single embodiment of a world crippled by its legacy of recent cruelties and a selflacerating worship of the proceeds of selfishness and greed again this was your world and i guarantee that in many ways i know it better than you there is a saying that some foolish people believe what does not kill you makes you stronger i know for a fact having seen the evidence indeed often enough having been the cause of it that what does not kill you can leave you maimed or crippled or begging for death or in one of those ghastly twilights experienced and one has to hope that that is entirely not the right word by those in a lockedin or persistent vegetative state in my experience the same people also believe that everything happens for a reason given the unalleviatedly barbarous history of every world we have ever encountered with anything resembling man in it this is a statement of quite breathtakingly casual retrospective and ongoing cruelty tantamount to the condonation of the most severe and unforgivable sadism nevertheless as much through chance i am sure as through any innate skill or other natural quality i survived these trials and did indeed grow more skilled more capable and more adept at all the arcane ethically dubious technically overspecialised and frankly disreputable techniques required i did however grow more frightened too because with every new mission and each required highrisk intervention attack or killing i knew that my gradually perfecting skills would not save me when my luck ran out indeed that they would stand for precisely nothing when the moment came as it surely must and that with every new mission i upped the chances of this one being my last not through any lessening of my preparation creativity vigilance or skill but due to the simple workingout of statistical chance i had already long forgotten most of the interventions i had taken part in then later could not recall how many people i had harmed or injured or left disabled or terrified for life eventually to my shame i even lost count of those id killed i think there is a kind of queasily mixed emulsion of guilt and fatalism that settles on a man or woman engaged in such deadly fatal work i mean deadly to those we target fatal only potentially to ourselves but still eventually if we keep going long enough always guaranteed to be terminal we come to know that the end cannot be evaded for ever and the terror of that knowledge the increasing certainty that every successful mission and every triumphant sidestepping of death this time only makes it more likely that the next risk we take could be the one that finally takes us makes us more and more nervous neurotic unbalanced and psychologically fragile and i believe if we are involved with the business of killing others and have any sort of conscience at all and even if we know that we fight the good fight and do what we do for the best of motives a part of us if we are honest with ourselves comes to look forward to that end begins even to welcome its increasingly likely arrival if nothing else it will bring an end to worry an end to guilt and nightmares both waking and sleeping an end to tics neuroses and psychoses too an end to seemingly always finding myself in the body and mind of somebody with ocd and that being the one trait that transfers i might have said no i might have resigned but stupid pride an urge not to be beaten or cowed by anybody including madame dortolan even if she was now the undisputed head of the whole concern kept me going until when that initial impetus fell away and i might have justly claimed id made my point and stepped away the resigned fatalism and thirst for it all to end and end as it had taken place so far as though only that could somehow justify and make sense of everything id done took over enabling and diseasing me at once so by the time i might have thought myself able to relinquish the role i had played it was too late to do so i was another person we all are anyway with every passing instant even without the many worlds changing from moment to moment waking to waking our continuity found as much within the context of others and our institutions but how much more so for those of us who jump from soul to soul world to world mind to mind context to context husk to husk leaving who knows what behind picking up who knows what from whom i thought my time had come on a few occasions most recently when i was chasing a disgraced caudillo out of his estancia down the steps and into the manhigh grasses of one of the great bluegreen fields that stretched to the horizon he fumbled the revolver as he plunged nearly falling down the broad stone steps trying both to hold his trousers up as he went and to avoid tripping over the broad red sash that was supposed to secure them id surprised him both in flagrante and on the toilet both bucking and straining under a straddling slave girl i swear peoples sexual predilections never cease to astound me and youd have thought by now that i could reasonably claim id seen it all wrong again hed thrown the girl at me and so bought himself enough time to start running once hed tripped over the still twitching bodies of his two guards in the hall outside i disentangled myself from the screaming girl then had to punch her with my free noncutlassheaving hand when she came flying at me nails out the local gods alone knowing why finally i set off in pursuit roaring for effect i dont even know where the pistol came from i stooped and plucked it from the ground as the caudillo disappeared into the grasses screaming hysterically not loaded well done i pushed it into my waistband anyway and followed the trail of tall broken grasses slackening my pace a little then a lot ahead of me the caudillo had the hard job pushing into and trampling over the fingerthick stalks leaving me with a path that a onelegged blind man could have followed and still gained on his quarry the wind sighed across the tops of the grasses somewhere over my head and for a moment i was back in a banlieue just beyond the périphérique vaulting a burnedout car and chasing after the two young maghrebis whod thought to try and rape the girl in the tower block wed just left all gallant stuff and she would allegedly turn into either a cowed failed little thing whod jump with her baby from the roof of this very block before she was twenty or a noted authority on psychosemantics whatever that was at the universities of trier and cairo according to whether the mooted violation took place or not the boys had a bottle of nitric with them i was supposed to use it to do to them what theyd been going to do to her after theyd fucked her otherwise theyd try again but before i could catch them they leapt a wall and fell ten metres into a newly dug hole for a métro line extension one had time to scream before he hit the concrete the other didnt scamp must have been between breaths parkour ninjas only in their playstation avatar forms theyd both tumbled as they went and so hit head first id just got to the wall i still think i heard both necks snap though it could have been their skulls popping i suppose the smashed bottle of nitric pooled around their bodies raising fumes except this time they both scrambled up a chainlink fence into an electricity substation and started running across the top of the humming machinery leaping equipment like hurdlers they disappeared together inside a single titanic blue flash that wrecked my night vision and produced a concussive bang that left my ears ringing i bounced to a stop against the fence wait this hadnt happened id almost jumped the wall too not been about to go geckoing up some chainlink and start dancing across the busbars and then i was back in the bluegreen field of giant grass again still pacing heavily after the increasingly desperate caudillo i could hear his panting breaths mingled with gasped gulped pleas for mercy somewhere ahead the path he was leaving was curved he might be trying to circle back to the buildings having worked out that he stood no chance while having to blaze the trail for both of us through the stiff resistant crop but no i was charging down a hillside favela in bahia jumping empty oil cans and screaming at the departing back of another skinny young kid blurring through the crowds of shouting people this one i just had to scare i was supposed to be mistaken for an undercover cop and she was supposed to become a famous violinist not a drug courier she ran into the first big street at the bottom of the hill and missed getting flattened by a truck by about a centimetre the truck swerved half toppled a man on a motorbike went full speed into the side of it nearly taking his head off flopping dead the girl disappeared down an alley on the far side of the traffic and i stopped stooped hands on knees to get my breath back i felt dizzy staggered to one side and then the stagger turned into a run i was still pelting down the alley after her i shouted her name and she half turned immediately before she reached the street long brown hair flung out to the side just for a moment the truck hit her full on and tossed her into the oncoming stream of traffic sending her spinning dollloose under a bus making it bounce on her body like it had gone over a speed bump i skidded stopping so fast against a corner that my sunglasses fell off what the fuck was going on i hesitated as i paced after the caudillo then kept on going cutlass raised shaking my head to loose the bizarrely vivid feeling of having just relived the recent past cutlass they wanted cutlass they would get it had some historical meaning apparently at any rate there would be no comeback now no triumphal return no matter how undeserved ask not oh ask then the answer is a corrupt press the manipulations of a foreign power and rich influential families bribing thugs and judges any incompetence any evil can be washed away with sufficient muscle and money but not for our boy here not for this version in this iteration of the world the trail was still curving back round through the grass it was a little narrower now too less wasteful the caudillo must be getting half clever trying to slip between the stalks rather than batter and stumble his way over them i upped my pace to a normal walk still puzzling over what was happening with these notquitemorethan flashbacks i found the caudillos scarlet waistsash first scribbled like a trail of rather too neat blood on the flattened grass and then the man himself lying in the grass chest heaving tears streaming pants still at threequarter mast air whistling in and out of his gaping mouth his hands clasped in front of him as though in prayer while he pleaded with me and offered rapidly increasing sums to let him go i swivelled the cutlass in the most economical of backstrokes the grass constricted matters and the bastard twisted rolled and suddenly had a tiny silvery twoshot upandover pistol in his quivering hands pointed right at my face in that instant i had time to see that the gun might be small but the barrels each looked wide enough to stick a little finger down and not get it wedged and the range was laughable how slowly my arm seemed to be moving as it brought the cutlass round and down had i time to flit away not quite but i could start the process you never knew so those flashbacks that were not quite and rather more than flashbacks had been some sort of premonition of things going terminally wrong that was what theyd meant theyd been a warning how foolish of me to ignore my own subconscious i thought though it did also occur to me that a simple but very strong urge to take off after the caudillo and his girly cries waving a highpowered handgun might have been a still simpler and less ambiguous hint but a cutlass they had wanted and where would people like me be if we didnt even have the weaselly excuse of just obeying orders this was taking too long i thought i could hear the swish of the cutlass edge tearing through the air as it accelerated and feel its tip connecting with a couple of the closest stalks of grass as it passed a blade amongst blades the caudillos fist the one holding the gun jerked once there was a click no more gun jammed or safety still on or also not loaded of course precedent the fumbled pistol dropped on the steps the man had made an unholy mess of running the country why expect him to be competent with a gun didnt particularly matter the scimitars curved blade hit the blubbering caliph on one arm then the other slicing all four bones and sending two halved forearms and the gun tumbling into the rushes wait a minute the return stroke took the shrieking mans head off i was already flitting away though whether from sighing bluegreen grass in greater patagonia or tall rushes within the sunlit marshes of new mesopotamia i was no longer sure patient i must have made myself understood to the medical staff somehow initially i did no more than blow off steam to the nurse who came grumbling to investigate my shouting in the middle of the night the fellow looked like he had just woken up despite the fact he was meant to be fully awake during his night shift he gave no sign of understanding what i was saying i was talking in my own language and so i did not expect him to he made soothing noises in between his yawns and tucked my bed sheets back in then he patted my hand took my pulse put a hand on my forehead and then after scribbling something on my notes left i stayed awake for some time heart beating fast mentally daring the pervert whod tried to interfere with me to come back i have a weapon i can use eventually i must have fallen asleep and only woke up later than usual as breakfast was served but one of the trainee doctors appeared later that morning and asked me slowly in the local language what had disturbed me during the night i told her what had happened or what had nearly happened as best i could with my still rudimentary vocabulary and she made some notes and left another doctor i havent seen before arrives after lunch she is a solid squareset woman with nononsense glasses and a mass of bleached blonde hair swept up and gathered in a bun from which a variety of curled wisps have escaped caught in the afternoon sun flooding into the room they look like solar flares she treats me like an idiot she speaks very slowly and carefully and asks me i am pretty sure did something bad happen to me i think i am right in nodding indicating that it did she asks me if i would like to come with her so that we can talk about it somewhere else i try to make it clear that right here in the security and comfort of my own room is just fine but she looks very concerned and talks over my halting attempts at her language and says well go to her office i try to protest but eventually she calls on an orderly and over my protests that this is tantamount to another assault i am helped into a wheelchair and taken along the corridor down to the ground floor in a large creakily protesting lift and along the corridor underneath the one we just left until we get to what i assume is her office situated if my navigational skills have not entirely deserted me somewhere close to the day room where the usual cast of droolers slackjaws and incontinencepad habitués will be congregating about now to argue over the choice of afternoon tv channel she thanks the orderly closes the door behind her and after some smiles and soothing words she sits me to the side of her desk while she moves her chair so that we are sitting quite close together at the corner of the desk she produces two dolls from a drawer the dolls look as though they have been knitted from vaguely fleshcoloured wool one is dressed like a girl one like a boy and they both have blank faces she hands me the girl doll for some reason and seems to want me to use it to indicate where i might have been touched when the interfering miscreant came to my room last night i sigh lift up the skirt of the girl doll at least it is not embarrassingly anatomically correct with only a little sewn line to indicate the female genital area and point at its crotch she holds the male doll up and asks do i want it as well i nod and she hands me the male doll i indicate on it as well where i was touched which seems to confuse her she leans forward and seems as if she wants to take the dolls for herself and show me what she thinks must have happened but then stops herself i begin to use the two dolls to show her what actually occurred then hold up the girl doll and ask as slowly as she has been talking to me if she has another male doll she looks uncertain at first then takes the girl doll away swapping it for another male doll i use a box of handkerchiefs on her desk as a makeshift bed for one of the dolls and point from it to me a couple of times so that there is no ambiguity about what is going on thats me asleep in my bed i even mime sleeping then i use the second male doll to indicate it walking along entering my room and approaching the bed at this point it occurs to me that i am not absolutely certain that the person who did the attempted interfering was indeed male i did not see them clearly enough and could not tell from the touch of their hand the feel of their skin or their smell what gender they might have been i just assumed it was a man i show the second male doll reaching over the first sleeping one and briefly touching it around its genitals then the bedbound one sitting up quickly and shouting while the second doll startles and runs away i lay the second doll down on the desk and spread my arms indicating that the little show is over the broad lady doctor sits looking thoughtful and makes some more soothing noises she appears to be thinking i pick up the second doll and sit it on my knee crossing its legs as it sits there from what i can tell the lady doctor seems to be questioning my version of events although on what authority i am at a loss to tell is there another conflicting account i wouldnt have thought so i take the doll on my lap in both hands is the doctor saying what i think she is is she saying that this did not could not have happened the way that i say that it did how dare she who does she think she is she wasnt there i had hoped that at least i might be believed does she think i would bother to make something like this up an injustice upon an assault i can feel my hands tightening into fists meanwhile above our heads there is the sound of some commotion shouting and a series of small thumps followed by a large ragged one more distant shouting it is a warm day and the window of the doctors room is lying half open outside i can hear birdsong and leaves rustling in the wind that and the shouting coming from upstairs you are sure it was another person doing this the doctor appears to be asking i nod and say yes with some considerable emphasis above our heads some sort of alarm is going off and i can hear running feet the doctor appears oblivious you know not who it was she asks no i tell her i know not you might have dreamed it she suggests i might have but i did not it happened you know not who it was no no how many more times no or could have been anyone any person it could have been not nurse she begins then i lose the rest possibly something about duties which would make sense not nurse i tell her upstairs more thumping the broad doctor looks down at the doll in my hands i am holding it rather tightly squeezing its chest as though trying to throttle it by the lungs she reaches over and takes it gently from my hands placing it beside the other one which is still reclining in its handkerchiefbox bed upstairs the rhythmic thumping ceases and a weak cheer sounds there is something something of doll the doctor says what i ask above our heads the sound of something scraping probably chair legs on the wooden floor of the day room is that clapping the male doll i was holding earlier slides off the edge of the desk and flops to the floor there is a scream from somewhere outside and a whiteclad body falls from above past the window hitting the ground outside the window with a thump and a roar of pain i seem to feel that pain i shiver half closing my eyes the room around me starts to dim i watch the doctor recede in my gaze seeming to fall slowly horizontally away from me as the office disappears hazily around me starting with the outskirts spreading to the wall behind the desk and the desk itself and ending with just the doctor an indeterminate dot somewhere in the far distance looking round in horror at the window and then starting to her feet and dashing towards it i see no more it is as though i am falling down a great dark pipe away from everything and eventually im too far away to make out anything at all upstairs more shouting again it too sounds like it is being heard from one end of a long pipe very distant and echoey and strange it fades quickly away to nothing finally i think i faint adrian what kennedy man on the moon the wall comes down mandela walking notable dates for your diary endofanera stuff like that ill tell you one what to each according to their greed is that it yeah yeah i said thinking about this yeah thats a pretty fair whatdoyoucallit summation yeah i should think ho ho the girl just widened her eyes and shook her head and took a drink you are so fucked up she flashed a shiteating smile and added dude we were in the met bar when it was still cool id already seen one gallagher brother i was meeting some mates there we were off to watch the f race the next day at brands hatch or silverstone or wherever the girl was there with a couple of old school friends though the other two had gone off to the ladies one looking unhealthily pale and the other to hold her hair i was guessing leaving this one called chloë chloë with the diaresis which is the twolittledots thing apparently the girl who was probably doing the hairholding by now had volunteered their names earlier in all the noise i didnt think chloë had caught my name and she hadnt asked either she was cute young enough to be a student maybe curly black hair cheeky little face with big eyes nice top great tits designer jeans red heels tasty in other words and a challenge patently greed gets a bad press i told her yeah what like fascism i winked youre an idealist arent you i have ideals she agreed her voice was western home counties girls school she was trying a bit too hard to sound bored plus im human so im a humanist and feminine i said id got better at seeing how this sort of stuff worked youre catching on i drank my lager smiled doing all right am i she raised her eyebrows i wouldnt get too optimistic i dont fuck guys like you what sort of guys do you fuck i asked her resting one elbow on the bar and leaning just a little closer to her taking up more of her field of vision id already got a semi just a girl using the fword like that was usually enough to be talking about fucking with a girl even when she was basically saying no or at least was telling you she was saying no was enough promising know what i mean nice guys nice i said looking sceptical she winked at me it looked like a whatdoyoucallit a parody of the way id just winked at her they finish last she drank from her cocktail glass looking pleased with herself i laughed i put my glass down and held out my hand looking tentative about it im ade i said quite quietly head lowered slightly in that letsstartagain kind of way she looked at my hand like it might be contaminated adrian i said and gave her the firstlevel cheeky smile which has been known to melt many a girls heart and other parts and which i am not ashamed to admit i have practised in the mirror to get the effect just right hey its for them in the end but then she took my hand gripped it for about a nanosecond chloë she told me yeah your mate said so what youre in the music biz ade or films it was like she was trying to sound sarcastic when there was nothing to be sarcastic about nah money money hedge fund whats a hedge fund she asked frowning to be fair not many people outside the industry had heard of them then this was preltcm folding sort of in between the asian crisis and the russian crisis way of making money i told her hedging your financial bets something like that sounds totally parasitic another insincere smile nah honest we make a lot of money for a lot of people we make money work we make it work harder than anybody else thats not parasitic at all your banks are parasitic they just sit there absorbing stuff from the people actually making the money were out there were predators were operators we make the profits happen we make money perform we make money work id already said that i knew but i was getting enthusiastic plus id taken a toot in the gents five minutes earlier and it was still hitting me she snorted you sound like a salesman whats wrong with being a salesman i asked she was starting to annoy me i mean im not but so what if i was what do you do chloë whats your business she rolled her eyes graphic design she sighed that any better than being a salesman bit more creative maybe she said in a bored voice slightly more meaningful i put both forearms on the bar let me guess chloë your dads loaded you fuck off she said angrily whats he got to do with me chloë i said in mock horror thats your dad youre talking about there i snapped my fingers trust fund i said youre a trusty no im fucking not you dont know anything about me i know i dont i protested pretending to match her in general upsettedness or whatever and youre not making it easy for me quite frankly you never want to overdo that kind of thing though i made a sort of deflating motion dropping my shoulders and my voice what have you got against me chloë i asked trying to sound just a little hurt but also being careful not to overdo the plaintiveness the thing about money maybe she suggested like it ought to be obvious the whole greed thing yeah look i said sighing i was already thinking this wasnt a chatup situation any longer i just wanted to say stuff that id been thinking about stuff that id sort of wanted to say to people like her before but never got round to plus of course there are some women that when you stop trying to chat them up and start treating them like a bloke youre arguing with they really like that and that can get them into bed where trying to chat them up normally never would so definitely worth trying the greed thing i say to her everybodys greedy chloë youre greedy you might not think so but i bet you are were all out for number one its just that some of us dont kid ourselves about it know what i mean we all want everybody to think the same as we do and we think theyre stupid if they think any different and when it comes to love and relationships were all looking for the right person to worship us because thatll make us happy arent we wanting to be happy thats selfish isnt it even wanting there to be no more poverty or violence i mean its all bollocks cos there always will be both but thats us being selfish cos we want the world to be the way we personally think it ought to be know what i mean you can dress it up as wanting other people to be happy but in the end it comes down to you and your own selfishness your own greed chloë held a hand up almost touching my mouth greed and selfishness arent the same thing she said close but not the same and theyre both different from selfpreservation and general selfinterest still close like you say she sighed drank yeah close she looked like she was studying something behind the bar theres nothing wrong with a bit of greed chloë its what makes the world go round wanting to get on wanting to better yourself being ambitious know what i mean wanting the best for yourself whats wrong with that wanting the best for your family whats wrong with that either eh its great having the luxury of thinking about other people the poor and the starving and all that but you only have that luxury cos somebodys been thinking for themselves and their family she turned to me big eyes wide and bright you know what you remind me of somebody ade she said somebody nice i asked sarcastically if im honest about it she shook her head i liked the way her hair moved though i was resigning myself to never running my fingers through it or breathing in its perfume or using it to pull her head back towards me while i fucked her from behind no she said hes one of those men who was packed off to public school when he was just a little kid yeah well i wasnt ssh she looked stern i heard you out the point is because of that or not he decided that everybodys out for themselves and nobody really cares for anybody else though some people pretend to hes looked after number one she did that fingerwaggly invertedcommas thing exclusively ever since and he cant see there might be something wrong with that in fact he cant even see that what hes got there is just a single point of view and a pretty perverse one at that as far as hes concerned its some great truth about people and life that only he and a few other realists have worked out thing is hes got a problem maybe hes still infected with some tiny remnant of human decency or something but he can only really be content with himself and his despicable egotism if hes satisfied that his selfcentred attitude doesnt make him a freak for his own peace of mind he needs to believe that its not just him that anybody who claims to care for others is lying maybe because theyre frightened to admit they only think of themselves too or maybe because they actively want to make people like him feel bad about themselves i was starting to think that chloë had been on the marching powder too though somehow it didnt look like she had know what i mean she wasnt speaking the way you do when youre coked up but fuck me she was still speaking socialists charity workers carers people who volunteer to help others theyre all and hes quite convinced about this theyre all in reality meanspirited bastards either selfdeceiving bastards or for their own filthy leftwing reasons deliberately trying to destroy the selfesteem of normal healthily ambitious people like him because if only everybody looked after their own interests everything would be fine see level playing field with everybody nakedly ambitious and selfish everybody knows where they are if some people arent totally selfish or even worse pretend not to be selfish then it messes up the whole system it makes it more unfair not fairer the way theyd claim he calls people like that dogooders and they make him angry i think he would actually prefer dobadders which is a pretty fuckedup attitude when you think about it he feels quite strongly that these charlatans needed to be unmasked always on about them never misses an opportunity to complain that theyre liars and frauds frankly ade altogether it makes him sound like and i firmly believe he actually is a complete cunt funny isnt it the cword has no discernible effect on me woodwise i mean youd think when a woman uses the term itd be quite sexy but it isnt weird i nodded ahha i said old boyfriend no ade my dad you remind me of my dad chloë drained her drink and patted me on the arm sorry dear she nodded now here are my friends coming back from the loo looking a bit more sorted thankfully she slid daintily off her bar stool i think well be moving on interesting to talk to you ade you look after yourself yeah and off all three of them fucked her fucking dad i fucking wanted to slap the bint the philosopher i have always had nightmares long before i became a soldier or a policeman long before i killed gfs father or became a torturer i would have unpleasant threatening frightening and distressing dreams perhaps they became worse for a while on a few occasions maybe especially just after mr f however i believe that my decision not to pursue any further personal vendettas and to act only when i felt i had the backing of some greater authority and that there existed a viable legal and moral framework supporting my professional actions helped as it were to clear my conscience at any rate my nightmares decreased in severity afterwards they did not disappear they would still haunt me people did faces did sounds did screams did especially some were very recent in origin the latest subject their roar of initial defiance the following howls of agony and the eventual inevitable pathetic whimperings and pleadings for mercy sometimes accompanied by the information required in the first place more often with nothing of use because the subject knew nothing useful to begin with i became a little disillusioned i suppose though that had nothing to do with the nightmares it was just that our job never seemed to end never seemed to achieve very much there were always more subjects and gradually a greater overall number of subjects at any given time from a greater spread of ages and from more and more backgrounds and professions society seemed to be collapsing around us the christian terrorist threat seemed only to increase despite the best efforts of the government the security services and ourselves and the real terrorists or terrorist suspects appeared to be joined by those who had fallen foul of the increased security measures and laws which the initial increases in terrorist activity had made necessary in the first place my colleagues and i comforted ourselves with the thought that however bad things might be or even might get just think how much worse everything would be without our dedication and professionalism i finally received some longdeserved promotion and began to take on more administrative duties taking me away from the front line as it were though not entirely in busy periods i would help out and when colleagues were unexpectedly absent i would fill in for them both situations seemed to occur rather more often than the department expected or id have liked i began to see a departmentapproved counsellor and my doctor put me on some medication that worked relatively well at first at any rate i established a mutually pleasing relationship with a lady police officer and found some solace in that as i believe she did as well we had decided to go on holiday looking for some winter sun this was required certainly in my case i had lately started to have increasingly distressing nightmares that centred around being killed in my home waking up to find exsubjects especially deceased exsubjects standing at the foot of my bed still in the state we had left them when my department had finished with them they would stand and stare at me in the darkness silent but filled with accusation i could always smell the bodily fluids and sometimes semifluid solids that subjects were prone to evacuating either right at the start of the interrogatory episode or when they were under especially pronounced pressure i would wake up in a sweaty knot of sheets terrified that i had myself wet or soiled the bed just the prospect of such unpleasantly interrupted sleep was bad enough my doctor put me on some more pills to help me sleep i found that a nightcap of whisky helped as well i might claim that i had a premonition regarding what happened at the airport though i think in retrospect that it was simply a memory of the cts who had attacked the airport some years before taking the weapons off the police guards and running amok with them in any event i was surprisingly nervous as my fiancée and i arrived at the airport nobody had attacked this airport for several years nor had anyone succeeded in bringing down an aircraft either despite a few near things so i kept telling myself that there was nothing to worry about but my hands were shaking as i locked the car door and picked up our luggage trolley part of my nerves was due to the fact that i had over the last year or so begun to worry that i might bump into an exsubject in a social situation or in a large crowd and that they would attack me or even just shout and scream at me or just quietly point me out to their friends and family as their erstwhile interrogator i must have interrogated thousands of people over the preceding decadeandabit and they were not all dead or in prison there must be hundreds still at large those whose crimes had been relatively minor or who had bought their release by turning informer or who had been the victim of malicious denunciation what if i encountered one of them what if they fell upon me or embarrassed me in front of other people this had preyed on my mind more and more recently statistically it had to happen eventually nowadays all too often i thought i did indeed see such people i tried never to memorise or even casually remember the faces of any of my subjects as my dreams showed they proved all too memorable without any effort being made on my part but nevertheless i had started to see faces in the street or in parks or shops or anywhere else where there were other people really which i felt certain i had last seen tearstreaked contorted in agony mouth open in a scream or sealed with tape their eyes popping faces turning red i had stopped going out quite so much as i had used to i entertained more at home had groceries delivered we entered the terminal building i found the beadyeyed gaze of the expressionless border police paramilitaries and soldiers intensely reassuring nobody would be surprising these fellows and stealing their weapons they took a family just in front of us to one side for a luggage spot check we went to the bar after the rather longwinded and laborious checkin process i claimed i needed a stiff drink after that and also that i was a slightly nervous flyer we spent half an hour there before we thought we ought to go through the main security barrier i drank three or four glasses to my fiancées one which she did not finish there was a long queue for the security barrier i had guessed as much from the latest internal security services threatlevel alert and had allowed for such in our schedule for the day so far despite some complaints we shuffled forward i was trying to read a newspaper police and soldiers walked up and down by the side of the line looking at people i started to worry that i might look suspicious just because i was trying so hard to look as though i was reading the paper and was so obviously sweating i could think of a few psychologicalphysiological parameters that i was fitting into all too neatly i put the newspaper down and looked around trying to appear normal unthreatening at least if i was taken out of the line my identity cards and especially my security forces special police pass would secure a speedy end to any suspicion and doubtless an apology the line still stretched twenty metres ahead of us two desks out of three working scanning passports and checking tickets before admitting people to the main security area where the hand luggage would be sniffed and scanned the coloured family a couple of metres ahead of us would probably attract extra attention a young man just beyond them carried a kitbag hed be lucky to get checked as hand luggage he was an army draftee judging by his uniform but even so we shuffled forward some more my fiancée took my hand and squeezed it she smiled at me my most disturbing feelings recently had been something close to treacherous i had come to think that the cts had a point even that all terrorists had a point they were still wrong still evil and still had to be resisted with all the means at our disposal as a society including emergency measures but the question that had started to occur to me was were we any better i put this down to the depressing realisation that people were all the same they all bled they all burned they all begged they all screamed they all reacted in the same ways guilty or innocent that made little difference race made none sex little cts were more fanatical certainly but i had begun to doubt they were any more fanatical than the extremists on our side who firebombed their congregations or crucified whole families in remote farms ordinary christians caught up in the trawls of their areas and families and friendship groups were just the same as ordinary people we all were almost without exception we human beings were weak and dishonest and cruel and selfish and dishonourable and desperate to avoid pain and torment and incarceration and death even to the point of implicating those we knew full well to be completely innocent and that was the point we were all the same there was no difference we reacted in the same ways to the same actions against us id seen it a thousand times many thousands of times so what had driven the cts to such desperate acts to such mad fanaticism any society any large group any substantial creed contained subgroups of people who would crack first under pressure and turn to violence and extremism but what had created that pressure in the first place who had created it and would we the ordinary decent people the security services my own department for that matter swapped at birth in the cradle i dont know have reacted any differently i was still sure we were doing the right thing but such questions had come to plague me at the head of our slowly shuffling queue between the two open desks there was a big hiphigh transparent plastic bin which contained all the knives tweezers pocket knives metal toothpicks and tools and other bits and pieces which had been confiscated from absentminded or ignorant people unaware of the relevant restrictions it looked nearly full i wondered if the bins contents would be sold as secondhand pieces or melted down or thrown away the young trainee soldier ahead of us walked out of the line when he was about five metres away from the bin and waved at the surprisedlooking border police official scanning the passports the young fellow was saying something sounding amused or jocular not angry or frustrated i imagined that he was late for a flight perhaps liable to be posted awol if he didnt get through ahead of the rest of us i looked back the nearest police officer behind us shook his head and started to head for the front of the queue where the young man had reached the big bin and was starting to talk to the border control official he put his heavylooking kitbag down and stretched his back putting his hands behind his neck in an unconscious parody of the position the approaching policeman would soon be asking him to assume if he persisted in this attempt to obtain priority i heard people around us tutting the big heavy kitbag was lying right behind the giant plastic bin full of sharps to this day i dont know exactly what made me react the way i did i started to cry out then somehow knew that there was no time and pulled my fiancée to the side throwing her down towards the wall and trying to throw myself on top of her that is all i can claim to remember the young soldier was a ct a suicide bomber the kitbag contained a blast bomb the explosive charge it held could be made larger than it would have been otherwise because it required no shrapnel the transparent bin provided that thirtyeight died not counting the bomber both border control gate officials perished as did the policeman who had been on his way to find out what was happening everybody ahead of us in the queue died instantly or within seconds save for one baby asleep in a backpack cradle for three or four metres behind where we had been standing almost everybody died my fiancée lived for five days i was on the critical list for about the same amount of time and in intensive care for a further month i had lost my left eye and left leg and both eardrums what i thought most tragic and somehow hopeless was that the young ct suicide bomber had not murdered a real soldier for his uniform or even just stolen it he really was an army draftee and one who had come from a good welloff welleducated family of unquestionable loyalty and social credentials and who had passed all the relevant weedingout stages and psychological tests with flying colours he had only converted to christianity in secret a few months earlier a kind of conclusive despair settled within me when i learned that and i had not being quite frank about it been in the best of spirits beforehand i was in a private room at the hospital still in some pain a couple of weeks after leaving the intensive suite when a lady came to see me while i was snoozing i got the impression of a short bustily attractive woman well dressed and strongly perfumed i didnt recognise her and wondered a little groggily due to the painkillers if she was one of my exsubjects arrived to inflict a bruise upon a bruise she held my wrist as though about to take my pulse then encircled it her hand a bracelet and with that and no further ceremony suddenly i was somewhere else the transitionary my new friend adrian insists that he must be personally present to be of the most help so is on his way however it will take most of the rest of the day for him to get here i wander the abandoned palace for a while imprisoned within all this luxury and space reluctant to show signs of life in case anybody is watching and equally reticent about leaving it i feel safe here even as i fret at the feeling of confinement and the prospect of presenting an unmoving target for the next five or six hours i stand looking at a walkin freezer on the ground floor the freezer is switched off dark dry its thick stepped door wedged open by a shrinkwrapped case of cocacola i shiver suddenly remembering the time i came here when it snowed when i met my little pirate captain and the very first time i came to this world when i tasted its unique fragre during the initial moments of that original visit knowing nothing of the place save for that first hint of its true essence id happily have bet somebody elses bottom dollar this was a greedist world a world where the untrammelled pursuit of material wealth and the virtues of money itself were extolled venerated and even worshipped not as an original act of faith of course we always give ourselves more credit than that accidentally rather perdition awaits at the end of a road constructed entirely from good intentions the devil emerges from the details and hell abides in the small print i claim no moral superiority here people like me get to see this more clearly than most only because we are privileged to witness lots of nonunique examples spread across a variety of worlds not because we are intrinsically wiser or more ethically refined and even i knowing full well that the technicalities profoundly matter have to accept that it is precisely from the details from the clutter and the turmoil of existence that the fatal blow inescapably arises like a freak wave overwhelming from the distributed chaos of the ocean the specifics will claim me one day the details always deliver in the end there are as many types of capitalism as there are types of socialism or any other ism for that matter but one of the major differences a major difference founded on what appears to be a minor detail between whole bundles of ostensibly fully capitalist societies centres indeed depends on whether commerce is governed by private firms and partnerships or by limited companies id lie if i claimed i possessed any congenital interest in economics but from what ive gathered over the years the invention and acceptance of the limited company means people can take big risks with money not their own and then if it all goes wrong lets them just walk away from the resulting debts because the company is somehow regarded as being like a person in its own right so that its debts die with it not the sort of fairy story a partnership is allowed to get away with its a piece of nonsense really and i used to wonder that legislatures anywhere bought into this blatant fantasy and agreed to give it legal house room but that was just me being naive before i realised that there was a reason why it always dawned on all those ambitious powerful gents in all those various legislatures that this ludicrous hooey might actually be quite a good idea anyway limited company worlds often progress faster than other types but always less smoothly and reliably and sometimes disastrously ive looked into it and frankly it just isnt worth it but you cant tell that to anyone caught up within the seductive madness of the dream they have the faith and are forever relieved by the invisible hand i kick the case of cocacola aside letting the freezer door thud closed there is a generously sized kitchen in the palazzo it also has no electricity of course and no other sort of power i can get to work but it does have drawers full of cutlery and cupboards full of tin cans i eat cold peas by candlelight as i begin to relax i discover a need to know how many peas are on the spoon i am eating with oh dear i thought id shaken that weakness off i try to ignore this absurd compulsion and just keep on eating but it is as though there is an elastic band joining the plate and the spoon or a membrane in front of my face physically preventing me from bringing the spoon to my mouth preposterous as it may be it is actually easier to give in and count the peas i cannot arrive at an accurate figure just staring at the slowly collapsing pile on the spoon of course though im sure an estimate would be pretty close to the final figure so i have to spoon the load onto the plate and count them there in the dim glow of the single candle this is harder than it sounds i have to sort them into files of five to ensure accuracy having arrived at a figure it proves impossible to pick all the peas up again i push them back into the mass of peas on the plate and take up another spoonful that first spoonful was a pretty typical one i reckon this one poised before me now is also pretty typical so ought to have the same number of peas but does it i am growing annoyed at myself and my stomach is growling at me still mostly empty but i need to know was that first spoonful typical did i arrive at a reliable number before i let this latest sample slide onto the side of the plate and count them as well slightly more than the first spoonful i take an average of the two though even as i do this i realise that two just seems an inadequate number one more sample ought to do it three is the number required for triangulation after all there this third spoonful contains a number in between the first two spoonfuls a straddle a sure sign that we are zeroing in on the right number i decide to take no more nonsense from myself and just eat this spoonful this works and i am able to sit back again i sigh through my nose as my teeth and tongue quickly convert the mass of peas into a single lump of paste inside my mouth i swallow and sit forward scooping up the next mouthful of piselli picolli on the table the candle flame flickers as though shivering i stop and let the spoon fall back into the plate i stare at the candle remembering and then suddenly i was not merely remembering i was i watched her move her hand above the lit candle through the yellow flame fingers spread fluttering through the incandescing gas her unharmed flesh ruffling the very burning of it the flame bent this way and that guttered sent curls of sooty smoke towards the dim ceiling of the room where we sat as she moved her hand slowly back and forth through the gauzy teardrop of flame she said no i see consciousness as a matter of focus its like a magnifying glass concentrating rays of light on a point on a surface until it bursts into flame the flame is consciousness it is the focusing of reality that creates that selfawareness she looked up at me do you see i stared at her i was here here with her in this place right now this was not a memory not a flashback certainly we had taken drugs and we were still at this point under their influence but this was definitely not some addled consequence of their effects this was startlingly immediate and unquestionably vivid real in a word she put her head to one side a little flexed an eyebrow tem she said softly are you listening im listening i said you look distracted she told me she pulled the sheet that was all she wore a little tighter about her as though she was cold she took a breath went to speak i said there is no intelligence without context her brows flicked momentarily into a tremulous frown thats what still frowning she sat back removing her hand from the candle flame it curled out after her fingers in a long flexing trail of glowing yellow as though reluctant to let go of her have i said this to you before she asked not really i said watching the candle flame restore itself not as no she looked at me with what could have been either suspicion or bafflement hmm she said well its like a magnifying glass and the partial shadow it casts around its focus the halo of reduced light around the bright spot at its centre is the debt required to produce that central concentration in the same way meaning is sucked out of our surroundings and concentrated in ourselves in and by our minds her hair her hair a brownred spill of curls across her shoulders and along her slender neck formed a quiet nimbus around her canted head her deep orangebrown eyes looked almost black reflecting the poised stillness of the candles flame like some image of the consciousness she had been talking about they looked perfectly still and steady i could see the minuscule spark of the flame reflected in them unwavering constant alive she blinked slowly languorously i recalled recalling that the eyes only see by moving we can fasten our gaze on something and stare intently at it only because our eyes are constantly consumed with dozens of tiny involuntary movements each second hold something perfectly and genuinely still in our field of vision and that very fixity makes it disappear i love you i said she sat forward suddenly what the word so emphatically pronounced was enough to blow out the candles little flame and plunge the room into darkness the candle sitting on the table in front of me here in the kitchen of the palazzo chirezzia blows out caught in a sudden draught i can feel on my face bringing a chill that lifts the hairs on the back of my neck the spoonful of cold peas i was about to eat remains poised halfway to my mouth exactly where it was the instant before i relived replayed and changed those moments from a room a dozen years and an infinitude of worlds away but i thought the spoon fell a door thuds somewhere in the building here in the kitchen things click and buzz and motors start turning fridge and freezer compressors sighing into life as a light comes on in the hallway outside and i hear distant footsteps patient last night i left this bed and this room and this level and i took me down to the floor below the ground floor where i witnessed something i found most terrible just yesterday i found the silent ward i was there i was in it i lay there with them for a time it did not last long but it was long enough i found it terrifying it happened after i fainted in the office of the broadshouldered lady doctor i still dont know quite what happened there it ended up as some sort of bizarre hallucinatory experience a lucid nightmare of voodoo cause and effect that ended with a keelingover that i was frankly thankful for at the time and despite the fact it meant it makes it harder to work out what did happen that i am still thankful for usually ive found there is a distinct point when one realises that one is asleep and dreaming i cant remember one in what happened what seemed to happen yesterday was it all a dream it cant have been at the very least i went or was taken somewhere else yesterday out of my room i was brought back here on a trolley after my time in the silent ward were coming to that i am certain i was as awake at that point as i am now though when i think about it i felt just as awake at the start of the experience with the broad lady doctor as i do now well we must leave that aside there is a continuum of banal experience between waking up in the silent ward and now no manipulated dolls causing people to have breathing difficulties or heart attacks or whatever and then to throw themselves out of windows i imagined all that anyway so im told this needs thinking about obviously that is why i am thinking about it i am lying here eyes closed concentrating i may have to get up and carry out further investigations in the day room amongst the droolers and perhaps ask further questions of the nursing staff but for now i need to lie and rest and think without distractions having said that i am very aware that the door to my room is closed and i will open my eyes the instant i hear it open just in case my assaulter from the other night has the audacity to attempt a repeat visit during daylight hours two things first i cannot see where the visit to the broad lady doctor went from rational to absurd it appears seamless in my memory this is most vexing like not being able to see how a simple trick is performed in a magic show or the join in a piece of mending where it ought to be obvious the second thing is what happened after i regained consciousness i woke flat out in a gurney a trolley bed it was dark only a couple of soft glows from nightlights illuminated a large space the size of the day room at the end of my own corridor maybe bigger the ceiling looked higher than in my room or the day room i felt groggy and sleepy but in no pain unharmed i tried to shift a little but either the sheets were very tight or i had temporarily lost a lot of strength i was too groggy to tell which and i had to remain lying flat out listening carefully i could hear gentle snores i turned my head to one side then the other i was at one end of a large open ward the kind of thing you see in old photographs or poor countries my trolley was at the end of a line of beds lying conveniently near the set of halfglazed double doors on the other side of the room beneath tall windows was another line of beds to see more i tried again to raise my upper torso attempting to bring my arms up so that i could support myself on my elbows but without success whatever sense we possess that informs us of such matters was busy informing me that i was not exhausted or hopelessly weakened my muscles were working normally and were simply being physically prevented from accomplishing their allotted tasks something was stopping me from moving i forced my head up as far as i could to the point where my neck muscles were quivering and realised as i looked down the length of the sheet covering my body that i was strapped in strapped in i felt a moment of panic and struggled to release myself there were four straps one across my shoulders another over my belly pinning my arms to my flanks a third securing my legs at my knees and a fourth gripping my ankles none of them seemed prepared to release me by as much as a millimetre what if there was a fire what if my attacker from the other night came back to find me helpless how dare they do this to me i had never been violent never had i of course obviously yes ha i had been extremely violent in my earlier life as a famously inventive ultraassassin but that was a long time ago and far far away and in another set of bodies entirely since id been here i had been a lamb a mouse a nongoosebooing paragon of matchless docility how dare they truss me like a psychopathic lunatic all my struggles were to no effect i was still tied tightly to the bed the straps were as tight as they had been when id started and all id done was raise my heart rate make myself very hot and sweaty and half exhaust myself at least i thought as i tried in vain to find any sort of seam or opening or purchase with my wriggling fingers if the person who had tried to interfere with me in my room the night before did discover me lying helpless here they would be faced with the same problem of absurdly tight sheets as i was i had to hope that it would be as impossible to squeeze a stealthily insinuating hand into the bed as my hands were finding it going in the opposite direction nevertheless i was still terrified what if there was a fire id roast or bake or burn to death smoke inhalation would be a mercy but what if my attacker did return perhaps they couldnt get a hand under my sheets without undoing me but they could do anything else they wanted they could suffocate me tape my mouth pinch my nose they could perform any unspeakable act they wanted upon my face or they might be able to undo the bedclothes at the foot of my bed and gain access to my feet there were torturers who worked on nothing but feet id heard just being severely beaten on the feet was allegedly excruciating i continued to try to free my feet and to work my hands towards the sides of the bed where it might be possible to find some weakness in the confining sheets and straps the muscles in my hands forearms feet and lower legs were starting to complain and even go into cramp i decided to rest for a while sweat was running off me and i had a terribly itchy nose that i could not scratch or move my head enough to relieve against any part of the sheets i looked around as best i could there must have been two dozen people in there at least still not much detail visible just dark shapes lumps in the beds some were snoring but not very loudly i could just shout i thought perhaps one of these sleepers would wake arise and come to my aid i looked at the bed next to mine about a metre away the sleeper appeared to be quite fat and to have his her head turned away from me but at least there were no straps securing them to their bed i was surprised that my struggles to free myself hadnt woken anybody up i must have been quiet i supposed there was a funny smell in the ward i thought that terrified me too for a moment or so what if it was burning electrical burning a mattress burning but when i thought about it it wasnt a burning smell not very pleasant but not the smell of burning perhaps one of the people in the ward had had a little nighttime accident i could shout i cleared my throat quietly yes no problem there everything felt like it was working normally and yet i was reluctant to shout out what if one of these people was the person who had attempted to assault me even if that wasnt the case what if one of them was of a similar proclivity probably not of course anyone dangerous would be in their own room wouldnt they theyd be locked away or at least restrained as i had been erroneously and absurdly still i was reluctant to shout out one of the other patients in the ward made a grunting noise like an animal another one seemed to answer that smell wafted over me again an appalling thought insinuated its way into my mind what if these were not people at all what if they were animals that would account for the lumpen misshapenness of so many of the shapes i could see for the smell for all the grunting sounds they were making of course over all the time i had been here there had been no hint that the clinic was anything other than a perfectly respectable and humanely run establishment with impeccable medical and caring procedures i had no reason beyond whatever my highly constrained senses could supply to my already terrified mind and feverishly overactive imagination to believe that i was in anything other than a ward full of ordinary patients asleep nevertheless when a person has a completely bizarre experience faints and then finds themself strapped helpless to a bed in an unknown room full of strangers at night it should come as no surprise that they start to imagine the worst the corpulent figure looming dimly in the bed next to mine from whom it now occurred to me there was a good chance that the strange smell had been coming as well as some of the grunting noises made motions as though they might be about to turn over bringing them face to face with me i heard myself make a noise a sort of yelp of fear the thing in the bed stopped moving for a moment as though having heard me or waking up i decided i might as well make more noise hello i said loudly with a tone of authority i trusted no reaction hello i said again raising my voice somewhat still nothing hello i said almost shouting now a few snores but the shape in the bed next to mine made no further move hello i shouted not a soul stirred hello then slowly the shape in the next bed started to turn round towards me again suddenly a noise outside on my other side forcing me to look in that direction there was a shape advancing on the barely lit glass of the halfglazed doors as someone or something came down the corridor a figure backlit and then the doors swung open and a male nurse padded in humming softly to himself walked up to my gurney and looked squinting for a moment at the notes attached to the footboard i took advantage of the slightly increased light and looked briefly round at the man in the nearby bed i saw a dark fat but entirely human face with a weeks worth of beard asleep dumblooking mouth and facial muscles slack he snored i looked back and saw the young male nurse stepping on the wheel brakes releasing them he wheeled me out into the corridor and let the double doors swing closed themselves seemingly careless of the noise he unclipped my notes from the end of the trolley and held them up to the light he shrugged replaced them and started pushing me up the corridor whistling now he must have seen me looking at him because he winked at me and said you awake mr kel you should be asleep well dont i didnt understand this middle bit out of those and into bed i dont know why something something he sounded friendly reassuring i suspected he was surprised that id been trussed up like that in the first place dont know why they put you in there with the i didnt get the last word but the way he said it it probably meant something mildly insulting one of those snappy honest but potentially shocking terms that medical people use amongst themselves that are not supposed to be for public consumption we went up in the big rattly lift it always went very slowly and he started undoing the straps pinning me to the bed while we made the ascent then he wheeled me along to my room released me from the trolley and helped me into bed he wished me nightnight and i wanted to cry the next day the young mousyhaired lady doctor visited me and asked me questions about what had happened two nights before i did not understand everything she said but i tried to answer as fully as i could no insulting dolls nonsense this time for which i ought to have been grateful i supposed no apology or explanation regarding my being strapped to the trolley in a strange ward for the first part of the previous night either mind you i wanted to ask her why that had been done what was going on what was being done to identify the perpetrator and what was being done to prevent them trying to interfere with me again but i lacked the vocabulary to express exactly what i wanted to say and anyway felt shy in front of the delicate young lady doctor i should have been able to deal with this sort of thing myself there was no need to trouble her and risk either of us being embarrassed the day passed i sat up in bed or sat in my chair mostly thinking eyes shut the more i thought about it the more i felt there had been something odd about that ward downstairs the atmosphere was too placid the man who turned over to face me looked too out of it could they all be sedated i supposed they might be problem patients often are the chemical equivalent of the restraining straps i was unjustly subjected to perhaps the place would have been in uproar if they hadnt all been given sedatives and yet it seemed to me more than that there was something about the place something almost familiar that woke a half or a quarter or a smaller fraction of a whole memory in me something that might be important one day if not now was it just the feel of the place the atmosphere i feel there ought to be another word but it eludes me or was it some detail i noticed subconsciously but which slipped past my attentive mental processes i resolved to investigate i was aware that i had resolved the day or the night before to investigate the matter of my attempted assaulter to ask questions of the staff and the slackjaws in the day room but had not done so however i decided that perhaps it was all best forgotten about and that so long as it did not happen again wed say no more about it it wasnt worth granting the fellow the attention the mystery of the very quiet people and the silent ward that seemed more important somehow more serious that definitely did deserve a degree of scrutiny i would take a look down there tonight i opened my eyes i ought to go now in daylight the silent ward would tell me more in waking hours than it might at night when everybody was meant to be sleeping anyway i got out of bed donned slippers and dressing gown and made my way down the corridor to the stairwell and the corridor below the cleaners were washing the floor and shouted at me from near the doors to the silent ward mostly from the pointing i gathered that i mustnt walk on their stillwet floor i tried again in the later afternoon and got as far as the doors of the silent ward itself before i was turned back by a nurse the glimpse i got of the ward through the closing door showed a tranquil scene hazy sunshine illuminated sparkling white beds but nobody sat upright or sat at the side of their beds and nobody was wandering around it was admittedly a brief glimpse but i found that very tranquillity disturbing i retreated a second time resolved to try again at night i slip out of my bed in the depths of the night and pull on my dressing gown i feel only a little groggy and fuzzy from my usual postsupper medication i swallowed just one of the pills and spat the other out later i am allowed a little torch which i keep in my bedside cabinet it has no batteries but works by being squeezed a little flywheel whizzing round with a faint grinding noise to produce a yelloworange light from the little bulb i take that i also have a little knife that the staff do not know about i think it is called a paring knife it was on a tray they brought my lunch on one day hidden by the underside of the main plate it has a sharp little blade and a nick out of the dense black plastic which forms the handle there was some slimy vegetable matter adhering to it when i found it as though it had not long been used it must have been misplaced by the kitchen staff ending up on what happened to become my tray my first instinct was to report it summon a member of staff immediately or just leave it lying obviously on the tray to be picked up and returned to the kitchen or thrown out that nick on the handle might harbour germs i dont really know why i picked it up cleaned it on my paper napkin and hid it on the little ledge at the back of my bedside cabinet it just felt right i am not superstitious but the appearance of the knife felt like a little present from fate from the universe and one that it would be impolite somehow to turn down i take that with me too my room is not locked i let myself out and close the door again quietly looking down the dimly lit corridor to the day room and the nurses station there is a small pool of light there and the faint sound of a radio playing jingly music how much more daunting the journey ahead seemed now compared to exactly the same one taken twice in daylight a few hours earlier i walk to the stairs the soles of my slippers making only the quietest of slapping noises i open and close the door carefully the stairwell is better lit than the corridor and smells of cleaning fluids i descend to the ground floor and enter the lower corridor just as silently as i left the one above another dim expanse i approach the two halfglazed doors and the darkness beyond them i shut the door behind me the ward looks just as it did the night before i approach the fat man lying in the bed nearest the door the one my trolley had been parked next to he looks just as he had last night i think i walk down past the other beds they are just ordinary people all men a mixture of body shapes and skin colours all sleeping peacefully something nags at me something about the first man i looked at the fat man near the doors perhaps it will become obvious when i look at him again on my way back out near the far end of the ward i notice that one of the sleeping men has something on his neck i have to use the torch shielding it so that it does not shine in his eyes there is dried blood near his adams apple just a little though nothing sinister a shaving nick i suppose ah thats it i pad back up to the fat man he has been shaved he had a weeks worth of beard last night but now he is cleanshaven i look back down the ward they are all cleanshaven you see men with beards here and moustaches there seems to be no particular rule regarding facial hair out of over twenty men youd think at least one or two would have beards i study the fat mans slack smooth face he has not shaved or been shaved very well there are little tufts of hair here and there and he has been nicked with the razor too on impulse i put my hand on his shoulder and shake him gently excuse me i say quietly in the local language hello i shake him again a little more vigorously this time he makes a sort of grumbling noise and his eyes flicker i shake him again his eyes open fully and he gazes slowly up at me his expression only a little less vacant there does not look to be much intelligence in those eyes hello i say how are you i ask for want of anything better he looks up at me seemingly uncomprehending he blinks a few times i snap my fingers in front of his eyes hello no reaction i take out my torch and shine it into his eyes i have seen the medics do this im sure he squints and tries to move his head away his pupils contract very slowly this means something though im not entirely sure what i stop squeezing the torchs handle it wheezes to silence and the beam fades to darkness within seconds the man is snoring again i choose another man at random halfway down the ward on the far side and get the same responses i have just switched the torch off again and he has just fallen back asleep when i hear footsteps in the corridor i duck down as a figure approaches the doors then i crouch out of sight as one of the doors starts to open i crawl underneath the bed banging my head on a metal strut and have to make an effort not to cry out i can hear the person walking down the ward and i see a soft light flicking on and off a pair of legs comes into view white shoes and a skirt the nurse passes by the bed i am crouched beneath without pausing i lower my head so that i can watch her she goes to the far end of the ward stopping at a couple of beds flicking her small torch on and off each time she turns and walks back down the ward stops at the door for some moments and then leaves letting one of the doors swing shut against the other without closing it especially quietly i wait a few minutes my heart calms in fact i become so relaxed i think i might even drift off to sleep for a few moments but im not sure then i let myself out i negotiate the lower corridor and stairwell without being seen but the light is on in my room when i return the duty nurse for our floor is in my room frowning as he looks at my notes on the clipboard toilet i tell him he looks unconvinced but helps me back into bed and tucks me in as i close my eyes i picture the ward downstairs again and i realise that one of the things that felt wrong one of the things disturbing me about it even though i could not pin it down at the time was the sameness of it all the bedside cabinets all looked the same there were no get well soon cards no flowers no baskets of fruit or other items that would personalise the allotment of space each patient is allowed i can remember seeing a water jug and a small plastic cup on each cabinet but that was all i cant recall seeing any chairs by the sides of the beds either no chairs anywhere in the ward that i could remember husks i keep coming back to this strangely significant word whenever i think about the silent ward and those deeply drugged or in some other way nearcomatose men i think of it husks they are husks i am not sure why this means so much to me but it would appear that it does husks madame dortolan but madame is it really such a terrible thing madame dortolan looked at professore loscelles as though he was quite mad the two of them were squeezed into a dusty study carrel high in a spire of one of the less fashionable upt buildings an outskirt adjunctery within sight of the dome of the mists but sufficiently distant and obscure for their conversation to stand no chance of being recorded someone transitioning without septus she asked emphatically not a terrible thing indeed loscelles said waving his chubbyfingered hands about ought we not madame rather indeed to celebrate the fact one of our number has or may have discovered how to transition without the use of the drug is this not a great breakthrough a veritable advance indeed madame dortolan immaculately dressed in a cream twinset an unlined notebook to the olive graphpaper of professore loscelless bucolic threepiece gave every appearance of thinking fairly seriously about trying to cram the professore through the unfeasibly narrow window of the tiny study space and out to the sixtymetre drop below loscelles she said with an icy clarity have you gone completely insane professore loscelles flexed his eyebrows perhaps to signal that as far as he was aware he had not if people madame dortolan said slowly as though to a young child are able to transition without the drug how are we to control them well the professore began first of all madame dortolan said briskly this has not turned up in one of our extremely expensive but now apparently rather irrelevant laboratories or within the context of a carefully regulated field trial or constrained by any sort of controlled environment this has come upon us on the hoof in the midst of a profound crisis in the council and in the guise of a previously loyal but now suddenly renegade assassin who i am nervously informed by those trying and mostly failing to track him may be continuing to develop other heretofore undreamtof powers and worryingly unique abilities in addition to this one as though really but thats extraordinary the professore exclaimed seemingly quite excited by such a development the ladys brows knitted well fascinating she shouted and slammed her palm on the carrels small desk raising dust the professore jumped madame dortolan collected herself im sure she continued breathing hard youll be glad to know that the relevant scientists experts and facultarians all share both your enthusiasm and your inability to appreciate what a catastrophe this represents for us she put her hands on either side of the professores ample cheeks and brought them towards each other so as to compress his smooth perfumed flesh making it look as though his squashed mouth and ruddily bulbous nose had been jammed between two glisteningly plump pink cushions loscelles think defeating an individual or grouping of people is easy one simply brings greater numbers to bear if they have clubs and so do we then we simply ensure that our clubs are always bigger and more numerous than theirs the same with guns or symbols or bombs or any other weapons or abilities but if this man who is now patently not one of us whose hand rather is most forcibly turned against us can do something that none of our own people can do how do we combat that the unyielding firmness of her grip on his face and the concomitant unlikelihood of him being able to form a comprehensible reply led the professore to believe that this was in the nature of a rhetorical question she shook his face gently back and forwards in her hands we could be in terrible terrible trouble thanks just to the threat of this one individual she jiggled his face in her hands and then worse for this can get much worse what if anybody can do this just with some training what if any idiot any zealot any enthusiast any revolutionary dissident or revisionist can just decide they want to flit into another persons body displacing their mind without planning without the necessary safeguards and respect for just cause and proven importance without the guidance and experience of the concern where does that leave us then hmm ill tell you powerless to control what is arguably the single most potent ability an individual can possess in this or any other world can we allow that can we countenance that can we indulge that she spread her hands slowly letting go of loscelless cheeks the professores features rearranged themselves into their accustomed alignments he looked surprised and a little shocked to have been handled so madame dortolan was shaking her head slowly her expression sorrowful and grave professore loscelles found his own head shaking in time with hers as though in sympathy indeed the lady told him we cannot it might i suppose lead to anarchy the professore said profoundly frowning somewhere towards the floor my dear professore madame dortolan said sighing we might greet anarchy with an open door garland its brows hand it all the keys and skip away whistling with nary a care in our heads compared to what this might lead to trust me loscelles sighed what do you think we might do then use all our weapons she told him bluntly he wields a new kind of club well we have some unusual clubs of our own the lady glanced to the window i can think of one in particular she watched clouds drift past in a silvergrey sky before turning back to the professores frown we have been too cautious i believe she told him it may even be to the good that somethings forced our hand at last left to ourselves we might have hesitated for ever she smiled suddenly at him gloves off claws out the professores frown deepened this will be one of your special projects i take it indeed madame dortolans smile went wide she put one hand out to his face again he flinched almost imperceptibly but she only smoothed and patted his right cheek affectionate as though he were a treasured cat and i know you will support me in this wont you would it prevent you if i did not it would prevent my adoring respect for you continuing professore she said with a tinkling laugh in her voice that found no echo in her expression loscelles looked her in the eyes well then maam he said softly i could not allow that it might serve to put me with obliq and plyte and krijk and the rest there have been narrow squeaks reported abnormal events madame dortolan nodded her expression a picture of concern havent there she tutted we should all be very careful loscelles smiled wanly i believe i am being she smiled radiantly at him why i believe you are too the transitionary what is it that we do what are we for and what are we against what are we for this again i have a feeling that if i say what anybody else in the concern would expect me to say youre going to tell me im wrong give it a go we help societies across the many worlds aiding and advancing positive progressive forces and confounding and disabling negative regressive ones to what end he shrugged general philanthropy its nice to be nice they sat in a hot tub looking out across a polished granite floor towards a starlit sea of cloud she scooped a handful of the warm water and bubbles and let it fall over her left shoulder and upper breast then repeated the action for her right side tem watched the bubbles slide mrs mulverhill even here wore a tiny white hat like piled snow and a spotted white veil she said how do we define the different forces the bad guys tend to enjoy killing people preferably in large numbers the good guys and girls dont they get a buzz when infant mortality rates go down and life expectancy goes up the bad guys like to tell people what to do the good guys are happy to encourage people to make up their own minds the bad guys like to keep the riches and the power to themselves and their cronies the good guys want the money and power spread evenly subject to the makingupyourownminds thing in this world there had once been an emperor of the world he had caused this palace to be built levelling the top of the mountain that was variously called sagarmatha chomolungma peak xv or mount everest or victoria or alexander or ghandi or mao or many many other names the palace was vast enclosed by great glass domes which were pressurised and warmed to mimic the conditions of a tropical island now though after a catastrophe caused by a gammaray burster happening relatively nearby by cosmic standards the world was devoid of humans or almost any other living thing and was in the slow eonslong process of changing profoundly as all the processes associated with life including carbon capture and even most of its plate tectonics started to shut down the concern had first discovered the world a few years after the catastrophe and had repaired and restored the palace it had become a place where privileged officers of the concern could holiday mrs mulverhill who now seemed to be able to go anywhere and do anything as long as she stayed away from the concern proper had found a version indeed a whole unshuffled deck of versions where this had been done but nobody had yet come to visit for now at least it was her private world she had brought him here this time she had only needed to hold his hand what is the point she asked him of trying to do any good in the many worlds when there will always be an infinite number of realities where the horrors unfold unstopped because one ought to do what one can good is good specific people and societies benefit that not all people and societies benefit is beside the point that a finite number of lives and worlds are better as a result of the actions of the concern is all the justification that is required and refusing to do a finite amount of good because you cannot do an infinite amount of good is a morally perverse position if you feel sorry for a beggar you still give them money even though doing so does nothing for the plight of all other beggars he let himself slide under the steaming water and the islands of bubbles resurfacing and wiping water from his face how am i doing im paraphrasing here but its sounding pretty good to me i should probably write a paper or something extremely well youre a credit to your teachers i thought so he pushed his fingers through his hair like a rough comb so tell me where im wrong and what the concern is really up to she nodded once there were times when he thought she lacked any sense of humour irony or sarcasm i think now that the concern she said exists for a much more specific purpose than simply acting as a multiversal nicenessenforcement agency it does do some good but its incidental a cover for its true purpose which is what that is what i hope you will agree to help me find out so you still dont know correct but you suspect theyre up to something i know they are how do you know i feel it you feel it indeed in fact i feel certain of it you know if youre going to convince anybody else about this including me youre going to have to do better than just telling them youre certain its a little vague i know but consider this of course she had a slyly refined sense of humour and appreciated ironies that entirely passed him by sarcasm was generally beneath her but even so i am he told her sitting comfortably she put one hand up to the side of her head so that one rosy nipple surfaced briefly from the white bubbles she took the little white hat and the veil off laid them on the black granite at the side of the tub slitlike pupils in amber irises narrowed fractionally as they regarded him we have access to an infinite number of worlds she said and have visited some very strange ones we suspect there are some so strange that we are unable to access them just because of that strangeness they are unenvisageable and because we cannot imagine going to them we cannot go to them but think how relatively limited is the type of world we do visit for one thing it is always and only earth as we understand it never the next planet further in towards or further out from the sun venus or mars or their equivalents this earth is usually about four and a half billion years old in a universe just under fourteen billion years old usually even if it supports no intelligent life it supports some life almost without variance it exists as part of a solar system in a galaxy composed of hundreds of millions of other solar systems in a universe composed of hundreds of millions of other galaxies as she spoke she flexed one leg and reached out with it to find his groin with her foot her toes brushed against his balls his cock stroking them wafting like the water wait he said opening his legs a little to allow her more room this isnt the where is everybody question is it yes thats easy there is no everybody there is only us there are no aliens not a single one of the many worlds shows any sign of alien contact past or present their lack throughout the multiverse proves the point we are alone in the universe her toes were gently brushing first one side of his penis then the other bringing him erect in all the universes she asked smiling in every single one then infinity seems to be failing somehow wouldnt you agree failing it hasnt produced any aliens it has produced only us a single intelligent species in all the wide universe does not smack of infinity she supported herself by stretching her arms out to either side of the tub and reached out now with both feet finding his erection with two sets of toes and stroking it gently up and down he cleared his throat what does it smack of then well it could simply be due to what the transitioneering theorists call the problem of unenvisionability as mentioned we cannot imagine a world that includes aliens or perhaps deep down we dont want to mrs mulverhill raised one hand and blew some bubbles from it to inspect her fingernails before looking at him and saying or it might smack of deliberate quarantine systematic enclosure some vast coverup why mrs mulverhill youre a conspiracy theorist yes she agreed smiling but not by nature ive been forced into it by the conspiracy im investigating she hesitated uncharacteristically ive found some examples ones youll know about want to hear fire away he nodded down to where her glistening feet bobbing rhythmically through the surface of the swirling bubbling water were caressing his cock parenthetical feel free to not stop doing that though she smiled the examples are from the more extreme end of the exoticism spectrum she told him but still ive always liked extremities im sure max fitching the singer i remember the green terrorist explanation was a lie he was going to give his money to seti research uhhuh marit shauoon i still wince he was going to use his network of communication satellites to do a seti in reverse deliberately broadcasting signals to the stars in his will hed have funded a trio of orbiting telescopes dedicated to finding earthlike planets and looking for signs of intelligent life on them you killed him days before he was going to alter his will with just that provision in mind glimpsing how its all heading you missed out serge anstruther yerge aushauser no he really was a shit he wasnt really a genocidal racist as such but whenever hes not stopped he ends up causing such havoc he might as well have been wanted to buy up a state in the us midwest and build an impregnable nirvana for the superrich xanadu shangrila fantasy made real a libertarian from his expression she must have thought he wasnt entirely familiar with the term she sighed libertarianism a simpleminded rightwing ideology ideally suited to those unable or unwilling to see past their own sociopathic selfregard youve obviously thought about it and dismissed it but expect to hear a lot more about it as madame do consolidates her powerbase its a natural fit for people just like you tem im already intrigued well you would be how do you know all this she waggled her toes over his penis as though it was a flute and her feet were intent on playing it i seduce forecasters ive even turned a few i have my own now uhhuh the concern use you and others to do this sort of thing more and more these days tem you still get to kill the genuine bad guys now and again but thats become little more than cover now not the main focus of their activities theyve even started going after people whore just thinking about what humanitys true place in the cosmos might be theres a guy called variously miguel estebanmike esterosmichel sanroismickey sants who keeps cropping up across one batch of worlds all the poor fucker wants to do is make a film about finding aliens but theyve started kidnapping him too now thats one of the few examples we know about im betting there are hundreds of others this is all back to madame do isnt it he said gripping the rim of the tub and flexing his shoulders to ease his hips forward closer to her so that her legs spread a little more glistening knees appearing out of the surface of the gently bubbling water on either side while her soles and toes still grasped his cock madame dortolan continues to believe in her imbecilic theories and pursue her sadistic research mrs mulverhill agreed graciously it just always seems more personal he said this thing between her and you ive no particular desire to personalise any of this tem its just that when you follow the relevant trails shes always whats waiting at the end no doubt he reached forward took her ankles in his hands and now i think you should come over here she nodded i think i should too the dawn began to break across the teeth of the eastward mountains a yellowpink stain slowly spreading they stood bundled in pillowed layers of highaltitude fourseason clothing on a high circular balcony situated on the summit of the highest dome of the great empty palace they were in the open air beyond a small airlock sucking oxygen from transparent masks over their noses leaving their mouths free small oxygen tanks in their outer jackets kept them supplied with the lifegiving gas and a backup system of valves dotted round the balcony stood ready to replace those if something went wrong even so one could not simply step from the scented sealevel warmth of the palace into the open air of nine and a half kilometres above the ocean the pressure difference was so great that a period of adjustment was required in the airlock to prevent discomfort before dawn when the air was most likely to be still was the best time to be here nevertheless a strong thin wind was blowing from the north a movable glass screen linked to a manhigh tail of a blade like a giant weathervane had positioned itself to deflect the worst of the blast over the balcony glowing figures on a small screen set into the parapet indicated that the temperature was forty below the air felt on the lips and the few square centimetres of exposed skin around the eyes seemed powderdry sucking up moisture as much as warmth she said people will generally make whatever compromises with the world they think necessary still to convince themselves that they are the most important thing in it the trouble with what were able to do specifically the trouble with unfettered access to septus and through it to the many worlds is that it abets and encourages this delusion to the point of naked solipsism her voice carried over the steady roar of wind sounded calm and strong unaffected by the thin air all the same he said its still an illusion the world exists without us whether we like it or not she smiled a hardline solipsist would dismiss your words as mere wind she said the point is that to a true solipsist there is no distinction between objective and subjective truth subjectivity is all that matters because it is effectively all that exists and to be a member of the central council of the transitionary office is to exist in a state that positively encourages such a state of mind it is not healthy not for the office lexpédience or for anything or anybody id have thought it was very healthy indeed for those on the council itself only in the trivial sense that now they need never die i bet it doesnt seem trivial to them well quite mrs mulverhill sat back against the balustrade its curved top fitting into the small of her back within the puffy layers of insulation her outer wear was white the slowly increasing light to the east washed it with a chilly pinkness but one has to ask what this has done to their outlook i cannot wait for you to tell me he told her she smiled unless we have been lied to even more comprehensively than even i suspect the concern has existed for a thousand years in that time certainly for the first eight centuries it spent its time investigating the many worlds researching the properties of septus and the abilities it confers upon people trained to take it and theorising regarding the metaphysical laws governing the many worlds and the composition of whatever context they might be said to exist within until about two hundred years ago interventions were rare much argued and agonised over heavily monitored and subject to extensive subsequent analysis so what happened two hundred years ago madame dortolan happened mrs mulverhill said with a sour smile she discovered how a transitioner could take somebody else with them between the realities and that opened up a whole new set of opportunities for lexpédience the numbers of worlds investigated soared then when she was on the central council she pushed for a far more aggressive policy of interference and a still wider spread of influence she also proposed that the practice of allowing central council members to shift down to a younger body when their own body approached advanced old age become the default for all rather than the extraordinary privilege for the mosthonoured few and that the limit of this being allowed to happen only once be lifted i thought that was still just a proposal it was a rumour throughout the concern indeed across calbefraques that this might be the case but there had been no official pronouncement in theory it is mrs mulverhill conceded she turned and looked out at the nearby peaks starting to shine like vast pink teeth all around them but its being done piecemeal as each of the other council members approaches the age when they might start to think that such a proposal does make sense after all when they have often spent their careers until then decrying and opposing it the good madame suggests they might like to reconsider to my knowledge only two of the council have resisted her so far and they might still be persuaded she looked at him and smiled the steps to the grave grow steeper the closer you approach a degree of urgency can grip people she might have those two council members too in time and besides with them gone and with effective control over the central council she can make sure the replacements are more amenable she has all the time she wants after all she can play the longest of games so now the central council just goes on for ever as an entity it always expected to she shrugged well bureaucracies always do but this one really might of course the difference is that in theory the individuals of the council can now go on for ever the point is not that the central council will never cease to be the point is that the central council will never cease to be exactly the same it will never change theyll still get older their minds will yes and it will be an interesting rolling experiment in how much information a healthy and relatively young mind can contain without having to overwrite some of it when its inhabited by a relatively ancient one and of course the council members are quite convinced that they will only get wiser and wiser the older they get in lived years and that this can only be a good thing but i think any rational outsider would and should be appalled at the prospect the old and powerful never want to let go they always think theyre both profoundly indispensable and uniquely right they are always wrong part of the function of ageing and dying is to let the next generation have its say its time in the sun to sweep away the mistakes of the previous age while if theyre lucky retaining the advances made and the benefits accrued the sunlight was stronger now picking out her strange dark eyes with their slit pupils they narrowed glittering as though frosted it is an insane conceit power always drives to perpetuate itself but this is a phenomenal extra distillation of idiocy only people already riddled with the internalised special pleading and selfimportance that too much power brings could even start to imagine that this might be in any way sustainable he rested one forearm on the parapet side on gazing at her even bundled so made comically rotund by the warm clothes she somehow contrived to appear slim slight and full of a specifically sensual energy he had a sudden flashback to the sight and feel and smell of the body contained within all those insulating layers they had been here for most of a day and had spent a lot of that time fucking his muscles felt tired and heavy and his legs still felt shaky from their latest bout half an hour earlier standing her wrapped around him in the airlock while they waited for the pressures to equalise thinking about her he half expected some sort of stirring from his cock but nothing happened it certainly wasnt the cold so he guessed that this time he really was all done he had wondered when she had first suggested they come out here onto the balcony if it was some sort of final spectacular site for sex a risky one he thought a chap could risk frostbite but they had fucked in the airlock instead he hoped she wasnt expecting more not for a while he felt a little sore and absolutely drained you do know so much about it all he said thank you in particular i think i know madame dortolan she told him i think i know how her mind works i can certainly vouch for how some of her other organs function she has selfbelief raised almost to solipsistic levels its her weakness that and a kind of fanaticism for neatness neatness neatness will bring her down it could be part of it having effective control of the central council will not be quite enough for her i think even though as a whole it will entirely do her bidding it will annoy her that there are still people on it who disagree with her just on principle she will want everybody on it to agree with her its just neater and that selfbelief it makes her think that she can do no wrong just because she is who she is for all her clearheaded cunning and guile and utterly ruthless rationality there is a kernel of something like superstition in her that tells her any given stratagem no matter how risky will work in the end simply because she is destined to triumph thats just the way the world works the way all worlds work and thats how we bring her down tem do we we keep annoying her keep opposing her keep nudging her to riskier and riskier tactics until she overreaches herself and falls or keeps winning she shook her head the longer you keep gambling everything the more certain you are to lose it so dont gamble everything rational but if youre absolutely convinced that it is your destiny to triumph that your victory is inevitable and gambling everything gets you there quicker than taking it in small steps why shuffle to glory when you can get there in a few boldly heroic leaps what if youre wrong she smiled ruefully then were fucked she took a deep breath and stared out across the pillowed skyscape of clouds towards the dawn but im not wrong something deep inside tells you that does it she glanced sharply at him then gave a small laugh yes quite point taken but we all need to have the courage of our convictions tem if were not to be just the playthings of the powerful hordes of falling clicking balls batted this way and that at their whim in some vast game and you have yet to say whether youll help or not you need to choose which side youre on mrs m im still not entirely sure what the sides are she looked down towards the layer of cloud two kilometres below you know she said people at the top of any organisation like to think that they are metaphorically on the summit of a mountain in perfect visibility theyre wrong of course in fact theres mist all the way down organisationally youre lucky if you can see clearly into even just the next level down after that its pure murk as a rule she left a pause so he said really of course with the concern it gets even more difficult to see whats going on she turned to look at him there are levels most of us dont even know exist i was on the level just beneath the central council if id kept my nose clean id probably be there now certainly in a decade or so assuming that one of the holdouts sticks to their guns and dies rather than keeps going on for ever youre a level down for that tem fasttracked for success but id guess her eyes narrowed again and her head tipped not knowing it would that be right i thought you had to do a lot of committee work and politicking back on calbefraques i enjoy working in the field too much also it has been noticed amongst the lower orders that the turnover in the central council has slowed down a lot over the last fifty years or so all the same youre one of the potential chosen ones im flattered is that why youre trying to recruit me not directly they must see something in you i do too though perhaps not exactly the same things i see a potential in you that i dont think they know is there and i think you might choose the right side so do they i suppose but this brings us back to the issue of sides you were about to explain just what they were i think i did ask you to she moved closer to him placed one snowsoft white mitten on his the central council has become obsessed with power before and beyond anything else the means has become the end if they are not opposed they will turn lexpédience into something that exists only for its own aggrandisement and the pursuance of whatever secret purposes the individuals on it choose to dream up i think that is unarguable plus i believe that at the behest of madame dortolan there is something else some already hidden agenda theyre working to the uniqueness of human intelligent life and the singular nature of calbefraques itself may well point to the nature of that secret but i never got close enough to the centre of power to find out what and i am supposed to no itll take too long for you to be elevated to the council if you ever are itll be too late by then too late too late because soon madame dortolan will have the council exactly as she wants it full of people who think just as she does and who will do everything she wants them to do and who will never die because they will keep repotting themselves into younger bodies as their older ones approach senescence so what do you propose mrs mulverhill her smile looked defensive ultimately that the central council either ceases to exist or is severely reined in and radically reconstituted certainly that it is subject to some sort of democratic oversight they can even keep their serial immortality as long as they resign in perpetuity from the council itself long life for long service an incentive to serve but not to entrench all the same youre asking a lot of them i know i dont see them giving up what they have at present without a fight and is the other side just you and your bandit gang oh there are plenty of people who feel the same way including a few people on the central council itself like who that smile again a little wary this time first tell me if youve betrayed me tem she said softly she lowered her head a fraction as she gazed up at him betrayed he said weve talked before im an outlaw if you were playing by the book you ought to have reported our meetings i did he said is that betrayal not by itself what else though what did they suggest you do keep meeting you keep talking to you which you have done which i have done and reporting back which i have also done fully not quite fully and have you agreed to help catch me no but have you refused ever to help catch me no they did ask i told them that of course id do what was right she smiled and do you yet know what is right he took a long deep breath of the pure gas and the stunningly cold air i think i would find it very hard to help them catch you she looked pleased and amused at once is that gallantry tem perhaps im not entirely sure myself sexual sentimentality is what madame dortolan would call it would she now she is a very unsentimental woman well apart from her cats maybe mrs mulverhill was silent for a moment then said do you think theyre using you to try and catch me even without your consent im sure they are ive always assumed that when we meet youve taken care of that i do what i can she shrugged i think im still ahead of them you think theyre in hot pursuit she nodded theodora keeps at least two tracking teams on the lookout for me at all times and she has her special projects her wild cards randomisers whom shes tormented and bent until they form specialist tools for seeking out people like me she thinks they might be able to work some magic and both find me and then disable me when im traced i suppose i ought to feel flattered to be the object of such obsessive attention she looked away at the startlingly bright point of the rising sun the surrounding peaks shone a bright yellowwhite now the level of illumination dropping down their snow and rock flanks as the sun continued to rise casting jagged shadows across the steeply sloped snowfields and glacier heads just in that moment he thought she looked small and vulnerable and hunted even afraid the urge to reach out and take her in his arms to shelter and protect and reassure her was very strong and surprising he wondered for a moment how much of this was deliberate if he was being manipulated and in that hesitation the moment passed and she turned back to him smiling raising her face you need to take care tem she told him you can only postpone making up your mind for so long perhaps no further after this you can seem to cooperate with them and listen to me for now but sooner or later theyll insist you do something that settles it youll need to decide i thought you were trying to get me to decide i am but im not threatening you theyre not threatening me not yet they will unless you take the hints that will be put before you if they havent been already and obviate the need for explicit threats she looked down towards the ruffled blanket of cloud far below still in shadow the central council prefers implied threats the threat of threats its more effective leaving so much to the individual imagination youre not going to tell me who the people on the central council are are you the ones who might think the way you do of course not you could probably make a fairly accurate guess anyway and its not as though i have signed contracts from them swearing to rebel when the time comes i havent even talked to all of them im just making assumptions but feel free to tell the questionary office that you asked the question i shall she was silent again for a while the wind roared on picking up in strength while the weathervane apparatus creaked and moaned and swung the glass barricade round to face the onrushing torrent of air you should take all this more seriously tem she said her tone gently chiding close to hurt these people are slowly making monsters of themselves madame do is already fullfledged under her if they havent already theyll come to countenance anything to avoid what she sees as contamination anything encouraging world wars genocide global warming anything at all to disrupt the slow progress towards the unknown dont let my defensive flippancy deceive you he told her pulling her to him enfolding her he hesitated deep down you still dont take it seriously either she suggested looking up at him with with a small wan smile theres that flippancy again he squeezed her i take it as seriously as ive ever taken anything including my own survival she looked unimpressed i was hoping for better leave it with me ill see what i can do she turned in his arms staring out over the nearly lifeless waste of rock ice and snow towards the faltering dawn we may not be able to meet like this again she said quietly im sorry then im glad he said that we were able to put so much effort into this meeting she looked back to him with an expression on her face that he was unable to read and he felt a real gutstirring emotion something between a kind of recidivist lust and an entirely unexpected regret at the potential loss of somebody who only now belatedly he realised was and had always been a soulmate he would never now never again call it love she pushed herself away from him a little then reached out and patted his gloved mittened hand again layers upon layers separating them ive enjoyed everything about the times weve spent together she told him would that there had been more he gave it a while then said so what happens next immediately trivially you go back to calbefraques and i disappear again if i do need to contact you if i do decide ill leave a note of places times people and beyond that over time more to the point i think madame dortolan will eventually move against the people on the central council who disagree with her shell try to isolate them perhaps even kill them kill them youre not serious this was not the sort of behaviour the central council was known for there had been one or two suspicious deaths on the council centuries before that might have been due to some judicious poisoning but nothing untoward since stolid and boring were the words most people associated with the council even after the ascendancy of madame do not danger not assassination oh im as serious as she is mrs mulverhill told him eyes wide madame dortolan is one of those people civilised on the surface brutish underneath who think themselves realists when they contemplate their own barbarism and ascribe the same callousness to others making the assumption that everybody else is as ruthless as she is helps her live with her own inhumanity though she would justify it as simple prudence she knows how she would deal with somebody like herself shed kill them so she assumes those who oppose her must be planning the same or shortly will obviously then by her demented logic she needs to kill them before they kill her she will think through this psychotic escalation without any evidence that her opponents actually do intend her harm and shell pride herself on her disinterested practicality probably even persuading herself that she bears those she has marked for death no personal ill will its just politics mrs mulverhill smiled briefly she will move against them tem decisively as she would see it murderously as anyone else would she put one mittened hand on his arm and she may think to use you to do so as you are still her promising boy discover and test your loyalty and commitment by ordering you to make the cull though she will undoubtedly have alternative means set up if you decide not to cooperate her gaze fastened on him if you do decide against her you will be making yourself an outlaw too or at best symbolically leaping behind a barricade with others like myself and unless we succeed the full force of the central council and the concern itself will be turned against you against us in time we have to persuade the waverers who are probably the majority that we are right and we need to survive long enough to do that if we can resist the council successfully they will look weak and be seen to lose authority then negotiation compromise might be possible you dont sound very hopeful she shrugged oh i am full of hope she said though her voice sounded small and faint he went to her and put his arms around her she pressed gently against him her head against his chest moments later almost together a series of beeps announced that their oxygen cylinders each only held enough gas for a few more minutes patient i think i have to leave i cannot stay here or maybe i can im not sure it is comfortable here all is not perfect i still worry that somebody might try to violate me again and there remains the disturbing incident with the broadshouldered lady doctor and her dolls when things seemed to slip aside from reality and it felt like i could only escape through fainting but even so my existence here is relatively calm and unthreatened maybe i should stay i am trying to spend less time asleep or snoozing or just with my eyes closed i am trying to discover more about where i am about this society and the clinic and about myself this has met with mixed results so far however i feel it is necessary no matter whether i stay here or leave if i stay i need to know where it is that i am staying so that i am prepared for what may happen suppose i am only here for as long as some sickness fund or medical insurance settlement lasts and then get thrown out regardless for example if i am to leave then i need to know into what sort of world i would be venturing so i have albeit reluctantly especially at first been spending more time in the day room watching television with the slackjaws droolers mumblers random shouters and nappywearers who inhabit the place there are one or two of its denizens who are not irredeemable but they are very much in the minority it is amazing though how little one can glean from the sort of broadcasts these people choose to watch i have tried finding news or currentaffairs channels but this always causes protests even from the true slackjaws who youd have sworn might as well have been sitting watching a turnip rather than a functioning television they like cartoons mostly they will watch programmes with lots of shouting and movement and colour but anything that might actually engage the brains higher functions beyond the sort of stimulus on a par with a chain of plastic toys stretched across an infants cot or pram that they cannot cope with i have learned a little more of the local language thats about all i persist only because the very distracting nature of the programmes sometimes lets my higher functions disengage more easily from the here and now freeing me to think i asked for and was given a radio to use in my room that was better i am still struggling to understand more than about a quarter of what is said less when people talk too fast but i have worked out that this is a mostly peaceful world and that this is a relatively benign egalitarian society my care here will continue indefinitely paid for by the state and that i am here because i suffered some sort of breakdown which left me in a catatonic condition for a month the medical staff think i must still be suffering from a mixture of amnesia and delusion or that i am just plain putting it on pretending to be crazy to escape well whatever it was i felt the need to escape i have been back to the ward of sleeping men in daylight nobody tried to stop me it is an ordinary ward after all the men were mostly awake a few were snoozing but not all and there were chairs by the bedsides and there were flowers and get well soon cards on the bedside cabinets and there was even a family what i took to be a wife sad and sallowfaced with two small silent children visiting one of the patients the two adults were talking quietly some of the other men sitting up in bed looked at me as i stood at the doors of the ward staring in i met their level mildly inquisitive gazes felt foolish and turned and walked away down the echoing corridor relieved and disappointed at once my name still means nothing to me kel mr kel mr p kel mr pohley kel nothing it means nothing to me well beyond that it feels the wrong way round somehow still it seems that i am stuck with it and i suppose it will do as well as any other i was a crane driver they tell me i worked in one of those tower cranes they use to build tall buildings and other large structures this is a job of some skill and responsibility and one that youd want someone quite sane and sensible doing so i probably couldnt just walk back into it but it occurs to me that it is also a job that somebody who did not very much like interacting with other people might choose and one that might allow the imagination to roam free and unfettered above the city and the site so long as the mechanics of the job got done safely i lived alone a loner both in my home life and up there in the sky swinging loads around from place to place while the people below scurried like ants and i took instructions from disembodied voices crackling over the radio no family no close friends hence no visitors save a foreman from the firm while i was still catatonic apparently anyway the whole building team has moved to another city now im told i rented a small flat from the city council which has now been allocated to somebody else my possessions such as they may be are in storage until i claim them but i remember nothing of that life rather i was a dangerous skilled swashbuckling hero a remorseful but utterly deadly assassin a thinking persons hooligan and later or perhaps just potentially a mover and shaker highflying fasttracked in a vast and burgeoning shadoworganisation spreading secretly under our banal existence like some fabulously bright and intricate mosaic long buried unglimpsed beneath a humble hearth i remain convinced that this calm unambitious selfsatisfied unspectacular little world is not all there is there exists a greater reality beyond this dull immediacy and i have been part of it an important part and will return to it i was betrayed or at least persecuted and i fell and nearly perished but i escaped as of course i would being who and what i am and now i am hiding here waiting biding my time so i need to prepare and work out whether i should do nothing but wait here patiently or take matters into my own hands and strike out purposefully there is much to be done madame dortolan between the plane trees and belvederes of aspherje on this clear midsummer early morning the dawnglittering dome of the mists rises splendidly over the university of practical talents like a vast gold thinking cap below amongst the statues and the rills of the philosophy faculty rooftop park walks the lady bisquitine escorted from the vantage point of a terrace a few metres higher and fifty metres away madame dortolan with mr kleist at her side watches the little party as it meanders closer from a distance bisquitine looks quite normal just a pretty plump blonde in a rather oldfashioned long white dress attended by four gentlemen and a ladyinwaiting there are other people we might employ maam kleist says he has been waiting to say this he might have said it a dozen times in the last day but has held his tongue she has been waiting for him to say it i know she tells him still watching the sauntering progress of the little group bisquitine does not appear to have noticed her yet her escort handlers and guards should have noticed them if they are doing their job but they show no sign either madame dortolan takes two steps back on the pink stones only just keeping the approaching figure in sight how are gongova and jildeep kleist ignores the question because he knows it is rhetorical a comment rather than a request for information there are others besides before we need to resort to this thing indeed there are but it will all take time no matter what we do and the next team we send if we do not use our little blonde friend here will be seen as just another incremental escalation he will probably be expecting that we need to send him somebody who will come as a deeply unpleasant surprise i am in no doubt that her deployment will produce a deeply unpleasant surprise or two madame dortolan still doesnt look at him still keeps her attention focused on the distant white figure possibly on our own side as well you mean that was what i wished to imply message received mr kleist madame dortolan squints tips her head fractionally you know im not sure ive seen her in sunlight before she says so quietly that mr kleist is not certain that she even means him to hear he supposes that what she says it true they have seen the creature in laboratories strapped to things like dentists chairs confined in small rubberised cages or tied to hospital beds sometimes weeping sometimes hysterical more lately in states of humming unconcerned calm or babbling nonsense but always surrounded by muttering technicians wielding clipboards electrodes and meters and rarely with a window even in sight always in artificial light and always until now physically restrained it has not always been pleasant to watch but the girls powers evident from birth but beyond control have been heightened and honed over time weaponised you might say personally he thinks a little less time might have been devoted to raising those abilities to their present admittedly formidable heights and a little more to making them easier to predict and control but bisquitine in her present form is very much madame dortolans creation and such timidity as she would see it is not madame dortolans way hmm madame dortolan says she looks as though she has a touch of the mongrel about her in this light she looks at mr kleist dont you think mr kleist makes the motion of looking i couldnt say maam madame dortolan turns to look at the distant group again she nods shallowly an octoroon or thereabouts id say there is a pause then a sigh before mr kleist says well in any event maam if you truly are decided on this course we should waste no further time madame dortolan flashes him a look then relents shoulders falling youre right im procrastinating she nods at the steps leading down from the terrace we must seize the day she observes patting her blouse frills flat against her jacket lapels a flower gelded by mr kleist lies limp upon her jacket breast and the nettle as kleist and madame dortolan approach it becomes clear that the lady bisquitine has been collecting insects snails and little lumps of soil from the flower beds and eating some of them the rest she deposits in a drawstring posy purse hanging from her waist her pretty little face surrounded by a nimbus of bouncily blonde curls and kept clean and minimally madeup by her forever fussing ladyinwaiting sports brown streaks at the corners of her mouth until the ladyinwaiting a thin blackdressed figure who moves like a stalking bird wets a handkerchief with her mouth and tutting cleans the lips of her charge bisquitine stands still staring at madame dortolan openmouthed her face looks provisionally blank as though she is a young child confronted with something new and surprising and is trying to decide whether to put back her head and laugh or burst out crying two of her attendants robust young men in a special uniform of dark grey and maroon armed with automatic pistols and electric shock guns touch their caps to acknowledge the approach of the older and more senior woman the other two are more slight in comparison informally dressed and look bored both nod all the same the ladyinwaiting curtsies bisquitine my dear madame dortolan says stopping a couple of metres away and smiling at her she never knows quite what to do with her hands when she meets bisquitine to touch her of course could be dangerous how are you you look well the lady bisquitine continues to stare at madame dortolan then she looks absolutely delighted her already pretty face splits in a guileless smile and in a clear belllike childish voice she sings ugby dugby bought a new ball ugby dugby played not at all ugby dugby went for a spin ugby dugby couldnt get in she nods proudly once for emphasis and then sits down where she stands the skirts of her white brocade gown pooling around her like spilled milk with her tongue out of the side of her mouth she takes a beetle out of her posy bag and starts to pull its wing casings open letting them click back while the protesting insect buzzes and jerks in her chubby grubby fingers one of the bored skinny attendants looks at madame dortolan and sighs sorry maam bit worse than usual recently he shrugs gazes down at bisquitine who has pulled one of the wing casings off entirely and is studying the wing inside crosseyed with concentration the young man smiles uncertainly at madame dortolan he appears to be vicariously embarrassed but still madame dortolan says potent yes proficient capable the other skinny young man blows out his cheeks and shakes his head oh be under no illusions maam he says the ladys skills remain undiminished oh yes he is squinting in the sunlight rather as mr kleist is doing the first young man rolls his eyes weve had to stop her flitting half a dozen times since breakfast maam he shakes his head bisquitine pulls the beetles other wing casing off and puts it between her teeth tasting it she makes a sour face and spits the wing casing out onto the path then leans over to let some spit dribble from her hangingopen lips she wipes her mouth with her sleeve grunting madame dortolan looks measuredly at the ladyinwaiting mrs siankung isnt it maam she curtsies again we have need of the lady bisquitines services and unique talents mrs siankung swallows now maam now this is more training evaluation yes no it is profoundly not i see maam the ladyinwaiting kleist thinks looks surprised one might even say startled and possibly also more than a little afraid the beetle is vibrating its wings noisily in a vain attempt to escape its large hornlike mouth parts spasming in frantic pincering movements connect with one of bisquitines fingers and nip bisquitine winces frowns severely at the creature and then pops it whole into her mouth and starts to eat grimacing only a little there are crunching noises the transitionary something very fucking weird happens as i sit there in the main kitchen of the palazzo chirezzia the spoonful of peas poised in front of my mouth i get the most transitory glimpse of something like a vast explosion it looks frozen at first then i plunge into it or it whirls out to meet me and i can see its surface is a boiling mass then im like some particle in a cloud chamber battered by brownian motion trilling down through an infinitude of worlds all riffling past too fast to see properly or count and then wham im here except i seem to have bounced partway back out of where i really am because i swear i can see myself sitting there in the kitchen and i can see the whole palace in three dimensions its like the entire building is made of glass roof tiles stones beams and floorboards carpets wall coverings furniture and even the piles that the whole place rests on ancient warped tree trunks densely packed twisted into the mud metres and metres beneath im aware that all the components are there and i can still tell what colour each is and see the patterns on things like the persian rugs scattered through the building but at the same time i can see through everything i can see the immediate surroundings too the buildings flanking the palazzo also facing the grand canal the small canal to one side the calles on the two other sides plus i have a vague impression of the rest of the city but the fabric of the palace itself is patently where all my attention is focused who the fuck is doing this am i doing this it looked like i zoomed in from the outside of the whole metareality there pinpointing in to this world this city this building right here and now all in under a second ive talked to the top brain boys and girls at the transitionary theory department in the speditionary faculty and what i saw looked like what they imagine in their heads all the time but have great difficulty explaining but it honestly felt like i was seeing it properly truly for real i inspect my newly revealed panorama and discover that i am not alone in the palace there are some people entering from a boat moored at the private jetty and what looks like another team bursting in through the front doors i can even see the air movements the draught i felt a moment ago came from the canaljetty doors then that detail disappears two teams six people each they each have a team member capable of damping down the capacity to transition anywhere near them im already within both volumes of affect more personnel there are another four people guarding the ways out of the palace and two more in a second launch holding station in the grand canal just off the palace how did i was out for nearly two hours after i performed my odd inadvertent flit from the room with the chair and the quietly spoken man and his sticky tape two hours i had no idea i had been out so long i also have no idea how i know this so certainly now but i do anyway the point is that theyve had plenty of time to prepare i wonder if my call to ade in london pinpointed me the thought has barely formed in my mind when i know that it didnt using the phone from the supposedly deserted palace only confirmed what they already knew both teams are splitting up four members of each jogging and running through the palace in a clearly predetermined pattern heading for every part of it two people in each team stay together near where they entered theyre communicating by some form of digital radio encrypted the transitiondamping fields in both cases coming from one of the two people in each team who stayed near their point of entry i can see now stop them using any techniques exclusive to us the comms equipment will be local just below the latest military spec in this world to reduce the awkwardquestions factor if they encounter any local officialdom one of the men near the front doors the one not responsible for the damping effect is called jildeep he is operations commanding officer as well as team leader the woman standing near the jetty doors with the other blocker is called gongova she is jildeeps deputy and second in command oh and lover interesting but probably not relevant somebody from gongovas team will burst into the kitchen where i am in about eight seconds she is called tobbing like the rest she has some tracking ability she will know that im the one theyre all looking for possibly even before she sees me she only needs to get to within about four metres of a transitioner to sense them my how highpowered this all is i should feel flattered would you apply such a serious concentration of resources just to grab one offmessage transitioner i suppose you would if the you involved meant you were madame dortolan you were trying to dispose of everybody on the central council who disagreed with you probably with the intention of mounting an utterly illegal and completely unprecedented coup and the first assassin sent to accomplish this dubious mission i assumed i was the first anyway promptly made a start at bumping off the people on the council whom you regarded as your allies you could see how that might make her cross but now i have this weird new power to add to the bizarre overreal flashbacks id been experiencing recently not to mention the stilllingering suspicion that id flitted without the benefit of septus the wonder drug all somewhat confusing but highly interesting too i wonder can i use my strange new sense to my advantage i mean youd imagine how can this turn out what can happen next the view of the palace splits suddenly into a blurring stack of further palaces each subtly different i can concentrate on any one i wish to inspect ah theyre alternative paths different futures the most likely quite clear the less and less likely more and more blurred until theyre just snow pointless i look at them each in turn the people in them the members of the two teams searching the palace are moving very slowly now i notice which is handy ms tobbing is very close to the kitchen door all the same i can hear a slow heavy thud back in what well have to call physical reality thatll be one of her footsteps that will i can hear the echoes of the previous one still resounding looking carefully comparing and searching i think i can see what to do its a little problematic but i cant spot a humane alternative turning the seat to face the open doorway i sit back and put my hands up ms tobbing spins across the doorway legs spread and slightly bent gun levelled dark blue trouser suit hair bunned thats all i have time to confirm before she tasers me and i end up on the floor jerking and spasming its more painful and distressing than i imagined i almost wish id chosen a different route through those futures but the others were even bloodier not that ill expect any thanks of course the rest arrive mobhanded seconds after ms tobbing stops zapping me and dr jildeep himself administers a syringe full of tranquilliser i dare say they thought of including something supposed to stop me transitioning too but those drugs can be permanently damaging and theyll want me intact wait this path leads to me killing most of them another set of futures bursts into my mind one of the areas or volumes i couldnt see into clearly a minute earlier but which now that im closer to them have become more distinct can i do what this implies i can do seriously im slipping away here i need to decide fast if i just think in through here ms tobbing spins across the doorway legs spread and slightly bent gun levelled dark blue trouser suit hair bunned combined earpiece and microphone nice blue blouse thats all i have time to confirm before she fires the taser at me ive used the five seconds and the highdef clarity of my xrayspecs vision of the palace to pull open a drawer grab a long boxed roll of aluminium foil and knowing exactly the trajectory that the tasers two little barbs are going to take feel them whack into it letting the guns charge go zapping down the wires to discharge harmlessly into the foil my other hand is wrapped in a kitchen towel taken from the same drawer i use it to grab the wires connecting the barbs to the gun and yank them hard pulling the stillinthecourseofbeingsurprised ms tobbing towards me before she can think to let go of the taser well now we find out if the futurepath vision thing is going to work or not according to what ive just visualised this looks almost easy my hand closes round ms tobbings right wrist i sneeze suddenly explosively my old self stares at me blankly hmm one of my more handsome incarnations though now with snot hanging from his nose but not even a gesundheit really i let go of the tasers trigger and the gun stops firing uselessly into the packet of foil now fallen to the floor where i he was standing a moment ago i prise his fingers off my wrist he smiles vaguely then shakes his head his expression changes profoundly and he starts talking loudly in what i think is slovenian i have english german french italian mandarin i use the gun to smack him under the jaw shutting the kitchen door on him as hes still staggering backwards tobbing i tell the radio as i turn back down the corridor letting the expended taser cartridge fall to the floor and digging a new one out of a pocket to snap onto the gun just dropped an unidentified civilian in the kitchen civilian you sure jildeeps voice says there isnt supposed to be anybody else here well im sure you still with him no im heading stay with him stay get back there oh forget it i mutter sneeze no still no gesundheit same as before except this time i dont use the radio i just start jogging down the corridor theres some chatter about somebody hearing a taser go off but when im asked i say i heard nothing being a woman is interesting moving feels different broader hips i suppose and altered weight distribution breasts move very slightly with each pace but constrained sports bra two corners two corridors and one door later im at the entrance to the jetty cracking the door i can see gongova and the blocker a weedylooking guy smoking a cigarette with a look of intense concentration i taser him and he falls into the waters by the side of the moored launch gongova starts turns her hand goes for a gun inside her jacket then she relaxes again and stands there the gun held loosely in her hand pointing straight down at the jettys timbers when jildeep gets here to see whats been going on shes going to shoot him in the groin for cheating on her with tobbing this is even true so not entirely all my own work appalled at what she has done she will then sit down and sob until this is all over which will be in about two and a half minutes the weedy blocker guy will drag himself out of the canal coughing dirty water in about a minute but he wont be blocking anything for a while and in the meantime the side of the palace he was covering is open what im doing here is conventionally impossible you cant transition into the mind of somebody who can themselves flit or indeed has ever flitted even with help the target individual has to be unaware as long as they are in that sense innocent and virginal theyre completely vulnerable as soon as theyve completed a single transition even an assisted one even one where theyve simply been taken along for the ride theyre immune there would appear to be no exceptions to this rule and it has become so accepted that the concern has never thought to prepare its agents against the possibility of somebody exercising this ability against them so i can flit from mind to mind here and cause any internal mayhem i want with seeming impunity i still dont feel i can transition to a different reality altogether and so escape completely at least not without an incentive so immediate and powerful that id rather not subject myself to the experience in the first place but if this new ability is the tradeoff ill happily accept it in other words i still need septus unless im feeling feeling very brave or especially desperate but that shouldnt be a problem here these guys ought to be loaded with it id rather have the stuff in the box which adrian is bringing from london because its mrs mulverhills finest untainted with the contaminants that make it easy to trace the flitter but ill take these guys supply just in case two of the people searching the upper floors realise theyve always loved each other and have wasted far too much time already they fall to fucking on a hallway floor another stares fascinated at his own reflection in a bathroom mirror like hes never seen himself before another loses herself in the depths of a to be fair fabulously patterned persian rug a kashan id guess while another decides to take off all his clothes and dive into the grand canal from the roof the guy at the controls of the launch on the canal sees this decides hes in love with the world and vows never to use an internal combustion engine ever again he takes the keys out of the ignition and drops them into the milkygreen waves with a wistful smile the other guy in the launch just falls into a deep and peaceful sleep one of the people guarding the calles is absolutely convinced hes just seen his yearsdead father walk past and takes off after him the rest are still covered by the second blocker but by the time jildeeps even half worked out whats going on ive arrived at the entrance hall and tasered him as well dr jildeep escapes skittering down a narrow service corridor it was him or the blocker with the taser but thats okay im in jildeeps mind now and discovering something galling i mean apart from the fact he wanted to shoot me in the legs just there even though his orders forbade this none of these people have any septus on them theyre in here clean just in case i do overpower one of them and take their supply from them and disappear they were thinking about a conventional physical whack over the back of the head rather than my rather more subtle consciousness manipulation but the same precautionary principle defeats either which is irritating theyll be approached by somebody unknown to them after the operations over and get their supplies that way ha these poor fuckers are here on faith and are going to have to stand around waiting for the man thats too bad for them and as it turns out for me so i still need to rendezvous with my londoner mate ade after all this cuts back my options significantly but even a fairly deep rummage through dr jildeeps mind finds nothing that can help the situation i suppose i could stay inside one of their minds for longer than i was intending to but long before their supplier arrives theyll have the blockers up and functioning again or if i disable these two blockers permanently theyll bring in new ones and ill be trapped at best more likely by far a good blocker will spot the wrong un in their midst like a badly bruised thumb and ill be caught whatever with the second blocker down nobody has the power to stop me and theres no point interfering with anybody else im free to go a man an unremarkable man about thirty black hair medium build sitting at the stern of a passing vaporetto bound for santa lucia sees a naked man run along the dark roof of an impressive white and black palazzo on the western side of the canalasso along with the rest of the passengers now turning to each other muttering saying things like oh my goodness and eh cosa and so on he turns to watch as the man throws himself from the roof and hurtles into the water just in front of a water taxi which swerves and goes astern to rescue him even though he does seem rather intent on swimming down the canal towards san marco nearby a man in an idling launch turns off the engine and casually drops the keys overboard the unremarkable man at the stern of the passing vaporetto looks surprised for a few moments then sneezes italian english greek turkish russian mandarin mavis bocklite a genial pensioner from baxley georgia usa who is sitting across from him says bless you sir finally i smile and nod grazie signora patient i think i am well i tell the broad doctor who had the dolls in her desk i know her name now she is called dr valspitter i think i am okay now to leave my grasp of the local language has improved markedly it is called itic dr valspitter looks at me lips pursed brows gathered in the middle as though by a pulled thread i appreciate everything all here have done for me i tell her what do you remember of your past life the doctor asks me not very much i confess what would you do if you returned to the outside world i would look for a place to stay and for work to do i am able to work not at your old job perhaps ordinary labourer i could do ordinary labour i know building sites that i could do ordinary labouring you feel you could do this yes i feel i could do this how would you find a place to live i would go to the municipal available local lodgings clearing office dr valspitter looks approving nods and makes a note good and how would you find work the obvious next question i would approach building site managers but also i would go to the municipal local employment exchange the doctor makes another note i think im doing all right here i need to i have to get out i have to get away last night i found i could not sleep and took another smallhours wander along the corridor down the stairwell and along to what i still thought of as the silent ward i could not help it i felt drawn there i dont think thats what woke me up but once i was awake i found myself thinking obsessively about the rows of still beds with their vacanteyed nearsilent patients and the contrast with their appearance in daylight when they were awake i couldnt think what good padding down to look at them would do but i couldnt think of anything else to do either and maybe just seeing them for real rather than in my minds eye would let me get back to sleep eventually so i went i looked they were all just the same though there were cards and personal items on the bedside cabinets and a few chairs scattered throughout the ward all the things id convinced myself hadnt been present on my first two visits but which i suppose were always there then i came back again there was somebody in my room i had left the door closed and my light off but now i could see some light showing beneath the door reflecting dimly off the shiny floor at first of course i thought it would just be the duty nurse again then i saw more movement at the far end of the corridor somewhere inside the day room a pale figure moving across the dark space disappearing then reappearing and coming towards the low lights of the corridor the figure in the day room emerged into the halflight of the nightdimmed corridor lights and was revealed as the duty nurse walking back to his desk at the end of the corridor holding a magazine and flicking its pages intent on it he did not look up so did not see me i felt a sudden terror and shrank back against the wall as far as i could hiding behind a metal cupboard holding firefighting equipment the duty nurse sat down at his station at the far end of the corridor feet up on the desk still flicking through the magazine he stretched out to one side i could hear the wheels of his chair squeaking and turned on the radio at a low volume tinny pop music sounded i could no longer see the door to my room who was in there if not the nurse was it my former attacker whoever had tried to interfere with me perhaps i ought to go to the door fling it open confront them the noise and commotion of course attracting the attention of the duty nurse or perhaps i should just approach the duty nurse directly and tell him there was somebody in my room let him deal with whoever it was i had decided on the latter course and was about to step out from behind the fireequipment cupboard and walk towards the duty nurses station when from the far end of the corridor i heard a toilet flush a door creaked and closed i stepped along the wall to the nearest door twisted the handle and let myself in this should be a private visiting room empty at this time of night sound came from somewhere near the toilets slipperslapping footsteps came and i recognised one of the old boys a notquite slackjaw capable of holding a conversation and talking about something other than television or the weather he went head hunched past where i watched via the cracked door somebody said something and he looked up waving down the corridor no doubt at the duty nurse i opened the door a little further to watch him go when he was opposite the door to my room a couple of doors short of his own room the door to my room was flung open and light spilled out mr kel i heard a strong male voice say the old guy stood looking confused staring blinking at whoever had addressed him from my room and then down the corridor i heard seat wheels squeal as the nurse said something voice inflected in a question then a bright light shone into the old fellows face he put his hand up to shield his eyes the duty nurse shouted something the bright light went out and a man tall wellbuilt in a dark suit went running past me and away down the corridor towards the stair well he held a chunkylooking torch in one hand in the other hand he was carrying something else he thrust it inside his jacket as he ran past me it was dark and heavylooking and i knew it was a gun so can i leave i ask dr valspitter can i go please she smiles perhaps i will need other doctor to come to same opinion but i think you can wonderful can we get other doctor their opinion today you are in such a hurry to leave i am i want to get out i say today she shakes her head frowning just a little not today maybe tomorrow if other doctor agrees with me and we can complete all required paperwork and provide you with clothing and belongings and money and so on maybe tomorrow i cannot promise but soon i think maybe tomorrow we shall see you must understand you must be patient i want to protest but i am aware that i have pushed things quite far enough already if i seem too desperate to get out they might take that as a sign that im unbalanced or neurotic or something i do my best to smile tomorrow then i say i hope i add before the frowning doctor can reiterate that its still only maybe no i wail staring at the two beige pills lying in the bottom of the little cup the cup is colourless translucent plastic and tiny a stingy measure of drink if you were serving spirits in it and yet to me it seems like its as deep dark and dangerous as a mine shaft i stare hopelessly into it and despair i not want to i am aware that i sound like a recalcitrant child you must the old nurse tells me she is starting to lose patience with me i can tell they harmless mr kel they give you a good nights sleep thats all but i sleep good doctor say you must have them mr kel the old nurse tells me firmly as though this trumps everything do you want me to go and get doctor this is a threat if she fetches a doctor and i still refuse to take the sleeping pills i may well find that such a protest too will count against me when i ask to be released from the clinic please not make me i say biting my bottom lip perhaps i can appeal to her emotions this is only partially an act however she is not moved she has seen it all before perhaps a younger nurse might have been persuaded but this old one is taking no nonsense very well we get doctor she turns to go and i have to reach out to her and say no all right she turns back and at least has the decency not to look smug i take them i tell her first line of defence i think i can fool her and just keep the pills under my tongue until she has gone and then spit them out but she insists on inspecting my mouth afterwards and so i have no choice but to swallow them second line of defence ill go to the toilets and throw them up but the nurse is watching for me to do this as she goes down the corridor dispensing drugs and twice shoos me back to bed with the threat that shell inject me with a sedative if i insist on going to the toilets she knows i already went not ten minutes ago third line of defence ill throw up here in my room into my water jug or out of the window if i have to i can sign myself out voluntarily if i have to everything subsequently will be harder if i have done so the finding a place to live and a job and so on but not impossible i am not stupid i can survive some time later i am vaguely aware of being pushed gently upright and something the water jug perhaps being taken out of my hands i am tucked into bed and the light is turned out i feel very sleepy and in a way happy to be so cosy in my wrapping of sheets and the feeling of dozing quietly off while another part of me is shrieking with fury and terror screaming at me to wake up and get away do something anything he comes for me again during that night the drug still holds me and it is as though everything happens through layers and layers of swaddling through multiple bundlings of something insulating and muddling making everything vague and fuzzy round the edges there is an impression of the quality of the light and sound around me changing somehow of the door being opened and closed very quietly and then there is the feeling that somebody else is here in the room with me at first i feel no sense of threat i have a vague groundless and completely stupid feeling that this person is here to protect and look after me to tend to me then i feel something happening to my bed i still persist with the vague sensation that all is well and i am being cared for they must be tucking me in how nice how like being a child safe and warm and loved and quietly looked after but i am not being looked after and the bed is being unmade not made untucked sheets and blanket loosened a way being made clear i feel the sliding spiderlycreeping probing hand slide into the bed and over my body at my hip i feel my pyjamas being touched and investigated and then the cord that ties them being found and gently at first tugged at the knot does not give and the tugging becomes harder more impatient and aggressive in all of this it is as though i am watching everything on a screen feeling it not as something that is happening to me but as something that is happening somewhere else to somebody else and the sensations accompanying the experience the sensations that are the experience are being transmitted to me through some technology or ability i have not heard of i am dissociated from whats going on this is not happening or at least not to me so i have no need to react to try to do anything because what good would that do its not happening to me except of course as one part of my mind has known all along and is still bellowing and yowling about it entirely is happening to me the hand undoes the knot on my pyjama bottoms and pulls them forcibly down there is a roughness and an urgency to the hands movements now that was not there before i think that whoever is doing this realises that i am truly in a deeply drugged sleep and so am not likely to wake up and start resisting or screaming and there is too horribly horribly a feeling of something like the uncaring passion that infects lovers when they cannot wait to get at each other when clothes are ripped off the self and the other when hands shake when bruises happen unmeant unfelt at the time when shouts and screams and crashings and bangings ring out without a care who hears them when we abandon ourselves utterly to something that is neither fully ourselves or them any more but something that lies between us aside from us beyond us i think i can remember feeling like that wanting somebody like that being wanted like that this this singlehanded furtiveness this selfish unmindful groping however urgent however needy dear fuck this is a sad pathetic petty thing in comparison something inside me wants to cry confronted with the memory of such wild and joyous passion such fervently mutualised desire contrasted with this sordid sweaty feeling and grabbing and squeezing i think i do feel hot tears in my eyes and on my cheeks so i can feel at least if not react would i rather this than outright unconsciousness until its all over is it better to witness such violation and know that it most surely happened or better to know nothing until one wakes up sore bemused suspecting perhaps but able to dismiss it forget about it i dont know anyway i seem to have no choice either about it happening to me or about the fact that i am aware of it the hand tires of manipulating my genitals and starts trying to turn me over onto my side rotating my body so that my exposed rear is turned towards my violator what heat there is in tears of such frustration how can i let this happen to me how can somebody do something so base and selfish and debased to another person my brain is still minutes behind events but my heart seems to be waking up to what is occurring it thrashes and spasms in my chest as though trying to wake me up through the sheer physical disturbance pulsing through my body i feel something happening with my behind i think my arms and hands might be flapping now trying to move to beat away though i could be imagining this i go with the feeling anyway trying to reinforce and strengthen it imaginary or not something enters me a finger into my anus too thin and hard and jointed to be a penis no worse than a doctors dispassionate probing in theory but this is not dispassionate this is not for my own good this is only for the pleasure of the person doing this to me motherfucker how fucking dare they i summon one vast wave of disgust and fury and put it all into one arm striking back at my assailant then i squeeze my lungs contract my belly throwing a pulse of sound out upwards through my throat vomiting a scream that quickly turns into a cough and a terrible squeezing constricting pain all across my chest imprisoning me the finger pulls roughly out of me i heave myself onto my back getting a glimpse of my attacker as they send the seat clattering to the floor and dash for the door i recognise him it is the duty nurse from downstairs the fellow who whistled his uniform covered by a patients dressing gown he puts his head down and hunches his shoulders as he makes his escape into the corridor outside i hear the duty nurse on this floor a female nurse tonight saying something then shouting my door slams shut outside i hear running but i am flat on my back hardly hearing it for the noise in my chest hardly caring about anything any more except the sensation that a tentonne iron giant is pinning me down one knee planted firmly on my chest as he squeezes the life out of me the band around my chest cinches tighter and the pain grows a little worse the last thing im fully aware of is the nurse coming into my room taking one look at me and running off is that the reaction of a seasoned professional health worker im not sure about this but somehow it scarcely seems to matter any more this crushing constricting pain beyond pain is all that matters an alarm sounds not that i can hear it very well in the vast overeverything silence that seems to be dropping onto me like some inky overcast raining pain then i think the door bangs open and somebody starts thumping me on the chest as though i havent had enough to endure this night they tear open my pyjama top and i want to protest please passion something shared wanted yearned for not imposed not this wrong they put my head back put their lips to mine and kiss blowing into me i smell her perfume oh that old sweetness i will miss that but still unasked for still a sort of violation also frankly been eating garlic more thumping and thudding against the hollow cavern of quietness that is my chest i drift away despite the smashing and whacking and the regular purposeful breathful kissing trying to fill the void caged by my ribs then voices and lights and a feeling of crowding come all ye in there is plenty of room here my loves in my empty chest and increasingly vacant mind if nowhere else so be at home my guests ill stay so long and then so long something pulls across me like a hawser side to side plucking me like some thick and fleshy string set vibrating forcing my back bowing up off the bed jangling every nerve and fibre of my being before releasing me letting me fall back with relief something resumes some regularity returns to matters like a stopped engine at last coughing hesitantly back into life i think i dont know im still sort of drifting like a boat at a quayside half disconnected just one painter securing it letting it move and wheel and jerk according to the vagaries of tides currents and winds it would not take much of a tug to separate me altogether from this mooring but i am lucky and it does not happen feeling myself drift into a sort of warm fogbank a pocket of peace i bump against the pier again and am secured once more and so here i lie back in my own bed in my own room brought back to life and grateful for that but lying here in dread for i think i have seen what happens next i believe that i know what is coming i cannot get away i am too exhausted too weak too sedated too disabled by all that has passed to be able to get up and go or even sit up and beg i try to speak to tell the staff what i fear what i have seen happening but i seem to have lost the words i can formulate the sentences in my head and i think i am speaking them in my own language inside my head well enough and perfectly coherently when i speak my own language out loud even though i know nobody will understand but the translation into the language spoken here by these nurses and doctors and cleaners and other patients that seems to have gone from me i speak gibberish no matter what i try to say and anyway talk so softly that i think theyd struggle to hear even if i was enunciating with exemplary clarity so here i lie seeing through the day and the hazy sweep of the suns slow track across the sky outside and the sheltering blinds between us waiting for darkness waiting for night wondering if it will be this night and knowing that it will be and the darkdressed man will come for me before the morning i feel tears well in my eyes and trickle gently down my cheeks intercepted and guttered only when they meet one of the various tubes and pipes and wires that join me to the various pieces of medical equipment clustered quietly around me like mourners around somebody already dead the transitionary no wonder ive been losing track of myself im sitting at a little café a short way from the railway station back to the wall nursing an americano and watching the boats stream up and down the grand canal just along the broad quayside a line of tourists stand with their luggage waiting to pick up water taxis at the next table two australian guys are arguing about whether its espresso or expresso look for christs sake its there in black and white that could be a misprint man like chinese instructions you dont know i am still toying with my newfound senses sensibilities even i have done no more leaping into other peoples brains whether concern or civilian i seem to have a sort of vague spotter sense which is quite useful i can sense that the baffled disordered demoralised intervention teams are still milling about the palazzo chirezzia their members collecting themselves tending to their wounded making their excuses to each other and themselves still not entirely able to understand what really happened and waiting for backup and assistance to arrive this is all happening just a few hundred metres away from where im sitting i am ready to move quickly away if i need to but for now im happy that i can see them without them seeing me another sense they give the impression of deaf people talking loudly amongst themselves and not realising that they are doing so while i am sitting here perfectly silent i would be nervous about putting it to the test however im oddly but completely confident that a spotter could pass me by right here a metre or two away and have no idea that somebody capable of transitioning was sitting watching them and of course they have no idea what i look like now i have been able to take more control of this glasswalls futurepaths sense at the moment it is telling me that nothing especially threatening is imminent looking backwards is possible too though its like i can see down corridors in my head in my memory and as though there is a nearinfinite series of doors angled partially to face me as i look down from one end of any particular corridor so that by looking closely and then zooming in on each one i can see what happened during different transitions i once made there is an uncanny impression that this is at once one corridor and many that it leads off in an explosion of different directions scattered vertically and horizontally and in dimensions that i would struggle to put a name to but despite this my mind seems able to cope with the experience here is the time just passed when i bamboozled the whole of not just one conventionally configured but highskillandexperience level concern intervention team but two and more like three if you count the people watching the perimeter all at the palazzo chirezzia barely an hour ago here is the time i sat in a room with somebody i thought i loved and watched transfixed as her hand moved through a candle flame like silk this is me chasing two fuckedup kids though a parisian sink estate and watching them die and again except differently here is the time i blew that musicians brains out while he sat in his preposterously blinged halftrack look observe how i save a young man from certain death here see how i stare at madame dortolans tits zitted with diamonds and this is me with my pals walking down a street and stopping by a fat old geezer sunbathing in his postagestampsize front garden one sunny day long ago i sit indulging myself in my own internal slide show amused as all hell ive let my americano grow cold the grand canal still froths with boats passing to and fro the arguing aussies are gone confusion tempered by affronted professional pride still reigns at the palazzo chirezzia and there is a little fear there too because their backup has started to arrive at last and theyve heard that madame dortolan is also on her way with questions a warm wind scented with tobacco smoke and diesel exhaust stirs me from my reverie back to the present and the insistent reality of the here and now indeed all this historical stuff is highly intriguing but there is the small matter of my being hunted with pretty much every resource the concern is able to bring to bear that needs attending to beyond that the coup that madame dortolan would appear to be trying to mount is either proceeding or not i have already done what i can in that regard i can only hope that my attempts to alert mrs m to the targets id been sent after worked and they have been warned and put themselves safe my present embodiment came complete with a mobile phone i try calling my new friend ade on his way here with a cunningly worked container full of septus but his mobile telephone is switched off and his office tells me that he is away expected back tomorrow sometime i look at the timepiece wrapped round my wrist the smaller but more important hand points to the two parallel lines just off the vertical to the left eleven adrian said that he should be here by four in the afternoon we are to meet at the quadri on the piazza san marco safely surrounded by the tourist throng it seems i have to wait i pay then go for a walk crossing the grand canal by the scalzi bridge and coming back the same way half an hour later an elegantly curved new one further up is only a week or two from being opened i wander into the station sit down in the café and order another americano the better to sip slowly i have a faint desire to count how many platforms there are in the station but it is residual easily ignored the phone rings a few times and its screen shows me the faces of the people calling annata claudio ehno i dont answer i take several more walks around the western end of cannaregio and the nearer parts of santa croce and sit in several more cafés none too far from the palazzo chirezzia keeping the vague hubbub in internal view at all times i sit quietly seemingly watching people actually probing further into my own pasts i am sitting in a little tourist café on the fondamenta venier near the ponte guglie when i am recognised i prepare for the worst but it is just somebody who knows this body this face enquiring why im not at work this afternoon i look furtive and embarrassed and stick to vague generalities mostly keeping my head down the man nods winks and taps me on the shoulder before he walks off he thinks i am waiting for my lover i drain my lemon tea and leave ive had enough coffee i walk to another café on the rio tera de la madalena a spritz this time and some pasta staring at the spaghetti in my bowl i drift into a strange trancelike state at first wondering how many individual strands of the pasta lengths there might be in the bowl then how many metres they would all add up to if laid end to end then realising as i toy with the pale soft strands draping them languorously voluptuously over the tines of my fork that their aggregated complexity is like the various entangled themes and episodes of my life a swirling hideously complicated topologically tortuous possibly knotted exposition of my very own reality lying dumped and glistening here in the moist coils lying on the plate before me the sliced abbreviated strands like the lives i have cut short the glistening red of passata adding an appropriately gory sheathing how many lives i reflect how many elisions and abbreviations how many slack abandonments and how many lives and deaths of my own selfelisions lives lived briefly in the head and body of another then skipped away from blithely flicked like dust from a sleeve every mission a suicide mission every transition a transition from life to death and back again but still a death i drift almost without meaning to into my private viewing theatre of the past here i am toddling saddled on my mothers hip dandled on my fathers knee going to school leaving home arriving at upt making friends going to classes seeing mrs m for the first time studying drinking dancing fucking sitting exams vacationing at home fucking mrs m for the first time fucking mrs m for the last time standing drunk on a parapet in aspherje looking out over the drop to the great park on the far side and wondering where she had gone why she had abandoned me and whether i should just jump and then falling backwards too wasted to stand or balance or even cry here i am training to be a fucking multiversal ninja instead i can even see how i got where i am metaphysically too if you know what i mean how and why i have changed and my abilities have developed over the last few months and weeks and days and even hours i was always a natural always a good learner i always saw things clearly and i was just genetically predisposed to take transitioning and its associate skills to places they had never been before with the right sort of push it doesnt even make me that special untold trillions of similarly potentially gifted minds have lived and died on untold worlds all unknowing their existences just never divined never sniffed out by lexpédience and i can see how all those fraught dangerous extra missions that madame do sent me on were what made the difference what proved me and tempered me and forced me to find and cultivate skills within that i did not know i had i can see these traits these attributes quite clearly in myself now and i suppose it is just possible that the right properly attuned sort of person a mulverhill a dortolan might have seen them or at least their potential in me years ago if they were able to glance in at just the right angle i snap out of my reverie when the waiter nudges my seat deliberately probably waking me from my dream the light has changed the remnants of pasta are quite cold i glance at my watch it is fifteen past four oclock if i stick with this body then even if i try to run through the crowds by the time i get to san marco ill be half an hour late maybe i should take the next right and get to the grand canal call a water taxi or maybe i should do the smart thing and just swap bodies with somebody already in san marco i close my eyes prepare to do whatever it was that let me flit across to this body and cant do it what whats going on i try again but still nothing its like im back to being blocked again im stuck with this body i rise throw down a handful of notes to cover the bill start walking quickly in the direction of the san marco and pull out the phone to call adrian wondering if i can still sense concern people remotely like i could before or if thats gone too then stop in midbutton press and midstride stumbling to a halt as i realise yes i can still sense stuff and what i sense now is that a profound change has taken place within the palazzo chirezzia something very strange and unpleasant has appeared in the small crowd of concern people in and around the building something bizarrely different and not benign who or what is that whatever or whoever it is i have the disturbing feeling that its what is blocking me and also that as i look at it its looking straight back at me with a kind of predatory fascination adrian hello whos this ade its fred who you are coming to meet yeah fred right look mate im en route amnt i bit optimistic getting through the formalities and then from the old aeroporto to the city in fortyodd minutes sorry about that but you know what its like in a water taxi wotsit now though making maximum speed driver says we should be there in about ten fifteen minutes that be all right yes adrian please tell your driver to take you to the rialto ill meet you there not san marco im running late too and we should get to the rialto at about the same time rialto not san marco gotcha thats the bridge innit thats right okeydoke see you there mate dont display the box though eh oh okay stand as close as you can to the very middle of the bridge right at the top of the walking surface got that middle top what outer clothes are you wearing blue jeans white shirt sort of umm orangey beigey leather jacket ill find you okay then see you there madame dortolan the voice was singsong herehere hyahhyah in the main study of the palazzo chirezzia bisquitine sat sprawled unladylike on a rather grand couch whose white covering had only recently been removed she picked her nose then inspected the finger involved crosseyed mrs siankung sat to one side of her one of her handlers to the other madame dortolan sat on an ornate chair a couple of metres away across a persian rug and a still sheetcovered occasional table the other handlers stood behind the couch now my dear madame dortolan said quietly be very sure about this hes still here still in the city still in venice are you certain bisquitine sucked in her lips looked meaningfully up at the painted ceiling of the study and said these are my lawyers called gumsip and slurridge theyll send you the bill and then talk of demurrage she smiled broadly displaying white teeth with little bits of seaweed stuck between them the body shed found herself within when they had transitioned had been that of a smartly dressed young woman carrying a briefcase shed been standing on a pontoon waiting for a vaporetto when her own consciousness had been displaced by that of bisquitine who had immediately decided the weed growing on the side of the floating jetty looked edible in fact delicious madame dortolan looked at mrs siankung who watched bisquitine with anxious concentration bisquitine appeared dishevelled already hair awry her businesswomans jacket removed as an annoyance her blouse hanging half out buttons undone at the bottom tights laddered shoes discarded she brought her head back and stuck her jaw out lowering her voice to something close to a mans as she said blinkenscoop why you silly man what do you call this a fine todo to do todo todo todooooo i cant see with you in the way begone you tea urchin she will need one of the other blockers to be sure mrs siankung announced madame dortolan and mr kleist exchanged glances they were out of character in a sense he was too young wiry and blond she too fat and awkward with badly dyed greyblack hair and a loud orange velour trouser suit mrs siankung was similarly wrong manifesting as a massive robustly built woman in a voluminous yellow dress who needed a threepointed aluminium stick to walk theyd had no time to find body types closer to their own especially as theyd all had to transition together with bisquitine and her handlers who had been similarly randomised in physiques madame dortolan frowned a blocker youre sure i think you mean a spotter mr kleist suggested no a blocker mrs siankung said reaching out to flick an unruly lock off her charges forehead and it has to be one of those who was here earlier with the first intervention team madame dortolan glanced at mr kleist and nodded he left the room bisquitine made as though to slap mrs siankungs hand away then started pulling at her long brown still mostly gatheredup hair tugging a thick length of it free and putting the end of it in her mouth and starting to chew contentedly on it she looked at a distant painting with an expression of great concentration what will happen to the blocker madame dortolan asked mrs siankung looked at her you know what will happen mr kleist returned with one of the two blockers a few minutes later the young man had been dried off after his dunking in the canal beside the palaces landing stage his dark hair was slicked down he was dressed in a towelling robe and he was smoking a cigarette put that out mrs siankung told him i work better with it he said glancing to madame dortolan who remained expressionless he sighed took a final deep draw found an ashtray on the broad desk and stubbed the cigarette out he took a frowning look at bisquitine as he did so she was in turn obviously fascinated by him staring wideeyed and still holding the hank of hair to her mouth while she chewed noisily at it a slight bald man hurried through the study doors came up to madame dortolan and kissed her hand madame i am at your disposal professore loscelles she replied patting his hand a pleasure as ever i am so sorry your lovely home has been made such a mess of not at all not at all he murmured please stay will you certainly the professore stood at the rear of madame dortolans chair the sheetcovered table was moved back and the young man who was employed as a blocker was sat on a chair immediately in front of bisquitine almost knee to knee he looked a little nervous he pulled the robe tighter cleared his throat she will take your wrists mrs siankung told him he nodded cleared his throat again bisquitine looked expectantly at mrs siankung who nodded the girl made a noise like grooh and sat forward quickly grabbing at the young mans wrists and encircling them as best she could with her own smaller hands while she thudded her head against his chest the reaction was immediate the young man bowed his back jackknifed forward and as though doing so deliberately vomited copiously over bisquitines head hair and back before quivering as though suffering a fit and starting to slump backwards in the seat and then slide forwards out of it legs splaying as he lost control of his bladder and bowels at the same time dear fuck madame dortolan said standing so suddenly that she knocked her chair over professore loscelles put a handkerchief to his mouth and nose and turned away bowing his head mr kleist did not react at all save to glance briefly as though concerned at madame dortolan then he walked over and carefully set her chair upright again mrs siankung moved her feet away from the mess bisquitine didnt seem to have noticed still cuddling into the young man and pulling him to her as he spasmed and jerked and voided noisily from various orifices whos a bad boy then they heard bisquitine say over the noises of evacuation coming from the young man her voice muffled as she hugged his shaking body and they collapsed together onto the floor a thick earthy stink filled the air whos a bad boy wheres this wheres this then you tell me ay ferrovia ferrovia al san marco fondamenta venier ay giacobbe is that you no its not me ponte guglie alora rio tera de la madalena strada nova al san marco alora il quadri due espressi per favore signori bozman who said you could come along get back get away get thee to your own shop if you have one euh yucky bisquitine seemed to notice the mess she was lying in she let go of the young man who flopped lifeless on the rug streaked with his own excrement his eyes wide almost popping stared up at the biblical scene depicted on the ceiling bisquitine got to her feet smiling brightly she stuck the length of hair in her mouth again then made a sour face and spat it out she continued to spit for a few more moments before holding her arms out to mrs siankung as a child would straight fingers spread bath time she cried out madame dortolan looked to professore loscelles who was dabbing at his lips with his handkerchief he nodded it would sound he said hoarsely as though the person is heading from santa lucia the railway station towards the piazza san marco so it would seem given the names of the thoroughfares mentioned or they may already be there at the quadri it is a café and rather fine restaurant very good cake madame dortolan looked at the other man standing nearby mr kleist ill see to it maam he left the room bisquitine stamped one foot messily bath time she said loudly mrs siankung looked to madame dortolan who said shower she glanced distastefully at bisquitine and dont tarry we may need her again soon the transitionary i make my way through the slow bustle of tourists on the main route leading towards the rialto and beyond towards both the accademia and piazza san marco moving as quickly as i can without actually throwing people aside or trampling small children scusi scusi scusi signora excuse me sorry scusi coming through scusi scusi at the same time im still trying to monitor whats going on just across the grand canal what a stew of conflicting talents and abilities are massed around the palazzo chirezzia there are blockers and trackers and inhibitors and foreseers and adepts with skills i barely recognise many of them recently arrived i think i can identify individual presences now too that one there would be madame dortolan this one here might be professore loscelles and at the centre of them all that bizarre presence that strange guileless malignity one of the blockers seems to have gone i remember the first blocker id tasered the young man who was smoking and fell into the small canal at the side of the palace he isnt there any more and some of the others are starting to move quitting the chirezzia and streaming in this direction heading for the rialto others clustering in what must be a launch jesus hey watch where youre going what the i mean jesus scusi sorry sorry signore i beg your pardon i tell the backpacker ive just knocked to his knees helping him back up to a surrounding chorus of tutting well just scusi then im off again sliding and dancing through the crowd like the people are flags on a slalom course leading with one shoulder then the other sliding and swivelling on the balls of my feet the boat with the halfdozen or so concern people in it is on its way down the grand canal more maybe a dozen are on foot heading over the rialto now im just a couple of minutes away from there if they turn left on its far side theyll pass right by me or well bump into each other my phone goes its ade a symbol on the display that wasnt flashing before is flashing now i suspect the battery is about to give out fred hello adrian just landed at the rialto mate just past the vaporetto sort of floating bus stop wotsit on the bridge in one minute ill see you very shortly i stop walking into the doorway of a glove shop breathing hard i still cant flit across to another person i can feel the squad of concern people splitting up most heading on down the main route for san marco three coming this way i turn to face the calle and close down as much as i can calming myself attempting if its possible to take all that i can of my new abilities offline a minute or two passes the street teems with people i recognise somebody and my heart leaps then i realise theyre heading the other way and its just the backpacker i bowled into earlier i try a quick toein reading with my sense of where the concern people are all three of the nearest are still heading up the way ive just come i walk out and on and turn a corner find myself facing the eastern end of the rialto madame dortolan cripes heads up mateys heres our boy whoop whoop last one ins a scallop i say that aint politic i aint even broke my fast yet dontcha know what where madame dortolan said she glared at mrs siankung is this something new mrs siankung stared into bisquitines eyes letting one of the other handlers take over the job of towelling her hair dry i think so she said they were in one of the main bedroom suites of the palace mr kleist and professore loscelles looked on as did bisquitines handlers and a spotter in a schoolboys uniform who was keeping in continual touch with the intervention teams heading for the san marco and the smaller groups checking out the other places that bisquitine had already mentioned bisquitine sat on the bed in a white towelling robe like the one the unfortunate young blocker had been wearing this is the bad man mrs siankung asked her gently bisquitine nodded dish it all chaplip im hungry i mean jeepahs mrs siankung took one of the girls hands in both of hers stroking it as though it was a pet we shall eat my love very soon you get dressed now and we go to eat yes where is the bad man sausinges would be nice i says it like that cos its cute wheres my old ma then i aint seen her round the blinkin farmstead in mumfs the bad man my love hes here loveakins bisquitine said putting her face very close to mrs siankungs shalls we to go see da bad mun she said deepvoiced as though talking to a baby she shook her head shalls we shalls we to go and see the bad mun shalls we shalls we yes mrs siankung said quietly at the same time as madame dortolan shouted enough of this bisquitine seemed to ignore them both she stuck one finger sharply up into the air narrowly missing the eye of the handler towelling her hair to the rialto me hearties realty bound tally fucking prostimitute madame dortolan looked at professore loscelles the rialto thats close isnt it five minutes away he told her mrs siankung patted bisquitines hand well get you dressed she started to say no we wont madame dortolan said standing bring her as she is its warm out she looked sourly round them all only professore loscelles appeared like himself or well enough turned out to be presentable we cant look any more ridiculous than we do already the transitionary it looks like all humanity is packing the rialto the bridge over the grand canal is compact but massive sturdy yet elegant two lines of small packed shops are separated by the broad central way whose surface is composed of flights of shallow greysurfaced steps edged with the same creamcoloured marble found throughout the city behind the shops two further walkways face up and down the canal linked to the pitched street of the central thoroughfare at either end and the centre the walkway facing southwest is the busier as it provides a longer more open view down the canal and the bustle of boats plying its milky bluegreen waters theyve left the palazzo chirezzia the thing the person the nexus of sheer terrifying weirdness is on the move and so is practically everybody else who was still there including madame herself and the prof theyre a minute away they can probably see the bridge by now my mobile phone goes and i start to answer it seeing that its adrian the display blinks off the phone wont come back to life i shove it in a pocket and start up the slope of the rialto with the rest of the tourist crowd madame dortolan when sir why sir ill tell you when then between the quilth of octoldyouso and the nonce of distember thats jolly well when bisquitines shout echoed off the surrounding buildings hush my dear mrs siankung said conscious of the stares they were attracting they were on the ruga orefici within sight of the rialto bisquitine padded happily along in the midst of their motley collection of ungainly bodies and unfortunate clothing styles she wore the same towelling robe shed been wrapped in after her shower and had been persuaded into a pair of panties but had adamantly refused shoes or even slippers she hugged the gown about her looked round at the various shops with their excitingly bright displays and tried unsuccessfully to whistle the smell of a bakery distracted her as the square in front of san giacomo di rialto opened out to their left still hungry she cried out i know dear mrs siankung said trying to keep an arm round the girls waist well eat soon wot you lookin at then squire bisquitine said in a deep voice as two bronzeskinned teenage girls passed by staring and then laughing at her pop a crap on yo petal bitches upside ya head an no mitsake mistake mystique mustique i meant that shush now dear claudia a man said suddenly stepping right in front of bisquitine she had to stop as did the others the man was tall he wore sunglasses had saltandpepper hair wore a suit and carried a briefcase he took the sunglasses off frowned eyes screwing up as he stared into bisquitines eyes ill met by sunlight my good fellow bisquitine said haughtily why ive half a mind to scratch the boundah the man looked confused and concerned in equal measure claudia he asked is that you you were supposed to be at he took a step back taking in the knot of people obviously with this woman who looked like somebody he knew and yet was not her hey what the hells mr kleist didnt wait for the nod from madame dortolan he stepped up to the man saying sir if i may explain and did a straightfinger jab into his throat gasping eyes wide unable to speak clutching his gullet the man staggered back it had been done so quickly that it seemed nobody had noticed ill catch you up mr kleist told the others quietly he squatted as he made the man sit down on the road surface still wheezing and struggling for air madame dortolan glared at mr kleist but he couldnt just leave the man making that noise he told himself that he was lingering here because he needed to make sure the man stayed down out of action not likely to follow them but really it was to stop him making that terrible choking gasping noise to ease him he pinched the fellows neck attempting to reopen his windpipe the man tried to bat his hand away a crowd of people had formed around them and he heard somebody call for the carabinieri the man made a series of terrible gagging strangling sucking noises bisquitine glanced back as they hurried away dat gotta hurt sho nuff id get some cream on that trot on dearest mrs siankung said please were nearly there very soon when sir why sir ill tell you when then somba tyme atwixt da the quilth of oncoldyousuch and zee chonce of plastemper tankums wilcums noddinks hurtsies ohdearohdearohdrear ohdearohdrearohdrolldums the backstroke in these shoes have you taken leafs off your fences enough already you muddy funster youre landfill i wish we could shut her up madame dortolan muttered to professore loscelles as they hurried up towards the broad shallow steps of the rialto itself i suspect the professore began tuktuk talkink in the ranks bisquitine sounded affronted there there dearest mrs siankung said patting her arm she glanced back at madame dortolan noo bisquitine intoned in her deep masculinesounding voice but quate appy to use this poor damaged creatchah for your own dimmed ignoble ends midim aint dat de trute bisq shh poor damaged creatchah poor damaged creatchah they had climbed almost to the summit of the rialto the crowds growing ever thicker and more chaotic madame dortolan grasped mrs siankungs arm is he here bisquitine stopped suddenly did a little dance and with one arm straight out pointing said triumphantly bingo bandits ahoy chumlets thar she blows adrian so im standing here at the very top of the very middle bit of the rialto in venice feeling like a bit of a muppet and wondering what the chances are that this is some gigantic longwinded longgame windup except it cant be can it all that monthis as standard instruction ey over the years was real enough and the box mrs m sent and fred asked me to bring didnt show up in my hand luggage when i went through heathrow security did it sailed past but anyway that isnt stopping me from getting that whatthefuckamidoinghere feeling even though yes its all very lovely in a sunny chocolateboxy cantmoveforbleedintourists kind of a way and here i go having to step away from the very top of the very centre bit yet again because yet another group of japanese or chinese or whatever tourists want to take a photograph of one of them standing at exactly that point when this little bunch of frankly not very well dressed people come marching up the steps from the opposite direction i arrived from theres a mousy bint in a white dressing gown in the middle of them hair straggling everywhere muttering to herself proper nutter then she sees me and sort of jogs on the spot and points and blabbers something just as i feel a hand on my elbow cupping it like a brandy glass but i dont know which way to look because this lot with the lady in white at their centre are all fucking looking at me now and starting up the slope towards me while the person behind me holding my elbow says quietly adrian im fred the transitionary adrian turns to me and his expression and body language changes instantly tem my darling man he says i stare at him then look beyond him to where the others are the small group intermittently visible through the swirl of people coming and going and chattering and laughing on the bridge this group includes madame dortolan professore loscelles and the frightening weirdness of the presence that has been blocking my newfound abilities for the last halfhour except she isnt blocking them any more not since the instant that somebody different stepped into adrian s shoes the approaching group is six or seven metres away hurrying raggedly towards us tem my love adrian says i believe youre free to do something now i think youd better do it leave madame do i need to talk to her i cant approach the girls mind the rest the people who attend her the prof the muscle boys and the specialist adepts including a guy called kleist whos hurrying towards the group from the street behind them i can work with they all become convinced they really are tourists and just wander off to look at the lovely views i work the same trick with the rest of the intervention teams all of whom had been ordered to aboutturn and are in the process of converging on the rialto the group in the launch currently exceeding the speed limit back up the grand canal to a wavelike chorus of shouts and horns and almost at the rialto unanimously decide to visit burano for ice creams though theyll be pulled over by a police launch near the railway station a few minutes later anyway meanwhile all lexpédience people who were carrying weapons have picked them out of their pockets with looks of puzzled distaste and holding them by thumb and finger disposed of them four tasers and six handguns have splashed into canals to join all the other secrets the waves have hidden over the centuries the whole fragre of the locality relaxes distinctly for a few moments madame dortolan is left bewildered then she starts shouting furiously at her people as they saunter away wideeyed smiling ignoring her mr kleist loscelles mr kleist only bisquitine remains unaffected looking bemused as the people around her disperse rum todo she muses and picks her nose business elsewhere mr rumblebunk ill be bound so i have time to ask adrian mrs m she makes adrian bow indeed hello tem glad you jumped the way you did welcome aboard you can do this flit to somebody whos already been transitioned she spreads adrian s arms patently well when it was me who popped their transitioning cherry anyway good trick eh ive been developing my talents so have you obviously congratulations the people on the list safe i got to all of them first she winks at me itll cost ya and what now im afraid you have to go my love she feels inside the jacket pulls out the box that adrian brought from london and gives it to me take this and get well away tem i mean well away untraceably distant she glances round to see madame dortolan looking undecided then with a word and a nod to the girl in the white robe start towards us again she turns back no matter what happens here you need to disappear whoever controls the concern even if its the good guys chances are theyll want to find you and take your mind to bits to find out how you can flit without septus or theyll just kill you she smiles nods at the box soon you wont need that again she glances briefly towards madame dortolan who is having to push a party of laughing chinese girls out of the way to get to us now go she says closing my fingers round the box youve done all you can this is my show now i hope i see you again go she places a finger briefly on my lips then turns away to face madame dortolan mrs mulverhill the angrylooking woman in the orange velour jumpsuit walks up to the man in the tan jacket ignoring the jostling crowds and the wash of humanity pressing in from all sides the girl in the white towelling robe trails vaguely after her still digging into her nose with the one remaining fingernail she hasnt broken or cracked in the hours since she found herself in this body she sighs still hungry she mutters she finds something up her nose and eats it success chewy and salty madame dortolan stands in front of mrs mulverhill close enough for the veloured breasts and belly of her current incarnation to touch adrian s shirt open jacket jeans she stares into the greygreen eyes hello theodora mrs mulverhill says in adrian s pleasantly deep voice hows tricks madame dortolan tries to take adrian s wrists in her hands but finds her own wrists grasped i dont think so theodora lets stay here and discuss this like civilised people shall we what in the holy fuck are you mulverhill just a concerned citizen of the concern theodora mrs mulverhill uses adrian s face to smile over madame dortolan at the girl in the white robe bisquitine waves back with one finger sui amazaro climb evry woman ah belong to you underground you hypocritical bitch oh now theodora im not the one trying to murder my way to absolute power within the central council you might have noticed your loyalists have gone unharmed really what about harmyle oh he was a traitor so many times over that im not sure even he knew who he was betraying at the end he was a disloyalist i think offing him was just to get your attention you think lets ask oh himself shall we madame dortolan struggles to free her hands in vain the point is i could have murdered them all in their sleep if id wanted to but then im not you im going to stay an outsider youll stay dead when we kill you youd have to catch me first which you have signally failed to do so far try flitting now then oh i know so close to your little friend here were all stuck with what weve got and with their vulnerabilities madame dortolan hisses and tries to knee adrian s body in the balls mrs mulverhill turns adrian to one side still gripping madame dortolans wrists the velourpadded knee thuds into the side of adrian s thigh ow now theodora civilised remember eye bee eye bee for eye foroh bisquitine sings its all idiotic nonsense mamas little baby loves shortbus shortbus she is standing quite close

her arms looking grumpy leiplig she growls my war chariot at once dyou hear madame dortolan turns and presses further into adrian who tenses as mrs mulverhill holds her ground madame dortolan goes on tiptoe to put her mouth as close as she can to adrian s ear if i had a gun id blow your brains out the top of your fucking head jings well take that rifle now chuck mrs mulverhill makes adrian sigh youre not entirely comfortable with this whole civilised concept are you theodora why are you doing this mulverhill you could have been on the council years ago thered have been peace a pardon no grudges were pragmatists and youre gifted you made your point what more can you want give up this day our mendelbrot all this is tired theodora adrian s voice says mrs mulverhill uses adrian s face to smile at a couple of passing nuns monochrome punctuations amidst the colourful throng and keeping me talking while your teams come groggily back to their senses isnt going to work in the meantime our man tem is getting away and anyway your little chum there is ticking down to zero she nods at bisquitine who is staring intently at the back of madame dortolans head und dat is dat und vat noo terminé terminé let me worry about her i wish you had but its too late now adrian s voice says with every appearance of resignation and sadness madam i dont think you realise what youve unleashed here and you do of course yes like tem i can see round corners well get him too late i got to him long ago i bet you did my sweet my finest pupil though it was you who really brought him on all those missions were

this is already over i can see the ways forward from here and they all go to fuck madame dortolan shouts as she struggles again to free her hands mrs mulverhill keeps adrian s body turned to the side protecting his groin bisquitine rolls her eyes excuse your being french ill thank you to keep a civil lung in your chest oy i is posimitively biafric here missus wumin do i look facking effiopian you caahnt madame dortolan ignores her inside adrian s head mrs mulverhill can still sense tems presence she has a sudden vision of him standing at the bar of a café just out of bisquitines damping range hes draining an espresso quickly she can feel the various concern people starting to remember who and where they were and why then tems presence winks out bless you she murmurs what help me general betrayus youre my only hope nothing whats it all been for theodora apart from power you know what its all been for she smiles i think i do now but you cant hold it back for ever yes i can there are a

of every fucking one of them that will soon no longer be in your power you think so like it or not i like it not terminé hoopla adrianmrs mulverhill glances over madame dortolan at the girl in the white towelling robe goodbye theodora she makes adrian say and lets go of the womans wrists pushing her gently away while the crowd surges all around them bisquitine tired with it all says ach then get ye gone all ye and in a blink go they did to the scattered realities she flung them to every remaining concern consciousness on earth save for two just disappearing plucked and hurled away to their various fates a few partchosen by themselves where those being thrown had the time and the wit to grasp what was happening and were allowed to exercise some control over their crossreality trajectory by bisquitine but many with no understanding and no control permitted tumbling into wherever they happened to have been directed some more pointedly than others the one who thought of herself as madame dortolan was heaved away with particularly enthusiastic gusto but also with a kind of ruthless disregard with no control allowed over her own destination but also with no exceptional care taken by bisquitine over where dortolan landed or what her precise fate would be let her know that control was not everything and that she had been dismissed discarded judged by the abused freak as being unworthy of any singular treatment that would hurt more than any contrived tormenting all that mattered was that they were gone and they could control her no longer she was finally free of them they had let her grow too strong because theyd thought they were so clever and she was so stupid only she wasnt so stupid after all no matter how clever they might think they were and they had never really understood what she could do and what she had kept hidden from them that was because there was a core inside her a steely soul of rage theyd never really glimpsed in her because shed kept it concealed from them for all that time unafraid and only finally unleashed it now when theyd thought to use her and she had used them instead so there the people who had been taken over were suddenly back again staggering looking round astonished nonplussed wondering what had happened where the day had gone the woman in the orange velour jumpsuit looked around her not really registering the man in the tan jacket standing a couple of paces ahead of her she turned round frowned at the strangelooking woman dressed in what looked like a hotel dressing gown then pushed past her and wandered off to be consumed by the swarming crowd but he didnt go bisquitine noticed the man in the tan jacket whod been waiting at the exact centre of the bridge the one whod given the box to the man whod walked away who had then disappeared all by himself the one whod held on to the bossy orange woman and had looked over her head at her when all the rest were gone that man was still there she looked at him frowning lips pursed brow furrowed eyes narrowed she thrust her jaw out briefly bit her bottom lip say youre from outa town you can stop now he said to her gently she thought he seemed

responsibility thats better funny old life sport okay random epilogue patient this is how it ends he comes into my room he is dressed in black and is wearing gloves it is dark in here just a night light on but he can identify me lying on the hospital bed propped up at a slight angle one or two remaining tubes and wires attaching me to various pieces of medical equipment he ignores these the nurse who would hear any alarm is lying trussed and taped down the hall the monitor in front of him switched off the man shuts the door darkening the room still further he walks quietly to my bedside though i am unlikely to wake as i am sedated lightly drugged to aid a good nights sleep he looks at my bed even in the dim light he can see that it is tightly made i am constricted within this envelope of sheets and blanket reassured by this confinement he takes the spare pillow from the side of my head and places it gently at first over my face then quickly bears down on me forcing his hands down on either side of my head pinning my arms under the covers with his elbows placing most of his weight on his arms and his chest his feet rising from the floor until only the tips of his shoes are still in contact with it i dont even struggle at first when i do he simply smiles my feeble attempts to bring my hands up and to use my legs to kick myself free come to nothing wound amongst these sheets even a fit man would have stood little chance of fighting his way from beneath such suffocating weight finally in one last hopeless convulsion i try to arch my back he rides this throe easily and in a moment or two i fall back and all movement ceases he is no fool he has anticipated that i might merely be playing dead so he lies quite calmly on me for a while as unmoving as me checking his watch now and again as the minutes tick by to make sure i am gone but there has been no intensifying beeping noise from the machine that monitors my heart its signal quickening as i expire no alarm has sounded at all he was expecting that one would so this troubles him a little i expect he glances at his wristwatch from this he would see that he has been lying on me for over two minutes since my last movement he frowns i imagine he presses down ever harder feet rising entirely off the polished vinyl floor with a squeak he has the same grasp of physiological limits as i do and so he knows that after four minutes brain death must be complete he waits until that time is up he relaxes his grip then tentatively releases me from the pillows embrace he pulls the pillow entirely away and stands there looking down at me glancing with a curious concerned but not especially worried expression at the monitoring machines on the far side of the bed he looks back at me a tiny frown on his face perhaps his eyes have adjusted a little better to the gloom now or perhaps he is looking for something to explain the lack of an alarm at last he notices the tiny transparent and in this light nearinvisible tube that leads from the oxygen cylinder standing amongst the other equipment to my nose i see this my eyes are even better adjusted to the darkness than his and are cracked open just enough to see his eyes suddenly widen my right arm slides free of the bedclothes i had felt for the paring knife hidden behind my bedside cabinet as soon as id heard the unusual noise in the corridor outside id switched the heart monitor off too i bring the hand with the knife sweeping out and round and up catching the pillow as he tries to parry the blow i feel the knife connect with something hard jarring my hand the pillow rips apart in a flurry of tiny pieces of white foam they billow and scatter and start to fall as he stumbles to the door holding one hand with the other i am falling already exhausted to the floor trailing bedclothes legs still half trapped by the constricting sheets my lunge has snapped or disconnected leads and cables and so finally produces some alarm noises from the nearby machines if he was thinking straight and was not injured and shocked by what has just happened my assailant might stay and finish the job taking advantage of my weakness but he stumbles crashing against the door whirls it open and runs out still holding his hand blood dark as ink spots on the floor as finally i slide out of the beds torque of sheets released from its confinement as though being birthed i lie gasping on the bloodslicked floor surrounded by tiny soft particles of foam still falling like snow nobody comes and eventually it is i who have to stagger along the corridor and cut the duty nurse free from his chair so he can call the police i sit back exhausted on the floor they find my attacker in his crashed car dead early the following morning the car is wrapped around a tree on a quiet road a few kilometres away from the clinic his hand wound was not lifethreatening but it bled copiously and he did not stop to staunch the bleeding properly the police think that probably some animal deer or fox most likely made him swerve and his hand bloodslicked slipped on the wheel it didnt help that he hadnt put his seat belt on i recover gradually over the next two months and leave without ceremony nearly a year and a half after first arriving at the clinic and and i accept that all that happened happened and i accept my part in it i accept too that it is over and that still the most rational explanation is that none of it happened that i made it all up i was never a man called temudjin oh of course that still leaves open the question of why somebody entered the hospital tied up the nurse and tried to smother me in my bed but no matter how i look at all this and try to explain it there is always at least one loose end and looking at it this way with that particular explanation resulting in that particular loose end produces the most comprehensive of the former and the least troubling of the latter whatever i am resigned to living a quiet and normal life henceforth and will be content with that i shall find a place to live and some honest constructive work to do if i can i shall put my dreams of the concern mrs mulverhill and madame dortolan and of having been mr oh behind me well see i suppose i could be wrong about any of this including the sensible stuff i have much to think about i think the philosopher when mr kleist wakes up he is in some pain his head hurts a lot he feels drunk or hungover or both he has a raging thirst he cant breathe very well this is because he is gagged with tape starting to panic he looks round he is in a cellar that he remembers from long ago he is tied tightly to a centralheating unit a youthful figure in a woollen ski mask comes carefully down the stairs holding a steaming kettle mr kleist starts trying to scream madame dortolan madame dortolan forcibly removed much reduced quite marooned on her way to watch the eclipse in lhasa on what she is sure will turn out to be another complete waste of time looks out of the window to watch the crumpled grey brown and green lands of tibet slide by she misses mr kleist though there was never anything sexual between them still she misses him her current assistant and bodyguard is asleep on the seat across from her snoring he is extremely well built and fit but quite without an original thought or even observation in his pretty thicknecked head she misses christophe the chauffeur from the other paris that was entirely sexual she breathes deeply sucking oxygen from the little mask attached to the trains supply she is still thinking of christophe when the door suddenly flies open the man is in the compartment and swinging round to face them arms triangled out fists closed round a long handgun before her eyes have had time to fully widen or her mouth can fully open the sleeping bodyguard never even wakes up the closest he gets is that his snoring stops the last expression on his face is a mild frown then his brains are blown across his burly shoulder and onto the carriage window in a greyred fan the impact of his head breaking the internal pane of the doubleglazed window spreading cracks like shattered ice madame dortolan flinches back horrified screaming as some of the blood and brains spatters over her the gunman kicks the door shut glances round the compartment madame dortolan cuts the scream off turns to face him she holds up one hand now just wait temudjin if thats you i still have considerable resources much to offer i he doesnt say anything he was only waiting for her to confirm who she was and shes done that now in the last second before she dies madame dortolan realises what is about to happen and stops saying what she was starting to say instead carefully pronouncing just the one word traitor only to you theodora the gunman murmurs to herself between the first and second head shots the pitcher mike esteros is sitting at the bar of the commodore hotel venice beach after yet another unsuccessful pitch technically he doesnt know its unsuccessful yet but hes developing a nose for these things and hed put money on another rejection its starting to get him down he still believes in the idea and hes still sure itll get made one day plus he knows that attitude is everything in this business he must remain positive if he doesnt believe in himself why should anybody else but well all the same the bar is quiet he wouldnt normally drink at this time of day maybe he needs to adjust the plot make it more familyoriented focus on the boy on the father son thing cute it up a little a dusting of schmaltz never did any harm well no real harm maybe hes been believing too much in the basic idea assuming that because its so obvious to him what a beautiful elegant thing it is itll be obvious to everybody else and theyll be falling over themselves to greenlight it and give him lots of money and dont forget goldmans law nobody knows anything nobody knows what will work thats why they make so many remakes and part twos what looks like lack of imagination is really down to too much as paranoid execs visualise all the things that could go wrong with a brand new untested idea going with something containing elements that definitely worked in the past removes some of the terrifying uncertainty what hes got here is a radical leftfield idea the central concept is almost too original for its own good thats why it needs a generous helping of conventionality slathered over it hell rework it again its not a prospect that fills him with joy frankly but he guesses it has to be done and he has to struggle on its worth it he still believes in it its just a dream but its a dream that could be made real and this is the place where that happens your dreams of your idea and your future self your fortunes get turned into reality here he still loves this place still believes in it too a woman comes in and sits two seats away shes rangy and dark dressed in jeans and shirt she sees him looking and he says hi asks if he can buy her a drink she thinks about it looks at him in a frankly evaluatory way and says okay a beer he asks to join her and she says yes to that as well shes cute and friendly and smart nice laugh just his type a lawyer on a day off just relaxing connie they get to talking have another beer each then decide theyre wasting the sunny day and go for a walk along the boardwalk beneath the tall palms watching the rollers rolling in the skaters skating the bladers blading the cyclists cycling the walkers walking and the surfers way in the distance surfing they sit in a little café still within sight of the beach then go for dinner in a little vietnamese place a short walk away he gives her the pitch because shes genuinely interested she thinks its a great idea it actually seems to make her thoughtful later they walk on the beach in the light of a halfmoon then sit and theres some kissing and a modest amount of fooling around though shes already told him she doesnt go any further on a first date him too he tells her though strictly speaking thats nonsense of course and he guesses that she guesses this but doesnt seem to care she takes his hands in hers and says michael what if i said i had access to a lot of money money that i think you could use money id like you to use he laughs id think this was too good to be true you come into a bar we leave it together then here we are kissing in the moonlight and now youre telling me youre rich he shakes his head i wouldnt write this i wouldnt dare you serious the money would not be for making your script into a film however oh well im crushed what then it would be so that you could become a shadow chaser it would be so that you can travel the world going to particular places on the tracks of eclipses and looking for people who seem a little overdressed for rvs with dark windows for rented villas where the locals havent seen the residents for yachts where nobody appears on deck he stares at her for a while hell girl you serious about that also you will need a new identity there are people who would like to make you disappear one of them was going to try to do this today we passed her on the boardwalk earlier he looks around is this a joke wheres the camera no joke michael she puts her hands round his wrists encircling them as near as she can now i am going to bring you back but let me show how they would make you disappear holy shit adrian adrian is left disoriented and slightly paranoid by it all he gets back to dear old blighty and thoroughly rattled begins to sell everything up handily he manages to offload almost all he owns just days before lehman brothers collapses and the entirety of international finance falls flailing off the first of several cliffs he immediately decides this is a sign of his invincible superiority and flawless luck he also decides to live where his money is with the forth international bank so buys a villa on grand cayman in the cayman islands south of cuba the cayman islands are a proper tropical paradise with aquamarine crystal waters and palm trees and golden beaches and everything but they are very prone to hurricanes in the summer of adrian hears theres a big one on the way most of the rich just jet off to somewhere more congenial for a few days but he decides hed like to experience a proper hurricane because he is invincible after all just as well he discovers that the villa was flooded in the last category and so after some problems finding anybody still around and doing the jobs theyre fucking being paid to do he hires an ancient walkthrough delivery van from a friend and loads all the stuff he can carry from the villa into it televisions computers hifis scuba gear rugs pieces of designer furniture some benin bronzes a couple of fullsize replica terracotta warriors various paintings and so on its exhausting but hes sure itll be worth it he parks up on higher ground behind a sturdylooking water tower just outside george town and sits there through the night the winds shrieking around him and the truck laden though it is shaking and bouncing on its shot overloaded springs the face of one of the terracotta warriors standing right behind his seat looks inscrutably over his shoulder throughout the night either angel of death or guardian angel adrian cant decide which the disturbing thing is that the company making the replicas let you specify what you wanted their faces to look like and adrian chose his own face for both so theres basically a stonyfaced version of himself standing right behind his seat the whole time the water tower makes some terrible groaning noises during the night and scares him half to death but it doesnt fall down and survives intact in the afternoon of the next day when the hurricane has passed he drives the beatenup van back along the leaf and wreckagestrewn road to discover the villa is intact and unflooded almost undamaged his luck has held yet again and he is still invincible he grins reaches behind him and pats the cheek of the terracotta warrior guardian angel then but on the way down to the villa whooping and hollering he loses control of the truck and it slams into a ditch all his possessions in the back come sliding forward and crush him to death bisquitine bisquitine remains empress of all she surveys just as she always has been the transitionary all right i lied about the quiet and normal life bit so im unreliable and there was no deer or fox or any other form of wildlife involved what there was was me briefly inside his head as he drove away long enough to unfasten the bastards seat belt and tug hard on the steering wheel before dancing back out of his head again an instant before the crash it was as long as i could have stayed in there anyway and it hurt plus it wore me out for days but its a start iain m banks iain banks came to widespread and controversial acclaim with the publication of his first novel the wasp factory in however it was his novel consider phlebas which introduced his remarkable talent to the sf community and also saw the addition of the m to his name an addition which remains a distinguishing feature of his sf work he has since written a further sf novels and a collection of sf short stories the state of the art all published by orbit described by william gibson as a phenomenon wildly successful fearlessly creative he was acknowledged as one of the best of young british writers in and lives in fife scotland
