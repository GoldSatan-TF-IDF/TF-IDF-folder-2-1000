a grammar of the english tongue grammar which is the art of using words properly comprises four parts orthography etymology syntax and prosody in this division and order of the parts of grammar i follow the common grammarians without inquiring whether a fitter distribution might not be found experience has long shown this method to be so distinct as to obviate confusion and so comprehensive as to prevent any inconvenient omissions i likewise use the terms already received and already understood though perhaps others more proper might sometimes be invented sylburgius and other innovators whose new terms have sunk their learning into neglect have left sufficient warning against the trifling ambition of teaching arts in a new language orthography is the art of combining letters into syllables and syllables into words it therefore teaches previously the form and sound of letters the letters of the english language are roman italick name a a a a a b b b b be c c c c see d d d d dee e e e e e f f f f eff g g g g jee h h h h aitch i i i i i or ja j j j j j conson k k k k ka l l l l el m m m m em n n n n en o o o o o p p p p pee q q q q cue r r r r ar s s s s ess t t t t tee u u u

and our letters are commonly reckoned twentyfour because anciently i and j as well as u and v were expressed by the same character but as those letters which had always different powers have now different forms our alphabet may be properly said to consist of twentysix letters vowels are five a e i o u such is the number generally received but for i it is the practice to write y in the end of words as thy holy before i as from die dying from beautify beautifying in the words says days eyes and in words derived from the greek and written originally with greek y as sympathy greek sympatheia system greek systma for u we often write w after a vowel to make a diphthong as raw grew view vow flowing lowness the sounds of all the letters are various in treating on the letters i shall not like some other grammarians inquire into the original of their form as an antiquarian nor into their formation and prolation by the organs of speech as a mechanick anatomist or physiologist nor into the properties and gradation of sounds or the elegance or harshness of particular combinations as a writer of universal and transcendental grammar i consider the english alphabet only as it is english and even in this narrow disquisition i follow the example of former grammarians perhaps with more reverence than judgment because by writing in english i suppose my reader already acquainted with the english language and consequently able to pronounce the letters of which i teach the pronunciation and because of sounds in general it may be observed that words are unable to describe them an account therefore of the primitive and simple letters is useless almost alike to those who know their sound and those who know it not of vowels a a has three sounds the slender open and broad a slender is found in most words as face mane and in words ending in ation as creation salvation generation the a slender is the proper english a called very justly by erpenius in his arabick grammar a anglicum cum e mistum as having a middle sound between the open a and the e the french have a similar sound in the word pais and in their e masculine a open is the a of the italian or nearly resembles it as father rather congratulate fancy glass a broad resembles the a of the german as all wall call many words pronounced with a broad were anciently written with au as sault mault and we still say fault vault this was probably the saxon sound for it is yet retained in the northern dialects and in the rustick pronunciation as maun for man haund for hand the short a approaches to the a open as grass the long a if prolonged by e at the end of the word is always slender as graze fame a forms a diphthong only with i or y and u or w ai or ay as in plain wain gay clay has only the sound of the long and slender a and differs not in the pronunciation from plane wane au or aw has the sound of the german a as raw naughty ae is sometimes found in latin words not completely naturalized or assimilated but is no english diphthong and is more properly expressed by single e as cesar eneas e e is the letter which occurs most frequently in the english language e is long as in scene or short as in cellar separate celebrate men then it is always short before a double consonant or two consonants as in vex perplexity relent medlar reptile serpent cellar cessation blessing fell felling debt e is always mute at the end of a word except in monosyllables that have no other vowel as the or proper names as penelope phebe derbe being used to modify the foregoing consonants as since once hedge oblige or to lengthen the preceding vowel as ban bane can cane pin pine tun tune rub rube pop pope fir fire cur cure tub tube almost all words which now terminate in consonants ended anciently in e as year yeare wildness wildnesse which e probably had the force of the french e feminine and constituted a syllable with its associate consonant for in old editions words are sometimes divided thus cleare felle knowledge this e was perhaps for a time vocal or silent in poetry as convenience required but it has been long wholly mute camden in his remains calls it the silent e it does not always lengthen the foregoing vowel as glove live give it has sometimes in the end of words a sound obscure and scarcely perceptible as open shapen shotten thistle participle metre lucre this faintness of sound is found when e separates a mute from a liquid as in rotten or follows a mute and liquid as in cattle e forms a diphthong with a as near with i as deign receive and with u or w as new stew ea sounds like e long as mean or like ee as dear clear near ei is sounded like e long as seize perceiving eu sounds as u long and soft e a u are combined in beauty and its derivatives but have only the sound of u e may be said to form a diphthong by reduplication as agree sleeping eo is found in yeoman where it is sounded as o short and in people where it is pronounced like ee i i has a sound long as fine and short as fin that is eminently observable in i which may be likewise remarkable in other letters that the short sound is not the long sound contracted but a sound wholly different the long sound in monosyllables is always marked by the e final as thin thine i is often sounded before r as a short u as flirt first shirt it forms a diphthong only with e as field shield which is sounded as the double ee except friend which is sounded as frend i is joined with eu in lieu and ew in view which triphthongs are sounded as the open u o o is long as bone obedient corroding or short as block knock oblique loll women is pronounced wimen the short o has sometimes the sound of close u as son come o coalesces into a diphthong with a as moan groan approach oa has the sound of o long o is united to e in some words derived from greek as oeconomy but as being not an english diphthong they are better written as they are sounded with only e economy with i as oil soil moil noisome this coalition of letters seems to unite the sounds of the two letters as far as two sounds can be united without being destroyed and therefore approaches more nearly than any combination in our tongue to the notion of a diphthong with o as boot hoot cooler oo has the sound of the italian u with u or w as our power flower but in some words has only the sound of o long as in soul bowl sow grow these different sounds are used to distinguish different significations as bow an instrument for shooting bow a depression of the head sow the she of a boar sow to scatter seed bowl an orbicular body bowl a wooden vessel ou is sometimes pronounced like o soft as court sometimes like o short as cough sometimes like u close as could or u open as rough tough which use only can teach ou is frequently used in the last syllable of words which in latin end in or and are made english as honour labour favour from honor labor favor some late innovators have ejected the u without considering that the last syllable gives the sound neither of or nor ur but a sound between them if not compounded of both besides that they are probably derived to us from the french nouns in eur as honeur faveur u u is long in use confusion or short as us concussion it coalesces with a e i o but has rather in these combinations the force of the w consonant as quaff quest quit quite languish sometimes in ui the i loses its sound as in juice it is sometimes mute before a e i y as guard guest guise buy u is followed by e in virtue but the e has no sound ue is sometimes mute at the end of a word in imitation of the french as prorogue synagogue plague vague harangue y y is a vowel which as quintilian observes of one of the roman letters we might want without inconvenience but that we have it it supplies the place of i at the end of words as thy before an i as dying and is commonly retained in derivative words where it was part of a diphthong in the primitive as destroy destroyer betray betrayed betrayer pray prayer say sayer day days y being the saxon vowel y which was commonly used where i is now put occurs very frequently in all old books general rules a vowel in the beginning or middle syllable before two consonants is commonly short as opportunity in monosyllables a single vowel before a single consonant is short as stag frog many is pronounced as if it were written manny of consonants b b has one unvaried sound such as it obtains in other languages it is mute in debt debtor subtle doubt lamb limb dumb thumb climb comb womb it is used before l and r as black brown c c has before e and i the sound of s as sincerely centrick century circular cistern city siccity before a o and u it sounds like k as calm concavity copper incorporate curiosity concupiscence c might be omitted in the language without loss since one of its sounds might be supplied by s and the other by k but that it preserves to the eye the etymology of words as face from facies captive from captivus ch has a sound which is analyzed into tsh as church chin crutch it is the same sound which the italians give to the c simple before i and e as citta cerro ch is sounded like k in words derived from the greek as chymist scheme choler arch is commonly sounded ark before a vowel as archangel and with the english sound of ch before a consonant as archbishop ch in some french words not yet assimilated sounds like sh as machine chaise c according to english orthography never ends a word therefore we write stick block which were originally sticke blocke in such words c is now mute it is used before l and r as clock cross d is uniform in its sound as death diligent it is used before r as draw dross and w as dwell f f though having a name beginning with a vowel is numbered by the grammarians among the semivowels yet has this quality of a mute that it is commodiously sounded before a liquid as flask fry freckle it has an unvariable sound except that of is sometimes spoken nearly as ov g g has two sounds one hard as in gay go gun the other soft as in gem giant at the end of a word it is always hard as ring snug song frog before e and i the sound is uncertain g before e is soft as gem generation except in gear geld geese get gewgaw and derivatives from words ending in g as singing stronger and generally before er at the ends of words as finger g is mute before n as gnash sign foreign g before i is hard as give except in giant gigantick gibbet gibe giblets giles gill gilliflower gin ginger gingle to which may be added egypt and gypsy gh in the beginning of a word has the sound of the hard g as ghostly in the middle and sometimes at the end it is quite silent as though right sought spoken tho rite soute it has often at the end the sound of f as laugh whence laughter retains the same sound in the middle cough trough sough tough enough slough it is not to be doubted but that in the original pronunciation gh has the force of a consonant deeply guttural which is still continued among the scotch g is used before h l and r h h is a note of aspiration and shows that the following vowel must be pronounced with a strong emission of breath as hat horse it seldom begins any but the first syllable in which it is always sounded with a full breath except in heir herb hostler honour humble honest humour and their derivatives it sometimes begins middle or final syllables in words compounded as blockhead or derived from the latin as comprehend j j consonant sounds uniformly like the soft g and is therefore a letter useless except in etymology as ejaculation jester jocund juice k k has the sound of hard c and is used before e and i where according to english analogy c would be soft as kept king skirt skeptick for so it should be written not sceptick because sc is sounded like s as in scene it is used before n as knell knot but totally loses its sound in modern pronunciation k is never doubled but c is used before it to shorten the vowel by a double consonant as cockle pickle l l has in english the same liquid sound as in other languages the custom is to double the l at the end of monosyllables as kill will full these words were originally written kille wille fulle and when the e first grew silent and was afterward omitted the ll was retained to give force according to the analogy of our language to the foregoing vowel l is sometimes mute as in calf half halves calves could would should psalm talk salmon falcon the saxons who delighted in guttural sounds sometimes aspirated the l at the beginning of words as hlaf a loaf or bread hlaford a lord but this pronunciation is now disused le at the end of words is pronounced like a weak el in which the e is almost mute as table shuttle m m has always the same sound as murmur monumental n n has always the same sound as noble manners n is sometimes mute after m as damn condemn hymn p p has always the same sound which the welsh and germans confound with b p is sometimes mute as in psalm and between m and t as tempt ph is used for f in words derived from the greek as philosopher philanthropy philip q q as in other languages is always followed by u and has a sound which our saxon ancestors well expressed by cw as quadrant queen equestrian quilt inquiry quire quotidian qu is never followed by u qu is sometimes sounded in words derived from the french like k as conquer liquor risque chequer r r has the same rough snarling sound as in the other tongues the saxons used often to put h before it as before l at the beginning of words rh is used in words derived from the greek as myrrh myrrhine catarrhous rheum rheumatick rhyme re at the end of some words derived from the latin or french is pronounced like a weak er as theatre sepulchre s s has a hissing sound as sibilation sister a single s seldom ends any word except in the third person of verbs as loves grows and the plurals of nouns as trees bushes distresses the pronouns this his ours yours us the adverb thus and words derived from latin as rebus surplus the close being always either in se as house horse or in ss as grass dress bliss less anciently grasse dresse s single at the end of words has a grosser sound like that of z as trees eyes except this thus us rebus surplus it sounds like z before ion if a vowel goes before it as intrusion and like s if it follows a consonant as conversion it sounds like z before e mute as refuse and before y final as rosy and in those words bosom desire wisdom prison prisoner present present damsel casement it is the peculiar quality of s that it may be sounded before all consonants except x and z in which s is comprised x being only ks and z a hard or gross s this s is therefore termed by grammarians su potestatis litera the reason of which the learned dr clarke erroneously supposed to be that in some words it might be doubled at pleasure thus we find in several languages greek sbennymi scatter sdegno sdrucciolo sfavellare greek sphinx sgombrare sgranare shake slumber smell snipe space splendour spring squeeze shrew step strength stramen stripe sventura swell s is mute in isle island demesne viscount t t has its customary sound as take temptation ti before a vowel has the sound of si as salvation except an s goes before as question excepting likewise derivatives from words ending in ty as mighty mightier th has two sounds the one soft as thus whether the other hard as thing think the sound is soft in these words then thence and there with their derivatives and compounds and in that these thou thee thy thine their they this those them though thus and in all words between two vowels as father whether and between r and a vowel as burthen in other words it is hard as thick thunder faith faithful where it is softened at the end of a word an e silent must be added as breath breathe cloth clothe v v has a sound of near affinity to that of f as vain vanity from f in the islandick alphabet v is only distinguished by a diacritical point w of w which in diphthongs is often an undoubted vowel some grammarians have doubted whether it ever be a consonant and not rather as it is called a double u or ou as water may be resolved into ouater but letters of the same sound are always reckoned consonants in other alphabets and it may be observed that w follows a vowel without any hiatus or difficulty of utterance as frosty winter wh has a sound accounted peculiar to the english which the saxons better expressed by hw as what whence whiting in whore only and sometimes in wholesome wh is sounded like a simple h x x begins no english word it has the sound of ks as axle extraneous y y when it follows a consonant is a vowel when it precedes either a vowel or a diphthong is a consonant as ye young it is thought by some to be in all cases a vowel but it may be observed of y as of w that it follows a vowel without any hiatus as rosy youth the chief argument by which w and y appear to be always vowels is that the sounds which they are supposed to have as consonants cannot be uttered after a vowel like that of all other consonants thus we say tu ut do odd but in wed dew the two sounds of w have no resemblance to each other z z begins no word originally english it has the sound as its name izzard or s hard expresses of an s uttered with a closer compression of the palate by the tongue as freeze froze in orthography i have supposed orthoepy or just utterance of words to be included orthography being only the art of expressing certain sounds by proper characters i have therefore observed in what words any of the letters are mute most of the writers of english grammar have given long tables of words pronounced otherwise than they are written and seem not sufficiently to have considered that of english as of all living tongues there is a double pronunciation one cursory and colloquial the other regular and solemn the cursory pronunciation is always vague and uncertain being made different in different mouths by negligence unskilfulness or affectation the solemn pronunciation though by no means immutable and permanent is yet always less remote from the orthography and less liable to capricious innovation they have however generally formed their tables according to the cursory speech of those with whom they happened to converse and concluding that the whole nation combines to vitiate language in one manner have often established the jargon of the lowest of the people as the model of speech for pronunciation the best general rule is to consider those as the most elegant speakers who deviate least from the written words there have been many schemes offered for the emendation and settlement of our orthography which like that of other nations being formed by chance or according to the fancy of the earliest writers in rude ages was at first very various and uncertain and is yet sufficiently irregular of these reformers some have endeavoured to accommodate orthography better to the pronunciation without considering that this is to measure by a shadow to take that for a model or standard which is changing while they apply it others less absurdly indeed but with equal unlikelihood of success have endeavoured to proportion the number of letters to that of sounds that every sound may have its own character and every character a single sound such would be the orthography of a new language to be formed by a synod of grammarians upon principles of science but who can hope to prevail on nations to change their practice and make all their old books useless or what advantage would a new orthography procure equivalent to the confusion and perplexity of such an alteration some ingenious men indeed have endeavoured to deserve well of their country by writing honor and labor for honour and labour red for read in the pretertense sais for says repete tor repeat explane for explain or declame for declaim of these it may be said that as they have done no good they have done little harm both because they have innovated little and because few have followed them the english language has properly no dialects the style of writers has no professed diversity in the use of words or of their flexions and terminations nor differs but by different degrees of skill or care the oral diction is uniform in no spacious country but has less variation in england than in most other nations of equal extent the language of the northern counties retains many words now out of use but which are commonly of the genuine teutonick race and is uttered with a pronunciation which now seems harsh and rough but was probably used by our ancestors the northern speech is therefore not barbarous but obsolete the speech in the western provinces seems to differ from the general diction rather by a depraved pronunciation than by any real difference which letters would express etymology etymology teaches the deduction of one word from another and the various modifications by which the sense of the same word is diversified as horse horses i love i loved of the article the english have two articles an or a and the an a a has an indefinite signification and means one with some reference to more as this is a good book that is one among the books that are good he was killed by a sword that is some sword this is a better book for a man than a boy that is for one of those that are men than one of those that are boys an army might enter without resistance that is any army in the senses in which we use a or an in the singular we speak in the plural without an article as these are good books i have made an the original article because it is only the saxon an or n one applied to a new use as the german ein and the french un the n being cut off before a consonant in the speed of utterance grammarians of the last age direct that an should be used before h whence it appears that the english anciently asperated less an is still used before the silent h as an herb an honest man but otherwise a as a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse shakespeare an or a can only be joined with a singular the correspondent plural is the noun without an article as i want a pen i want pens or with the pronominal adjective some as i want some pens the the has a particular and definite signification the fruit of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste brought death into the world milton that is that particular fruit and this world in which we live so he giveth fodder for the cattle and green herbs for the use of man that is for those beings that are cattle and his use that is man the is used in both numbers i am as free as nature first made man ere the base laws of servitude began when wild in woods the noble savage ran dryden many words are used without articles as proper names as john alexander longinus aristarchus jerusalem athens rome london god is used as a proper name abstract names as blackness witchcraft virtue vice beauty ugliness love hatred anger goodnature kindness words in which nothing but the mere being of any thing is implied this is not beer but water this is not brass but steel of nouns substantive the relations of english nouns to words going before or following are not expressed by cases or changes of termination but as in most of the other european languages by prepositions unless we may be said to have a genitive case singular nom magister a master the master gen magistri of a master of the master or masters the masters dat magistro to a master to the master acc magistrum a master the master voc magister master o master abl magistro from a master from the master plural nom magistri masters the masters gen magistrorum of masters of the masters dat magistris to masters to the masters acc magistros masters the masters voc magistri masters o masters abl magistris from masters from the masters our nouns are therefore only declined thus master gen masters plur masters scholar gen scholars plur scholars these genitives are always written with a mark of elision masters scholars according to an opinion long received that the s is a contraction of his as the soldiers valour for the soldier his valour but this cannot be the true original because s is put to female nouns womans beauty the virgins delicacy haughty junos unrelenting hate and collective nouns as womens passions the rabbles insolence the multitudes folly in all these cases it is apparent that his cannot be understood we say likewise the foundations strength the diamonds lustre the winters severity but in these cases his may be understood he and his having formerly been applied to neuters in the place now supplied by it and its the learned and sagacious wallis to whom every english grammarian owes a tribute of reverence calls this modification of the noun an adjective possessive i think with no more propriety than he might have applied the same to the genitive in equitum decus troj oris or any other latin genitive dr lowth on the other part supposes the possessive pronouns mine and thine to be genitive cases this termination of the noun seems to constitute a real genitive indicating possession it is derived to us from the saxons who declined smith a smith gen smither of a smith plur smither or smithar smiths and so in two other of their seven declensions it is a further confirmation of this opinion that in the old poets both the genitive and plural were longer by a syllable than the original word knitis for knights in chaucer leavis for leaves in spenser when a word ends in s the genitive may be the same with the nominative as venus temple the plural is formed by adding s as table tables fly flies sister sisters wood woods or es where s could not otherwise be sounded as after ch s sh x z after c sounded like s and g like j the mute e is vocal before s as lance lances outrage outrages the formation of the plural and genitive singular is the same a few words still make the plural in n as men women oxen swine and more anciently eyen shoon this formation is that which generally prevails in the teutonick dialects words that end in f commonly form their plural by ves as loaf loaves calf calves except a few muff muffs chief chiefs so hoof roof proof relief mischief puff cuff dwarf handkerchief grief irregular plurals are teeth from tooth lice from louse mice from mouse geese from goose feet from foot dice from die pence from penny brethren from brother children from child plurals ending in s have no genitives but we say womens excellencies and weigh the mens wits against the ladies hairs dr willis thinks the lords house may he said for the house of lords but such phrases are not now in use and surely an english ear rebels against them they would commonly produce a troublesome ambiguity as the lords house may be the house of lords or the house of a lord besides that the mark of elision is improper for in the lords house nothing is cut off some english substantives like those of many other languages change their termination as they express different sexes as prince princess actor actress lion lioness hero heroine to these mentioned by dr lowth may be added arbitress poetess chauntress duchess tigress governess tutress peeress authoress traytress and perhaps othets of these variable terminations we have only a sufficient number to make us feel our want for when we say of a woman that she is a philosopher an astronomer a builder a weaver a dancer we perceive an impropriety in the termination which we cannot avoid but we can say that she is an architect a botanist a student because these terminations have not annexed to them the notion of sex in words which the necessities of life are often requiring the sex is distinguished not by different terminations but by different names as a bull a cow a horse a mare equus equa a cock a hen and sometimes by pronouns prefixed as a hegoat a shegoat of adjectives adjectives in the english language are wholly indeclinable having neither case gender nor number and being added to substantives in all relations without any change as a good woman good women of a good woman a good man good men of good men the comparison of adjectives the comparative degree of adjectives is formed by adding er the superlative by adding est to the positive as fair fairer fairest lovely lovelier loveliest sweet sweeter sweetest low lower lowest high higher highest some words are irregularly compared as good better best bad worse worst little less least near nearer next much more most many for moe more for moer most for moest late later latest or last some comparatives form a superlative by adding most as nether nethermost outer outermost under undermost up upper uppermost fore former foremost most is sometimes added to a substantive as topmost southmost many adjectives do not admit of comparison by terminations and are only compared by more and most as benevolent more benevolent most benevolent all adjectives may be compared by more and most even when they have comparatives and superlatives regularly formed as fair fairer or more fair fairest or most fair in adjectives that admit a regular comparison the comparative more is oftener used than the superlative most as more fair is oftener written for fairer than most fair for fairest the comparison of adjectives is very uncertain and being much regulated by commodiousness of utterance or agreeableness of sound is not easily reduced to rules monosyllables are commonly compared polysyllables or words of more than two syllables are seldom compared otherwise than by more and most as deplorable more deplorable most deplorable dissyllables are seldom compared if they terminate in some as fulsome toilsome in ful as careful spleenful dreadful in ing as trifling charming in ous as porous in less as careless harmless in ed as wretched in id as candid in al as mortal in ent as recent fervent in ain as certain in ive as missive in dy as woody in fy as puffy in ky as rocky except lucky in my as roomy in ny as skinny in py as ropy except happy in ry as hoary some comparatives and superlatives are yet found in good writers formed without regard to the foregoing rules but in a language subjected so little and so lately to grammar such anomalies must frequently occur so shady is compared by milton she in shadiest covert hid tund her nocturnal note par lost and virtuous what she wills to say or do seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best par lost so trifling by ray who is indeed of no great authority it is not so decorous in respect of god that he should immediately do all the meanest and triflingest things himself without making use of any inferior or subordinate minister ray on the creation famous by milton i shall be namd among the famousest of women sung at solemn festivals miltons agonistes inventive by ascham those have the inventivest heads for all purposes and roundest tongues in all matters aschams schoolmaster mortal by bacon the mortalest poisons practised by the west indians have some mixture of the blood fat or flesh of man bacon natural by wotton i will now deliver a few of the properest and naturalest considerations that belong to this piece wottons architecture wretched by jonson the wretcheder are the contemners of all helps such as presuming on their own naturals deride diligence and mock at terms when they understand not things ben jonson powerful by milton we have sustaind one day in doubtful fight what heavns great king hath powrfullest to send against us from about his throne par lost the termination in ish may be accounted in some sort a degree of comparison by which the signification is diminished below the positive as black blackish or tending to blackness salt saltish or having a little taste of salt they therefore admit no comparison this termination is seldom added but to words expressing sensible qualities nor often to words of above one syllable and is scarcely used in the solemn or sublime style of pronouns pronouns in the english language are i thou he with their plurals we ye they it who which what whether whosoever whatsoever my mine our ours thy thine your yours his her hers theirs this that other another the same some the pronouns personal are irregularly inflected singular plural nom i we accus and me us other oblique cases nom thou ye oblique thee you you is commonly used in modern writers for ye particularly in the language of ceremony where the second person plural is used for the second person singular you are my friend singular plural nom he they applied to masculines oblique him them nom she they applied to feminines oblique her them nom it they applied to neuters or things oblique its them for it the practice of ancient writers was to use he and for its his the possessive pronouns like other adjectives are without cases or change of termination the possessive of the first person is my mine our ours of the second thy thine your yours of the third from he his from she her and hers and in the plural their theirs for both sexes ours yours hers theirs are used when the substantive preceding is separated by a verb as these are our books these books are ours your children excel ours in stature but ours surpass yours in learning ours yours hers theirs notwithstanding their seeming plural termination are applied equally to singular and plural substantives as this book is ours these books are ours mine and thine were formerly used before a vowel as mine amiable lady which though now disused in prose might be still properly continued in poetry they are used as ours and yours when they are referred to a substantive preceding as thy house is larger than mine but my garden is more spacious than thine their and theirs are the possessives likewise of they when they is the plural of it and are therefore applied to things pronouns relative are who which what whether whosoever whatsoever nom who gen whose other oblique cases whom nom which gen of which or whose other oblique cases which who is now used in relation to persons and which in relation to things but they were anciently confounded at least it was common to say the man which though i remember no example of the thing who whose is rather the poetical than regular genitive of which the fruit of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste brought death into the world milton whether is only used in the nominative and accusative cases and has no plural being applied only to one of a number commonly to one of two as whether of these is left i know not whether shall i choose it is now almost obsolete what whether relative or interrogative is without variation whosoever whatsoever being compounded of who or what and soever follow the rule of their primitives singular plural this these in all cases that those other others whether the plural others is not used but when it is referred to a substantive preceding as i have sent other horses i have not sent the same horses but others another being only an other has no plural here there and where joined with certain particles have a relative and pronominal use hereof herein hereby hereafter herewith thereof therein thereby thereupon therewith whereof wherein whereby whereupon wherewith which signify of this in this c of that in that c of which in which c therefore and wherefore which are properly there for and where for for that for which are now reckoned conjunctions and continued in use the rest seem to be passing by degrees into neglect though proper useful and analogous they are referred both to singular and plural antecedents there are two more words used only in conjunction with pronouns own and self own is added to possessives both singular and plural as my own hand our own house it is emphatical and implies a silent contrariety or opposition as i live in my own house that is not in a hired house this i did with my own hand that is without help or not by proxy self is added to possessives as myself yourselves and sometimes to personal pronouns as himself itself themselves it then like own expresses emphasis and opposition as i did this myself that is not another or it forms a reciprocal pronoun as we hurt ourselves by vain rage himself itself themselves are supposed by wallis to be put by corruption for his self it self their selves so that self is always a substantive this seems justly observed for we say he came himself himself shall do this where himself cannot be an accusative of the verb english verbs are active as i love or neuter as i languish the neuters are formed like the actives most verbs signifying action may likewise signify condition or habit and become neuters as i love i am in love i strike i am now striking verbs have only two tenses inflected in their terminations the present and simple preterit the other tenses are compounded of the auxiliary verbs have shall will let may can and the infinitive of the active or neuter verb the passive voice is formed by joining the participle preterit to the substantive verb as i am loved to have indicative mood present tense sing i have thou hast he hath or has plur we have ye have they have has is a termination connoted from hath but now more frequently used both in verse and prose simple preterit sing i had thou hadst he had plur we had ye had they had compound preterit sing i have had thou

future tenses may be observed the variations of shall and will imperative mood sing have or have thou let him have plur let us have have or have ye let them have conjunctive mood present sing i have

or be the plural be is now little in use preterit sing i was thou wast or wert he was plur we were ye were they were wert is properly of the conjunctive mood and ought not to be used in the indicative

should have been loved c infinitive present to be loved preterit to have been loved participle loved there is another form of english verbs in which the infinitive mood is joined to the verb do in its various inflections which are therefore to be learned in this place to do indicative present sing i do thou dost he doth plur we do ye do they do preterit sing i did thou didst he did plur we did ye did they did preterit c i have done c i had done c future i shall or will do c imperative sing do thou let him do plur let us do do ye let them do conjunctive present sing i do thou do he do plur we do ye do they do the rest are as in the indicative infinite to do to have done participle present doing participle preterit done do is sometimes used superfluously as i do love i did love simply for i love or i loved but this is considered as a vitious mode of speech it is sometimes used emphatically as i do love thee and when i love thee not chaos is come again shakespeare it is frequently joined with a negative as i like her but i do not love her i wished him success but did not help him this by custom at least appears more easy than the other form of expressing the same sense by a negative adverb after the verb i like her but love her not the imperative prohibitory is seldom applied in the second person at least in prose without the word do as stop him but do not hurt him praise beauty but do not dote on it its chief use is in interrogative forms of speech in which it is used through all the persons as do i live dost thou strike me do they rebel did i complain didst thou love her did she die so likewise in negative interrogations do i not yet grieve did she not die do and did are thus used only for the present and simple preterit there is another manner of conjugating neuter verbs which when it is used may not improperly denominate them neuter passives as they are inflected according to the passive form by the help of the verb substantive to be they answer nearly to the reciprocal verbs in french as i am risen surrexi latin je me suis lev french i was walked out exieram je mtois promen in like manner we commonly express the present tense as i am going eo i am grieving doleo she is dying illa moritur the tempest is raging furit procella i am pursuing an enemy hostem insequor so the other tenses as we were walking greek etynchanomen peripatountes i have been walking i had been walking i shall or will be walking there is another manner of using the active participle which gives it a passive signification as the grammar is now printing grammatica jam nunc chartis imprimitur the brass is forging ara excuduntur this is in my opinion a vitious expression probably corrupted from a phrase more pure but now somewhat obsolete the book is a printing the brass is a forging a being properly at and printing and forging verbal nouns signifying action according to the analogy of this language the indicative and conjunctive moods are by modern writers frequently confounded or rather the conjunctive is wholly neglected when some convenience of versification docs not invite its revival it is used among the purer writers of former times after if though ere before till or until whether except unless whatsoever whomsoever and words of wishing as doubtless thou art our father though abraham be ignorant of us and israel acknowledge us not of irregular verbs the english verbs were divided by ben jonson into four conjugations without any reason arising from the nature of the language which has properly but one conjugation such as has been exemplified from which all deviations are to be considered as anomalies which are indeed in our monosyllable saxon verbs and the verbs derived from them very frequent but almost all the verbs which have been adopted from other languages follow the regular form our verbs are observed by dr wallis to be irregular only in the formation of the preterit and its participle indeed in the scantiness of our conjugations there is scarcely any other place for irregularity the first irregularity is a slight deviation from the regular form by rapid utterance or poetical contraction the last syllable ed is often joined with the former by suppression of e as lovd for loved after c ch sh f k x and after the consonants s th when more strongly pronounced and sometimes after m n r if preceded by a short vowel t is used in pronunciation but very seldom in writing rather than d as plact snatcht fisht wakt dwelt smelt for placd snatchd fishd wakd dweld smeld or placed snatched fished waked dwelled smelled those words which terminate in l or ll or p make their preterit in t even in solemn language as crept felt dwelt sometimes after x ed is changed into t as vext this is not constant a long vowel is often changed into a short one thus kept slept wept crept swept from the verbs to keep to sleep to weep to creep to sweep where d or t go before the additional letter d or t in this contracted form coalesce into one letter with the radical d or t if t were the radical they coalesce into t but if d were the radical then into d or t as the one or the other letter may be more easily pronounced as read led spread shed shred bid hid chid fed bled bred sped strid slid rid from the verbs to read to lead to spread to shed to shread to bid to hide to chide to feed to bleed to breed to speed to stride to slide to ride and thus cast hurt cost burst eat beat sweat sit quit smit writ bit hit met shot from the verbs to cast to hurt to cost to burst to eat to beat to sweat to sit to quit to smite to write to bite to hit to meet to shoot and in like manner lent sent rent girt from the verbs to lend to send to rend to gird the participle preterit or passive is often formed in en instead of ed as been taken given slain known from the verbs to be to take to give to slay to know many words have two or more participles as not only written bitten eaten beaten hidden chidden shotten chosen broken but likewise writ bit eat beat hid chid shot chose broke are promiscuously used in the participle from the verbs to write to bite to eat to beat to hide to chide to shoot to choose to break and many such like in the same manner sown shewn hewn mown loaden laden as well as sowd showd hewd mowd loaded laded from the verbs to sow to show to hew to mow to load to lade concerning these double participles it is difficult to give any rule but he shall seldom err who remembers that when a verb has a participle distinct from its preterit as write wrote written that distinct participle is more proper and elegant as the book is written is better than the book is wrote wrote however may be used in poetry at least if we allow any authority to poets who in the exultation of genius think themselves perhaps entitled to trample on grammarians there are other anomalies in the preterit win spin begin swim strike stick sing sting fling ring wring spring swing drink sink shrink stink come run find bind grind wind both in the preterit imperfect and participle passive give won spun begun swum struck stuck sung stung flung rung wrung sprung swung drunk sunk shrunk stunk come run found bound ground wound and most of them are also formed in the preterit by a as began sang rang sprang drank came ran and some others but most of these are now obsolete some in the participle passive likewise take en as stricken strucken drunken bounden fight teach reach seek beseech catch buy bring think work make fought taught raught sought besought caught bought brought thought wrought but a great many of these retain likewise the regular form as teached reached beseeched catched worked take shake forsake wake awake stand break speak bear shear swear tear wear weave cleave strive thrive drive shine rise arise smite write bide abide ride choose chuse tread get beget forget seethe make in both preterit and participle took shook forsook woke awoke stood broke spoke bore shore swore tore wore wove clove

brake spake bare share sware tare ware clave gat begat forgat and perhaps some others but more rarely in the participle passive many of them are formed by en as taken shaken forsaken broken spoken born shorn sworn torn worn woven cloven thriven driven risen smitten ridden chosen trodden gotten begotten forgotten sodden and many do likewise retain the analogy in both as waked awaked sheared weaved cleaved abided seethed give bid sit make in the preterit gave bade sate in the participle passive given bidden sitten but in both bid draw know grow throw blow crow like a cock fly slay see ly make their preterit drew knew grew threw blew crew flew slew saw lay their participles passive by n drawn known grown thrown blown flown slain seen lien lain yet from flee is made fled from go went from the old wend the participle is gone of derivation that the english language may be more easily understood it is necessary to inquire how its derivative words are deduced from their primitives and how the primitives are borrowed from other languages in this inquiry i shall sometimes copy dr wallis and sometimes endeavour to supply his detects and rectify his errours nouns are derived from verbs the thing implied in the verb as done or produced is commonly either the present of the verb as to love love to fright a fright to fight a fight or the preterit of the verb as to strike i strick or strook a stroke the action is the same with the participle present as loving frighting fighting striking the agent or person acting is denoted by the syllable er added to the verb as lover frighter striker substantives adjectives and sometimes other parts of speech are changed into verbs in which case the vowel is often lengthened or the consonant softened as a house to house brass to braze glass to glaze grass to graze price to prize breath to breathe a fish to fish oil to oil further to further forward to forward hinder to hinder sometimes the termination en is added especially to adjectives as haste to hasten length to lengthen strength to strengthen short to shorten fast to fasten white to whiten black to blacken hard to harden soft to soften from substantives are formed adjectives of plenty by adding the termination y as a louse lousy wealth wealthy health healthy might mighty worth worthy wit witty lust lusty water watery earth earthy wood a wood woody air airy a heart hearty a hand handy from substantives are formed adjectives of plenty by adding the termination ful denoting abundance as joy joyful fruit fruitful youth youthful care careful use useful delight delightful plenty plentiful help helpful sometimes in almost the same sense but with some kind of diminution thereof the termination some is added denoting something or in some degree as delight delightsome game gamesome irk irksome burden burdensome trouble troublesome light lightsome hand handsome alone lonesome toil toilsome on the contrary the termination less added to substantives makes adjectives signifying want as worthless witless heartless joyless careless helpless thus comfort comfortless sap sapless privation or contrariety is very often denoted by the participle un prefixed to many adjectives or in before words derived from the latin as pleasant unpleasant wise unwise profitable unprofitable patient impatient thus unworthy unhealthy unfruitful unuseful and many more the original english privative is un but as we often borrow trom the latin or its descendants words already signifying privation as inefficacious impious indiscreet the inseparable particles un and in have fallen into confusion from which it is not easy to disentangle them un is prefixed to all words originally english as untrue untruth untaught unhandsome un is prefixed to all participles made privative adjectives as unfeeling unassisting unaided undelighted unendeared un ought never to be prefixed to a participle present to mark a forbearance of action as unsighing but a privation of habit as unpitying un is prefixed to most substantives which have an english termination as unfertileness unperfectness which if they have borrowed terminations take in or im as infertility imperfection uncivil incivility unactive inactivity in borrowing adjectives if we receive them already compounded it is usual to retain the particle prefixed as indecent inelegant improper but if we borrow the adjective and add the privative particle we commonly prefix un as unpolite ungallant the prepositive particles dis and mis derived from the des and mes of the french signify almost the same as un yet dis rather imports contrariety than privation since it answers to the latin preposition de mis insinuates some errour and for the most part may be rendered by the latin words male or perperam to like to dislike honour dishonour to honour to grace to dishonour to disgrace to deign to disdeign chance hap mischance mishap to take to mistake deed misdeed to use to misuse to employ to misemploy to apply to misapply words derived from latin written with de or dis retain the same signification as distinguish distinguo detract detraho defame defamo detain detineo the termination ly added to substantives and sometimes to adjectives forms adjectives that import some kind of similitude or agreement being formed by contraction of lick or like a giant giantly giantlike earth earthly heaven heavenly world worldly god godly good goodly the same termination ly added to adjectives forms adverbs of like signification as beautiful beautifully sweet sweetly that is in a beautiful manner with some degree of sweetness the termination ish added to adjectives imports diminution and added to substantives imports similitude or tendency to a character as green greenish white whitish soft softish a thief thievish a wolf wolfish a child childish we have forms of diminutives in substantives though not frequent as a hill a hillock a cock a cockrel a pike a pickrel this is a french termination a goose a gosling this is a german termination a lamb a lambkin a chick a chicken a man a manikin a pipe a pipkin and thus halkin whence the patronymick hawkins wilkin thomkin and others yet still there is another form of diminution among the english by lessening the sound itself especially of vowels as there is a form of augmenting them by enlarging or even lengthening it and that sometimes not so much by change of the letters as of their pronunciation as sup sip soop sop sippet where besides the extenuation of the vowel there is added the french termination et top tip spit spout babe baby booby greek boupais great pronounced long especially if with a stronger sound great little pronounced long leetle ting tang tong imports a succession of smaller and then greater sounds and so in jingle jangle tingle tangle and many other made words much however of this is arbitrary and fanciful depending wholly on oral utterance and therefore scarcely worthy the notice of wallis of concrete adjectives are made abstract substantives by adding the termination ness and a few in hood or head noting character or qualities as white whiteness hard hardness great greatness skilful skilfulness unskilfulness godhead manhood maidenhead widowhood knighthood priesthood likelihood falsehood there are other abstracts partly derived from adjectives and partly from verbs which are formed by the addition of the termination th a small change being sometimes made as long length strong strength broad breadth wide width deep depth true truth warm warmth dear dearth slow slowth merry mirth heal health well weal wealth dry drought young youth and so moon month like these are some words derived from verbs die death till tilth grow growth mow later mowth after mowth commonly spoken and written later math after math steal stealth bear birth rue ruth and probably earth from to ear or plow fly flight weigh weight fray fright draw draught these should rather be written flighth frighth only that custom will not suffer h to be twice repeated the same form retain faith spight wreathe wrath broth froth breath sooth worth light wight and the like whose primitives are either entirely obsolete or seldom occur perhaps they are derived from fey or foy spry wry wreak brew mow fry bray say work some ending in ship imply an office employment or condition as kingship wardship guardianship partnership stewardship headship lordship thus worship that is worthship whence worshipful and to worship some few ending in dom rick wick do especially denote dominion at least state or condition as kingdom dukedom earldom princedom popedom christendom freedom wisdom whoredom bishoprick bailiwick ment and age are plainly french terminations and are of the same import with us as among them scarcely ever occurring except in words derived from the french as commandment usage there are in english often long trains of words allied by their meaning and derivation as to beat a bat batoon a battle a beetle a battledore to batter batter a kind of glutinous composition for food made by beating different bodies into one mass all these are of similar signification and perhaps derived from the latin batuo thus take touch tickle tack tackle all imply a local conjunction from the latin tango tetigi tactum from two are formed twain twice twenty twelve twins twine twist twirl twig twitch twinge between betwixt twilight twibil the following remarks extracted from wallis are ingenious but of more subtlety than solidity and such as perhaps might in every language be enlarged without end sn usually imply the nose and what relates to it from the latin nasus are derived the french nez and the english nose and nesse a promontory as projecting like a nose but as if from the consonants ns taken from nasus and transposed that they may the better correspond sn denote nasus and thence are derived many words that relate to the nose as snout sneeze snore snortsnear snicker snot snivel snite snuff snuffle snaffle snarl snudge there is another sn which may perhaps be derived from the latin sinuo as snake sneak snail snare so likewise snap and snatch snib snub bl imply a blast as blow blast to blast to blight and metaphorically to blast ones reputation bleat bleak a bleak place to look bleak or weatherbeaten black blay bleach bluster blurt blister blab bladder blew blabber lipt blubbercheekt bloted bloteherrings blast blaze to blow that is blossom bloom and perhaps blood and blush in the native words of our tongue is to be found a great agreement between the letters and the thing signified and therefore the sounds of the letters smaller sharper louder closer softer stronger clearer more obscure and more stridulous do very often intimate the like effects in the things signified thus words that begin with str intimate the force and effect of the thing signified as if probably derived from greek strnnymi or strenuous as strong strength strew strike streak stroke stripe strive strife struggle strout strut stretch strait strict streight that is narrow distrain stress distress string strap stream streamer strand strip stray struggle strange stride stradale st in like manner imply strength but in a less degree so much only as is sufficient to preserve what has been already communicated rather than acquire any new degree as if it were derived from the latin sto

stick stake a sharp pale and any thing deposited at play stock stem sting to sting stink stitch stud stuncheon stub stubble to stub up stump whence stumble stalk to stalk step to stamp with the feet

slack slight sling slap and so likewise ash in crash rash gash flash clash lash slash plash trash indicate something acting more nimbly and sharply but ush in crush rush gush flush blush brush hush push imply something as acting more obtusely and dully yet in both there is indicated a swift and sudden motion not instantaneous but gradual by the continued sound sh thus in fling sling ding swing cling sing wring sting the tingling of the termination ng and the sharpness of the vowel i imply the continuation of a very slender motion or tremor at length indeed vanishing but not suddenly interrupted but in tink wink sink clink chink think that end in a mute consonant there is also indicated a sudden ending if there be an l as in jingle tingle tinkle mingle sprinkle twinkle there is implied a frequency or iteration of small acts and the same frequency of acts but less subtile by reason of the clearer vowel a is indicated in jangle tangle spangle mangle wrangle brangle dangle as also in mumble grumble jumble but at the same time the close u implies something obscure or obtunded and a congeries of consonants mbl denotes a confused kind of rolling or tumbling as in ramble scamble scramble wamble amble but in these there is something acute in nimble the acuteness of the vowel denotes celerity in sparkle sp denotes dissipation ar an acute crackling k a sudden interruption l a frequent iteration and in like manner in sprinkle unless in may imply the subtilty of the dissipated guttules thick and thin differ in that the former ends with an obtuse consonant and the latter with an acute in like manner in squeek squeak squeal squall brawl wraul yaul spaul screek shriek shrill sharp shrivel wrinkle crack crash clash gnash plash crush hush hisse fisse whist soft jar hurl curl whirl buz bustle spindle dwindle twine twist and in many more we may observe the agreement of such sort of sounds with the things signified and this so frequently happens that scarce any language which i know can be compared with ours so that one monosyllable word of which kind are almost all ours emphatically expresses what in other languages can scarce be explained but by compounds or decompounds or sometimes a tedious circumlocution we have many words borrowed from the latin but the greatest part of them were communicated by the intervention of the french as grace face elegant elegance resemble some verbs which seem borrowed from the latin are formed from the present tense and some from the supines from the present are formed spend expend expendo conduce conduco despise despicio approve approbo conceive concipio from the supines supplicate supplico demonstrate demonstro dispose dispono expatiate expatior suppress supprimo exempt eximo nothing is more apparent than that wallis goes too far in quest of originals many of these which seem selected as immediate descendants from the latin are apparently french as conceive approve expose exempt some words purely french not derived from the latin we have transferred into our language as garden garter buckler to advance to cry to plead from the french jardin jartier bouclier avancer crier plaider though indeed even of these part is of latin original as to many words which we have in common with the germans it is doubtful whether the old teutons borrowed them from the latins or the latins from the teutons or both had them from some common original as wine vinum wind ventus went veni way via wall vallum wallow volvo wool vellus will volo worm vermis worth virtus wasp vespa day dies draw traho tame domo greek dama yoke jugum greek zeugos over upper super greek hyper am sum greek eimi break frango fly volo blow flo i make no doubt but the teutonick is more ancient than the latin and it is no less certain that the latin which borrowed a great number of words not only from the greek especially the olick but from other neighbouring languages as the oscan and others which have long become obsolete received not a few from the teutonick it is certain that the english german and other teutonick languages retained some derived from the greek which the latin has not as ax achs mit ford pfurd daughter tochter mickle mingle moon sear oar grave graff to grave to scrape whole from greek axin greek meta greek porthmos greek thygatr greek megalos greek migny greek mn greek xros greek graph greek holos since they received these immediately from the greeks without the intervention of the latin language why may not other words be derived immediately from the same fountain though they be likewise found among the latins our ancestors were studious to form borrowed words however long into monosyllables and not only cut off the formative terminations but cropped the first syllable especially in words beginning with a vowel and rejected not only vowels in the middle but likewise consonants of a weaker sound retaining the stronger which seem the bones of words or changing them for others of the same organ in order that the sound might become the softer but especially transposing their order that they might the more readily be pronounced without the intermediate vowels for example in expendo spend exemplum sample excipio scape extraneus strange extractum stretchd excrucio to screw exscorio to scour excorio to scourge excortico to scratch and others beginning with ex as

disfigured many especially as they so much affected monosyllables and to make the sound the softer took this liberty of maiming taking away changing transposing and softening them but while we derive these from the latin i do not mean to say that many of them did not immediately come to us from the saxon danish dutch and teutonick languages and other dialects and some taken more lately from the french or italians or spaniards the same word according to its different significations often has a different origin as to bear a burden from fero but to bear whence birth born bairn comes from pario

freese or freeze from frigesco but freeze an architectonick word from zophorus but freeze for cloth from frisia or perhaps from frigesco as being more fit than any other for keeping out the cold there

scroll from proud and dance prance from st of the verb stay or stand and out is made stout from stout and hardy sturdy from sp of spit or spew and out comes spout from the same sp with the termination in is spin and adding out spin out and from the same sp with it is spit which only differs from spout in that it is smaller and with less noise and force but sputter is because of the obscure u something between spit and spout and by reason of adding r it intimates a frequent iteration and noise but obscurely confused whereas spatter on account of the sharper and clearer vowel a intimates a more distinct poise in which it chiefly differs from sputter from the same sp and the termination ark comes spark signifying a single emission of fire with a noise namely sp the emission ar the more acute noise and k the mute consonant intimates its being suddenly terminated but adding l is made the frequentative sparkle the same sp by adding r that is spr implies a more lively impetus of diffusing or expanding itself to which adding the termination ing it becomes spring its vigour spr imports its sharpness the termination ing and lastly in acute and tremulous ending in the mute consonant g denotes the sudden ending of any motion that it is meant in its primary signification of a single not a complicated exilition hence we call spring whatever has an elastick force as also a fountain of water and thence the origin of any thing and to spring to germinate and spring one of the four seasons from the same spr and out is formed sprout and wit the termination ig sprig of which the following for the most part is the difference sprout of a grosser sound imports a fatter or grosser bud sprig of a slenderer sound denotes a smaller shoot in like manner from str of the verb strive and out comes strout and strut from the same str and the termination uggle is made struggle and this gl imports but without any great noise by reason of the obscure sound of the vowel u in like manner from throw and roll is made troll and almost in the same sense is trundle from throw or thrust and rundle thus graff or grough is compounded of grave and rough and trudge from tread or trot and drudge in these observations it is easy to discover great sagacity and great extravagance an ability to do much defeated by the desire of doing more than enough it may be remarked that walliss derivations are often so made that by the same license any language may be deduced from any other that he makes no distinction between words immediately derived by us from the latin and those which being copied from other languages can therefore afford no example of the genius of the english language or its laws of derivation that he derives from the latin often with great harshness and violence words apparently teutonick and therefore according to his own declaration probably older than the tongue to which he refers them that some of his derivations are apparently erroneous syntax the established practice of grammarians requires that i should here treat of the syntax but our language has so little inflection or variety of terminations that its construction neither requires nor admits many rules wallis therefore has totally neglected it and jonson whose desire of following the writers upon the learned languages made him think a syntax indispensably necessary has published such petty observations as were better omitted the verb as in other languages agrees with the nominative in number and person as thou fliest from good he runs to death our adjectives and pronouns are invariable of two substantives the noun possessive is in the genitive as his fathers glory the suns heat verbs transitive require an oblique case as he loves me you fear him all prepositions require an oblique case as he gave this to me he took this from me he says this of me he came with me prosody it is common for those that deliver the grammar of modern languages to omit the prosody so that of the italians is neglected by buomattei that of the french by desmarais aad that of the english by wallis cooper and even by jonson though a poet but as the laws of metre are included in the idea of grammar i have thought proper to insert them prosody comprises orthoepy or the rules of pronunciation and orthometry or the laws of versification pronunciation is just when every letter has its proper sound and every syllable has its proper accent or which in english versification is the same its proper quantity the sounds of the letters have been already explained and rules for the accent or quantity are not easily to be given being subject to innumerable exceptions such however as i have read or formed i shall here propose of dissyllables formed by affixing a termination the former syllable is commonly accented as chldish kngdom ctest cted tilsome lver scffer farer fremost zalous flness gdly mekly rtist dissyllables formed by prefixing a syllable to the radical word have commonly the accent on the latter as to begt to besem to bestw of dissyllables which are at once nouns and verbs the verb has commonly the accent on the latter and the noun on the former syllable as to descnt a dscant to cemnt a cment to contrct a cntract this rule has many exceptions though verbs seldom have their accent on the former yet nouns often have it on the latter syllable as delght perfme all dissyllables ending in y as crnny in our as lbour fvour in ow as wllow wllow except allw in le as bttle bble in ish as bnish in ck as cmbrick cssock in ter as to btter in age as corage in en as fsten in et as quet accent the former syllable dissyllable nouns in er as cnker btter have the accent on the former syllable dissyllable verbs terminating in a consonant and e final as comprse escpe or having a diphthong in the last syllable as appase reval or ending in two consonants as attnd have the accent on the latter syllable dissyllable nouns having a diphthong in the latter syllable have commonly their accent on the latter syllable as appluse except words in ain crtain montain trissyllables formed by adding a termination or prefixing a syllable retain the accent of the radical word as lveliness tnderness contmner wgonner phsical besptter cmmenting commnding assrance trissyllables ending in ous as grcious rduous in al as cpital in ion as mntion accent the first trissyllables ending in ce ent and ate accent the first syllable as cuntenance cntinence rmament mminent legant prpagate except they be derived from words having the accent on the last as connvance acquintance or the middle syllable hath a vowel before two consonants as promlgate trissyllables ending in y as ntity spcify lberty vctory sbsidy commonly accent the first syllable trissyllables in re or le accent the first syllable as lgible thatre except discple and some words which have a position as exmple epstle trissyllables in ude commonly accent the first syllable as plnitude trissyllables ending in ator or atour as cretour or having in the middle syllable a diphthong as endevour or a vowel before two consonants as domstick accent the middle syllable trissyllables that have their accent on the last syllable are commonly french as acquisce reparte magazne or words formed by prefixing one or two syllables to an acute syllable as immatre overchrge polysyllables or words of more than three syllables follow the accent of the words from which they are derived as rrogating cntinency incntinently commndable commnicableness we should therefore say disptable indisptable rather than dsputable indsputable and advertsement rather than advrtisement words in ion have the accent upon the antepenult as salvtion perturbtion concction words in atour or ator on the penult as dedictor words ending in le commonly have the accent on the first syllable as micable unless the second syllable have a vowel before two consonants as combstible words ending in ous have the accents on the antepenult as uxrious volptuous words ending in ty have their accent on the antepenult as pusillanmity actvity these rules are not advanced as complete or infallible but proposed as useful almost every rule of every language has its exceptions and in english as in other tongues much must be learned by example and authority perhaps more and better rules may be given that have escaped my observation versification is the arrangement of a certain number of syllables according to certain laws the feet of our verses are either iambick as alft crete or trochaick as hly lfty our iambick measure comprises verses of four syllables most good most fair or things as rare to call yous lost for all the cost words can bestow so poorly show upon your praise that all the ways sense hath come short drayton with ravishd ears the monarch hears dryden of six this while we are abroad shall we not touch our lyre shall we not sing an ode or shall that holy fire in us that strongly glowd in this cold air expire though in the utmost peak a while we do remain amongst the mountains bleak exposd to sleet and rain no sport our hours shall break to exercise our vein what though bright phoebus beams refresh the southern ground and though the princely thames with beauteous nymphs abound and by old cambers streams be many wonders found yet many rivers clear here glide in silver swathes and what of all most dear buxtons delicious baths strong ale and noble chear t asswage breem winters scathes in places far or near or famous or obscure where wholsom is the air or where the most impure all times and every where the muse is still in ure drayton of eight which is the usual measure for short poems and may at last my weary age find out the peaceful hermitage the hairy gown and mossy cell where i may sit and nightly spell of evry star the sky doth shew and evry herb that sips the dew milton of ten which is the common measure of heroick and tragick poetry full in the midst of this created space betwixt heavn earth and skies there stands a place confining on all three with triple bound whence all things though remote are viewd around and thither bring their undulating sound the palace of loud fame her seat of powr placd on the summit of a lofty towr a thousand winding entries long and wide receive of fresh reports a flowing tide a thousand crannies in the walls are made nor gate nor bars exclude the busy trade tis built of brass the better to diffuse the spreading sounds and multiply the news where echoes in repeated echoes play a mart for ever full and open night and day nor silence is within nor voice express but a deaf noise of sounds that never cease confusd and chiding like the hollow roar of tides receding from th insulted shore or like the broken thunder heard from far when jove to distance drives the rolling war the courts are filld with a tumultuous din of crouds or issuing forth or entring in a thoroughfare of news where some devise things never heard some mingle truth with lies the troubled air with empty sounds they beat intent to hear and eager to repeat dryden in all these measures the accents are to be placed on even syllables and every line considered by itself is more harmonious as this rule is more strictly observed the variations necessary to pleasure belong to the art of poetry not the rules of grammar our trochaick measures are of three syllables here we may think and pray before death stops our breath other joys are but toys waltons angler of five in the days of old stories plainly told lovers felt annoy old ballad of seven fairest piece of well formd earth urge not thus your haughty birth waller in these measures the accent is to be placed on the odd syllables these are the measures which are now in use and above the rest those of seven eight and ten syllables our ancient poets wrote verses sometimes of twelve syllables as draytons polyolbion of all the cambrian shires their heads that bear so high and farthst survey their soils with an ambitious eye mervinia for her hills as for their matchless crouds the nearest that are said to kiss the wandring clouds especial audience craves offended with the throng that she of all the rest neglected was so long alledging for herself when through the saxons pride the godlike race of brute to severns setting side were cruelly inforcd her mountains did relieve those whom devouring war else every where did grieve and when all wales beside by fortune or by might unto her ancient foe resignd her ancient right a constant maiden still she only did remain the last her genuine laws which stoutly did retain and as each one is praisd for her peculiar things so only she is rich in mountains meres and springs and holds herself as great in her superfluous waste as others by their towns and fruitful tillage gracd and of fourteen as chapmans homer and as the mind of such a man that hath a long way gone and either knoweth not his way or else would let alone his purposd journey is distract the measures of twelve and fourteen syllables were often mingled by our old poets sometimes in alternate lines and sometimes in alternate couplets the verse of twelve syllables called an alexandrine is now only used to diversify heroick lines waller was smooth but dryden taught to join the varying verse the full resounding line the long majestick march and energy divine pope the pause in the alexandrine must be at the sixth syllable the verse of fourteen syllables is now broken into a soft lyrick measure of verses consisting alternately of eight syllables and six she to receive thy radiant name selects a whiter space fenton when all shall praise and evry lay devote a wreath to thee that day for come it will that day shall i lament to see lewis to pope beneath this tomb an infant lies to earth whose body lent hereafter shall more glorious rise but not more innocent when the archangels trump shall blow and souls to bodies join what crowds shall wish their lives below had been as short as thine wesley we have another measure very quick and lively and therefore much used in songs which may be called the anapestick in which the accent rests upon every third syllable may i gvern my pssions with bsolute swy and grow wser and btter as lfe wears awy dr pope in this measure a syllable is often retrenched from the first foot as digenes srly and prud dr pope when prsent we lve and when bsent agre i thnk not of ris nor ris of me dryden these measures are varied by many combinations and sometimes by double endings either with or without rhyme as in the heroick measure tis the divinity that stirs within us tis heaven itself that points out an hereafter and intimates eternity to man addison so in that of eight syllables they neither added nor confounded they neither wanted nor abounded prior in that of seven for resistance i could fear none but with twenty ships had done what thou brave and happy vernon hast atchievd with six alone glover in that of six twas when the seas were roaring with hollow blasts of wind a damsel lay deploring all on a rock reclind gay in the anapestick when terrible tempests assail us and mountainous billows affright nor power nor wealth can avail us but skilful industry steers right ballad to these measures and their laws may be reduced every species of english verse our versification admits of few licences except a synaloepha or elision of e in the before a vowel as th eternal and more rarely of o in to as t accept and a synaresis by which two short vowels coalesce into one syllable as question special or a word is contracted by the expulsion of a short vowel before a liquid as avrice temprance thus have i collected rules and examples by which the english language may be learned if the reader be already acquainted with grammatical terms or taught by a master to those that are more ignorant to have written a grammar for such as are not yet initiated in the schools would have been tedious and perhaps at last ineffectual
