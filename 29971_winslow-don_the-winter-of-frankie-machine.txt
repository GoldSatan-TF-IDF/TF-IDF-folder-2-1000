don winslow the winter of frankie machine its a lot of work being me is what frank machianno thinks when the alarm goes off at in the morning he rolls right out of the rack and feels the cold wooden floor on his feet hes right itis a lot of work being him frank pads across the wooden floor which he personally sanded and varnished and gets into the shower it only takes him a minute to shower which is one reason that he keeps his silver hair cut short so it doesnt take long to wash it is what he tells donna when she complains about it it takes him thirty seconds to dry off then he wraps the towel around his waistof which theres a little more these days than hed likeshaves and brushes his teeth his route to the kitchen takes him through his living room where he picks up a remote hits a button and speakers start to blastla boheme one of the nice things about living alonemaybe the only good thing about living alone frank thinksis that you can play opera at am and not bother anyone and the house is solid with thick walls like they used to build in the old days so franks early morning arias dont disturb the neighbors either frank has a pair of season tickets to the san diego opera and donna is kind enough to pretend that she really enjoys going with him she even pretended not to notice when he cried at the end ofla boheme when mimi died now as he walks into the kitchen he sings along with victoria de los angeles ma quando vien lo sgelo il primo sole e mio il primo bacio dellaprile e mio il primo sole e mio frank loves his kitchen he laid the classic blackandwhite floor tile himself and put in the counters and cabinets with the help of a carpenter buddy he found the old butcher block in an antique store in little italy it was in tough shape when he bought itdried out and starting to crackand it took him months of rubbing oil to get it back into prime condition but he loves it for its flaws its old chips and scarsbadges of honor he calls them from years and years of faithful service see peopleused this thing he told donna when she asked why he didnt just buy a new one which he could easily afford you get close you can even smell where they used to chop the garlic italian men and their mothers donna said my mother was a good cook frank replied but it was my old man who couldreally cook he taught me and taught him good donna thought at the time whatever else you want to think about frank machiannosuch as he can be a genuine pain in the assthe man can cook the man also knows how to treat a woman and maybe the two attributes arent unrelated actually it was frank who introduced this idea to her making love is like making a good sauce he said to her one night in bed during the afterglow frank quit while youre ahead she told him he didnt you have to take your time usejust the right amount of the right spices savor each one thenslowly turn the heat up until it bubbles the unique charm of frank machianno she thought lying there next to him is that he just compared your body to abolognese and you dont kick his ass out of bed maybe its that he really does care so much she has sat in the car while hes driven back and forth across town going to five different stores for five different ingredients for a single dish thesalsiccie isbetter at cristafaros donna he brings the same attention to detail into the bedroom and the man can make shall we say the sauce bubble this morning like every morning he takes raw kona coffee beans from a vacuumsealed jar and spoons them into the little roaster he bought from one of those chefs catalogs hes always getting in the mail donna gives him endless crap about the coffee bean thing get an automatic maker with one of those timers she said then it would be ready when you get out of the shower you could even sleep a few minutes later but it wouldnt be as good its a lot of work being you donna said what can i say frank thought itis youve heard of the phrase quality of life he asked her i have donna said usually referring to the terminally ill whether they pull the plug or not this is a qualityoflife issue frank replied and it is he thinks this morning as he enjoys the smell of the roasting coffee beans and puts the water on to boil quality of life is about thelittle thingsdoing them well doing themright he takes a small pan from the rack that hangs over the butcher block and puts it on the stovetop he lays a thin slice of butter in it and when the butter just starts to bubble he breaks an egg in the pan and while its frying he slices an onion bagel in half then he carefully slips the egg out with a plastic spatula onlyplasticmetal would scratch the nonstick surface which is something donna cant seem to remember which is why shes not allowed to cook in frankscucina lays it on one of the slices puts the other over it and wraps the egg sandwich in a linen napkin to keep it warm donna of course gives him grief about the daily egg its anegg he tells her not a hand grenade youre sixtytwo years old frank she tells him you have to watch your cholesterol no they found that wasnt true about the eggs he says they got a bum rap his daughter jill harasses him about it too she just graduated premed at ucsd so of course she knows everything he tells her otherwise yourepre med he says when youremed then you can give me agita about the eggs america frank thinkswere the only country in the world afraid of our food by the time the lethal egg sandwich is ready the coffee beans are roasted he pours them into the grinder for exactly ten seconds then pours the ground coffee into the frenchpress maker pours the boiling water in and lets it sit for the suggested four minutes the minutes arent wasted frank uses them to get dressed how a civilized human being can get dressed in four minutes is beyond me donna has observed its easy frank thinks especially when you lay your clothes out the night before and youre going to a bait shop so this morning he puts on a clean pair of underwear thick wool socks a flannel shirt an old pair of jeans then sits on the bed and puts on his work boots when he goes back into the kitchen the coffee is ready he pours it into a metal go cup and takes his first sip frank loves that first taste of coffee especially when its freshly roasted freshly ground and freshly made quality of life little things he thinks matter he puts the lid on the go cup and sets it on the counter as he takes his old hooded sweatshirt from the hook on the wall and puts it on jams a black wool beanie on his head and takes his car keys and wallet from their assigned place then he takes yesterdaysuniontribune from which hes saved the crossword puzzle he does it late in the morning when the bait business is slow he picks the coffee back up grabs the egg sandwich flicks off the stereo and hes ready to go its winter in san diego and cold outside okay relatively cold its not wisconsin or north dakotaits not the painful kind of cold where your engine wont turn over and your face feels like its going to crack and fall off but anyplace in the northern hemisphere is at least chilly at am in january especially frank thinks as he gets into his toyota pickup truck when youre on the wrong side of sixty and it takes a little while for your blood to warm up in the morning but frank loves the early hours theyre his favorite time of the day this is his quiet time the only part of his busy day thats actually tranquil and he loves to watch the sun come up over the hills east of the city and see the sky over the ocean turn pink as the water changes from black to gray but that wont be for a little while its still black out now he turns to a local am station to get the weather report rain and more rain a big front moving in from the north pacific he pays half attention as the announcer gives the local news its the usualfour more houses in oceanside have slid down a slope in the mud the city auditors cant decide if the city is on the verge of bankruptcy or not and housing prices have risen again then theres the city council scandalthe fbis operation gsting has resulted in the indictment of four councilmen for taking bribes from stripclub owners to repeal the city ordinance prohibiting touching in the clubs a couple of vice cops have been paid off for looking the other way yeah its news and its not news frank thinks because san diego is a port town for the navy the sex trade has always been a big part of the economy bribing a councilman so that a sailor can get a lap dance is practically a civic duty but if the fbi wants to waste its time on strippers its nothing to frank he hasnt been in a strip club inwhat twenty years frank switches back to the classical station opens the linen napkin on his lap and eats his egg sandwich while he drives down to ocean beach he likes that little bite of the onion in the bagel against the taste of the egg and the bitterness of the coffee it was herbie goldstein may he rest who had turned him on to the onion bagel back in the days when vegas was still vegas and not disney world with crap tables and back when herbie all pounds of him was an unlikely player and unlikelier ladies man theyd been up all night hitting the shows and clubs with a couple of gorgeous girls when herbie had somehow pulled into his orbit they decided to go out to breakfast where herbie talked a reluctant frank into trying an onion bagel come on you guinea herbie had said stretch your horizons that was a good thing herbie had done for him because frank enjoys his onion bagels but only when he can buy them freshmade at that little kosher deli up in hillcrest anyway the onion bagelegg sandwich is a highlight of his morning routine normal people sitdown to eat breakfast donna told him iam sitting down frank replied sitting down driving what is it jill calls it the kids these days think they invented doing more than one thing at a time they should have tried raising kids in the old days before the disposable diapers the washerdryers and the microwaves so they came up with a fancy name for it yeah multitasking im like the young people frank thinks im multitasking ocean beach pier is the biggest pier in california a big capitalt of concrete and steel jutting out into the pacific ocean its central stem running for over sixteen hundred feet before its crosspiece branches out to the north and south an almost equal distance if you decide to walk the entire pier youre looking at a jaunt of about a mile and a half franks bait shop ob bait and tackle sits about twothirds of the way up the stem on the north side just far enough from the ocean beach pier cafe so that the smell from the bait shop doesnt bother the diners and the dining tourists dont bother franks regular fishermen actually a lot of his customers also hit the obp cafe on a regular basis for its eggsmachaca and lobster omelette so does frank for that matter a good lobster omelette okay any lobster omelette being a difficult thing to come by so if theres one right next door you tend to take advantage of it but not at in the morning even though the obp cafe is open frank just polishes off his sandwich parks his van and walks out to his shop he could drive out therehe has a passbut unless he has some equipment or something to bring in he likes to walk the ocean at this time of the day is spectacular especially in winter the water is a cold slate gray heavy this morning with the ominous swell of an approaching storm its like a pregnant woman this time of year frank thinksfull temperamental impatient the waves are already slapping against the concrete support pillars making little explosions of white water burst into the air below the pier frank likes to think about the long journey that the waves make starting near japan and then rolling all the way across thousands of miles of the north pacific just to break against the pier the surfers will be out in force not the spongers the wannabes or the kooksthey will and should stay onshore and watch but the real guys the gunners will be out for these swells big waves thundercrushers that will crash all along the old spots and breaks which read like a litany in a surfers church service boil rockslide lescums out ta sites bird shit osprey peskys both sides of the ob piersouth side north sidethen up along the coastgage avalanche and stubs frank gets a kick just reciting the names in his head he knows them alltheyre sacred places in his life and those are just the breaks around obgo farther up the san diego coast and the litany continues from north to south big rock windansea rockpile hospital point boomer beach blacks beach seaside reef suckouts swamis d street tamarack and carlsbad these names have magic for a local surfer theyre more than just nameseach place holds memories frank grew up at these spots back in the golden sixties when the san diego coast was paradise uncrowded undeveloped when there werent a lot of surfers and you knew practically every guy who went out thosewere the endless summers each day seemed to last forever frank thinks as he watches a wave roll in and smack the pier youd get up before dawn just like now and work hard all day on the old mans tuna boat but youd get back by the middle of the afternoon then it was off to meet your buddies at the beach youd surf until dark laughing and talking shit out there in the lineup goofing on one another showing off for the bunnies watching you from the beach those were the longboard days plenty of time and plenty of space days of hanging ten and hodadding and those fat dick dale guitar riffs and beach boys songs and they were singing aboutyou they were singing aboutyour life your sweet summer days on the beach youd always stop and watch the sunset together you and your buddies and the girls had that ritual a common acknowledgment ofwhat wonder a few quiet respectful moments watching the sun sink over the horizon the water glowing orange pink and red and youd think to yourself howlucky you were even as a kid you knew you were just damn lucky to be in that place at that time and you were just wise enough to know that youd better enjoy it then the last sliver of red sun would slide over the edge and youd all gather firewood and build a bonfire and cook fish or hot dogs or hamburgers or whatever you could scare up and youd eat and sit around the fire and someone would pull out a guitar and sing sloop john b or barbara ann or some old folk song and later if you were lucky youd slip away from the firelight with a blanket and one of the girls and youd make out and the girl smelled of salt water and suntan lotion and maybe shed let you slide your hand under her bikini top and there was nothing like that feeling and you might lie with her all night on that blanket and then wake up and hustle down to the docks just in time to catch the boat and get to work and then do the whole thing all over again but you could do that in those daysget a couple hours of sleep work all day surf all afternoon play all night and shake it off cant do that anymorenow you put in a short night and youache the next morning but those were the golden days frank thinks and suddenly he feels sad nostalgia isnt that what they call it he thinks as he shakes himself from his reverie and walks toward the bait shack remembering summer on a cold wet winter day we thought those summers would never end never thought wed ever feel the cold in our bones two minutes after he opens the fishermen start coming in frank knows most of themtheyre his obp regularsespecially on a weekday when the weekend fishermen have to go to work so on a tuesday morning he gets his retired guys the sixtyfiveandups who have nothing better to do with their time than to stand on the dock in the cold and wet and try to catch a fish then more and more over the years you have your asiansmostly vietnamese along with some chinese and malaysiansmiddleaged guys for whom thisis work this is how they put food on the table and they always still seem amazed that they can do this pretty much for free buy a fishing license and some bait and throw a line into the ocean and feed their families from the bounty of the sea but hell frank thinks isnt this what immigrants have always done here hes read articles about how the chinese had a fleet of fishing junks down here way back in the s until the immigration laws shut them down and then my own grandfather and the rest of the italian immigrants started the tuna fleet and dived for abalone and now the asians are doing it again feeding their families from the sea so you got the retirees and the asians and then you got the young bluecollar white guys mostly utility workers coming off night shifts who consider the pier their ancestral turf and resent the asian newcomers for taking their spots about half these guys dont fish with poles at all but with crossbows theyre not fishermen frank thinks theyre hunters waiting until they see a flash in the water and shooting one of their bolts which are attached to long cords so they can pull the fish up and every once in a while they shoot a little too close to a surfer coming in by the pier and there have been a few fights over this so theres some tension between the surfers and the crossbow guys frank doesnt like tension on his pier fishing and surfing and the water should be about fun not tension its a big ocean boys and theres plenty for everybody thats franks philosophy and he shares it freely everyone loves frank the bait guy the regulars love him because he always knows what fish are running and what theyre hitting on and hell never sell you bait that he knows wont work the casual fishermen love him for the same reason and because if you bring your kid on a saturday you know that frank is going to hook him up right and find him a spot where hes most likely to catch something even if he has to nudge a regular aside for a little while to get it done the tourists love frank because he always has a smile and a funny saying and a compliment for the women thats a little flirtatious but never a comeon thats frank the bait guy who decorates his shack every christmas like its rockefeller center who dresses up at halloween and gives out candy to anyone who comes by who holds an annual childrens fishing contest and gives prizes to every kid who enters the locals love him because he sponsors a little league team pays for uniforms for a local kids soccer team even though he hates soccer and never attends a game buys an ad in the program for every high school drama production and paid for the basketball hoops at the local park this morning he gets the bait for his early customers and then theres the usual lull so he can relax and watch the surfers who are already out on the dawn patrol these are the young hard chargers getting in a session before they have to go to work a few years ago that would have been me he thinks with a slight pang of jealousy then he laughs at himself a few years get real these kids with their shortboards and their cutback maneuvers christ even if you could do one of those youd probably just throw your back out and be in bed for a week youre twenty years out from being able to compete with those kidsyoud just get in their way and you know it so he sits and does his crossword puzzle another gift from herbie who had turned him on to the puzzles herbie goldstein has been on his mind a lot these days particularly this morning maybe its the storm he thinks storms bring up memories like they drop driftwood on the beach things you think are lost forever and then suddenly there they arefaded worn but back again so he sits and works the puzzles thinks about herbie and waits for the gentlemens hour the gentlemens hour is an institution on every california surf spot it starts around or when the young guns have hustled off to their day jobs leaving the water to guys with more flexible schedules so the lineup consists of your doctors your lawyers your real estate investors your federal worker early buyouts some retired schoolteachersin short gentlemen its an older crowd obviously mostly with longboards and straightahead riding styles more leisurely less competitive a lot more polite no ones in a particular hurry no one drops in on anybody elses wave and no one worries if he doesnt get a ride everyone knows that the waves will be there tomorrow and the next day and the next truth be known a lot of the session consists of sitting out on the lineup or even standing on the beach swapping lies about gigantic waves and ferocious wipeouts and talking stories about the good old days which get better with each passing rendition let the kids call it the geriatric hourwhat do they know lifes like a fat orange frank thinks when youre young you squeeze it hard and fast trying to get all the juice in a hurry when youre older you squeeze it slowly savoring every drop because one you dont know how many drops you have left and two the last drops are the sweetest hes thinking this when a fracas breaks out across the pier oh this is going to make a good story for the gentlemens hour frank thinks when he gets over there and sees whats what this is richcrossbow guy and vietnamese guy have caught the same fish and are about to come to blows over who caught it first whether crossbow guy shot it while it was on vietnamese guys hook or vietnamese guy hooked it when it was on crossbow guys arrow the poor fish is hanging in the air at the apex of this unlikely triangle while each guy plays tugofwar with their lines and one look at it tells frank that vietnamese guy is in the right because his hook is in the fishs mouth frank somehow doubts that the fish got shot clean through the body with an arrow andthen decided it was hungry for a nice minnow but crossbow guy gives a hard yank and pulls the fish in vietnamese guy starts yelling at him and a crowd gathers and crossbow guy looks like hes going to pound vietnamese guy into the pier which he could easily do because hes big bigger even than frank frank steps through the crowd and stands between the two arguing men its his fish frank says to crossbow guy who the hell areyou its an amazingly ignorant question hes frank the bait guy and anyone who frequents obp knows it any regular would also know that frank the bait guy is one of the piers sheriffs see every water spotbeach pier or wavehas a few sheriffs guys who by virtue of seniority and respect keep order and settle disputes on the beach its usually a lifeguarda senior guy whos a lifesaving legend out on the lineup its one or two guys whove been riding that break forever on ocean beach pier its frank you dont argue with a sheriff you can present your case you can express your grievance but you dont argue with his ruling and you sure as hell dont ask who he is because you should know not knowing who the sheriff is automatically labels you as an outsider whose ignorance probably put you in the wrong in the first place and crossbow guy has east county written all over him from the down vest to thekeep on truckin ball cap to the mullet underneath it franks guessing hes from el cajon and it always amuses him how guys who live forty miles from the ocean can get territorial about it so frank doesnt even bother to answer the question its obvious he hooked it first and you shot it while he was reeling it in frank says which is what vietnamese guy is saying fast loudly continuously and in vietnamese so frank turns to him and asks him to chill out he has to respect the guy for not backing down even though hes giving away a foot of height and a bill and a half in weight of course he wont back down frank thinks hes trying to feed his family then frank turns back to crossbow guy just give him his fish theres a lot more in the ocean crossbow guy isnt having it he glares down at frank and one look at his eyes tells frank that the guy is a tweeker great frank thinks a head full of crystal meth will make him alot easier to deal with these fucking gooks are takingall the fish crossbow guy says reloading the crossbow now vietnamese guy may not speak a lot of english but from the look in his eye he knows the wordgook probably heard it a lot frank thinks embarrassed hey east county frank says we dont talk that way here crossbow guy starts to argue and then he stops just stops he might be a moron but he isnt blind and he sees something in franks eyes that just makes him shut his mouth frank looks square into crossbow guys methedup eyes and says i dont want to see you on my pier again find a different place to fish crossbow guys in no mood to argue anymore he takes his fish and starts the long walk back down the pier frank goes back to the bait shack to change into his wet suit hey if it isnt the dispenser of justice dave hansen grins at frank from his board out in the lineup frank paddles up and pulls alongside you heard about that already small town ocean beach dave says he stares pointedly at franks longboard an old ninefootthreeinch baltierra is that a surfboard or an ocean liner you got stewards on that thing id like to sign up for the second sitting please big waves big board frank says theyll be even bigger tomorrow when we talk about them dave says waves are like bellies frank says they grow with time except daves hasnt he and dave have been buddies for maybe twenty years and the tall cops belly is still washboard flat when dave isnt surfing hes running and except for a cinnamon roll after the gentlemens hour he doesnt eat anything with white sugar in it cold enough for you dave asks oh yeah yes it is even though franks wearing an oneill winter suit with a hood and booties it is damn cold water and to tell the truth frank had considered giving the gentlemens hour a pass this morning for that reason except that would be the beginning of the end he thinks an admission of aging getting out there every morning is what keeps you young so as soon as the kid abe got in frank forced himself to climb into his wet suit hood and booties before he could chicken out but itis cold when he was paddling out and had to duck under a wave it was like sticking his face into a barrel of ice im surprised youre out here this morning frank says whys that operation gsting frank says funny name dave and people say we have no sense of humor except gsting is no joke dave hansen thinks its about the last vestiges of organized crime in san diego bribing cops councilmenthere might even be a congressman in the mix gsting isnt about strippers its about corruption and corruption is cancer it starts small with lap dances but then it grows then its construction bids real estate deals even defense contracts once a politician is on the hook hes hooked for good the mob guys know it they know that you bribe a politician only once after that you blackmail him outside frank yells a nice set coming in dave takes off hes a strong guy with an easy athletic paddlein and frank watches him catch the wave and get up then drop down ride the righthand break all the way in then hop off into the ankledeep water frank goes for the next one he lies flat on his board and paddles hard feels the wave pick him up then goes into a squat he straightens up just as the wave drops points the front of his board straight toward the shore its classic oldschool straightahead longboard style but for the thousands of times frank has done it its still the best kick there is no offense to donna or patty or any of the women hes made love to in his life but theres nothing like this never has been never will be how does the old song go catch a wave and youre sitting on top of the world thats it sittingwell standingon top of the world and the world is going about a thousand miles an hour cold and crisp and beautiful he rides the wave and hops off he and dave paddle back out together were looking pretty good for old men frank says we are dave says when they get back out to the shoulder he says hey did i tell you ive decided to pull the pin franks not sure he heard him right dave hansen retiring hesmy age for gods sake no he isnthes a couple of yearsyounger the bureaus offering early retirement dave says kind of gently because he sees the look on franks face all these young kids coming up all the terrorism crap i talked it over with barbara and we decided to take it jesus dave what are you going todo this dave says waving his hand toward the water and travel spend more time with the grandkids grandkids franks forgotten that daves daughter melissa had a baby a couple of years ago and is expecting another one where does she live seattle portland some rainy place wow hey ill still be here for the gentlemens hour dave says most of the time and i wont have to leave so early no listen congratulations frank says centanni every happiness uh when nine months dave says september september frank thinks the best month on the beach the weather is beautiful and the tourists have gone home another set comes in they both ride it in and then call it a session two solid waves on a day like this are enough and a cup of hot coffee and a cinnamon roll are sounding pretty good right about now so they go up and clean up at the outdoor shower on the back of the bait shack get dressed then grab a table at the obp cafe they sit there drink coffee consume fat and sugar and watch the winter storm now brewing on the edge of the sea dark gray sky thickening clouds a wind building from the west its going to be a ripper after the gentlemens hour frank starts on his busy day allfranks days are busy what with four businesses an exwife and a girlfriend to manage the key to pulling it off is to stick to a routine or at least try to he has triedwithout conspicuous successto explain this simple management technique to the kid abe if you have a routine he has lectured you can always deviate from it if something comes up but if youdont have a routine theneverything is stuff that comes up get it got it but he doesnt get it frank knows because he doesntdo it frank does it religiously actually more than religiously as patty reminded him the last time he was at the house to fix a drip under the kitchen sink you never go to church she told him why should i go to church frank asked and listen to some priest whoschtupps little boys lecture me on morality he got that word from herbie goldstein and prefers it to the alternative words frank doesnt approve of profanity and somehow saying it in yiddish is less vulgar youre terrible patty said yeah im terrible frank thinks but from the last few times hes balanced her checkbook hes noticed she doesnt give as much to the church as she used to the priests should know what italian husbands have always known italian wives will always find a way to punish you and its usually in the wallet you piss her off shell still do the job in the bedroom but then she goes out and buys a new dinette set and never says a thing about it and if you got any brains at all you wont either and if the priests have any brains at all they arent going to get in that pulpit and bitch about the shrinking receipts in the collection plate because theyll start seeing nickels and dimes in there anyway church isnt part of franks routine his linensupply business is the first two hours of his postbait shop day are spent driving around to the various restaurants he serves making what he calls happy callsthat is talking to the owners and managers and making sure theyre happy with the service that their orders have come in right that the tablecloths napkins aprons and kitchen cloths are spotless if the restaurant is also a fish customer he goes into the kitchen to say hello to the chef and make sure hes happy with the quality hes getting they usually go into the walkin refrigerator where frank inspects the product personally and if the chef has any complaints frank writes it down in his little notebook and takes care of it right away god bless cell phones frank thinks because now he can call louis from the car and tell him to get some fresh tuna over to the ocean grill inside the next twenty minutes and make itgood this time why do you write it down if you make the call right away the kid abe asks him because the customersees you write it down frank tells him and he knows you take his business seriously by one oclock frank has visited a dozen or so of the best restaurants in san diego today he works his way from south to north so hell end up in encinitas to meet jill for lunch shes a vegetarian so they meet at the lemongrass cafe off the pch even though the restaurant isnt one of franks customers and he doesnt get comped there shes already seated when he gets there he stands in the foyer for a second looking at her for so long he and patty thought they couldnt have a baby theyd resigned themselves to the fact then boom jill my beautiful daughter all grown up now tall pretty shoulderlength chestnut hair dark brown eyes and a roman nose dressed casual but smart in blue jeans and a black sweater shes readingthe new yorker and sipping on a cup of what he knows is herbal tea she looks up and smiles and that smile is worth everything in the world to him they were estranged for a long time after he and patty split up and he doesnt blame her for being bitter those were tough times frank thinks i put her and her mother through a lot through most of college she barely spoke to him even though he paid all the tuition and room and board then at the end of her junior year something just clicked in her she called and invited him to lunch and it was awkward and shy and totally terrific and from there they slowly built their relationship back up not that itsfather knows best yet she still harbors some resentment and can be a little sharp from time to time but they have a steady tuesday lunch date and he wont break it for anything no matter how busy a day hes having daddy she sets the magazine down and stands up for her hug and kiss on the cheek sweetie he sits down across from her the place is your typical southern california hippiebuddhistvegetarian joint with naturalfiber everything on the tables and walls and waiters who speak in whispers as if theyre in a temple and not a restaurant he looks at the menu try the tofu burger she says no offense sweetie but id rather eat dirt he sees something that looks like it might be an eggplant sandwich with sevengrain bread and decides to go with that she orders soup with tofu and lemongrass hows the bait business steady he says have you seen mom lately sure like every day frank thinks if its not her checkbook its the car needing maintenance and theres always something with the house plus he pays the alimony every week in cash you we did the dinner and shopping thing last night jill says part of my continuing albeit futile campaign to get her to buy an article of clothing thats not black he smiles and doesnt mention her sweater she dresses like a nun since you left her jill says well at least we got the obligatory mention ofthat out of the way early frank thinks and just for the record sweetie i didnt leave hershe kicked me out not that she didnt have her reasons or that i didnt deserve it just for the record he doesnt say it though jill reaches for something on the seat beside her then hands him an envelope across the table he looks at her curiously open it she says shes beaming he takes his reading glasses out and puts them on getting older is a bad idea he thinks i should give it up right away the stationery is from ucla he takes out the enclosed letter and starts to read it cant finish though because his eyes start to mist up is this i got accepted she says ucla medical school sweetie frank says thats fantastic im so proudhappy me too she says and he remembers that at her better moments she is totally without guile wow he says my little girl is going to be a doctor oncology she says of course he thinks jill never does anything by half when she jumps in its always at the deep end of the pool so jill isnt just going to be a doctor shes going to cure cancer well good for her and i wouldnt be a bit surprised if she does ucla medical school i dont start until fall shes saying so i thought id work a couple of jobs this summer then get a parttime job during the school year i think i can swing it he shakes his head work the summer he said but you cant go to med school and work at the same time sweetie daddy i he holds his hand up palm out ill take care of it you work so hard and ill take care of it are yousure this time she gets just the hand no words but those are going to be some heavy bills frank thinks thats a lot of bait linens and fish and rental propertiesfrank spends his afternoons looking after his propertymanagement business im going to have to kick it all up a notch he thinks thats okay i can kick it up a notch i handed you a lot of shit in your life i can find a way to give you this and to have a daughter named dr machianno what would my old man have thought of this this is such a happy thing he says he stands up leans over and kisses her on the top of her head congratulations she squeezes his hand thank you daddy the food arrives and frank eats his sandwich with fake enthusiasm but he thinks i wish they would let me go back in the kitchen and show them how to fix eggplant they make small talk through the rest of lunch he asks her about boyfriends nobody special she says besides im not going to have time for med school and a love life classic jill he thinks the kid has always had a good head on her shoulders dessert he asks when they finish the entree i dont want anything she says looking fixedly at his belly and neither should you its my age he tells her its your diet she says its all the cannoli im in the restaurant business what businessarent you in the tofu business he says gesturing for the check and you should be glad im in all those businesses its all those businesses that paid for your college and are going to find a way to pay for your med school i just have to figure out how he walks her out to her little toyota camry he bought it for her when she started collegesafe good mileage reasonable insurance its still in perfect shape because she maintains it the future oncologist knows to how to check the oil and change spark plugs and god help the mechanic who tries to pull a fast one on jill machianno now shes looking at him real seriously those sharp brown eyes can be remarkably warm sometimes not often but when they are what he asks she hesitates then says youve been a good father and im sorry if i sorries are for yesterday frank says all god gives us is today sweetie and youre a wonderful daughter and i couldnt be prouder of you they hug tightly for a minute then shes in her car and gone with her whole life in front of her frank thinks what that kid is going to do hes barely back in the van when the cell phone rings he glances at the screen hello patty the garbage disposal she says what about it its not disposing garbage she says and the sink is all filled up withgarbage did you call a plumber i calledyou ill stop by this afternoon what time i dont know patty he says i have things to do ill get there when i get there you have the key she says i already know that he thinks why does she have to remind me every time i have the key he says i just had lunch with jill its tuesday she says did she tell you about medical school patty asks she showed me the letter isnt it wonderful absolutely wonderful but how are we going to pay for it frank ill figure it out but i dont know ill figure it out frank says patty im going to lose you here he clicks off terrific he thinks now i have a cloggedup garbage disposal to add to my day ten to one patty was peeling potatoes in the sink and tried to wash them down the disposal and even though ive got at least four plumbers on the arm that i could send over there it has to be me or patty doesnt believe its fixed unless shes got me under the sink barking my knuckles on a wrench shes not happy he pulls off at a strip mall in solana beach goes into starbucks and buys a single cappuccino with skimmed milk and a cherry but no whipped cream puts a cover on it hops back into the van and drives over to donnas little boutique shes behind the counter skimmedmilk she asks yeah like every other day i bring you a skimmed milk frank says but today i bring you awhole milk youre a darling she smiles at him takes a sip and says thank you i didnt have time for lunch today time for what frank thinks because lunch for donna is a raw carrot slice a piece of lettuce and maybe a beet or something then again its why shes pushing fifty and looks more like midthirties and why she still has the vegas showgirl body long thin legs no waist and a balcony that while big isnt in danger of collapsing combine all that with her flame red hair green eyes a face to die for and a personality to match and its little wonder he brings her a cappuccino every time hes passing through and flowers once a week and something shiny on christmas and birthdays donna is a highmaintenance broad as she will readily admit frank understands thishigh quality and high maintenance go together donna takes good care of donna and she expects frank to do the same not that donna is a kept woman far from it she put away most of her money from her showgirl days moved to san diego and opened her pricey boutique not a lot of inventory but what she has is top quality and very stylish and attracts a loyal customer base mostly from san diego ladies who lunch you should move the shop to la jolla he told her you know the rents in la jolla she replied but most of your customers are in la jolla they can drive ten minutes she said shes right frank thinks and they do drive to her shop right now there are two ladies inspecting the racks and another one in a changing room and it doesnt hurt that donna wears her own merchandise and looks stunning if the store was empty frank thinks id like to take her into one of those fitting rooms and she reads the glint in his eye youre too busy and so am i she says i know but what are you doing later he feels a little twinge in his groin donna never fails to do that to him and theyve been togetherwhat eight years did you have your lunch with jill she asks he tells her about jills news thats wonderful donna says im so happy for her and she means it frank thinks even though she and jill have never as much as met frank has tried to bring the subject of donna up to his daughter but shes cut him off every time and changed the subject shes loyal to her mother frank thinks and he has to respect loyalty donna does too hey she said when all this came up if she were my kid and my ex wanted her to meet his new squeeze id want her to act the same way maybe frank thought although donna is more sophisticated than patty about matters romantic but it was nice of her to say it anyway shes a good kid donna says now shell do well yeah she will frank thinks gotta go he says me too donna says eyeing a customer coming out of the dressing room with an outfit that would be a disaster on her he nods and heads out the door as he hears her say honey withyour eyes let me show you rental properties frank thinks is a polite way of sayinghemorrhoids because they are an itching burning pain in the butt the only difference is that rental properties make money and hemorrhoids dont unless youre a proctologist in which case they do he thinks this as he drives around ocean beach checking on the half dozen condos houses and small apartment buildings he looks after as a silent partner in ob property management a limited partnership which is limited basically to frank and ozzie ransom whose name appears on all the paperwork and who takes care of the money except that after ozzie counts the money frank counts it all over again to make sure that ozzie isnt robbing him like a bartender its not that he doesnt trust ozzie its just that he doesnt want to put his partner in the way of temptation frank is similarly protective about the moral wellbeing of his partners in the linen business and the fish business he checks their books on a regular basis and he also checks them on an irregular basis as he calls it they never know when frank might drop in to check the accounts the receipts the inventory or the order sheets and every quarter frank has his accountant and attorney sherm the nickel simon a nickel here a nickel there go over all the books both to do his taxes and to make sure that even though the government is robbing him blind his partners arent frank is a fanatic about paying his taxes he calls it the capone factor al capone frank once said to herbie goldstein ran the biggest bootlegging operation in history bribed cops judges and politicians kidnapped tortured and murdered people in broad daylight on the streets of chicago and what did he go to jail for income tax evasion its as true now as it was then frank thinksyou can do aboutanything in this country as long as you kick up to the feds uncle wants his taste and as long as he gets it you can pretty much do what you want as long as you dont rub it in uncles nose frank is meticulous on both counts he pays his taxes and does nothing to draw attention to himself if the nickel comes up with a deduction thats even on the edge frank nixes it the last thing in the world he wants is an audit and frank doesnt even go near the businesses that attract the feds attentiongarbage construction bars porno no hes just frank the bait guy and his side endeavors are all totally legit he works his linen supply his fish his rental properties renters are a pain especially in a beach community where people tend to be somewhat transient anyway people come to the beach thinking its paradise and that theyre going to spend all day beachcombing and all night partying and they forget that somewhere in all that they still have to make a living they always think they can make the rent and then find that they cant so what they do is move in a roommate or five very often people they met at a bar who may or may not have the rent money on the first of the month not that frank doesnt counsel themhe does when hes taking their application he goes over first monthlast monthdamage deposit he gets a credit check a bank statement and references and more than half the time tells them that they just cant afford to live by the beach but the young people didnt come to californianot to live by the beach so they get some roommates and dive into an obligation they cant handle the result is that frank has a lot of turnaround and turnaround is the bane of rentalproperty management it means cleaning costs repairs advertising interviewing credit checks and running down references and employment on the other hand you do collect the last months rent and the damage deposit because the kids always damage the place usually as a result of a party frank has the whole enchilada on his plate this afternoon he has to show an apartment and interview a couple of young ladies who will be either waitresses or strippers or waitresses who will soon decide that theres more money in stripping then theres a kitchen upgrade he wants to check in on then he has to check on the cleaning of an apartment thats in transition and make sure that the carpet cleaners havesteamed the vomit stains left by the previous tenantsparty animals out of the carpet he shows the two young ladies the apartment theyre strippers all right and a nice semimarried lesbian couple so frank doesnt have to worry about their ability to pay the rent or about them having skanky guys from the strip clubs moving in they want the place and he takes their deposit on the spot the credit check will be a formality and hell give the club a quick call to confirm employment next he hustles over to the condo to check on the kitchen upgrade which looks pretty good with the new subzero refrigeratorfreezer and flatsurface stovetop after that he takes a walk around the outside to make sure the landscapers and gardeners are keeping the place up whereupon he notices that the ice plant needs a little trimming then he goes opportunity shopping scouting the neighborhood for rental properties that have good locations but look a little shabby or rundown maybe they need a coat of paint or the lawn has been neglected or a window screen is torn and hasnt been fixed he makes a note of their addresses and will track down their ownership because maybe the owners might need a manager or a change of managers or maybe theyre tired of the work that comes with ownership and might be looking to sell low he finds three or four possibilities then he heads over to ajax linen supply plops down in the old wooden rolling chair behind the steelcase desk and reviews the weeks orders the marine house order on kitchen towels is down percent and he makes a note to find out if ozzie has started selling some of his own towels along with the companys but the orders from the rest of the customers are the same or up so probably its something specific to the marine house and he makes a note to drop by there and find out whats what he makes a quick check of the days receipts then heads down to the docks to the sciorelli fish company offices where he reviews and compares the price of yellowfin tuna with that of his competitors and then decides that they can reduce the price by two cents a pound for their prime customers theyre buying at this price sciorelli argues theyre happy i want them tostay happy frank says i dont want them looking around for the better deal wellgive them the better deal keep their eyes from wandering he also tells sciorelli to buy as much of the mexican shrimp as he can getthe storm is going to keep the shrimp boats in for a week or so and thecamarones will be getting prime price things change and they dont he thinks as he gets in the van and heads back toward ob pier my daughter is going to be a doctor but were still selling tuna and there are other things that dont change he thinks as he drives to little italy right up the hill from the airportim still fixing things in the old house the old house is just thatan old house something thats getting more and more rare in downtown san diego even over here in little italy which used to be a neighborhood of old wellkept singlefamily homes but is now giving way to condo buildings office buildings trendy little hotels and parking structures to service the airport franks old house is a beautiful twostory victorian white with yellow trim he parks in the narrow driveway hops out of the van and finds the right key on his big chain he has the key in the lock when patty opens it from the inside as if she heard the van pulling up which maybe she did took you long enough she says as she lets him in she can still get to me frank thinks as he feels a pang of annoyance and something else too patty is still an attractive woman shes gotten a little matronly maybe around the hips but shes kept herself in good shape and those brown almondshaped eyes still have a way of well getting to him im here now he says kissing her on the cheek he walks past her into the kitchen where one half of the deep double sink looks like high tide in a third world harbor someplace its not working patty says coming in behind him i can see that frank says he sniffs the air are you making gnocchi uhhuh and did you peel all the potatoes and try to put them down the disposal frank asks as he rolls up his sleeve plunges his hand into the dirty water and feels around the drain potato peels are garbage patty says i tried to dispose of the garbage isnt that what a garbage disposal is supposed to do its garbage disposal frank says not garbage disposeall i mean you dont put tin cans down there do you ordo you you want some coffee she asks ill make some fresh sounds good thanks he goes to a hallway closet to get his tool chest they go through this routine every time shell make some fresh weak coffee in the krups maker that he bought her and that she refuses to learn how to run properly and hell take a polite sip while he works and then leave the rest in the cup frank has discovered that rituals like this are even more important to a peaceful relationship when youre divorced than when you were actually married but when he comes back down the hallway he hears the whir of a coffee grinder and when he reaches the kitchen theres a french press sitting on the stove beside a kettle of water on the boil he raises his eyebrows this is the way you like it now isnt it patty says jill says this is the way you like it thats how i make it yeah he doesnt say a word when she pours in the boiling water and presses the plunger down right away instead of waiting the requisite four minutes instead he keeps his mouth shut and crawls into the cabinet under the sink stretches out on his back and starts to work the crescent wrench on the disposal trap where the potato peels are no doubt trapped he hears her set the coffee cup on the floor by his knee thanks you could take a minute and have a cup of coffee she says actually i cant frank thinks he still has to get back to the bait shack for the sunset rush then go home shower shave and dress and go pick up donna but he doesnt say this to her either the subject of donna might cause patty to kick the coffee over on his leg accidentally or to try to flush an entire roll of paper towels down the upstairs toilet or maybe just to kick me in the balls while im vulnerable frank thinks i have to get to the bait shop he says but he slides out sits up and takes a sip of the coffee its actually not bad which surprises him he didnt marry patty for her cooking he married her more because she looked like that movie star ida lupino and still does and he was crazy about her and her being a good italian girl she wouldnt let him past second base without a ring on her finger so frank did the bulk of the cooking at home when they were married and they were already divorced when the termcontrol freak came into vogue now he says this is good surprise she says sitting on the floor next to him thats really something about jill isnt it ill find a way to pay for it im not nagging you about money she says looking a little hurt i just thought it would be nice to take a moment and share some parental pride you did a good job with that kid patty frank says we both did her eyes start to tear up and frank feels his own eyes get a little moist he knows what theyre both thinking aboutthat morning in the delivery room after the long hard labor when jill was finally born and it was a busy morning lots of babies so the doctors and nurses finished up with them and frank was so tired that he crawled onto the gurney with his wife and new baby and they all fell asleep together she gets up suddenly and says fix the damn thing youve got to get to the bait shop and im going to be late for yoga yoga he says getting back under the sink at our age she says its use it or lose it no look i think its good its mostly women she says so quickly that frank instantly gets that its mostly women but theres at least one man there he feels this little twinge of jealousy which is irrational and unfair he tells himself you have donna patty should have somebody in her life but still he doesnt like the thought he gets the trap off then reaches in and pulls out a wad of sodden potato peels he holds it up to her and says patty please cooked food not raw and not five pounds at a time okay okay she says but cant help adding they should make those things better though so he knows shes going to do it again or something just like it and he thinks next time let your boyfriend fix it with all that yoga he can get under the sink with no problem right he puts the trap back on tightens it down and crawls back out from under the sink you want to try the gnocchi she asks i thought you had yoga i could skip a class he thinks about it for a second then says no you want to keep up with that use it or lose it like they say you jerk he thinks when he sees her eyes get sharp and cold what a stupid thing to say and patty being patty she isnt going to let it slide you could use a little yoga yourself she says looking at his belly yeah maybe ill join your class thats all i need he washes his hands then gives her another quick kiss on the cheek which she tries to turn away from see you friday he says if im not here she tells him just leave the envelope in the drawer thanks for the coffee it was really good he gets back to the bait shack just in time for the dusk rush the kid abe can handle the slow midafternoon business but he starts to panic when the night fishermen begin to line up and demand their bait besides frank wants to be there to close out the register he helps the kid abe through the rush closes out locks the joint up and heads home to grab a quick shower and wash the fish smell off him he showers shaves changes into a suit with a dress shirt but open collar and takes the mercedes not the van out of the garage he has time to drop by three new restaurants before he goes to pick up donna his routine is the same at each place he has a tonic water at the bar and asks to see the manager or owner then he presents his card and says if youre happy with your linen service pardon the intrusion if youre not give me a call and ill tell you what i can do for you nine times out of ten he gets the call he picks donna up at her condo which is in a large complex overlooking the beach he parks in a visitors slot and rings the bell even though he has a key to her place in case of emergencies or if shes traveling and the plants need to be watered or if hes coming in late at night and doesnt want to get her out of bed she looks terrific she always does and not just for a woman in her forties but for a woman of any age shes wearing a basic black dress just short enough to show off her legs and cut just low enough to show a little cleavage back in the day frank thinks as he opens the car door for her we would have called her a classy broad course you dont talk like that anymore but thats what donna is always was a vegas showgirl who didnt hook or hustle didnt succumb to the booze or the dope just did her job saved her money and knew when it was time to call it a day took her savings moved to solana beach and opened her boutique makes herself a nice life they drive up the coast to freddies by the sea its an old san diego place on the beach in cardiff and sometimes like tonight the water laps right up against the restaurant the hostess knows frank and shows them to a table by a window with the storm front coming in the waves are already approaching the glass donna looks out at the weather well it will give me a chance to catch up on inventory anyway you could take a couple of days off you first its a constant joke between them and a constant hassle two businessminded people trying to find time to go off for even a few days vacation she doesnt really feel comfortable with anyone else running the boutique and frank is well frank they made it to kauai for five days three years ago but since then theyve managed one overnight in laguna and a weekend at big sur we need to stop and smell the roses he tells her now you could start by having two jobs instead of five she says still she has a sense that maybe one reason their relationship works so well is that theydont have too much time for each other the waiter comes back and they order a bottle of red and then in the interest of time go ahead and order their appetizers and entrees too he goes for the seafood soup and the shrimp scampi donna orders a green saladno dressingand the baked halibut with tomatoes the scampi is tempting she says but butter shows up on me the next day she excuses herself to go to the ladies and frank takes the opportunity to scamper into the kitchen for a hello call to the chef for the usual hows the fish been any complaints wasnt that yellowtail terrific last week hey just to let you know im going to have a good supply of shrimp next week storm or no storm when he gets to the kitchen john heaney isnt there frank has known him for years they used to surf a lot together back when john owned his own restaurant in ocean beach but john lost that place on amonday night football bet frank was there that tuesday morning at the gentlemens hour when john paddled out hungover and looking like death whats the matter with you frank asked him twenty large on the vikes to cover john replied they blew an extra point a goddamn fucking extra point you have the money no so byebye restaurant john went to work out at the viejas casino which was kind of like an alcoholic going to work at the jack daniels distillery every two weeks hed pull a paycheck in the red and finally the casino canned him john bounced from job to job until frank got him the gig at freddies what are you going to do frank thinks a buddy is a buddy john makes good money at freddies but good money is never good enough for a degenerate gambler last time frank heard john was moonlighting as the lateshift manager at hunnybears wheres johnny he asks the souschef who nods his head toward the back door frank understands the chef is out back by the dumpster grabbing a smoke and maybe a quick drink you go to any dumpster in back of any restaurant youre going to find a pile of butts and maybe a few of those little airline bottles of booze that the staff is too lazy to toss into the garbage johns sucking at a ciggy and staring at the ground like it has an answer for something his tall skinny frame bent over like one of those cheap sculptures made out of clotheshanger wire hows it going johnny frank asks john looks up startled like hes surprised to see frank standing there jesus frank you scared me johnnys got to bewhat mid to late fifties maybe he looks older whats wrong frank asks john shakes his head world of shit right now frank this gsting business frank asks is hunnybears involved in that john holds his hand palm down up under his chin what if they close the place i need the fuckin money frank itll blow over frank says this stuff always does john shakes his head i dunno youll always work john frank says you want me to drop a word somewhere it would be easy to hook john up with a second job at some good restaurant hes a good cook and besides hes a popular guy everybody likes him thanks frank not right now you let me know thanks frank makes it back to the table just before donna and blesses the fact that theres always a line at the ladies and that women take a lot longer to get all that complicated gear off and on again hows the chef donna asks as he gets up and holds the chair out for her frank sits back down and shrugs with a look of hurt innocence incorrigible donna says the rain really starts coming down while theyre having dessert well franks having dessertcheesecake and an espressoand donnas having a black coffee the rain starts with slow fat plops against the window then picks up and its only a minute or so before the wind starts to drive sheets of rain against the glass most people in the restaurant cease their conversations to watch and listen it doesnt rain that often in san diegoless than usual in fact the past few yearsand it rarely rains hard like this its the true beginning of winter the short monsoon season in this mediterranean climate and the people just sit back and gaze at it frank watches the whitecaps picking up its going to be something tomorrow donnas condo doesnt have an ocean view her place is on the back side of the complex away from the beach so she got it for about percent less doesnt matter to frankwhen he goes to donnas place all he wants to look at is donna their lovemaking has a ritual donna isnt one of those offwiththeclothesandintobed women even though they both know thats where theyre headed so tonight like most nights he comes over they go into her living room and she puts some sinatra on the stereo then she goes and gets two snifters of brandy and they sit on the sofa and neck frank thinks he could live in the crook of donnas neck and never leave its long and elegant and the perfume she dots there makes his head whirl he spends a long time kissing her neck and nuzzling her red hair and then he moves down to her shoulder and after some time there he eases the strap of her dress off her shoulder and down her arm she usually wears a black brassiere which drives him crazy he kisses the tops of her breasts while his hand makes the long slow trip up her leg then kisses her lips and hears her purr into his mouth then she gets up and takes him by the hand and leads him into her bedroom and says im going to get comfortable and disappears into her bathroom leaving him lying fully dressed on her bed while he waits to see what shes going to wear donna has great lingerie she gets it wholesale from her suppliers so she indulges herself well she indulgesme frank thinks as he leans over to take off his shoes and then loosens his tie once just once he took all his clothes off and was in bed naked when she came out and she asked and what areyou assuming and asked him to leave the wait is interminable and he enjoys every second of it he knows shes dressing carefully to please him freshening her makeup putting on perfume brushing her hair the door opens she shuts off the bathroom light and comes out she never fails to knock him out tonight shes wearing a sheer emerald green peignoir over a black garter belt and hose and has high freaking heels on she turns around slowly to let him enjoy every angle of her and then he gets up and takes her in his arms he knows that now she wants him to take over he knows you dont have sex with donna you make love to herslowly carefully finding each little pleasure spot on her amazing body and lingering there and shes a dancershe wants it to be a dance so she glides over him with a dancers grace and eroticism using her breasts her hands her mouth her hair on him undressing him and making him hard then he lays her down on the bed and moves down her long frame and pushes up the peignoir and shes dotted perfume on her thighs but she doesnt need any perfume there frank thinks he takes his time theres no hurry and his own need can wait wants to wait because it will be all the better for the waiting its like the ocean he thinks later like a wave coming in and then receding again and again and then building like an ocean swell thick and heavy and picking up speed he likes to look at her face when hes making love to her likes to see her green eyes brighten and the smile on her elegant lips and tonight hear the sound of the rain pelting the window glass they lie there for a long time afterward listening to the rain that was beautiful he says always you okay frank the working guy always checking his work oh yeah she says you that was me screaming he says hes lying there politely considerately but she knows that hes already restless its fine with her shes not that much of a cuddler and anyway morning comes early and she sleeps better alone so she gives the standard cue im going to wash up a little which means that he can get dressed while shes in the bathroom and when she comes out they can go through the comfortable ritual oh are you heading out yeah i think so busy day tomorrow you can stay if you want and hell pretend to consider it then say nah id better get home and then theyll have a warm kiss and hell say i love you i love you too and then hell be gone to go home grab a little sleep and start the whole thing over again its the routine except tonight turns out different tonight he drives home and theres a car in the alley a car he doesnt know frank knows the neighbors knows all their vehicles none of them owns a hummer and even through the nowdriving rain he can see there are two guys sitting in the front seat they arent pros he knows that straight off pros would never use a vehicle as conspicuous as a hummer and they arent cops because even the feds dont have the budget for a vehicle like that and third professionals would know that i love life and because i love life i havent in thirty years pulled into my house at night without driving around the block first especially when my garage entrance is in an alley where i could get cut off so if these guys were pros they wouldnt be sitting in the alley theyd be at least half a block down wait for me to pull into the alley and then come in they spotted him though as he drove by or they think they did that was him travis says bull fucking shit j answers how can you tell no that was him junior travis says that was frankie fucking machine a motherfucking legend parking isnt easy in ocean beach so it takes frank about ten minutes to find a spot on the street three blocks away he pulls in reaches under the seat and finds his s ampw puts it in the pocket of his raincoat pulls his hood up and gets out of the car walks another block out of his way so that hell hit the alley from the east and not from the west where they might be expecting him he comes around to the alley and the hummer is still there even over the rain he can hear the bass vibrating so the dumb mooks are in there listening to rap music which is going to make it easier he walks up the alley his feet sloshing in the puddles ruining the shine on his shoes and hes careful to stay dead center with the back of the hummer so hes less likely to get spotted in either rearview mirror as he gets closer he can smell the reefer so now he knows hes dealing with complete doofskids probably drug dealerssitting in their cool sled getting high and listening to tunes hes not even sure they hear him when he opens the back door slides in sticks a gun in the back of the drivers head and pulls the hammer back i told you it was him travis says frankie j says dont you recognize me yeah frank maybe recognizes him although its been years the kidmaybe in his midtwentieshas short black hair gelled into spikes some sort of stud stuck through his bottom lip and earrings through the tops of his ears hes decked out in surfer clothesa longsleeve billabong shirt under a rusty fleece and workout pants mouse junior frank asks the other one chuckles then quickly shuts up mouse junior doesnt like being called mouse junior he prefers j which is what he tells frank now the other one is also dressed like a clown hes got the gel thing going too and a wispy goatee and hes wearing one of those surfers beanies on his head which frank resents because frank wears one to keep his head warm when hes come out of the cold water after actuallysurfing and not to look pseudohip and both of them are wearing sunglasses which is maybe why they couldnt see a fullgrown man coming up behind them he doesnt tell them this though and he doesnt put the gun down even though holding a gun to the son of a boss is a major violation of protocol thats okay frank thinks he doesnt wantbut he respected protocol carved on his headstone who are you he asks the other one my name is travis the other says travis renaldi this is what its come to frank thinks italian parents giving their kids yuppie names like travis its an honor to meet you mr machianno travis says frankie machine shut up frank says i dont know what youre talking about yeah shut the fuck up mouse junior says frankie could you put that gun down now could we go inside maybe you could offer us a beer or a cup of coffee or something this is a social call frank asks you waiting in the alley in the middle of the night we figured wed wait until you were done with your booty call frankie mouse junior says franks not sure he knows what a booty call is but he can figure it out from the nasty tone of mouse juniors voice he hasnt seen junior in probably eight years and the kid was a spoiled teenage punkthen he hasnt matured any frank would like to give him a hard cuff in the ear for the booty call remark but there are limits to what you can do to a bosss kid even a boss as limp as mouse senior mouse seniorpeter martiniis boss of whats left of the la family which also includes whats left of the san diego crew peter got the nickname mouse after la police chief daryl gates famously referred to the west coast mob as the mickey mouse mafia and the name stuck he became mouse senior after he had his son and named him peter but the rules are the rules you cant lay hands on a bosss kid and you cant refuse him hospitality frank doesnt like it though as he leads them into his place for one thing he doesnt like letting them get the lay of the land in case they come back later to try something second its not a good idea in case they ever flip and take the witness stand it will be harder for him to deny that a meeting ever happened if they can accurately describe what the inside of his house looked like on the other hand he knows his house isnt wired he pats them both down the second they come in no offense he says hey these days mouse junior says no kidding these days frank thinks this is probably what this little sitdown is about anywaymouse senior sending mouse junior down to get reassurance that frank is still on the reservation because mouse senior hasnt been named on the goldstein hit even though he was the one who ordered it done and frank knows it like mouse senior is so careful frank thinks for three years three years back in the late eighties bobby the beast zitello was wearing a wire while mouse senior thought the sun shone out of his ass bobbys greatest hits album went platinum and put half the family in the joint for fifteen years now mouse senior is out and he doesnt want to go back in but the goldstein thing might put them all in the can for good poor herbie got clipped back in and a couple of lowlevel mokes confessed to it but theres no statute of limitations on murder and the goldstein killing has come back like a ghost the feds have been all over it lately as part of operation button down their attempt to put the last nail in mouse seniors coffin what probably happened is the two mooks found out they didnt like prison so much and decided to trade up for all frank knows mouse senior might be under a sealed indictment and be looking to make some trades of his own so frank pats mouse junior down pretty thoroughly he doesnt find any wires or mikes or guns that would be the other possibilitymouse senior wanting to make absolutelycertain that i dont tell the feds who ordered up the goldstein thing but mouse would have sent one of the few soldiers he has left even mouse wouldnt send his own kid on a mission to try to hit frankie machine you want your son to buryyou you want coffee or beer frank asks taking off his raincoat he keeps the pistol in his hand beer if you got it mouse junior says i have it frank says good he thinks it saves me the trouble of brewing up a pot he goes into the kitchen grabs two dos equis then changes his mind and takes two of the cheaper coronas instead he comes back out hands them the beers says use coasters the two kids sit on his sofa like bad students in the principals office frank sits down in his chair with his pistol on his lap and kicks off his wet shoes thats all i need he thinks a cold they go through the preliminaries hows your father hows your uncle give them my regards what brings you boys to san diego dad suggested it mouse junior says he said i should come talk to you about what i got a problem mouse junior says you got more than one problem frank thinks youre stupid youre lazy youre uneducated and youre careless what did the kid do a year and a half of junior college before he dropped out to help dad with the business we mouse junior begins whos we frank asks me and travis mouse junior explains we have a sweet little porno operation running golden productions were getting a piece of half the distribution that comes out of the valley frank doubts it you can read the papers and know the san fernando valley produces billions in porn every year and these kids dont look like billionaires maybe maybe they have the arm on a few operations but thats about it still its lucrative how many times did mike pella try to get me to invest in the porn business and how many times did i refuse for one thing it used to be all mobbed up back when it was illegal two as i told him i have adaughter mike but since porn went mainstream most of the money in it is strictly legit you set up shop or you invest like you would with any other business so what bootlegs mouse junior explains we invest in the studio so we can get a good master we distribute a bunch of those on the legit market but for every one we sell legally we bootleg three so they sell one of the companys videos and three of their own frank thinks basically they cheat their own partners its even easier with dvds travis explains you can press them out like pancakes the asians cant buy enough of blondes with big tits fucking and sucking watch your mouth frank says this is my home travis turns red he forgot what j had warned him that frankie machine doesnt like profanity sorry frank talks to mouse junior so whats your problem detroit can you be a little more specific frank asks some guys from detroit mouse junior says friends of ours have done a little porn out here and okay maybe they introduced us to some people now they think theyre owed they are frank says he knows the rules besides detroitaka the combinationhas had a piece of san diego forever since back in the forties when paul moretti and sal tomenelli came out and opened a bunch of bars restaurants and strip clubs downtown back in the sixties paul and tony ran a lot of heroin through those joints but after tomenelli was murdered they settled into loansharking gambling strip clubs porn and running whores anyway they carved out their piece because of morettis prestige his soninlaw joe migliore got a pass in san diego never having to kick up or even answer to la it was like detroit had its own separate little colony in the gaslamp district they still dojoes kid teddy still has callahans down in the lamp and runs his other businesses from the back room if detroit set you up with these connections frank tells mouse junior youdo owe them not sixty percent mouse junior whines we do all the workmake the videos set up the warehouses do the bootlegs get to the asian markets now this guy wants a majority share i dontthink so whos the guy vince vena mouse junior tells him youre sideways with vince vena frank asks you do have a problem kid vince vena is a heavy guy word is he just made it on the ruling council of the combination no wonder mouse junior is scared the la family was never that strongit used to bow to new york then chicago and now theres a power vacuum as the east coast families are getting hammered by old age attrition and the rico statutes so now detroit is positioning itself to move in on whats left of the west coast and in one of the few profit centers left and it makes sense to start with mouses kid because if you pull that off youre proving a point mouse senior is so weakened by the goldstein indictments he doesnt have the strength to protect his own son if vena succeeds in extorting sixty points out of mouse junior the la family might just as well give up the ghost entirely which is fine with me frank thinks new york chicago detroit its all the same its all going the way of the dinosaur anyway doesnt matter who shuts the lights outits still dark why are you coming to me frank asks even though he knows the answer because youre frankie machine mouse junior says what doesthat mean what it means mouse junior explains is that theyve calendared a sitdown with vena to hammer out a deal do it frank says if vena says sixty hell take forty maybe even thirtyfive you give him a cut of the pie then you just go out and make a bigger pie thats all theres enough for everybody mouse junior shakes his head if we dont stop it here you stop it here frank says you start a war with detroit and let me tell you what your old man already knows kid you dont have the troops but mouse juniors too young to know that too much testosterone bouncing around in there mouse junior says im not rolling over for this guy so dont frank says its not my problem im retired fifty k mouse junior says thatis high frank thinks there must be more money in this porn thing than i thought it shows they have resources but it also shows how weak they are you dont normally pay cash to have this kind of thing doneyou give it to one of your soldiers in exchange for future business considerations or maybe getting him straightened out but la doesnt have many soldiers left not good ones anyway guys who could do this kind of work fifty k is a lot of money invested well it would pay a lot of tuition im going to take a pass on this one frank says dad said you might turn it down mouse junior says your father is a wise man actually hes a jackass but what the hell he said to tell you mouse junior continues that he would consider this a personal favor a matter of loyalty meaning what franks going to make him say it with everything thats happening in vegas mouse junior says his voice quivering a little scared the goldstein stuffdad would like to know that youre you know on the team so there it is frank thinks its two birds with one stone mouse senior gets his detroit problem taken care of and he gets an insurance policy on my silence over goldstein because i cant go to the feds with a fresh hit on my hands and if i dont do the vena job i make myself suspect as a possible rat so either i take vena out or i put myself in the bullseye but if mouse senior doesnt have the soldiers to take vince himself why does he think he has the resources to make a run atme nobody in the mickey mouse club has either the skills or the stones who could he send hed go outside the family new york maybe florida maybe even the mexicans he could get it done its a problem tell you what frank says ill get vena off your back one way or the other set up a meeting with him ill come along if he sees me there hell be more reasonable if not he lets it hang there the rest is obvious travis likes the idea anyway thatll work j he says if vena sees that we have frankie freakingmachine on our team hell shit his pants no he wont frank says but he will negotiate more reasonable points he turns to mouse junior you dont want a war if you can help it kid ive seen war peace is better something youll learn when you get a little older frank thinks if you dont get yourself killed first young guys they always want to prove how tough they are its a testosterone thing older guys see the beauty in compromise and save the testosterone for better things mouse junior thinks it over judging by the expression on his face its apparently a grueling process then he asks what about the fifty k the fifty is for solving your problem frank says either way half now mouse junior says half when the job is done frank shakes his head all of it up front thats unprecedented thisis unprecedented them approaching him directly that is the protocol is that they should have gone through mike pella capo of whats left of san diego whod collect a referral fee it would be good to talk to mike about this vena thing get his take mike pella is an oldschool mafioso among the last of a dying breed he and frank have been tight since forever mikes been his friend his confidant his partner his captain mike would be able to give him the lay of the land steer him clear of the land mines but mike with his instinct for survival has been in the wind since the goldstein thing came back up good place for you to be mike stay there twothirds onethird mouse junior says im notnegotiating with you kid frank says i gave you the conditions under which ill work if its worth it to you fine if not its also fine the moneys in the hummer mouse junior sends travis out to get it he brings back a briefcase containing fifty k in used bills nonsequential dadsaid youd want it all up front mouse junior says smiling then why were you busting chops frank asks because youre a smarmy wiseass punk frank thinks trying to prove how smart and tough you are and youre neither if you were smart you wouldnt have gotten yourself into this predicament if you were tough youd take care of it yourself its just business mouse junior says nothing personal frank wishes he had a dime for every time hes heard that line the wise guys all heard it in the firstgodfather and liked it now they all use it same with the termgodfather for that matteruntil the movie came out frank never heard the word in that context the boss was just the boss those were good movies and allwell two of them werebut they had nothing to do with the mob not the mob that frank knows anyway maybe its just a west coast thing he thinks we never went in for all that heavy sicilian stuff or maybe its just too warm out here for all those hats and overcoats mr machine travis is saying frank shoots him a dirty look mr machianno i meant travis says theres one other thing whats that the sitdown is tonight mouse junior says tonight frank asks its already after midnight he has to be up in three hours and fortyfive minutes tonight frank sighs its a lot of work being me mouse junior hands him a cell phone its on speed dial he says pressing the button for him vena doesnt answer until the fifth ring hello he sounds like the phone woke him up vince frank machianno here theres a long pause which is what frank expected vinces mind has to be whirling he figures wondering why frankie machine is on the phone how he got this number and what he wants frankie long time too long frank says not meaning it if he never talked to vince vena again hed be very happy he knows vince from the old days back in the eighties in vegas when it was open territory and everybodys playground vince was a fixture at the stardust practically furniture when he wasnt at the blackjack table he was out catching the comedians shows and then hed annoy everyone by constantly reciting their routines vince liked to think he did a pretty good dangerfield which he didnt although unfortunately that never stopped him from doing it poor rodney frank thinks now that was a truly funny man hey vince frank says this thing with mouse juwith petes kid j mouse junior prompts vinces voice sounds pissed off what is it mousedick junior been whining to you he reached out frank chooses these words deliberately because they have a very specific meaning im involved now youre dealing with me vince hears it i didnt know you was in the dvd business frank if i did idve come to you in the first place no disrespect huh im not in the business vince its just that well the bosss kid reaches out to me what am i going to do the boss vince laughs then sings whos the leader of the club thats made for you and me mickey mouse anyway frank says im going to come along for the sitdown you dont mind or even if you do these kids frank continues they dont know whats righthe casts a pointed glance at the two doofs sitting across from him who look down at the floorbut you and me im sure we can get it straightened out hes sure they can what hell do is hell take ten k of the fifty along as a gesture then negotiate vince down to fifteen points on the rest of the deal thats a fair offer one that vince should accept if not mouse senior is in a position to bitch to detroit about vena get him in line if none of that works frank doesnt want to even think about that itll work hey whatevers right frankie vince is saying which means hes going to be reasonable frank thinks he says see you in a little bit vince give it a half hour vince says me and this chick are making some waves you know what i mean i dont know what you mean frank says and who says chick anymore didnt mousedick junior tell you vince says im on a boat here in san diego a boat a cabin cruiser vince says im renting it itswinter vince a friend of ours cut me a deal classic wise guy frank thinks long as they think theyre getting a deal theyll go for it so you got a cheap shakedown artist on a boat he cant use in the rain classic he knows whats coming next vince doesnt disappoint him so if the boat is rockin vince says dont come knockin finish your beers frank says then lets go get this straightened out he goes into the kitchen opens a drawer and takes out an envelope then he comes back into the living room counts ten thousand out from the fifty puts it in the envelope and slides it into his jacket pocket what are you doing mouse junior asks didnt your parents teach you any manners frank asks you never go to a persons emptyhanded in the same spirit he checks the load on his and slips it in the waistband of his slacks underneath the back of his coat he looks at the boys are you carrying sure absolutely leave the hardware in the car frank says when they start to object he says something goes southwhich i dont expect but it mightthe last thing i want is one of you blowing my brains out by accident if the stuff hits the fan you hit the deck and stay there until it gets real quiet and you hear me telling you to get up you dont hear me telling you to get up its because youre dead and then it doesnt make any difference anyway and you letme do the talking capisce got it absolutely and quit saying absolutely frank tells travis it annoys me abso well take your car frank says to mouse junior no sense in burning upmy gas he thinks the prices at the pump these days even in the rain frank loves the view of san diego from the harbor the lights from the tall downtown buildings reflect red and green on the water and on the horizon the coronado bay bridges lights shine in the night sky like the diamonds of a necklace on an elegant womans neck the rain just makes everything sparkle all the more he loves this city always has they have no trouble finding a parking spot or the slip where venas cabin cruiser is docked walking down the floating dock frank reminds them remember leave everything to me but we could help mouse junior says if anything goes down travis clarifies dont help me frank says where do they learn to talk like this the movies i guess or television anyway the only thing thats going to go down is venas percentage which will drop an automatic ten points just by virtue of me being there he knows what venas move will betry to get frank alone and tell him that if he makes mouse junior give up forty points hell cut frank in for five and ill turn the offer down because its a bosss kid which vince will understand then well get down to the realhondeling another word herbie taught me god rest he finds the boat thebecky lynn the name tells the storytwo guys finally get their wives permission to buy a boat together and name it after both wives so they dont get jealous not of each other of the boat which never works frank thinks women and boats mix like women and boats he steps down off the dock onto the afterdeck the cabin is all shut up against the rain but the lights are on and frank can hear music inside ahoy he yells because he cant resist it the door opens and vince venas ugly face pops out he never was a goodlooking guy vince got this thin face with old acne scars and his eyes are a little too close together now he grabs his shirt collar gives it a tug and says a la rodney my wife and i were very happy for twenty years then we met frank thinks then we met vince says and laughs come in out of the rain frank prove everyone wrong what they say about you vince goes back into the cabin and leaves the door open frank steps in the door shuts and the garrote is around his neck and cutting into his throat before he can get his hands up which is a good thing because your instinct is to try to get between the wire and your throat and thats actually the last thing you should doyou only end up getting your fingers sliced along with your windpipe the guy is huge frank can feel his height and his bulk and he knows hes not going to outmuscle him so he reaches behind him and jams his fingers into his attackers eyes which doesnt make the guy let go but does make him suck his breath in and frank uses that second to squat low grab the mans wrist pivot and hiproll the guy to the deck his wouldbe strangler lands with a crash on the little dining table and frank continues his roll getting his body under the table just as vince pulls a pistol and crouches to shoot him franks gun slides out in one easy move all he can see are venas legs so he aims at a point above them and fires twice then sees vinces legs stagger back and collapse against the bulkhead and hears vince yell oh fuck oh fuck frank closes his eyes and shoots through the bottom of the table three times splinters of plywood hit his face and then everything is quiet frank opens his eyes and sees blood dripping down he stays under the table in case theres a third guy he can hear running on the dock two pairs of feet beating it out of there and he figures its mouse junior and travis absolutely frank makes himself wait for thirty seconds before he crawls out from under the table the wouldbe strangler is dead two bullet holes and a bunch of plywood splinters in his face and the guy is enormousfour bills easy frank checks out whats left of the guys face he recognizes him from someplace but cant quite remember where vince is still breathing sitting with his back against the bulkhead his hands trying to hold his guts in frank squats down beside him vince who sent you vinces eyes stare out into space frank has seen the look beforevince isnt going to make it whether hes looking at the white light or whatever hes already checked out ofthis motel and whatever sound hes hearing now it isnt franks voice frank gives it one more try though vince whosent you nothing frank puts the pistol barrel against vinces heart and pulls the trigger then he sits down to catch his breath surprised and pissed off that his chest is pounding he makes himself take a few long deep breaths to slow his heart rate it takes a minute youre not getting any younger he thinks and you almost werent getting anyolder either and dont deserve to either being so stupid and careless letting a punk kid like mouse junior set you up and thats what he did how do the kids say it these days he played you worked on your ego and set you up frank gets up and takes a long look at the dead guy on the table the wire garrote is still clutched in his hands oldschool frank thinks using a wire but they probably didnt want to risk the noise of a gun unless they had to use a silencer then unless the garrote was meant to make it slow and painful in which case this hit waspersonal but who has that kind of beef with me he wonders get real he tells himself its a long list frank starts the engine then he goes back out and unmoors the boat from its slip one piece of luck is that the two flanking boats are both empty battened down for the winter he goes back in lets the engines warm up then backs the boat out of the slip he steers it into the channel and heads out to sea not a good night to be out on the open ocean too much swell and chop and the roll coming out of the storm keeps working the boat back toward the coast frank hacks it out about ten miles into the ocean anyway he fished these waters hundreds of times as a kid he knows every current and channel and he knows just where he wants to dump the bodies so if they ever come to shore itll be in mexico thefederales will figure its a dope deal gone bad and put about two minutes work into solving the case still its a bitch out here tonight with the wind and rain and the roll and franks biggest fear is that hell run into a coast guard vessel that will stop him and want to know what kind of jackass is taking a boat out on a night like this ill just play stupid frank thinks which shouldnt be hard given my track record tonight his neck hurts from the wire but pain is good he figures seeing as how by all rights he shouldnt be feeling anything it had to be mouse senior he thinks making sure i dont flip on the goldstein hit dont think about that now he tells himself take care of one thing at a time he finds the current hes looking for tosses out an anchor and shuts the running lights out its a lot of work dragging two bodies over the side hence the expressiondead weight he thinks as he gets his arms under vinces and hefts him to the afterdeck fortunately its a sportfishing boat with a stepdown aft so he doesnt have to lift him over the rail just drag him to the aft and kick him off the other guy is a bigger problem literally and it takes frank a good ten minutes to drag him out onto the deck then get down behind him and roll the body into the water now what frank thinks you have to go off the radar for a while until you can find out who wants you dead and why and what to do about it you cant just take the bloodsoaked boat back to the slip and walk away because you dont know who might be waiting for you back there thebest option would be the cops and thats no option at all no ones going to believe that frankie machine gunned down two mob guys in selfdefense so he goes back into the cabin and looks around he gets lucky in a storage locker where he finds scuba gear tanks and underneath that a piece of gold in the form of a wet suit that he can fit into he undresses wriggles into the wet suit which is very tight but better tight than loose frank thinks then he shoves his clothes a towel the envelope with the ten k and vinces gun into a wet bag he wipes his own gun down then reluctantly throws it over the side hell miss the but its a murder weapon at least in the jaundiced eye of the law frank steers toward shore running the boat in about five hundred yards off the coast then stops the engine he cranks the wheel out again toward the open ocean clamps a wheel lock onto it starts the engine again ties the wet bag to his ankle and goes over the side the water is cold even with the wet suit on and a definite shock to his uncovered head five hundred yards is a long swim in these conditions and his plan is to start slowly and then taper off he knows right where he is though and gets himself into a current that will pull him to the tip of ocean beach down by rockslide the trick is going to be getting through the break without getting slammed against the rocks so he swims slowly and lets the current do the work for him franks a strong swimmer more than comfortable in the ocean even in frigid water at night he stays in the current aims himself toward the lights of shore and only starts swimming hard when he hears the waves breaking its going to be tough and he cant let himself be pulled south of rockslide because the next stop is mexico so he pulls himself out of the current puts his head down and starts doing a hard australian crawl straight into the break he feels a wave lift him and push him toward shore which is a good thing but then it starts to pick up speed and take him right toward the rocks and theres nothing he can do about it except hope his luck holds out it does the wave breaks a good twenty yards from the rocks and he manages to get to his feet and wade the rest of the way in he gets down on all fours and crawls across the slippery rocks onto shore the air feels colder than the water what with the wind and the rain and he hurriedly wriggles out of the wet suit dries off and gets back into his clothes then he stuffs the wet suit into the bag and starts walking but not home whoever tried to clip him is going to try again going tohave to try again and his only advantage is mouse junior and his little friend running back and saying inevitably frankie machine sleeps with the fishes good that will buy me a little time a few hours max because when they dont get the phone call from vena that its done theyre going to start wondering if they have any brainsand you have to stop underestimating themtheyre going to assume the worst still it gives me a narrow window of time to go off the radar every prudent professional hit man has a spider hole and frank is nothing if not prudent his is a vacant apartment on narragansett street a little efficiency unit on the second floor of a house thats a tenminute walk away it has a separate entrance up a back stairway he bought it twenty years ago when property was still pretty cheap put it up for rent and never rented it only went there every few months to check up on it and then only stayed a few minutes after making sure that he wasnt being followed no one else knows about the existence of this placenot patty not donna not jill not even mike pella he walks there and lets himself in first thing he does is take a shower he stands under the spray for a long time shivering at first until the hot water finally warms him up it takes a while because hes chilled to the bone he reluctantly gets out vigorously rubs himself dry then puts on a heavy terrycloth robe and walks back into the bedroomliving roomkitchen where he opens up the bottom drawer of a dresser and takes out a heavy sweatshirt and sweatpants and puts them on then he goes into the closet and opens up a little safe bolted to the floor behind some coats and jackets inside the safe is his parachute packan arizona drivers license an american express gold card and a visa gold card all under the name jerry sabellico every month or so he makes a phone purchase with cards to keep them current and pays them with checks from his sabellico account theres also ten thousand in cash in used mixed bills and a new clean smith amp wesson with extra ammunition he reaches up to a trapdoor that opens to an attic crawl space he feels around and quickly finds what hes looking for a case that holds a beretta sl twelvegauge pump shotgun with the barrel sawed off to fourteen inches now what you need is sleep he thinks a tired body and a fatiguefoggy head will get you killed you need to think and act sharp so the next thing is to get in bed and sleep its a matter of will turning off the paranoia thinking rationally and knowing that youre safe here an amateur would lie awake all night starting at every noise making up sounds when there arent any hes hunted enough guys to know that their own heads can be their worst enemies they start seeing things that arent there then worse not seeing things that are they worry and worry and chew on their own insides until when you do track them down theyre almost grateful by this time theyve been killed so many times in their minds that the real thing is a relief so he gets into bed closes his eyes and is asleep in about ten seconds it isnt hardhes exhausted he sleeps for eleven full hours and wakes up feeling rested although his arms are a little sore from the long swim he makes himself some coffeejust cheap grind from an automatic makerand breakfasts on a couple of granola bars he stored away like a mormon the apartment has one small window facing west and rain is pounding on the glass frank sits at the small cheap table and starts to work on the problem who wants me dead mike where are you you could tell me whats going on but mike isnt aroundmaybe mike is dead too because he and frank did a lot of work together together they put a lot of guys in the dirt frank starts at the beginning his first hit was on a guy who was already dead that was the weird thing about it well the whole thing was weird frank thinks now looking at the rain coming down outside the whole thing with momos wife marie anselmo was a hot little number thats what we would have called her back in frank thinks nowadays the kids have shortened it to just hottie but the idea is the same marie anselmo was hot and she was little petite but with a nice rack tightly packed in that blouse and a pair of shapely legs that led franks nineteenyearold eyes up to an ass that would give him an instant woody not thatthat was so tough frank remembers when you were nineteen anything would get you hard i used to get a chubby riding to school in the morning he once told donna just bouncing in the car for two years i had an affair with a buick yeah but marie anselmo was no buick she was pure thunderbird with that body and those dark eyes and the beestung lips and that voice that smoky comedome voice that would drive frank up the wall even if she was just telling him where to turn which was mostly all marie ever said to frank whose job it was in those days to drive her around in momos car momo being too busy collecting the money he had out on the street or running his gambling wire to take his wife grocery shopping or to the hairdressers or the dentists or wherever marie did not like to stay home im not one of your standard guinea wives she said to frank one day after hed been chauffeuring her for a couple of months whos going to stay home crank out babies and make the pasta i like to get out frank didnt answer for one thing he had a hardon that could cut stone so most of the blood in his body wasnt concentrated in the part responsible for speech and two he wanted tokeep the blood in his body which could be an issue if he started to discuss anything of a personal nature with a made mans wife that was not something that was done even in the more than casual mob culture of san diego where there was barely a mob at all instead he said are we going to ralphs mrs a he knew they were although marie wasnt dressed like most women dress when they are going to the supermarket that day marie had on a tight dress with the top three buttons undone and black stockings and a string of pearls around her neck that drew your eye right to her cleavage like her cleavage couldnt have done that all on its own frank thought as he sneaked a glance and wondered if she was wearing a black bra under that dress when he pulled into a parking spot in ralphs lot and stopped the car her skirt rode up as she got out and he got a peek at those white thighs against the black hose she pulled her skirt down and smiled at him watch for me she ordered its going to be a long struggle with patty tonight in the ocean beach parking lot thats for sure he thought hed been dating patty almost a year by then and the most he could get was a little tit on the outside of her blouse if he pretended it was an accidental brush patty had a set on her too but her bra was built like a fort and as for goingdown stairs forget about it it wasnt going to happen patty was a good italian girl a good catholic so shed steam up the windows french kissing with him because theyd been going steady a year but that was it even though she said shed like to give him the hand job hed been begging for i got blue balls he told her they hurt when were engaged she told him ill jerk you off but its going to be a long night tonight frank thought as he watched mrs as ass switch across the parking lot how a guy as ugly as momo anselmo had nailedthat was a question for the ages momo was this skinny kind of hunchedover guy with a face like a hound so marie sure as hell hadnt fallen for his looks and it couldnt have been the moneymomo did well but he didnt dogreat he had a nice little house and all and the required wiseguy cadillac and enough cash to flash around but momo wasnt no johnny roselli or even jimmy forliano momo was a big deal in san diego but everyone knew that san diego was really run from la and momo had to kick up heavy to jack drina even though the word was that the la boss was dying of cancer but frank liked momo a lot which is why he felt a little bad lusting after the mans wife momo was giving him his shot letting him break in even if it was as an errand boy but thats how most guys broke in so frank didnt mind going out for the coffee and doughnuts or the cigarettes or washing momos caddy or even driving his wife to the supermarket at least he didnt have to go in with her and push the cart aroundeven an apprentice wise guy wasnt expected to do thatso he got to hang out and wait in the car and listen to the radio even though momo bitched that it ran down the battery momo didnt have to know about it which beat the hell out of busting his ass working on the tuna boats which was what he would have been doing if momo hadnt given him a shot that was what franks old man did and whathis old man had done and whathis old man had done the italians had come to san diego and taken over the tunafishing business from the chinese and that was what most of them still did and what frank had done from the time he was big enough to shovel bait out there on a tuna boat before the sun came up cold and wet assdeep in a smelly bait pit or worse cleaning out the scuppers when he got bigger hed graduated to working the net and then when his old man figured he could wield a knife without cutting his own hand off hed gotten to clean the fish and when he complained about how disgusting and filthy it was the old man had told him that was why he should finish high school so frank did he got his diploma but then what was he supposed to do his choices seemed to be the marines or the tuna fleet he didnt want to stay on the tuna boats or get his head shaved at boot camp what he really wanted to do was hang out on the beach surf drive up and down the pch try to lose his cherry and surf some more and why the hell not that was what you did when you were a young guy in san diego in those days you surfed with your buddies you cruised the strip and you chased girls just one of the guys trying to find a way to keep up the sweet life which wasnt the tuna boat or the marines it was momo the old man didnt like it of course he didnt the old man was oldschool you get a job you work hard you get married and you support your family end of story and even though there werent a lot of wise guys in san diego the old man didnt especially like the ones who were there momo included they give us a bad name he said and that was about all hed say because whatcould he say frank knew full well why the old man got a fair price from the fish buyers how his catch got unloaded while it was still fresh and why the truckers took it straight to the markets if it werent for the momos of the world then the good honest hardworking civilians of the business community would have screwed the italian fishermen like a twodollar whore in a tijuana donkey show you ask what happened to the longshoremen in this town when they tried to get a decent wage and organize a union and they didnt have the wise guys backing them up the cops beat them and shot them until blood ran down twelfth street like a river to the sea thats what and that didnt happen to the italians and it wasnt because they worked so hard which they did to support their families so when frank started to spend less time on the boat and didnt go into the marines but signed on with momo instead the old man griped a little bit but mostly kept his mouth shut frank was making money he was paying room and board and the old man didnt really want to know the details actually the details were pretty boring until the thing happened with momos wife it started out okay frank was hanging out one day when momo came out and told him to wash the caddy and wax it cause they were going to the train station to pick up a special visitor who the pope frank asked because he thought he was a funny guy in those days better momo said the boss desanto old jack drina had finally died and the new boss al desanto had taken over in la mr desanto to you momo said if you open your mouth at all which you shouldnt unless he directly asks you something but yeah the new king is coming down to visit the provinces frank wasnt quite sure what momo meant by that but he picked up this tone and he wasnt sure what that was either jesus im gonna drive the boss youre going to wax the car forme to drive the boss momo said im gonna bring him to the restaurant youre going to go pick up marie bring her over after after theyve discussed business frank knew and dress decent momo added not like a surf bum frank dressed up first he polished that car until it shined like a black diamond then he went home showered scrubbed his skin until it hurt shaved again combed his hair and changed into his one suit look at you marie said when she answered the door look at me look atyou frank thought her black cocktail dress was cut low practically down to the nipple her full breasts pushed up by what had to be a strapless bra he couldnt help but stare at them you like the dress frank its pretty she laughed then went to her dressing table took a drag on her cigarette and another swallow of the martini that was sweating on the table something in her manner told frank that it wasnt her first drink of the night she wasnt drunk but she wasnt exactly sober either she turned back to frank and gave him the whole view then patted her frosted hair to place it perfectly on her neck picked up her little black bag and said so you think theyre done with their business now i dont know about that mrs a you can call me marie no i cant she laughed again do you have a girl frank yes mrs a thats right she said that little garafalo girl shes pretty thanks youhad nothing to do with it she said does she put out frank didnt know what to say if a girl put out you didnt tell and if she didnt you didnt tell that either anyway it wasnt any of mrs as business and why was she asking anyway we better get to the club mrs a theres no hurry frank yes there is frank thought cant a girl finish her drink she asked setting those beestung lips into a pretty pout she reached back and picked up her drink and sipped on it never taking her eyes off his and it was like she was giving him a blow job which frank had never had but which hed heard about in fact this was just like a scene from one of those dirty books hed read except reading one of those books wouldnt get him killed and this could she finished her drink looked kind of hard at him then laughed again and said okay lets go his hand was shaking as he opened the door she saw it and it seemed to make her a little happier they didnt talk on the drive to the club it was the most expensive supper club in town momo wasnt going to take the la boss anyplace but the best plus the club was owned by a friend of his a friend oftheirs so they got a big table in the front right by the stage and most of the wise guys in san diego were there with their wives the girlfriends having been left in their apartments for the night with strict orders to wash their hair or something but not to go anywherenear the club this was a state visit frank knew to establish that desanto was the new boss of los angeles and therefore also the boss of san diego except desanto hadnt brought his wife neither had the handful of guys hed brought down with him nick locicero desantos underboss was there and jackie mizzelli and jimmy forliano all very heavy guys sitting at that table all guys who were going to expect to get laid that night frank was glad he didnt havethat job but he knew it was all set up that a few of the cocktail waitresses had already agreed to go with these guys after the party but were supposed to stay away from the table in the meantime so was frank not that hed expected to be at the table he knew he was about thirtyseven rungs down that ladder and his job was to hang around the edges of the room in case momo looked up like he needed something momo was sitting at the center of the table next to desanto of course except desanto wasnt talking with momo he was talking with marie and saying something funny too because marie was laughing real hard and leaning way over and showing him a lot of tit desanto was looking too not even bothering to disguise it and she was giving him lots of chances leaning over so he could light her cigarette so he could smell her perfume leaning in real close pretending she couldnt hear him over the music and the conversation frank was watching this he couldnt believe what he was seeing there were rules about wise guys and their women different sets of rules for sisters cousins mistresses and wives you wouldnt treat a made guysgumar the way desanto was acting toward momoswife and if a guys girlfriend flirted with another guy the way mrs a was flirting with desanto that girlfriend was letting herself in for a good beating when they got back to her place there are rules frank thought even for a boss he had certain privileges but this wasnt one of them so frank was pissed off for momo and he also had to admit he was a little jealous shit frank thought she was making a move on me two hours ago then he felt guilty thinking that about momos wife he watched her laugh again her tits jiggling then saw desanto lean into her neck and whisper something in her ear her eyes widened and she smiled then playfully slapped him on the cheek and he laughed back desantos not abad looking guy frank thought hes no tony curtis but hes no momo either he wore glasses with thick black frames and had his graying hair brylcreemed straight back with a little widows peak in the middle of his receding forehead but he wasnt ugly and he must be kind of charming frank thought because hes sure as shit charming mrs a momo didnt look so charmed he was steaming he wasnt stupid enough to show it but by this time frank knew momo well enough he could tell the man was pissed off frank could feel the tension coming from the whole tableall the guys were drinking a lot laughing a little too loudly and the wivesthe wives were torqued off it was hard to tell if they were angrier at desanto or mrs a but their necks were stiff from not looking even as their eyes couldnt stay off the little scene and they were leaning down and whispering to one another the way wives do and it didnt take any imagination to know what they were talking about when momo got up to go to the mens room one of the san diego guys chris panno went with him frank waited until they went in then he wandered down the corridor and stood outside hes your boss boss or no boss there are rules momo said keep your voice down momo lowered his voice a little but frank could still hear him say la pisses on us they piss all over us if bap was here frank heard someone say bap aint here momo said baps inside frank knew they were talking about frank baptista whod been the san diego underboss until he got hit with a fiveyear rap for trying to bribe a judge frank had never met bap but hed sure heard about him bap had been a legendary button man since the thirties there was no telling how many guys bapd put in the dirt jack would not have allowed this momo was saying jacks dead and baps in the joint panno said things are different now bapll be out soon momo said not tonight he wont be chris panno said this isnt right momo said then frank saw nick locicero coming down the hall shit what to do he decided fast and walked into the mens room the guys looked at him like what the fuck uhh frank said he jerked his head toward the hallway locicero the guys looked at him for a second then got their faces on locicero came in what are we broads he asked we all gotta go the little girls room the same time everyone laughed locicero looked at frank or is this the littleboys room im just going frank said dyou come in to take a piss momo asked frank take a piss frank had a hard time with it he unzipped stood at the urinal but nothing came out he pretended it did though shook his dick off put it back in he was relieved to see that the men were all carefully washing their hands and paying no attention to him nice party locicero was saying the boss seems to be having a good time momo said locicero looked at him trying to see if he was just busting balls or if he was serious then he said yeah i think so frank just wanted to get out of there he headed for the door frankie momo said yeah wash your hands momo said what are you raised by wolves frank blushed as the men laughed he stepped in washed his hands and managed to get to the door when momo said kid nobody else comes in here okay jesus frank thought as he stood on guard in the hallway whats going to happen in there he halfexpected to hear gunshots but he only heard voices nicky locicero was saying momo we came down here to be nice whats going on out there isnice you guys have been going your own way down here locicero said for too long its time you came back under control when jack jack is gone locicero said the new guy out there wants you to understand that you are not your own family down here you are just another la crew a hundred miles down the road thats all he wants your respect chris panno weighed in if hewants respect nick he shouldshow respect whats going on out there is not right i dont disagree locicero said a guy came down the hall to use the mens room you cant go in there frank said stepping in his way the guy was a civilian he didnt get it what do you mean its broken all of it yeah all of it ill let you know okay the guy looked for a second like he might want to argue the point but frank was a big kid with muscles showing beneath his jacket so the guy turned around frank heard locicero say look momo all respect but your mrs has had a little too much to drink have your kid drive her home then theres no problem theres aproblem nick said momo when this guy who wants respect treats our wives like whores what do you want me to say momo hes the boss there are rules momo said he came out of the mens room grabbed frank by the elbow and said mrs a is going home you drive her holy hell frank thought go tell the valet to get the car momo said frank had to go through the main room to get outside he looked up at the table and saw desanto whispering into mrs as ear again except now she wasnt laughing and the bosss hands werent on the table frank couldnt see them under the long white tablecloth but he could guess where they were they were downstairs five minutes later momo was pulling mrs a out of the club frank got out and held the door open for her youre such an asshole she said to momo stupid twat get in the car he pushed her in frank closed the door take her home and stay with her till i get back momo told him frank just hoped hed get homesoon marie didnt say a word on the drive home not a word she lit a cigarette and sat there puffing on it so the car filled with smoke when he got to momos place he jumped out and opened the car door for her and she walked pretty fast up to her own door and stood there impatiently while he fumbled with the key to the front door when he got it open she said you dont have to come in frankie momo said i did she looked at him funny then i guess youd better inside she went straight to the bar and started making a manhattan do you want one frankie im too young to drink itd be two more years before he could get a legal drink she smiled ill bet youre not too young forother things are you i dont know what you mean mrs a but of course he did and it scared the hell out of him he was in a jam hereif he got up and left which was what he wanted to do hed be in big trouble but if he stayed here and mrs a kept making moves on him hed be in bigger trouble he was working through this when she said momo cant fuck me you know frank didnt know what to say hed never even heard a woman sayfuck never mind what mrs a was telling him he can fuck every cheap whore in san diego and tijuana she continued but he cant fuck his wife what do you think of that justhearing this could get me killedthats what frank thought of that if momo found out that i know this hed clip me so i couldnt tell anyone else which momo really doesnt have to worry about because im never going to say this even to myself doesnt matter though if momo knew thati knew that he wasnt taking care of business with his wife hed kill me just because he couldnt look me in the eye a woman has needs marie was saying do you know what i mean frankie i guess so patty didnt seem to have them you guess so now she sounded angry frank figured she couldnt be too angry though because she started to slide her dress off her left shoulder mrs a mrs a she mimicked i know youve been looking at my tits all night frankie theyre nice arent they you should feel them im leaving mrs a but momo told you to stay im leaving anyway mrs a he said now he could see the top of her breast in the black brassiere it was round and white and beautiful but what he reached for was the doorknob thinking you screw a made mans wife what they do is they cut your balls off and make you eat them thatsbefore they kill you those were the rules whats the matter frankie she asked are you a homo no you have to be mrs a said i think youre a homo im not are you afraid frankie is that it she asked he wont be home for hours you know how these things go hes probably with some whore right now im not scared her face got softer now are you a virgin frankie is that it oh baby theres nothing to be afraid of ill make you feel so good ill show you everything ill show you how to please me dont worry its not that its you dont think im pretty she asked her voice getting an edge what you think im too old for you youre very pretty mrs a frank said but i gotta go he was turning the doorknob as she said if you leave ill tell him you did it im in for a beating anyway so ill just tell him that you fucked me until i screamed ill tell him you screwed me silly frank remembered it what forty years later how he was standing there with his hand on the doorknob and his chin on his chest thinking whats this drunken broad saying that if i dont screw her shes going to tell her husband that i did but if i do screw her youre dead anyway he thought frank felt the panic welling up in his chest as he looked at that hot little number marie anselmo standing there with her little black dress half off holding a lipsticksmudged manhattan glass up to her beestung lips her perfume swirling around him like a sexy deadly cloud what saved him was the door opening she turned from him and got her dress back on just as momo came into the room he didnt look so good they had beaten the shit out of him nicky locicero shoved him into the room and told him to sit down on the couch momo did it because locicero had a in his hand locicero looked at frank and said get some ice for your boss frank stepped over to the ice bucket at the bar icecubes locicero said from thefreezer dipshit in the kitchen frank hustled into the kitchen got a tray out of the freezer and cracked a few cubes into the sink then he found a dish towel in a drawer put the ice in the towel and wrapped it up when he got back into the living room al desanto was there he had a real smirk on his goofylooking face marie wasnt smiling she just stood there like she was a piece of ice herself frozen stonecold sober now frank sat next to momo on the couch and held the ice up to his cut swollen eye he can do it himself locicero said frank heard him but didnt listen he kept holding the cloth up to momos eye a trickle of blood ran down the towel and frank twisted it to keep the blood from getting on the sofa we have some unfinished business desanto said to marie no we dont marie said i disagree desanto said you dont play with a man like that then leave him high and dry it isnt nice he grabbed her wrist wheres the bedroom she didnt answer he slapped her across the face momo started to get up but locicero pointed the gun at his face and momo sat back down i asked you a question desanto said to marie his hand cocked again she pointed to a door off the living room thats better desanto said he turned to momo im just going to go give your wife what she wants paisan you dont mind do you locicero leering stuck the pistol in momos temple momo shook his head frank could see him trembling come on honey de santo said he walked her to the bedroom door and pushed her in he went in himself started to shut the door then changed his mind and left it ajar frank saw him toss marie facefirst onto the bed saw him grab her by the neck with one hand and rip the dress down with the other saw her kneeling on the bed in her black lingerie as desanto pulled her panties down and unzipped his fly the guy was already hard and he shoved himself into her frank heard her grunt saw her body quiver under desantos weight you had it coming momo locicero said you ran your mouth momo didnt say anything just put his head in his hands bubbles of snot and blood ran down from his nose locicero put the pistol barrel under momos chin and lifted his face so he had to look desanto had left the door open so that momo had to see him pulling maries hair back and riding her hard frank saw it too saw maries face her lipstick smudged her mouth twisted into an expression frank hadnt seen before desanto was pulling her hair with one hand and mauling her breasts with the other he grunted with effort and his glasses were askew on his face as his sweat made them slide down his nose this is what you wanted isnt it bitch desanto asked say it he yanked her head up she murmured yes what yes say fuck me al fuck me al marie cried sayplease please fuck me al please fuck me al thats better frank saw him push her face into the mattress and lift her ass up so he could drive into her harder he was really piling into her and frank heard marie start making noises he couldnt tell if it was pleasure or pain or both but marie started moaning and then yelling and frank saw her small fingers grip the bedspread as she screamed jesus momo locicero said your wife is a hot little number desanto finished and pulled out he wiped himself off on her dress zipped his fly back up and got off the bed he looked down at marie still lying facedown on the bed her chest heaving anytime you want more of that baby he said you have my number he walked back into the living room and asked did you hear the bitch come locicero said hell yes didyou hear her momo locicero nudged momo with the gun i heard momo said then he asked why dont you just shoot me frank felt like he was going to throw up desanto looked down at momo i dont shoot you momo because i want you to keep earning what idont want is any more of this san diego bullshit whats mine is mine and whatsyours is mine capisce capisce good frank was just staring at him desanto noticed and asked what kid you got a problem frank shook his head i didnt think so desanto looked back toward the bedroom you want sloppy seconds momo i dont mind he and locicero laughed and then walked out frank sat there in shock momo got up opened a dresser drawer pulled out a wickedlooking little revolver and started for the door frank heard himself say theyll kill you momo i dont give a damn then marie was standing in the hallway leaning against the doorjamb her dress still pulled down her makeup smeared over her face like a crazy clown her hair a tangled mess youre not a man she said letting him do that to me you liked it you cunt how could you he made you come he lifted the pistol momo no frank yelled momo said shecame for him he shot her christ frank screamed as maries body twirled and then corkscrewed to the floor he wanted to lunge and take the gun away but he was too scared and then momo took a step away from him put the gun to his own head and said i loved her frankie frank looked at those sad hound eyes for a second then momo pulled the trigger his blood spattered all over kennedys smiling face funny thing frank thinks now thats what i remember more than anythingthat blood on john kennedy later when kennedy was killed it didnt seem like such a surprise to him it was like hed seen it already marie anselmo survivedit turned out that momo had hit her in the hip she rolled around on the floor screaming while frank frantically called the police the ambulance took marie away and the detectives took frank he told them most of what hed seenthat is that momo had shot his wife and then himself he left out any mention of al desanto or nicky locicero and was relieved to hear later that marie had also kept her mouth shut about the rape and if the san diego cops were busted up over momos suicide they kept it hidden pretty well unless open laughter was what they used to suppress their grief marie spent weeks in the hospital and had a barely detectable limp after that but she lived out of respect for momo frank used to deliver groceries to the house and when she recovered enough he still used to drive her to the supermarket but after that frank was disillusioned all the stuff momo had taught him about this thing of oursthe code the rules the honor the familywas straightup bullshit hed seen their fucking honor that night at momos house he went back to working on the tuna boats and that probably would have been my life he thinks now looking out the window at the gray ocean and the whitecaps except that six months later who should show up but frank baptista bap came on the dock one night when frank had just finished squaring the deck away and was headed for a shower and a night of struggling against pattys virtue you didnt see a lot of guys in suits and ties on the dock so frank lamped bap right away as something different but he didnt know who he was except the guy seemed to know frank are you frankie machianno bap asked yeah frank was afraid now that the guy was a cop and maybe marie had decided she wanted to press charges against desanto after all the guy stuck out his hand we got the same first name im frank baptista frank was shocked this guy sure didnt look like a famous button manround chubby soft body meaty jowls bottlethick glasses over owl eyes balding with a greasy combover bap made momo look like troy donohue this is the guy frank wondered that killed lew brunemann russian louie strauss and red sagunda when the cleveland mob tried to move on san diego this is the guy who was boss here since the forties until he went into the can for bribery can i buy you a drink bap asked a cup of coffee i should have said no frank thinks now i should have said no offense mr baptista but im out of that now i seen enough but i didnt i went for a beer with the bap frank followed him up to pacific beach to one of the joints near crystal pier they got a booth in the back where bap ordered a coffee for himself and a beer for frank bap spent a long time stirring milk and sugar into his coffee and then he asked did you like momo yeah i did i hear you still bring marie her groceries bap said that speaks well of you it shows you have respect momo was always good to me bap took this in then made small talk but it was clear to frank that the former boss wasnt really interested in chitchat so frank finished his beer and said he had a date bap thanked him for his time and said it was nice meeting him frank figured that was that but about a month later bap showed up at the dock again and said come on lets go for a drive frank followed him to a cadillac parked on ocean avenue bap tossed him the keys and sat in the front passenger seat frank got behind the wheel and started the engine where do you want to go dont matter just drive frank pulled onto sunset drive and headed south cruising alongside his surfing spots you drive good bap said youre my driver now and that was it frank went to work for bap he drove the man everywhereto the grocery store the barbers to clubs to momos old house to visit marie to the track when the horses were running at del mar he took bap to see all the bookies the loan sharks the hustlers in san diego desanto didnt like it the la boss knew that bap was out that he was going to want his old territory back he was going to want a piece of the money on the street the gambling anything else they had going in san diego and desanto didnt want to give him any of that bap was a big name a guy with ambitions and la didnt want a strong guy down in san diego wanting to go his own way again we just got those indians back on the reservation desanto told nicky locicero last thing we need is a guy who thinks hes a chief running around down there so he tried to throw bap a few crumbs off the table and bap wasnt shy about expressing his dissatisfaction that was always baps problem he could never swallow a resentment it always came out his mouth at the end of the day its what killed him frank could still remember bap mouthing off back in right at the del mar track with half the wise guys in southern california within earshot what am i a dog he throws me a fewbones frank was running baps bets to the window and bap wasnt doing so good no wonder he needs money frank thought he has a fondness for slow horses bap threw another handful of losing tickets at his feet and said im in the joint for three years not earning this guy has to let me eat for chrissakes he said this right in front of three la guys down for the race season so he had to know it was going straight back to desanto as soon as they could get to a telephone and the la boss wasnt going to be happy hearing this shit from bap especially what bap said next maybe i should just start my own fucking thing down here which was bap justbegging to get clipped desanto wasnt long in honoring the request he set up a meet at which bap would be killed and his driver with him if it fell that way they met in a vacant lot up in orange county in those days frank remembers orange county was mostly just that orange groves with disneyland thrown on top memory is a funny thing because he can still smell the oranges from that night anyway he pulled into this red dirt lot alongside an orange grove on an isolated road desanto and locicero were already there locicero behind the wheel of desantos black cadillac the boss sitting behind him in the backseat dont worry bap said when he saw the scared look in franks eyes nick has guaranteed my safety bap got out and walked over to the cadillac locicero got out snubbed his cigarette out in the dirt and walked over to him bap raised his arms and locicero patted him down then nodded and bap got into the back with desanto locicero leaned back against the hood keeping an eye on frank nodded at frank and smiled as he did another car pulled into the lot right in back of frank trapping him frank started to sweat he looked in the rearview mirror and saw that there were two guys in the front of the lincoln one he recognized as jimmy forliano the other he didnt know it was a younger guy about his own age but this guy had a confident look that made him seem older then frank saw what looked like lightning in the back of desantos caddy and it took him a second to realize that they were muzzle flashes locicero smiled and lit another cigarette you were so scared frank remembers now you tried to start the car but your hand was shaking on the key and there was no place to go anyway so you started to open the door and try to make a run for it but forliano was already at the window easy kid i didnt see anything forliano just smiled and then the back door of the caddy opened up and bap got out waved his hand at you to come over forliano opened the door for you and you walked over to bap your legs shaking your knees rattling and then bap handed you the gun momo was your friend wasnt he yeah he was my friend too bap said this cocksucker had to go hitting aboss frank wanted to pay desanto back for momo too but hitting a boss was suicide even if you did manage to get to him youd have every family in the country after you and maybe bap used to be the boss in san diego but he was demoted to a common soldier when he went into the can you gotta put a couple into him bap was saying thats okay frank said no you gotta bap said so you cant be a witness this boat we got to be in together he walked frank over to the other side of the caddy and opened the door de santos body with two holes in the head toppled halfway out his glasses slid down his nose and dropped in the dirt put two in his chest bap said frank hesitated i like you kid bap said i dont want to have to leave you in this field with him bap walked away frank knew he was listening for the shots waiting for the flashes he tried to lift the gun and shoot but he just couldnt do it then he heard someone come up behind him your first one it was the young guy from the car parked behind him jetblack hair medium height wide shoulders on an otherwisethin frame yeah frank said ill help you the guy said its easier than you think the guy helped him aim the gun at desantos body now just pull the trigger frank did his hand was shaking but he couldnt miss at that range the body jolted with each shot though then it slid down the open door and onto the dirt raising a little cloud of dust when it hit the guy beside frank took his own gun out and put two more into desantos corpse now the guy said were in it together you and me bap walked back over and pissed on the body this was years before all the dna stuff so nobody cared in those days bap just whipped his thing out and pissed into desantos gaping mouth this is for marie he said he finished zipped up and then said to frank drive me home frank sort of shuffled back to the car forliano stopped him and took the gun out of his hand well take care of this okay you did good kid forliano said youre all right the younger guy was standing there too smiling at frank like he was in on some kind of funny practical joke dont worry about it he said you did fine he had an east coast accent thanks frank said you know for helping me out there forget about it the guy offered his hand mike pella frank machianno they shook hands locicero got into the car with forliano and pella and they took off frank got behind the wheel and this time managed to turn the key in the ignition the wheels spun in the dirt as he hit the gas drive slow not fast bap instructed him always drive the speed limit leaving a job last thing you want is to get stopped for speeding you get a cop putting you near the scene just get out on the highway get in the flow of traffic frank did what he was told they were a good twenty miles south on the before bap said i been in chicago okay frank thought you dont get what i mean bap said i mean i talked with certain people there which did nothing to enlighten frank la runs san diego bap explained but la dont run la las never really been its own thing used to be it answered to new york to the jews siegel and lansky now la cant shake its own dick after it takes a piss it dont put a call in to chicago first i didnt know that because you aint supposed to bap said la dont want san diego guys crying to chicago they got a problem with la but thats what you just did frank thought i go back bap said like he read franks mind i was doing work for chicago when al desanto was getting jack drina his coffees i talked with certain people there and they didnt like the cocksucker either they gave the okay frank was shocked that aint the way it works frankie bap said they dont say yes they just dont say no that means something happens to the guy in la they aint gonna do nothing about it makes you feel any better detroit said the same thing now frank got it and lociceros the new boss everyone has his price frankie bap said never forget that frank didnt so that was that frank remembers now locicero became the boss bap got san diego although as a captain in the la family except that wasnt quite it was it there was that afternoon you picked up marie anselmos grocery order and brought it to the house and she answered the door but wouldnt let you bring the bags in like usual but you could see through the open door bap in the hallway pulling his pants on he married marie six months later after that no one ever whispered a word about what happened that night at momos with desanto frank sure as hell didnt hed decided to go straight so one day he drove to oceanside saw the recruiter and was in the marines about five minutes after that like the surfaris song that was so popular then surfer joe joined uncle sams marines today they stationed him at pendleton not far away its funny frank thinks now i got my training from the federal government frank turns from the window gets on the phone and calls the bait shop the kid abe answers on the first ring frank you okay i came in and the shop was closed you know what abe frank says lets shut it down for a few days theres an incredulous silence then shut it down yeah with the storm were not going to do much business anyway frank says lets take a few days off ill call you when i want to reopen

good thank you i love you i love you too she says will i see you again absolutely now theyve gotme saying it he thinks he calls jill and gets her answering machine hi im off skiing in big bear arent you jealous leave a message and ill call you back he tries her cell and gets pretty much the same message oh well he thinks shes safe in big beareven if they whoever they are want to try to get her they cant track her down there so the people i love are safe which is a good thing on its own and also gives me freedom of movement and its time to move he packs the shotgun and some clothes into a gym bag straps on a shoulder holster for the then slips into a raincoat and heads out the door he takes a taxi downtown then goes to hertz and uses his sabellico identification to rent a nondescript ford taurus he heads north on the pacific coast highway toward la dave hansen walks out onto the beach the wet sand looks like dark shiny marble and the cold rain pelts him in the face two thousand miles of coastline he thinks and the floater had to wash up on federal land in weather like this hes at the edge of america literally point loma is the last stop in the continental usa the end of the line the floater just made it a few feet the other way and the body would have been a mexican problem a bunch of sailors from the coast guard station and a few san diego cops are gathered around the body we didnt touch it the police sergeant tells dave this is your jurisdiction he sounds pleased as punch thanks dave says actually the san diego cops like hansen he has a light touch for a fed the sergeant says we havent had any missing persons report usually do in a drowning i checked with coast guard too nada he didnt drown dave says hes not blue the skin of drowning victims even if theyve been in the water for only a few minutes turns a ghastly blue no one whos seen it ever forgets it dave squats down by the body he opens up the guys jacket and sees the large entrance wound right where the guys heart used to be he keeps looking and finds the other entrance wound in the stomach whoever killed the john doe shot him in the gut then pressed the gun against his chest and finished him off even after an unknown number of hours in the water the powder burns on his clothes are unmistakable probably a dope run gone wrong the sergeant said probably dave says he keeps looking through the guys clothes the shooter also removed john does id no wallet no watch no ring nothing dave looks closely at the victims face or whats left of it after the fish pecked at the eyes he doesnt recognize him didnt expect to but theres something vaguely familiar about him a faint memory or an old dream washed up onshore like a piece of driftwood its weird but its been a weird day dave thinks must be the weather these highpressure fronts seem to make everything and everybody a little crazy people do odd things that they wouldnt otherwise do frank machianno for instance franks at the bait shop every morning like clockwork for as long as dave can remember and then today he doesnt show up and frank whos been a regular at the gentlemens hour for longer than dave has is a noshow for the best waves of the year dave figured he was sick and called the house to bust his chops about the great waves he missed but no answer tried frank on his cell same thing so he went back to the bait shop only to find the kid abe closing it up frank said to abe told him said take a few days off franksaid take a few days off whati thought abe said told me to go home for a while wheres home abe pointed south tj like where else so dave took a drive over to franks house his van and his mercedes in the garage the house all locked up no frank so its been a strange day a murdered body that by all the rules of normal tide and current should have drifted down the baja coast manages instead to snag itself up on the last tip of america when dave first heard they had a floater he was afraid it was tony palumbo the star witness in gsting has been undercover for years as a bouncer at hunnybears and he was supposed to meet with dave earlier that morning he didnt show up he wasnt anywhere to be seen and a fourhundredpound man is hard to miss so tony palumbo is and frank goes off the radar james jimmy the kid giacamone walks into the bar of the bloomfield hills country club in suburban detroit and looks for his father he spots vito william giacamone aka billy jacks sitting at a banquette by the window sadly contemplating the snowcovered eighteenth green billy jacks turns and looks at his son the kid comes to the country club dressed in baggy pants and an old sweatshirt with the hood up like one of them rapperswhats the white ones name the local kidsome kind of candym ampms his son thinks hes m ampms then again billy thinks the kid just did a hard stintfive years for extortion and the boy has done some other work that thank saint anthony the feds didnt make him for the boy may look like a clown but hes a good worker and hes back with me so let him look like what he wants this life of ours you never know how much time you have with your kids so why bust balls jimmy slips into the booth beside him and signals the bartender to bring him his usual its gonna be months billy says before we can get out there jimmy doesnt care golf is for old guys a waiter sets a vodka and tonic in front of jimmy and walks away you heard from vince billy asks jimmy shakes his head b company aint comin back which is what happens jimmy thinks when you send a guy like vince against a legend like frankie machine billy accepts the verdict what choice does he have if vince was alive he would have checked in he hasnt and the silence can only mean one thingvince vena better hope he was current with his acts of contrition fuckin shame about vince though after a life of service the guy finally makes it to the ruling council of the combination and then gets himself whacked just a few weeks later then again it means theres going to be a vacancy on the council jimmy sits there listening to his fathers brain grinding away on overtime he can see the old man working through the stages of grief first theres acceptance vince is dead then theres anger fuck vince is dead then theres ambition vince is dead and someones going to get his seat at the table theyre like hyenas these old guys thinks jimmy who watched a lot of shows on animal planet when he was in the joint they run together they hunt in packs they share the kill but one of them goes down the rest will eat his bones and suck the marrow and vinces bones have some juicy marrow in them theres only two street bosses jimmy thinks my dad and old tony corrado so one of them is going to move up and if dad can rescue this san diego deal its going to be him they should have sentme jimmy says you asked billy says jimmy shrugs its true he made a big play with jack tominello but the head of the council the real boss agreed that it should be vince after all san diego was going to be vinces territory so he should take care of his own business except he couldnt now what billy asks hes come to that age when hes asking advice from his own kid but youth must be served and jimmy the kid is an upandcomer at only twentyseven years of age the combinations biggest earner and theres a seat practically reserved for him at the council table in his turn in his time and the first step would be i move up to the council then jimmy gets my streetboss slot now what jimmy asks i kill frankie machine thats what billy jacks shakes his head dad jimmy says we cant let this guy kill a member of the ruling council and walk away besides we promised certain people i know what we promised billy says he looks off again at the snow and then gets mad again about vince a bunch of california beach bums jimmy says let me remind you billy says one of those beach bums killed vince vena you think i cant handle the guy frank machianno frankie fucking machine jimmy thinks the guy has to be on the wrong side of sixty he might be a legend and all that but a bunch of old war stories dont make the man bulletproof jimmy likes the fact that frankie machine is a legend killing a legend makesyou a legend you aint the man until you beat the man whowas the man thats what his uncle taught him tony jacks was aman uncle tony made his bones the old way chased the old jewish navy out of detroit then was a freaking warrior in the long war between the east and west sides that finally settled into the combination it was tony jacks who brought hoffa into the fold and tony jacks who finally reluctantly gave the word to have him clipped but now uncle tony is retired ill living out his last days in gods waiting room in west palm thats the problem with this thing of ours these days not enoughmen like uncle tony jimmy loves his father but the old man is like most of the old men these daysworn out tired and reluctant to pull the trigger it took generations to build this thing of ours and now the old men are just giving it away to the moolies and the jamaicans and the russians or beach bums out on the west coast were just soft these days but jimmy the kid is a throwback hes oldschoolhe aint afraid to pull the trigger he figures its time for the new generation to take over and restore their thing and the best way to move up and do that is tostep up jimmy thinks take out a legend like frankie machine let them know theres a new kid in town dave hansen walks into callahans the popular bar is in the heart of the gaslamp district in downtown san diego once a rough neighborhood of sro hotels strip clubs and porno shops the area has become a tourist attraction of faux seediness callahans has made a lot of money in the transition dave hansen is about as welcome at callahans as a cold sore on a lip two wise guys make him the second he walks in and they shuffle quickly to the back room where teddy migliore keeps his office young teddys mob genealogy couldnt be more solidhes old joe migliores son and paul morettis grandson teddy did a pop for loansharking a few years ago but has kept his nose clean until recently until operation gsting started to bring up some troublesome connections like the fact that teddy is the silent owner of hunnybears and several other strip clubs in the area like the fact that john heaney is a night manager at hunnybears teddy comes out of the office my lawyer will be here in five minutes he says ill be gone by then dave tells him can you make it four trust me dave says i wont spend a second longer in this rat hole than i have to good teddy says what do you want im sick to death of this fbi harassment just because i have an italian surname and im a migliore tony palumbo is missing dave says he watches for teddys reaction teddy smiles follow a trail of twinkie wrappers you should find him did you kill him youre kind of jumping to conclusions there arent you teddy asks one that hes dead two that idwant him dead three that even if idid want him dead i would take matters into my own hands dave steps up to him teddys two boys start to move in until dave says yeah why dont you im in an ugly mood and i havent gotten my exercise today the fbi agent is six four andcut they back off dave gets right in teddys face if i find out you did him dave says ill be back and ill make ruby ridge and

people teddy says to his back you might want to be looking for frank machianno dave turns around your surfing buddy teddy adds frankie machine jimmy the kid rents a car at the airport and drives out to his uncles place in west palm its nice to be in florida nice to be cruising in a convertible getting some sun jimmy runs a hand through his dyedblond hair he likes his new lookbright blond almost a buzz cut nice too to show off the tatts in shortsleeve weather got him some of those chinese symbolsstrength courage loyalty got him a big wrecking ball on his right forearm about to swing down on some geek in an old caddy the wrecking crew nice tonys bungalow is sweltering its a hot day anyway and jimmy swears the old man has the freaking heat turned on in the house he glances at the thermostat and it reads and uncle tony has a sweater on its his circulation jimmy thinks the blood just isnt moving and old men get cold jimmy hugs his uncle and kisses him on both cheeks the skin feels like parchment paper on his lips tony jacks is glad to see his nephew come sit they go into the living room jimmy sits down on the sofa and his legs stick to the plastic covering in the heat you want something to drink uncle tony asks ill call the girl im good they make the requisite small talk for a few minutes then tony jacks gets to the point what brings you here jimmy this mess in san diego tony jacks shakes his head theyd asked me idve told them vince couldnt handle that job what i said ive known this frankie since he was a kid tony jacks says he did some work for me back in the day a tough nut to crack i want the shot uncle tony tony jacks looks at him for a few seconds then says thats up to jack tominello nephew hes the boss youshould be boss jimmy says or my father it should be the giacamones not the tominellos i figure i do this thing i take over whatever vince had going in san diego what do you know about that something about strip clubs its a lot more than a few strippers why such a hardon for frankie machine jimmy asks why did we even want him gone tony jacks leans forward it looks like it takes some effort his voice drops into a hoarse whisper what im about to tell you jimmy your father doesnt know even jack doesnt know and if i tell you you can never tell another soul as long as you live i wont swear i swear to god jimmy says tony jacks tells him a story it goes way back and it takes a long time when jimmy the kid finally leaves his uncles house he is blown freaking away freakingaway tracking down mouse junior is a cinch frank simply calls gets the number for golden productions and dials it hey he says to the receptionist im the caterer for the shoot today and i cant locate it can you tell me its in the valley of course the san fernando valley is the porn capital of the world you cant bounce a tennis ball in the valley without hitting a bare ass waiting to go on the set an incorporated part of los angeles it tried to secede a few years back ostensibly frank thinks as he turns on the and heads toward the valley to recreate itself as the republic of porn so you have hollywood and then to the north you have hollywoody gay guys with viagrafueled erections banging drugaddicted girls on bare mattresses tossed on lawns in encino about as erotic frank thinks as an intestinal bug but the truth is that the adultentertainment industry outgrosses no pun intended hollywood major league baseball the nfl and the nba combined its a major money maker and where you find money being made youll find the guys he finds the shoot with no problem its a big house in chatsworth with a walledin backyard and the inevitable pool he knows he has the right place because mouse juniors hummer is parked on the street which just goes to show you how careless this thing has gotten lately when you take a whack at a guy miss then keep using your own car like you dont have a worry in the world unless its an ambush frank thinks he drives around looking for a work car but he doesnt see one nor does he see any guys on the corner if mouse junior has security with him theyre all in there watching the action which is really dumb frank thinks as he drives up the switchback where he can look down at the backyard he parks gets his binos out and checks the scene if i wanted to take mouse junior out i could do it right from the car with a single rifle shot and then all his security could do for him would be pick his dead body up off the wet grass because there is the dumb little punk with his dumber wingman travis standing around with the director and the crew trying to figure out where to shoot now that its raining the cast and crew are miserably gathered in a knot inside the covered patio and the director seems to be trying to figure out how to shoot in there and sure enough a couple of gaffers go out and roll a chaise lounge onto the patio a production assistant finds a towel and wipes it off which is considerate frank thinksat least the actors get to work on adry lawn chair frank focuses the glasses on mouse junior it would be easy to take him out but frank doesnt want mouse juniors blood he wants information so he has to sit there and wait for a chance there are five things that make guys give you an opening carelessness fatigue habits money sex thats it thats the list mouse juniors already committed carelessness and it would be enough to kill him except that frank doesnt want him dead so now he has to wait for mouse junior to commit one of the other five deadly sins franks money is on sex which is not a huge long shot seeing as how mouse junior is standing there watching a young lady having sex with herself right now shes a petite blonde with an enormous chest a rack off the rack as it were and she has the requisite tattoo on the small of her back the tramp stamp as mike pella refers to it a dolphin frolicking in a wave franks offended on behalf of dolphins hessurfed with dolphins for heavens sake sometimes they do that ride along with the surfers just for fun and some of the best memories of his life come from watching dolphins play in the break at sunset he doesnt need to see them depicted on some porn actresss back frank doesnt get the whole tattoo thing anyway doesnt see the attraction at all he doesnt think they look good on young bodies and what happens when gravity takes its inevitable toll and the drawings start to go south not a pretty picture mouse junior has his eye on dolphin girl she has her eye on him its porno puppy love kind of sweet if it werent so disgusting shes playing with herself and moaning and making eyes offcamera at mouse junior whos standing there shifting his weight from one leg to the other and grinning like the congenital idiot he is in the meantime male porn star is getting a smoker from another young man and now he breaks off and walks onto the set and dolphin girl takes over the oral chore then male porn star returns the favor and then they go through a tedious rotation of positionslike sexual gymnasts performing their mandatory techniqueswhich culminates in the requisite money shot on her face which she receives with apparent enthusiasm if not downright gratitude then its lunchtime frank doesnt know if adult entertainers have a union but they seem pretty prompt on the lunch break and everybody lines up on the patio to work their way down the long table mouse junior waits as a production assistant hands dolphin girl a moist towelette to wipe her face off with then steps forward and drapes a terrycloth robe around her shoulders proving frank supposes that chivalry is not indeed dead he watches as they separate themselves from the group and eat their lunch by the covered barbecue grill and talk about what frank wonders the scene she just did or the one shes about to about her performance her technique some pointers from the producer career notes what doesnt matter frank waits until the lunch break is over then drives closer to the house and finds a parking spot down the street dolphin girl comes out about two hours later and gets into a ford taurus frank follows her as she drives down the street to the onramp of the he stays a few cars behind her as she drives south then exits at encino she lives in one of those twostory blocks of apartment buildings like thousands of others in the la area frank follows her into the parking lot where she pulls into her assigned slot he finds an empty space and parks then watches as she walks up to the second floor and lets herself into her apartment then he drives out finds a subway gets himself a turkey sub and a bottled iced tea goes to the convenience store in the same strip mall and buyssurfer then drives back across the street from her apartment building and waits the sandwich is goodnot great not like hed build for himself at home but good he chose the turkey with wholegrain bread because both donna and jill have been after him about his carb intake what with all the pasta diet fads frank thinksa while back everyone was carb packing and you couldnt sell enough pasta at the restaurants and now carbs are the devil and protein is the thing mouse junior doesnt get there until almost eight must have been problems on the set frank thinks script troubles camera breakdowns erectile dysfunctions astroglide shortage anyway mouse junior comes in his hummer and he comes alone carelessnessand sex frank thinks a deadly daily double the only question is whether to take him now or wait untilafter hes gotten his rocks off it would be better to do it in the apartment than on the street frank thinks but dolphin girl has nothing to do with this so he decides to leave her out of it hoping that mouse junior doesnt spend the night in short frank thinks you hope hesyou he sets the alarm on his watch and takes a halfhour nap knowing that mouse junior isnt going to be that fast he leans back in the seat and sleeps soundly until the little ringer wakes him up then he gets out opens the trunk takes out a slim jim and walks over to the hummer in the old days if a bosss son was paying court as it were there wouldve been guys out on the street waiting taking his back not now frank walks up to the hummer and opens the door the alarm goes off but no one pays attention to these things anymore and it only takes him a couple of seconds to reach under and disarm the stupid thing he climbs into the backseat and lies down on the floor to wait hoping that mouse junior is a bad lover mediocre as it turns out its nearly when mouse junior emerges from the apartment building whistling unreal frank thinks as he hears mouse junior warbling the kid is a walking cliche he waits as the door opens and mouse junior gets behind the wheel then he presses the pistol barrel into the back of the drivers seat so mouse junior can feel it poking into his back press your hands onto the ceiling frank says hard mouse junior does it frank reaches over and finds the pistol in mouse juniors shoulder holster empties the chamber and tucks the gun into his own waistband now put your hands on the wheel frank says mouse junior does that too please dont kill me mr machianno if i wanted you dead frank says youd already be dead just understand that if you make me shoot you through this seat it will be the bulletand the handtooled leather and god knows what else that will be blowing through your vital parts capisce i understand mouse junior says his voice quivering good frank says now lets go see daddy its a long drive to westlake village mostly because mouse junior develops a case of verbal diarrhea and cant stop the foolishness flowing out of his mouth about how happy he is that franks alive how shocked he was about what happened on the boat how he and travis ran and called his dad right away to see if he could help how the whole la family has been junior shut up frank says youre giving me a headache sorry just drive franks says he tells him to go to the one place in the world that no one would expect frank machianno to go mouse seniors place of business the coffeehouse will be closed to the public by now but frank knows that mouse senior and half the la family will be there which is just what he wants get this thing settled so he can get his life back when they get there frank tells mouse junior to pull into the back parking lot keep the engine running and use his cell phone to call his dad mouse juniors hand is shaking like an old drunks as he punches the number on speed dial when frank hears mouse senior answer he grabs the phone come outside he says mouse senior recognizes the voice frank what the fuck i have a gun pressed to your kids back and ill pull the trigger unless youre out here in ten seconds what are you drunk mouse senior asks is this some kind of sick joke one frank what the fucks wrong with you two frank im looking out the window i see junior sitting in his car by himself tell him frank says to mouse junior dad mouse junior says hes here hes in the backseat he has a gun that was three four and five frank says is this a kidnap thing mouse senior asks are you crazy machianno are you out of your fucking mind is it possible frank thinks that mouse senior didnt know about the setup six frank says im coming out im coming out frank keeps the gun on mouse juniors back but rises up just enough to see out the window mouse senior steps out the back door his brother carmen is with him and so are rocco meli and joey fiella the martini brothers wont be carrying guns frank knows but rocco and joey will definitely be strapped it doesnt matter nobodys going to take a shot at him while hes this close to the bosss son i could frank thinks i could make the shot and never splash a drop of blood on the kid but thats me thats not them and they know it they also know that i could have killed the kid already if thats what i was about and i would have been within my rights to do it for setting me up the fact that i brought him here where it would be tantamount to suicide to pull the trigger lets them know i want to make peace he says pete you know your son could be dead already take it easy frank frank hasnt seen mouse senior in years the boss still has that broad flat fryingpan face but the lines in it are a lot deeper and his hair has gone completely white im taking it easy frank says you do the same and you just listen weve apparently had some sort of bad misunderstanding pete to lead you to think you had to have me clipped if you think im going to flip on you for herbie goldstein youre wrong i havent been arrested indicted or even questioned about it and even if i had im not a rat i never thought you were mouse senior says what thefuck are you talking about the little sitdown with vince vena on the boat frank sees some movement from the corner of his eye tell joey to stop working his way around the other side of the car joey stand still mouse senior orders frank what the fuckare you talking about he doesnt know frank asks junior mouse junior shakes his head youd better tell him tell me what mouse senior glares at his son tell mewhat junior what did you fuck up now dad goddamn it tell me me and travis were shooting some porn down in san diego mouse junior says internet porn webcam shitstreaming video you fucking little asshole mouse senior says you know thats i was trying to make some money dad mouse junior says i was trying to earn keep talking i was making so much fucking money dad mouse junior says then the detroit guys found out they jammed me up said they were going to take it to you unless what did youdo junior they just wanted me to set up a meeting mouse junior cries get frank to come sit down with vena thats all i didnt know they were going to kill him i swear i didnt know they just said tell him this story get him to the meeting i could keep my business down there frank im sorry mouse senior says i didnt know baloney frank says detroit would never come on your turf and clip one of your guys without you signing off on it youre the boss the boss mouse senior asks his mouth twisting into a rueful sneer boss ofwhat im the boss ofshit its the stonecold truth most of mouses guys are in the joint what hes got left are garbage and hes looking down the barrel of another indictment heis the boss of shitfrank just didnt realize that he knew it so where are we now frankie mouse senior asks he turns to his son you know the man is within his rights to kill you dad shut up idiot mouse senior says he turns to frank you have a daughter frank you know how it feels you want me to give him a good beating i will but let him go please father to father im begging you im humbling myself who frank asks mouse junior one chance to tell me the truthwho came to you john heaney mouse junior says john heaney frank thinks no wonder he looked so edgy when i saw himcould it have been just last nightoutside freddies john my old surfing buddy my friend the guy i helped get half a dozen jobs thats this world we live in get out of the car frank says mouse junior practically falls tumbling out of the hummer frank climbs into the drivers seat slams the door shut puts the vehicle into reverse and roars out of the parking lot onto the street from the rearview mirror he can already see joey winging shots at him rocco scrambling to a car and mouse senior slapping mouse junior upside the head but taking a break long enough to yell kill that cocksucker yeah well wanting to kill that cocksucker and actuallykilling that cocksucker are two very different things frank thinks hopefully the more serious issue is who would send john heaney to set me up and why frank makes himself concentrate on more immediate concerns like the fact that joey fiella and rocco meli are trying to chase him down or not as the case may be joey and rocco are definitely chasing him but the last thing they probably want is actually tocatch him if they catch him theyll have to do something about it which is probably get themselves killed and they know it still and all frank thinks i cant just let them follow me forever a bright yellow hummer stands out like a bright yellow hummer and if these bozos have any brainsand he concedes them a certain feral cunningtheyll know hed have left a work car somewhere near mouse juniors girlfriends place so what he needs is a little space he puts his foot down on the pedal and guns it racing toward the its a lot faster than he usually likes to go especially in an awkward car hes not used to driving but he needs to create a little space he stomps on the gas joey fiella cranks the car onto the onramp of the south and hopes his mustang can handle the curve it does juniors hummer didnt its left front fender is crumpled against a light pole and smoke is coming up from the engine juniors going to be pissed rocco says fuck him joey says he pulls the car off on the shoulder behind the hummer this is a piece of luck rocco says yeah but which kind joey thinks as he grabs his pistol and opens the door rocco does the same and they approach the hummer from both sides guns pointed like cops on a sketchy traffic stop fuck junior and his tinted windows joey thinks as he gets to the drivers door because he cant see inside and can only hope that frankie machine is slumped against the steering wheel with his melon cracked in half he decides not to take any chances frankie could be playing possum in there and besides another car could be coming up the ramp any second so joey fiella just starts shooting rocco catches the panic bug and does the same thing and the two of them empty their guns into the front windows the window glass shatters joey blinks frankie aint in there and his own mustang is pulling onto the highway with frankie behind the wheel this isnt good joey thinks it isnt going to be any fun explaining to pete how he shot juniors hummer to shit and got his own car stolen and let frankie machine get away idiots frank thinks these are what pass for soldiers these days mouse senior was right heis the boss of shit if these clowns are the best he can send out now back in the day it would have been guys like bap jimmy forliano chris panno mike pella and well me now its rocco and joey frank could have gunned them down where they stood easily but what would have been the point youre younger maybe you kill them because your blood is up and you have this macho thing but at his age you know that the less killing the better besides he didnt want to create any more vendettas than he already had and apparently he thinks i have one i dont even know about john heaney frank thinks as he drives the mustang back toward dolphin girls condo to pick up his own car what did i ever do to john john heaney goes out for a cigarette break out by the dumpster in back of hunnybears its been a bitch of a night the place is jammed with both the usual pack of locals and a swarm of touristssome convention in from omaha anyway the girls are making money and the bar registers ringing like a twentyalarm fire john takes the pack of marlboros from his shirt pocket and his lighter from his pants pocket lights up and leans back against the dumpster suddenly hes choking as an arm comes across his throat and he feels himself being lifted off his feet just an inch or so but its enough he cant breathe and he cant get traction to move i thought we were friends john he hears frank machianno say frankie machine is standing in the dumpster calfdeep in garbage his strong left forearm locked across heaneys neck oh shit john says mouse junior gave you up frank says what was it john did i give you a delivery of bad tuna or what oh shit john repeats youll have to do better than that frank says the clubs back door opens and a wedge of yellow light spills out into the back john feels himself being jerked up like a fish into a boat and then hes lying in garbage franks heavy body on top of him and a gun barrel pressed against his left temple go ahead and yell frank whispers john shakes his head good decision frank says now make it two in a rowtell me who sent you to mouse junior nobody john whispers john youre a mediocre cook and a night manager at a titty joint frank says you dont have the swag to order a hit and the next lie you tell me i swear ill pop you and leave your body here in the garbage where it belongs i didnt want to frank john whines they said they could help me who johnny who came to you teddy migliore teddy migliore frank thinks owner of callahans and scion of the combination its not good news help you with what ive been indicted frank indicted on this gsting shit john says i was the bagman i brought cash to a cop he was undercover john blurts out the rest of the story he was being squeezed from both sides the feds offering him a deal to flip the wise guys threatening to whack him to keep him from talking i was totally fucked frank then teddy migliore offered him a way out if john went to mouse junior and made him a deal he could walk the mob wouldnt clip him and theyd get him off the indictment or at least get him a pardon and youbelieved this crap frank asks him knowing its a useless question a condemned man will believe anything that will give him even a little hope he cocks the hammer of the pistol and feels john flinch underneath him dont frank please john says im sorry frank eases the hammer back down then johns body lurches into sobs im going to leave now johnny frank whispers you lie here for five minutes before you get out if you feel bad about what you did to me youll wait an hour before you call teddy if you dont well theres nothing i can do about it frank climbs out of the dumpster and brushes the garbage off itll be good to get someplace where he can take a shower and get a change of clothes but right now he has something else to do he walks to his car and opens the trunk frank stands across the street from callahans waiting for it to close its a long cold wait at two in the morning finally the trendy young crowd starts to pour out and a few minutes later the bouncer goes to lock the door thats when frank steps in the bouncer takes a swing at him frank ducks underneath the punch pulls the softball bat from under his coat and tony gwynns the bouncers shin bones the resultingcrack and the bouncer toppling to the sidewalk gets some attention from the afterhours crowd inside the bar one of the boys rushes frank frank butts him in the solar plexus with the blunt end of the bat then swings the handle up in an arc and catches the man under the chin he takes a step back to let the guy fall then sees the next man reach in his jacket into shoulderholster territory frank swings the bat and breaks the guys wrist against the gun butt the bartender vaults the bar with a nightstick in his hand and swings it down toward the back of franks head frank turns raises the bat horizontally to block the nightstick pulls his arms back in and then thrusts the bat back into the bartenders nose which breaks with a splatter of blood then frank crosses his right foot over his left whirls and delivers a homerun swing into the bartenders floating ribs three guys down teddy migliore stands there like his feet are rooted to the spot then he turns and runs frank lofts the bat low across the floor it bounces and catches teddy in the back of the knees sending him sprawling to the floor franks on top of him before he canstart to get up he puts his right knee into the small of teddys back grabs him by the back of the collar and smashes his face into the expensive tile until he can see blood trickle into the grouting what frank yells did i ever do to you huh what did i ever do to you frank leans down slips one hand under teddys chin and lifts as his other arm forms a bar across the top of teddys neck he can either snap teddys spinal cord or choke him out or both nothing teddy gasps i just got the word is all whogave the word frank asked frank hears police sirens start to wail some citizen must have spotted the bartender writhing on the sidewalk and called the cops frank puts more pressure on teddys neck vince teddy says why why did vince want me clipped i dont know teddy groans i swear frankie i dont know he just told me to deliver you deliver me frank thinks like a pizza and teddys lying he knows exactly why vince wanted to kill me or else hes just laying it all on a dead man police come out with your hands where we can see them frank lets go of teddy steps over him into the office and lets himself out the back door as hes leaving he hears a voice on the answering machineteddy its me john frank steps out in the alley and runs teddy migliore sits in his office and rubs his throat he looks up at the uniformed cops and says you sure took your timethe fucking money we pay the cops dont look too eaten up with sympathy theyve stopped taking the money anyway youd have to be a fucking idiot to take an envelope from teddy migliore these days what with everything going on operation gsting do you know who did this one of the cops asks do you want to file a report asks the other get the fuck out of here teddy tells them hes going to file a report all right but not with these two losers he waits until theyve left though to pick up the phone frank jogs out of the alley and back onto the street you had it exactly backward dummy he tells himself it wasnt la who contracted with vince to take you out it was vince who used la or at least mouse junior to set you up but why he cant think of a thing he ever did to vince vena or the migliores he can only think of something he didfor them it was the summer of the summer frank came back from vietnam the truth of the matter is frank thinks now as he watches the rain splatter against the window of his safe house the truth is that i killed more men for the feds than i ever did for the mob and they gave me a medal and an honorable discharge frank punched out a lot of vc and nva during his stint incountry that was his jobsniperand he was damned good at it sometimes he felt bad about it but he never felt guilt over it they were soldiers he was a soldier and in a war soldiers kill soldiers frank never bought into any of thatapocalypse now crap he never shot any women or children or massacred any villages or even saw anyone who did he just killed enemy soldiers the tet offensive was made for guys like frank because the enemy came out to be shot before that it had been frustrating patrols in the jungle that usually turned up nothing except when you walked into a vc ambush and lost a couple of guys and still never saw the enemy but in tet they came out en masse and got gunned down en masse frank was a oneman wrecking machine in the city of hue the urban housetohouse fighting was a perfect match for his skills and frank found himself in manoamano duels with nva snipers that sometimes went on for days those were battles of wit and skill frank always won he came back from nam to find that the country hed left didnt exist anymore race riots peace riots hippies lsd the surf scene was just about dead because a lot of the guys were in nam or were screwed up because of it or they went the hippie route and were living in communes in oregon frank put his uniform away and went to the beach spent long weeks surfing mostly by himself holding his own small bonfires and cookouts trying to reclaim the past but it wasnt the same patty was shed written him every day he was incountry long chatty letters about what was going on at home who was dating who who had broken up about her secretary work her parents his parents whatever and love stuffpassionate passages about how she felt about him how she couldnt wait for him to come home and she couldnt the former good catholic girl walked him up to her room the second her parents left the house and pulled him down on the bed not that i took much pulling frank remembers god the first time with patty they got to the brink like they had so many times in the backseat of his car except this time she didnt clamp her legs tight or push him off instead she guided him inside her he was surprised but he certainly didnt object and when it came time to pull outall too quickly he remembers ruefullyshe whispered dont im on the pill which was a shock she had gone to the doctor and then went on the pill in anticipation of his homecoming she told him as they lay on her bed afterward her head snuggled into the crook of his arm i wanted to be ready for you she said then shyly added was i okay you were terrific and then he was hard againgod to be young frank thinksand they did it again and this time she climaxed and said that if shed known what she was missing she would have done it a lot sooner patty was good in bedwarm willing passionate sex was never their problem so frank got back with patty and they began the long inevitable march toward matrimony what wasnt inevitable was franks future what was he going to do now with his marine tour winding down he thought about reupping maybe making the corps a career but patty didnt want him going back to vietnam and he didnt like being away from san diego that much his father wanted him to go into the fishing business but that didnt sound all that appealing either he could have gone to college on the gi bill but there was nothing he was that interested in studying so it was a gimme putt hed end up back with the guys it was nothing dramatic nothing sudden frank just ran into mike pella one day and they had a beer and then they started hanging out mike told him about his past how he grew up in new york with the profaci family and had a little hassle there and then was sent out west to work for bap until things straightened out but he liked california he liked bap and so hed decided to stay who needs the fucking snow right mike asked not me frank thought he started to go with mike to the clubs where the guys spent their days andthis hadnt changed this had stayed the same like it was in a time warp it was comforting familiar familial i guess frank thinks now it was all the same guysbap chris panno and mike of course jimmy forliano had a trucking business out in east county and hed come around sometimes but that was really about it they were a small tight little group in what was back then still a small town that was the thing about san diego in those days frank thinks now we werent really even a mob or an obvious family like they had in the big east coast cities and there wasnt a hell of a lot going on the normally free and easy san diego had a new federal prosecutor who was busting everyones balls hed worked up a twentyeightcount indictment against jimmy and bap for some bullshit about the truckers union and was generally making life difficult for whatever organized crime there was in the city bap also had a silent piece of a local taxi company and he set frank up with a job driving cabs washing machines on wheels is what they really were the guys laundered so much money through those taxis gambling money loan shark money prostitution moneyit all went on cab rides and political money to city councilmen congressmen judges cops you name it the chief of police got a new car every year courtesy of the cab company then there was richard nixon he was running for president and needed a war chest and it just wouldnt have looked goodmobbedup guys in san diego writing checks to the nixon campaign so the money went through the cab company in chunks donated by the owners and the drivers frank never would have found out about it except that he saw one of the checks on the office desk one night im giving money to nixon he asked mike we all are im a democrat frank said notthis year you aint mike said what you want bobby fucking kennedy in the white house guys got a hardon for us you could cut glass with besides it aint really your money is it so relax frank was sitting in the office of the cab company with mike drinking coffee and talking shit when the call came are you boys ready to take a step up bap asked he was calling from a phone booth bap never called from home because bap wasnt stupid what hed do is hed put rolls of quarters in his pocket and hed walk four blocks to this phone booth on mission boulevard at night and conduct his business from there like it was his office usually theyd meet bap on the boardwalk in pacific beach just a few blocks from the bosss house you wouldnt have figured a guy like bap to have loved the ocean so much something he and frank had in common although of course bap never got out on a board or even went for a swim as far as frank ever knew no bap just liked looking at the ocean he and marie used to go for sunset walks together on the boardwalk or stroll on crystal pier their condo had a nice oceanfront view too and bap used to stand at the window and do watercolors bad watercolors he had dozens of them scores of them probably and he used to give them out as presents all the time otherwise marie would bitch about him clogging up their whole place with the paintings bap would give them for christmas birthdays anniversaries groundhog day anything all the guys had themwhat were you going to say no frank had one on the wall of his little apartment on india streetit was a sailboat heading out into the sunset because bap knew that frank liked boats which was true frank did like boats which made this watercolor all the more painful because no vessel should have to suffer what bap did to this boat but frank kept it on his wall because you never knew when bap might drop by and frank didnt want to hurt his feelings this worked because he wasnt married yet the married guys wives usually made them put baps paintings in a closet or something because the married guys were usually made men and protocol even in casual san diego dictated that even a boss didnt just drop by without a phone call but there had been some frantic replacements of paintings on walls when the phone call came with guys scrambling to get one of baps hideous watercolors up in the living room before the doorbell rang so if it was just normal business they met at the beach this day however bap told them to meet him at the zoo outside the reptile house the subject was a guy named jeffrey roth who mike asked you heard of tony star bap asked his face pressed up against the glass staring at a spitting cobra sure mike said they all had heard of tony star he was a rat from detroit whose testimony had put half that citys family away rocco zerilli jackie tominello angie vena they were all doing time because of tony star the papers had a field day with the irresistible headline tony star witness hes jeffrey roth now in the witness protection program bap said he started tapping on the glass trying to provoke the cobra into attacking you think you could get one of these guys to spit at you i dont think they want you doing that frank said he felt bad for the snake which was just minding its own business bap looked at him like he was nuts and frank got it they probably didnt want bap killing people hijacking trucks shylocking money and running gambling operations either so he probably wasnt going to stop tapping on the glass at the zoo indeed bap tapped on the glass some more then asked guess where star is living now mission beach no shit mike said it was a personal affront a rat living right in their own backyard frank and mike had had many discussions on the subjects of rats it was the worstpossible thing in the world to be the lowest of the low you gotta be a standup guy mike had said were all grown men we know the risks if you get popped you keep your mouth shut and do your time frank had agreed absolutely id die before id go into the program hed said now they had a guy who had put half the detroit family in the joint and here he was hanging out and enjoying himself on mission beach howd they find him mike asked the spitting cobra had curled itself into a ball and looked like it was asleep bap gave up and moved on to the puff adder in the next cage it was wrapped around a tree limb coiled and looking dangerous some secretary in the justice department that tony jacks got on the arm bap said tapping on the adders cage he took a slip of paper out of his pocket and handed it to frank the note had an address in mission beach written on it detroit wanted to send their own guys but i said no its a matter of honor fuckin right it is mike said our turf our responsibility and its worth twenty grand bap said the puff adder struck at the glass and bap jumped back about five feet losing his glasses in the process frank suppressed a laugh as he picked them up wiped them off on his sleeve and handed them to bap sneaky fuckers bap said taking the glasses theyre camouflaged mike said frank and mike went out and bought some geeky clothes that made them look like tourists and checked into a motel on kennebec court on mission beach they spent most of their time looking out through venetian blinds at tony stars condo across mission boulevard were kind of like cops mike said the first night in how do you figure i mean this is what they do right mike asked stakeouts i guess frank said first time he ever felt sorry for cops because being on a stakeout was boring it gave whole new meaning to the wordtedium sitting there drinking bad coffee taking turns going to kentucky fried chicken mcdonalds or a local taco joint eating off your lap on sheets of greasy paper what this garbage was doing to his insides frank could only guess heknew what it was doing to mikes insides because it was a small room and when mike opened the door as he came out of the bathroomanyway frank started feeling bad for cops he and mike would take shifts one of them keeping watch out the window while the other grabbed some sleep or watched some bad television show they only got a break when star went out which he did at every morning to go jogging they discovered this the first morning when star came out the front door of the building in a purple jumpsuit and running shoes and started doing stretches against the rail of the building steps what the fuck mike asked hes going running frank said heshould go fucking running said mike he looks good though frank observed star did look good he had a nice tan his black razorcut hair was neatly brushed back and he was thin they decided only one guy should tail him and mike took the job he came back an hour later sweaty and incensed fucking guy mike huffed goes jogging around the marina like he dont have a worry in the world scoping the chicks looking at the boats soaking in the sunshine working on his fucking tan cocksucker is leading the good life while friends of his are in the hole im telling you we shouldhurt this motherfucker before we take him out frank agreedstarshould suffer for what hed donebut those werent the orders bap had been very clear about thatquick and clean was how he wanted it get in do the job get out the sooner the better as far as frank was concerned patty hadnt been too thrilled about him going away like this where are you going shed asked come on patty what for why business what kind of business shed pressed why cant you tell me youre just going out to party with your buddies arent you some party frank thought sharing a cheap motel room with mike pella listening to his constant toilet mouth sucking in his cigarette smoke smelling his gas spending hour after tedious hour looking out the window trying to establish the pattern of some rats pathetic life because that was the key a pattern bap had coached him on that guys lapse into habits he had told frank everyone does people are predictable once you can predict what a guys going to do and when hes going to do it then you can find your opening quick and clean in and out so they knew he went jogging around the marina every morning mike wanted to do it then we get ourselves some fag tracksuits we run up behind him and we pop him in the head done frank vetoed it too many things could go wrong one him and mike joggingtheyd stick out like polar bears in a sauna two theyd be out of breath and it was hard to shoot accurately when you were out of breath even from short range three thered just be too many potential witnesses so they had to figure something else out problem was star wasnt giving them many openings he lived a very boring life predictable as death and taxes but very tight hed go jogging in the morning then come home shower presumably and change clothes then go to his job at an insurance agency where hed work from ten to six then hed walk back to his condo and stay there until he went jogging again in the morning this is one dull motherfucker mike said he dont go out to no clubs no bars dont pick up no broads what the guy just sits in there jacking himself off every night biggest excitement in this guys life is pizza night every thursday night star had a pizza delivered to his door i love you mike you going fag on me pizza night frank said star buzzes the guy in this was on a tuesday so they pretty much relaxed for a couple of days laid low and waited for pizza night wednesday night they ordered a pizza from the same joint ate it and saved the box at exactly frank was at the front door of stars building with the pizza box in his hand mike was in the work car on the street ready to drive them out of there and to intercept the pizza guy with some sort of bullshit if he had to frank rang the bell and shouted into the intercom pizza mr roth a second later the buzzer sounded and frank heard the metallic click of the lock opening he went into the building walked down the hallway to stars unit and rang the bell star opened it a crack keeping the chain on the door frank could hear the drone of a television so this was the rats big life frank thought treating himself to a pizza while he watches the boob tube pizza frank repeated wheres the usual kid star asked sick frank said hoping this thing wasnt going south he got ready to kick the door in but star opened it first he had his money in his handa five and two ones sixfifty right star asked holding out the bills frank reached into his pocket like he was digging for a couple of quarters keep the change star said thanks a fiftycent tip frank thought no selfrespecting wise guy in the world would give a fiftycent tip no wonder he turned rat frank handed star the pizza box and when the guys hands were full frank pushed him inside kicked the door shut behind him and pulled the silenced pistol star tried to run frank put the bead on the back of his head and fired star fell forward and crashed into the wall frank stepped up over stars prone body and aimed at the back of his head rat frank said he pulled the trigger three more times and walked out the whole thing had taken maybe a minute frank got in the car mike put it in gear and drove away howd it go mike asked fine frank said mike grinned youre a machine he said frankie machine wasnt that the name of a guy that sinatra played in the movies frank asked the man with the golden arm mike said he was a junkie great but you mike said youre the man with the goldenhand frankie machine the name stuck they took ingraham street down to the floodway frank got out smashed the pistol on some rocks and threw the pieces into the water then they dumped the work car in a strip mall parking lot in point loma where they found two other cars waiting frank got into his and drove downtown dumped the car took a taxi to the airport then another taxi back home nothing ever came of it the san diego cops pretty much took a pass on the case sending a message of their own to the feds if youre going to put a snitch in our yard and not tell us about it what the hell do you want us to do the truth is nobody really likes snitches not even the cops who make their bread and butter from them frank got up the next morning made coffee and turned on the television it was showing the kitchen of some hotel in los angeles what youre surprised mike asked him later that morning kind of im only surprised it didnt happen sooner mike said and thats the way it is frank thought bobby gets two in the head nixon gets checks there was a lot of celebration down at the cab office when nixon got elected one of the first things the new president did was to transfer the san diego federal prosecutor who was putting so much pressure on the guys the indictments against bap were dropped although forliano went into the can other than that it was back to business as usual frank and mike split two thousand dollars for the tony star job frank bought an engagement ring with his cut so he was a married man when he met president nixon it was partially as a reward for the tony star thing frank and mike had been bumped up from driving cabs to driving limousines and town cars when they werent driving they were on the hustle frank probably put more hours in than your average working stiff but it was different it wasnt like you were working for that hourly wage with uncle taking his piece out of it even though they were working hard it didnt feel like working it was more like playing a game which is why they called it scoring frank guessed thats what they did in those days they scored they went out on scores they scored merchandise off the backs of trucks street tax from bookies vig from shylock money noshow jobs on construction projects they ran card and dice games sports books and lotteries they made roundtrip runs across the mexican borderalcohol down and cigarettes back they practically had a license from the san diego cops to rip off drug dealers they were scoring making money although not much of it stuck to their hands most of it they had to kick up to chris who kicked up to bap who kicked up to nicky locicero even with all their scoring and hustling they really werent getting ahead frank resented it but mike being from the east coast was more oldschool its the way it is frankie hed lecture when frank would complain its the rules were not even made guys yet we gotta show we canearn frank wasnt into the whole made guy thing he really didnt give a damn about all that old sicilian stuff he was just trying to make a living stash away enough money for a down payment on a house threeplus years of busting his hump and he and patty were still renting a walkup apartment in the old neighborhood and he was working all the timewhen he wasnt on a score he was driving the limo mostly back and forth from the airport to la sur mer spa up in carlsbad mike about shit when he heard frank had driven moe dalitz from the airport to la sur mer or just the sur as it was known to the locals and cognoscenti dalitz went way backhe had been an admiral in detroits little jewish navy before the venas moved in and chased him to cleveland he eventually became chicagos eyes and ears in vegas where he was considered the jewish godfather dalitz fuckingbuilt the sur mike said he got the teamsters to put up the money the teamsters central states pension fund was jointly controlled by the chicago and detroit families mike explained the gobetween was a insurance executive named allen dorner the son of red dorner who was buddies with chicago boss tony accardo dorner frank asked yeah he was in my car dalitzand dorner yeah they were going to play golf frank said the teamsters played a lot of golf at la sur they kept frank and mike very busy running them back and forth from the airport or around town or out at night frank figured thats why hed been bumped up to town carsthe bosses wanted a connected guy driving the car so that the teamsters and the wise guys could talk without worrying about it just drive bap had told him keep your ears open and your mouth shut it wasnt just dalitz and dorner either it was also frank fitzsimmons who had taken over as president of the teamsters while hoffa was serving his sentence fitzsimmons loved the sur so much he bought a condo there and started holding the unions annual board meeting at the hotel then there were the outandout wise guys mostly east coast higherups getting out of the snow for a while there was tony provenzano tony pro who ran the new jersey teamsters and joey the clown lombardo who was the liaison between chicago and allen dorner and detroit guyspaul moretti and tony jacks giacamone who ran hoffa one day bap called frank and mike told them to get their limos spit and polished to look sharp themselves and be over at the airport exactly at nine the following morning whats up frank asked he figured something big was going on because the night before hed made two trips to the airport to pick up joey the clown and tony pro and theyd checked into suites at the sur what was up was that frank fitzsimmons president of the teamsters was going to hold a press conference at the sur to announce that the union was going to endorse nixon for reelection theres a surprise frank thought the whispers around the sur were that the teamsters had funneled millions of dollars of illegal funds into nixons campaign fund in fact the spa had become the virtual west coast headquarters for the teamsters since dorner had bought himself a condo overlooking the fourth green frank smirked so this is why nixon pardoned hoffa bap smiled and said hoffa is nothing but a cheap leg breaker out of his league with the big money fitzsimmons and dorner are raking in so much cash most people dont want hoffa back in office hoffa wants them clipped but the fact is theyre making everybody too much money listen and learn frankie making money for other people is what keeps you breathing never forget that frank didnt anyway bap said after the press conference youre driving the union guys to the western white house you might meet the president frankie arent you coming bap smiled but frank could see there was hurt behind it im not on the list bap said none of the guys are thats not right bap its all bullshit bap said the fuck do i care but frank could see that he cared in the morning with his car gleaming and himself in a freshly pressed black suit frank drove to the private airstrip in carlsbad to pick up allen dorner from his private jet word was that dorner had laid out three million dollars to frank sinatra for the gulfstream and that the money had come from the teamsters fund good morning frank dorner said as he stepped off the plane onto the tarmac good morning mr dorner its going to be a beautiful day always is in san diego frank replied holding the back door of the car open for him it was a quick drive to the sur frank waited in the parking lot with the other drivers as fitzsimmons made his endorsement speech and the sixteen other board members stood by beaming all the board members are here frank thought but the wise guys are nowhere to be seen do you believe mike said looking very spiffy and a little nervous as he stood beside his immaculate car that were going to the fuckingpresidents house after his speech fitzsimmons and three other board members got into franks car the other cars followed them as frank led them out onto the and drove up to san clemente to the western white house frank had been there before well not exactly to the house but right below it under the red bluff he and some surfing buddies had hiked up from trestles and found this great righthand break under the western white house for some reason or other this spot had the name cottons maybe i should tell nixon about it frank thought as he pulled up to the gate where secret service agents in their dark suits sunglasses and earpieces stopped him and checked the car out then again he thought its a little hard to picture richard nixon on a board waving thatv for victory thing he did while hanging ten in the soup cowabunga dude the secret service guys let the caravan through why not frank thought nixon couldnt be safer in his mothers arms than he was with this delegation although none of them was strapped having received strict orders to leave the hardware at home after all were his people were all making money together another secret service agent directed him where to park he did then got out to open the doors for fitzsimmons and his boys and saw the president of the united states walking down to meet them frank even with the twentysomething cynicism that was part and parcel of the seventies had to admit he felt a little awed maybe even intimidated this was thepresident of the united states the commander in chief and the former marine in frank made him straighten his posture a little bit and he had to fight the impulse to salute he felt something elsethis little stirring of pride at being in on this even as a chauffeur it was this feeling of being part of somethingso powerfulit could bring them to the home of the president of the united states and the man would personally walk down from his house to greet them nixon opened his arms wide as he walked toward fitzsimmons and said i hear you have good news for me frank verygood news mr president it must have been because nixon was in a very good mood he embraced fitzsimmons and then went around and shook everybodys hand working the crowd like the career politician he was he shook all the board members hands then came around and even shook the drivers hands nice to meet you nixon said to frank thanks for coming frank didnt know what to say he was afraid of saying something stupid like what was in his head which was you have a great break here mr president but nixon had already moved on well before frank formed the words thats the last frank saw of him that day the teamsters board went up to the house and the drivers waited by their cars the house staff brought them barbecued chicken and ribsthe same meal the big shots were getting up on the lawn later on some staffer came and gave them each a golf ball with the presidents signature on it im going to keep this for fucking ever mike said frank could swear he saw tears in his eyes frank wandered down to the edge of the bluff he had lots of time because the teamsters were scheduled to play a round on the presidents threehole golf course and that was going to take a while so frank sat by the ocean and watched cottons break below him there were no surfers out there never were when nixon was in residence i guess the secret service is afraid of some surfing assassin or something frank thought although it would be one hell of a shot from the beach up to the lawn he looked south and sure enough could see the westernmost buildings of the sur glistening white in the sun and he wondered what joey the clown and tony pro were doing while everybody else was visiting the presidents house wondered if they felt bad being left out that was the summer of the summer of richard nixon by the winter of it had all gone to shit nicky locicero died in the fall of his funeral was pathetic just immediate familynone of the guys showed up because they didnt want to give the feds any ammo the feds werepounding the la family it was like the fbi was living inside the guys heads the prosecutors seemed to know everything and the feds xerox machines were breaking down they were cranking out so many indictments and the indictments were rocksolid even sherm simon advised the guys to plead out which they did peter martini got popped for four years jimmy regace who had just taken over as boss for two he named old paul drina as acting boss bap thought it should have been him he was very pissed off tom is a lawyer whos never got his hands wet bap said to frank whats he ever done other than be jacks brother and they jump him over me after all ive done for them this was baps constant refrain back in the seventies the after all ive done for them mantra the fact that it was justified didnt make it any less tedious or futile though fact was frank was sick of hearing it there comes a time in a mans life he figured the infamous midlife crisis when a guy has to face the reality that what he has is all hes going to get and he needs to find his peace and his happiness in his life as it is most guys managed to get that done but not baphe was always griping about how hed been screwed how this guy or that guy had done him dirt in a deal how there were guys who were dead wood and he was sick of carrying them how la never cut him in for his fair piece of the pie whatpie frank thought as he heard this litany for maybe the thousandth time theres practically no pie to cut up what with half the guys in the can and new york and chicago picking the bones like vultures which was why frank had taken his meager savings and gone into the fish business mike could laugh at him all he wanted and make jokes about how frank smelled like a mackerel which wasnt truea frank showered meticulously after work and b there were no mackerel in the pacific ocean but the money was clean and safe and while he wasnt raking it in like you could with the rackets when everything was good everythingwasnt good and they couldnt expect any help from on high either because the guy in the white house had his own problems and he wasnt about to reach a hand out to a bunch of mobsters so it was a bad time for things to go haywire at the sur but they did june the summer of frank got a call from baps phone booth office you and mike get your asses here quick frank heard the urgency in his voice and told him they could be in pacific beach in half an hour not pacific beach bap said the sur and come heavy it was fort sur mer driving up to the main building frank spotted half a dozen wise guys all dressed casually like guests but posted to control the avenues of access and frank knew that under the polo shirts and the gabardine trousers or tucked in golf bags or tennis frames the guys were carrying serious hardware frank parked in a slot across from dorners condo bap must have seen them pull up because he was walking toward them before frank even turned the motor off come on come on bap said opening franks door whats up hoffas making his play bap said he might be putting a hit out on dorner frank had never seen bap this worked up when they got into dorners condo frank could see why the heavy drapes were pulled closed against the big glass slider that normally looked out on the golf course jimmy forliano stood at the edge of the curtain peeking out a holster with a strapped on his shoulder joey lombardo was in the kitchen getting a beer out of the fridge carmine antonucci sat on the sofa sipping coffee dorner sat next to him a gin and tonic sweating on the glasstop coffee table at his knees in a big chair across from them sat tony jacks looking cool and collected in a white linen suit and a royal blue tie dorner looked up at them as if hed never seen them before even though they had hauled him back and forth from his private jet at least a few dozen times he didnt look good he looked pale and tired hi guys he said his voice was weak you stay tighter on dorner than his own asshole tony jacks said he dont shit shave or shower he dont look over his shoulder and not see one of you there anything happens to him it happens to you next the siege went on for three weeks hey mike said about a week in if youre going to go to the mattresses there are worse places to do it than the sur moregodfather jive frank thought if anybody had ever gone to the mattresses in san diego before this they were air mattresses in swimming pools dorner started to get cabin fever i want to get out he said play a little golf just take a fucking walk get a little sun frank shook his head no can do mr dorner he had strict orders i feel like a prisoner in my own home dorner said its not far from the truth frank thought beginning to wonder if they were protecting dornerfrom hoffa orfor him he expressed this to bap one day as he was walking him out of the condo bap looked at him for a long moment youre a smart boy frankie bap said youre going to go places it could go either way bap explained chicago and detroit were working it out all they could do was wait basically tony jacks was fighting for his boy hoffa while the chicago boys were taking up for fitzsimmons and dorner bap was betting on fitzsimmons and dorner because they were the better earners but then again hoffas detroit connections were long and strong and tony jacks was lobbying hard for both dorner and fitzsimmons to get the chop dont let yourself get too close to the guy bap said meaning dorner you dont know what you might have to do huh so that was it they were guarding dorner and they wereguarding him they werent letting anybody in and they werent letting him out it was weird sitting there playing rummy with the guy night after night knowing you might be called on to whack him so it was tense it got a lot more tense when mike came back from a little walk took frank aside and whispered to him we gotta talk he wasshook mike pella who was usuallyice looked shaken its bap mike said whatsbap frank asked with this edge to his voice but he already knew the answer he felt like he could throw up bapsbeen talking to the feds mike said hes been wearing a wire no frank said shaking his head except he already knew it was true it made sensebap had finally found his way to take out the la leadershipcooperate with the feds and put them in jail then when theyd made paul drina boss instead he decided he needed to finish the job how do youknow this frank whispered dorner was asleep in his bedroom but frank wasnt taking any chances hed overhear the guys set him up mike said they tossed him some bullshit about a porn shakedown and the feds showed up at it and now mike said la was wondering ifall baps guys were in on this coup by cop frank mike said you gotta figure theyre thinking about clippingall of us he was freaking out now paranoia pumping adrenaline what if bap gaveus up too he didnt frank said still hoping we dont know that mike said what if he takes the stand he could put us up for desanto star if he had frank said wed have been arrested by now the feds dont sit on murder indictments no if this was true baps strategy was to get rid of la by giving them up to the feds then basically replace the la guys with his own san diego crew which was why not a single san diego guy had been named in the sweeping indictments the previous summer it had always been baps dream to run california from san diego wed be his two captains frank said the fuck you talking about frank laid out his analysis of baps plan and repeated bap is planning to make us the captains in his new family he kept us out of the indictments he kept us off the tape so what we owe him yeah do we owe him our fuckinglives frankie mike asked because thats what were talking about here mike was right frank hated to admit it but mike was absolutely right it was eitheror either they took bap out or they jumped in the boat with him and that boat was going down so there it was the afternoons in dorners luxurious jail cell got real long now there were three guys sitting around wondering if they were going to get whacked trying to keep their minds off it by watching other guys rat on their boss the end of july they got the word jimmy hoffa had disappeared so frank thought i guess chicago and detroit worked it out and he learned if its a contest between old connections and money put your money on money dorner took a big sigh of relief and kicked the two men out of his house they werent so glad to go nobody was going to clip them in dorners condo outside it might be a different story frank went home and got an uneasy nights sleep bap called at ten in the morning from his phone booth telling frank to come right over that he had some news frank met him on the boardwalk at pacific beach bap had his easel set up he was out there painting and the man wasbeaming they made meconsigliore bap said the pride in his voice was palpable centanni frank said its overdue its not boss bap said its not all i wanted but its a significant honor its anacknowledgment you know what i mean frank wanted to cry maybe that was all the man had ever wanted anattaboy a pat on the back not a lot to ask but frank knew what it really was it was poison wrapped in candy a sleeping pill to lull bap into a feeling of security it was a death sentence frank almost told him but he choked the words back im going to take care of you bap said tranquilly painting his crappy watercolor of the ocean dont you worry you and mike im going to see that you get straightened out thanks bap dont thank me bap said youve earned it marie came out of the house with two tall glasses of iced tea for them she wasnt a hot little number anymore but she still looked good and it was clear from the way she looked at her husband that she adored him youre almost done with this painting huh she said looking over her husbands shoulder its good it isnt frank thought only a loving wife would say it was the next call came from mike they met down at dog beach watched golden retrievers fetch frisbees its a done deal mike said la chicago and detroit have all signed off chris panno gets san diego we report to chicago until la gets its act together yeah when willthat be frank asked avoiding the real topic we gotta do it mike said hes ourboss mike hes a fucking rat mike said he has to go you want to go with him thats your choice but im telling you right now it aint mine frank stared out at the ocean thinking hed like to get out on a board and just paddle maybe get his ass kicked in a big wave and getcleansed look ill do it that makes you feel better mike said youdrive this time no frank said ill do it he went home that afternoon turned on the television and watched nixon walk to a helicopter then stand there and wave jimmy forliano made an appointment for bap to call him that night it was raining that night along the coast bap was wearing a windbreaker and one of those old wiseguy fedoras like they used to wear in the movies he took it off when he got inside the phone booth frank sat in the car and watched him take the roll of quarters out of his pocket and knock it against the little metal shelf to break the paper open then he started feeding quarters into the phone forliano was up in murietta a longdistance call frank couldnt hear him say its me but even through the rain and the glass he could see his lips move he waited until bap was in the middle of the conversation not worried about it ending early forliano was a bullshit artist if there was anything he could do it was talk frank had a pistol for this job not his usual dont sign your work bap had told him he flipped the hood of his windbreaker up over his head and stepped outside the street was emptypeople in san diego dont come out at night in the rain only bap did that to come to his office bap dropped the roll of quarters when he saw frank they clattered to the floor some of them rolling around like they were trying to escape bap tried to hold the door shut he knew frank thought he knows there was a little hurt look in his eyes as he tried to hold the door but frank was too strong and just ripped it open im sorry frank said he put four shots into baps face the blood followed him back into the street frank went to the funeral marie seemed inconsolable later on she sued the fbi for negligence the suit didnt get very far neither did the murder investigation the feds liked jimmy for it and charged him and threw the hit into the indictment salad against la with everything else but they had no evidence and couldnt prove anything and frank got his button for that night him and mike they had a cheesy ceremony in the back of a car pulled off the i near riverside with chris panno and jimmy forliano that was it chris just pulled off the side of the road and jimmy turned around to the backseat pricked franks thumb with a pin kissed him on the cheeks and said congratulations youre in they didnt hold burning paper or a stiletto or a gun or anything like that it was nothing like it was supposed to have been in the old days nothing like it was in the movies mike was disappointed frank went straight after the hit on bap mike went to san quentin he had gotten popped for extorting local gamblersthe feds had a wire tap of him and jimmy regace discussing it so they were both jacked up good the feds tried to put him behind the wheel for the baptista hit with forliano as the triggerman and tried to get him to trade up but mike didnt buy the bluff and he wouldnt have taken the deal anyway whatever else mike was or wasnt he wasnt a rat and he never breathed franks name nobody did and frank sweated it out literally down in rosarito that same spring the california crime commission listed ninetythree names on its organized crime list and frank wasnt on it he figured that he had dodged a big bullet so it was time to lay low frank saw richard nixon one more time it was the autumn of and the president wasnt the president anymore but theex president in exile and disgrace in san clemente he came down to the sur in october to play in fitzsimmonss golf tournament his first public appearance since being hounded out of office frank was in the parking lot when nixons limo pulled in and he saw him get out of the car nixon didnt look jaunty anymore he looked beaten and old but he played a full eighteen holes and this time he didnt seem to mind being seen with the likes of allen dorner and joey the clown and tony jacks who were playing too they didnt mind being seen with richard nixon is it possible frank wonders could marie baptista baps widow have learned something in her suit against the fbi bided her time saved her money maybe put out a contract on me that vince picked up its unlikely but i have to find out he gets in the rental car and heads for pacific beach marie baptista still lives in the same house frank hasnt seen her since baps funeral thirty years ago he remembers the way to the house though now he walks up the narrow little path between the welltended flower gardens and rings the bell like he used to do in the old days when he was coming to pay his respects marie still looks great tiny diminished in the way of old people but still great she still has that pretty face and the bright eyes and one look at those eyes tells frank that this old lady could commission a hit to revenge her husband mrs baptista frank says do you remember me frankie machianno she looks puzzled shes trying hard but its not coming to her or shes a terrific actress i used to work with your husband frank prompts as a matter of fact i worked forboth of them he thinks i used to drive you to get your groceries frank says her face brightens frankiewont you come in he steps inside the place has that musty floweryperfume smell that comes with old ladies but its as neat as a pin and clean she must have help come in bap must have left her comfortable good for bap would you care for some tea marie asks i dont drink coffee anymore my bowels tea would be nice frank says can i help you i just put water on marie says sit ill only be a minute frank sits on the sofa baps crappy paintings hang all over the walls watercolor after watercolor of ocean scenesand a bad portrait of her bap at his worst but she must love it to her she looks beautiful photos of bap sit on every flat surface the bad combover the big bug eyes the thick glasses the awkward smile frank has a different picture of bap burned in his head bap in the phone booth blood running marie comes in with two cups on saucers frank stands and takes one of the cups from her then steadies her as she sits in her chair its so nice to see you frankie she says nice to see you frank says im sorry i havent come more often she smiles and nods if it was her frank thinks youd know it by now shed look scared or guilty you would see it in her eyes did you bring my groceries she asks no maam frank says i dont do that now oh she looks confused i thought do youneed groceries mrs baptista frank asks well yes she looks around the room my listi thought iwhere is it is it in the kitchen frank asks may i go look shes frowning looking around the room frank gets up sets his teacup on a doily on the side table and walks into the kitchen he finds the list taped near the telephone she either forgot to call the delivery service or forgot that she called either way mrs baptista he says as he steps back into the living room may i go get these for you thats your job isnt it she snaps yes maam it is he finds an albertsons in a strip mall three blocks away it doesnt take him long as the list is shorta few cans of tuna fish some bread some milk some orange juice he goes to the frozen section carefully chooses a few of the betterquality meals for one and tosses them into the basket he rings the bell again when he gets back she lets him in and he sets the bags down on the kitchen counter and starts putting things away he shows her the microwave dinners before he puts them in the freezer you can make these in five or six minutes he tells her i know that she says impatiently looking into the eyes of this old woman he has so many memories her in her black dress the hot little number al desanto and momo she was a tough lady surviving all that then marrying bap to boot she reaches out touches his arm and gives him her best charming smile oddly enough itis charming shes still beautiful ill tell momo she says you did a good job thank you maam you can call me marie i cant do that mrs baptista he puts the dinners in the freezer says goodbye and leaves yeah youre a great guy he thinks you kill the womans husband so you buy her a couple of frozen dinners that should make it okay but it wasnt marie who ordered the hit so im still stuck with the question why did vince vena want me dead and if he wasnt acting on his own then why did detroit want me dead doesnt matter he decides if detroit didnt have a beef against me before i killed vince they sure do now they cant just let someone kill a member of the ruling council of the combination and walk away even if it was in selfdefense so this isnt going to be any short mixup that can be quickly fixed theyll be coming in force and for the long haul and they wont quit until theyve put me in the dirt this is going to be a war and ill need the resources for a war he heads up to la jolla to see the nickel we have an id on your floater the rookie agent tells dave hes back in the fbi office downtown the young agent came in like an acolyte bringing the chalice to a bishop how did you know mr hansen dave dave says i feel old enough already today and i cant remember this kids name he thinks the new crop all look alike just like this one slim but muscular cleancut short hair tailored black or blue suits white shirts understated monotone ties this one is particularly meticulous about his clothes hes wearing the standard white shirt dave notices but it has french cuffs with expensive cuff links cuff links dave thinks whats it coming to and troythats the kids name troyvaughan but how did you know dave asks troy to check the fingerprints against the oc files he means still that was a lot of files and daves a little surprised they already have a hit supercomputers i guess he thinks in the old days it was a matter ofwho cares these arent the old days ididnt know dave says it was a hunch awesome you going to give me the id dave asks troy blushes and shows him the file vincent paul vena looks a lot better in his mug shot than he did on the rocks at point loma hes giving the camera that classic wiseguy i dont give a shit smile the one they must teach in goombah vena has quite a sheetsimple assault aggravated assault shylocking gambling extortion arson he did a five spot in leavenworth for the fire the michigan cops liked him for several murders in the nineties but couldnt hang any on him and the word is that hed just risen to the ruling council of the combination none of that means much to dave what does mean somethingmeans a lotis that vena was the guy in detroit whom teddy migliore kicked up to it was vena who looked after the san diego strip club and prostitution business for the combination whats a detroit guy doing in california troy asks vacationing says dave maybe dave thinks but probably not more likely he was out here doing damage control from the gsting indictments maybe hit somebody but it looks like someone hit back dave finishes reading the vena file then gets in his car and drives over to what used to be little italy frank machianno didnt show up again for the gentlemens hour or at the bait shop which was still locked up no one has reported him missing but he is missing goddamn it dave walks over to the downtown branch of the library where patty machianno works parttime just to have a chat with her not as an fbi agent but as a concerned friend shes not there he walks all over the building and doesnt see her so he asks a woman her age behind the front desk is patty here today the woman looks at him then glances at his wedding ring im a friend of franks he says because everyone loves frank the bait guy i was in the library thought id say hi patty called in sick yesterday the woman tells him said she wasnt sure how long shed be out thanks dave goes back to the office checks out a car and drives over to pattys house he rings the bell half a dozen times then snoops around the house peeking in windows the place is all locked up he looks in the mailbox and its empty no mail no newspaper he knows that patty takes theuniontrib because frank is always bitching about it she could read it at the library frank told him maybe she likes to read it over breakfast frank patty is a devoted padres and chargers fan and reads the sports section every morning shesaddicted to nick canepas columns dave calls the newspapers customerservice line hey frank machianno here he says i didnt get my paper this morning he gives the lady on the phone pattys address a few seconds later the girl gets back on the line and says sir you stopped delivery for two weeks dave ends the call dials the office and gets troy on the line troy get a license plate number and registration for a machianno patricia and start looking for the vehicle he spells out the name try the airport he tells troy not the main lot but one of the bargain lots a woman married to frank machianno for all those years wouldnt pay prime parking fees at the main airport lot shed go to one of the cheaper commercial lots off pch and take the complimentary van to the airport troy asks what file should i youdont dave snaps you dont open a file you just do what i ask yes sir and dont call me sir no dave feels badly about snapping at the kid he says troy youre doing a great job okay dave leaves pattys house and drives up to solana beach he feels a little guilty about doing it because frank doesnt know that dave knows about donna frank has a thing about keeping his private life well private and he probably wouldnt like dave intruding into his personal life except that theres a bureau intelligence file on frankie and daves studied every word of it im worried about you frank dave thinks as he drives north donna bryants shop is closed dave gets out of the car walks up to the door and reads the handlettered sign on vacation donna bryant doesnt take vacations dave has checked in on the shop from time to time and its always openseven days a week if donna bryant were really taking a vacation she would have planned it well in advance and would have arranged for someone to work the shop at the very least she would have had a printed sign made upwith a date announcing when she would reopen but she doesnt know when shell be back dave thinks she didnt know she was leaving either so franks in the wind his exwife is gone and his girlfriend who is as big or bigger a workaholic than even frank is goes on a sudden vacation all after a detroit strongarm man washes up on the rocks no it doesnt work that way frank machiannos in trouble but frank wouldnever go in the wind without making sure his loved ones were safe first patty and donna being gone is a good sign that frank is still alive that he told them to get scarce and then went off the grid himself and where is jill he debates whether to call her on the one hand he wants to make sure shes safe on the other hand he doesnt want to scare the hell out of her and theres something else jill machianno doesnt know that her father is and frank just got back on good terms with her and that means the world to him and the last thing dave wants to do is screw that up so find her he tells himself put a loose surveillance on her but let it go at that in the meantime it might be a good idea to put a little pressure on sherm simon see what the nickel has to say run thats what the nickel has to say when he gets franks call just the single word run before he sets the receiver down do not pass go do not collect two hundred dollars donot come by the office or anywhere near it just run run dave hansen asks hes sitting across the desk from sherm simon japanese movie simon answers kurosawa if you havent seen it you should that wasran ran run whats the difference a big difference dave says if that was frank machianno on the phone frank who dont play games with me i dont play games sherm says do you have a warrant agent hansen because if you dont he gestures to the door frank may be in trouble dave says no shit frank may be in trouble sherm thinks i may be in trouble weall may be in trouble theres trouble that youve had trouble that you presently have and trouble youre going to havethats the world you hold franks mad money dave says its a statement not a question i dont know what youre talking about im trying to help him dave says i seriously doubt that dave gets up and leans over the desk well dont seriously doubtthis the patriot act gives me carte blanche when it comes to money laundering mr simon i can open you up like a kids juice carton and spill you out all over the place you know goddamn well sherm says that frank machiannoand im not implying any relationship herehas nothing to do with terrorism the notion is ridiculous thats not what ill tell the judge no ill bet it isnt if you see him dave says if he contacts you you let me know right away sherm doesnt make any promises troy vaughan leaves the federal building to go grab some lunch they have a good cafeteria in the building but troy feels like getting some air he tucks theuniontribune under his arm and leaves his office its raining the receptionist tells him troy holds up his umbrella there are maybe three people in san diego who own an umbrella anyway its not raining hard and the umbrella stands up to the wind troy walks three blocks down to a little lunch place on broadway at the edge of the gaslamp district he finds a stool at the counter and sits down whats the soup of the day he asks the guy behind the counter vegetable bean troy orders the soup and halfsandwich special and unfolds his newspaper he removes the sports section sets it down on the stool beside him and starts to read the main section a minute later the guy two stools over gets up slides his check off the counter picks up the sports section and goes up to the register the man pays his check and walks out into the rain troy cautions himself to ignore the man walking out he makes himself sit and finish his sandwich and his cup of vegetable bean soup which he thinks is not exactly haute cuisine but good on a cold rainy day the fishermen were trying to bag a fourhundredpound marlin but they hooked a fourhundredpound bouncer instead grisly catch dave hansen gets the call that morning and goes down to the docks to meet the boat he isnt very worried about the forensics getting screwed up on a body thats been in the water for two days still and all it isnt hard to id tony palumbo a few hours later dave gets confirmation that palumbo was shot with the same gun that killed vince vena hypothesis vena had come out from detroit to get rid of tony palumbo and someone had killed them both so someone was trying to clean up gsting from the top down and to do it they contracted with the most efficient hit man in california dave puts a warrant out for frank machianno frank takes a left on nautilus street and pulls off the road at windansea sherms single word run let him know that the nickel is hot on a normal day hed relish the chance to come to windansea the legendary surf spot especially on a day when the break is going off and some of the worlds best surfers will be out but this isnt a normal day this is a day when somebody is waiting to kill him let them wait frank thinks he flirts briefly with the idea of driving into la jolla anyway and just letting the chips fall they dont know what car youre driving and better they dont know that you know that theyre there on the downside you dont know who they are or how many or where they are all you know is that theywhoever they arewill be hanging close to sherms office and besides what do you gain even if you win a shootout in the crowded shopping district on la jolla boulevard life without parole so dont be stupid he tells himself he pulls out of the parking lot and heads east on nautilus then south on la jolla scenic drive then east on soledad mountain road out to the then he drives north to the and heads east jimmy the kid giacamone sits in a car and thinks about balls balls is what frankie machines got big clanging brass clappers first he snatches mouse junior and rides him right into his daddys place of business next he pulls john heaney into a dumpster and then he strolls into migliores bar beats half the guys senseless and roughs up teddy himself the guys got balls good jimmy thinks because thats the kind of trophy you want hanging on your wall not his balls of course not literallybut any hunter worth his salt wants the big old bull elephant the one that you fuck up is going to kill you otherwise whats the point jimmys in california with his whole crew the wrecking crew theyre glossed because they work out of a carsalvage place out in deerborn jimmy likes the tagthe wrecking crewit says it all they didnt come in together of course that wouldve been stupid they came in on separate flights and none of them into san diego either jimmy came into orange county paulie and joey into la carlo into burbank tony into palm springs jackie into long beach mouses guys met them and hooked them up with hardware thats all jimmy asked from those west coast mooks get us some hardware clean untraceable you guys think you can handle that maybe yes maybe no frankie m had come right into their driveway for chrissakes and they let him skate way he heard it frankie had shot up the kids hummer and stolen joey fiellas car in the process too fucking funny but the mouseketeers had come through with the arsenal hed requested so his crew was strapped and ready to rock and roll motor citystyle eight milestyle jimmy starts to sing you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo no shit you aint gonna blow this opportunity take care of business here go back and jump the old man for the spot on the council like king me dad first step in taking the family back from the tominellos and getting it home where it belongs to the giacamones something dad never had the stones to do but i do jimmy thinks me and frankie m we got balls i just gotta blow frankies off so he sits in the car and waits frankie machine is going to show up sooner or later two hours later franks in the desert its raining there raining in the damn desert frank thinks it just figures it goes with all the other weird stuff thats going down borrego springs is an oasis in anzaborrego desert state park acres of some of the wildest terrain in the country the towns founders thought it was going to be the next palm springs but that never happened mostly because there are only two roads into town both of them bad both of them winding through miles and miles of tough inhospitable desert a dozen or somojados die every year trying to cross the desert from the mexican side and the border patrol has taken to burying water beneath thirty foot redflagged poles to try to save lives so the town never really flourished and now its mostly a small retirement community for snowbirds along with a couple of thousand hardy souls who live there yearround even in the summer when the temps can reach frank drives in from route which snakes in seemingly endless switchbacks down from the mountains onto the vast desert floor and becomes borregos main street which sports a couple of motels a few restaurants and shops and a bank the bank is what has brought frank here its a tame bank one of the many places that sherm launders money and the prearranged pickup spot for frank to get cash in case of an emergency he drives past it though looking for cars or people who look out of place he doesnt see anything he parks the car outside albiertos a little mexican joint where hes eaten before the food is good and cheap and you get a lot of it because albiertos caters to the local mexicans who work damn hard and want a good meal for their money frank stops outside gets aborrego sun from the newspaper machine walks up to the counter and orders two chicken enchiladas with black beans and rice and an iced tea then sits down in a booth and waits for them to call his name not a lot happens in borrego springs theres an article about a new archaeological dig another one about renovations to the high school gym but the lead story is about the san diego city council scandal and the grand jury indicting another councilman frank skips over the article and finds tom gortons column gorton is the editor and an oldtime newspaper guy and a hell of a good writer frank reads his column every time he sees asun somewhere this time gortons writing about all the rain theyve had this winter and how it will bring a wonderful spring bloom id like to see that frank thinks its been years since theres been a big desert bloom the valley floor carpeted with a panoply puzzle word of wildflowers franks always found it moving a miracle when the sere desert becomes a sea of color and blooms with life its anaffirmation of life frank thinks its proof that redemption is possible when flowers blossom from the desert i hope i get to see it ill bring donna out here maybe jill too maybe its a trip that the three of us can do together yeah right he thinks thats going to happen those two in the same car together bob frank lifts a finger then walks over to the counter and gets his tray the food smells great he goes to another counter picks two different salsasaverde and afresca and some spiced carrots the food is as good as it smells the enchiladas smothered in a rich mole sauce and the rice and beans done perfectly frank notices that they have fish tacos on the menu and wonders who supplies their seafood he thinks briefly about making a pitch then does the math and decides that the drive out here and then having to deadhead back would more than eat up any profit he finishes his meal tosses the plastic plate into the trash can and walks outside the rain is gentle more of a mist but the streets are quiet as if the residents are hiding in their houses waiting for the sun to come out again frank goes into the bank walks up to the nice lady teller and asks for the manager mr osborne may i say whos calling the teller asks scott davis frank says with a smile one moment mr davis osborne looks nervous when he comes out from the office he has a big adams apple anyway on a skinny neck but its bobbing up and down a little more than frank would like dont get hinky frank tells himself this is just an otherwiselawabiding citizen a little stressed about committing an illegal act osborne sticks his hand out his palm is moist sweaty mr davis he says loudly enough for the teller to hear come into my office lets see if we can do some business about your loan frank follows him back into the office osborne opens a safe closet then the safe then takes out a canvas bank bag and hands it to frank twenty thousand he says minus your three points frank says he puts the bag in his jacket arent you going to count it osborne asks should i its all there i just assumed it would be frank says osborne is looking over franks shoulder out the window that faces onto the street frank pulls the and sticks it in the bankers face tell me these men osborne says his voice shaking they came to my house this morning they said to give you the money please dont kill me i have a wife and two children becky is eight and maureen is shut up frank says nobodys killing anybody maybe osborne starts to cry my careermy familyprison youre not going to prison frank says all you need to do is keep your mouth shut capisce keep my mouth shut osborne repeats like hes trying to remember directions somebodys giving him over the phone turn left on jackson second right on la playa keep my mouth shut is there a back door frank asks osborne looks at him frank repeats the question you told me to keep my mouth shut osborne says notnow frank says is there a back way out ill have to unlock it what are you waiting for the door is triplelocked and has a security bar across it it takes a good minute for osborne to get the door unlocked dont open it frank says what are you thinking he asks himself any decent crew will have a guy or two out back and theyll have heard the door unlatching you step out that door you walk into a hail of bullets then again you walk out thefront door you step into the same youre trapped thats certainly what jimmy the kid thinks frankie m is totally fucked jimmys sitting in the car across the street hes in the passenger seat rifle in his lap waiting for the kill shot youre sure he went in jimmy asks i watched him carlo says carlo placed himself in the ice cream store across the road he watched frankie machine drive by then have lunch then go into the bank he could have taken the man out himself except he had strict orders from jimmy whod said you see him you call me so carlo called him then got himself another ice creambutter brickle this time now jimmy sits in the car his foot tapping like a bass drummer in a heavymetal band paulie jackie and joey are in back yeah you sure you can call them you want jimmy thinks about it then decides against it it would be just like paulie to shout into the phone and tip off frankie m no we want frankie nice and confident let him come strolling through that door with his money in hand and happy thoughts in his head thenblam you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow whats taking so fucking long jimmy asks carlo doesnt have time to answer because just then sirens start wailing police sirens coming this way carlo doesnt wait for jimmy to tell him to get in gear and get the fuck out of there its the obvious call frank goes out the back as soon as he hears the sirens osborne had hit the silent alarm just like hed told him to hopefully the banker will follow the rest of his instructions tell the state troopers a man came in and tried to rob you then got nervous and ran out give the cops the description of one of the guys who approached you this morning hed told osborne why dont i tell them the robber got twenty grand osborne asked are yousupposed to have an extra twenty k in the bank frank said no well oh right just hit the alarm okay frank doesnt run out the back alley though he finds the ladder that leads to the roof and climbs up by the time he reaches the top his heart is hammering and hes gasping for breath jill was right about the red meat and the desserts he thinks i have to cut down he crawls along the rooftop on his stomach then climbs down the ladder on the other side just as the troopers cars screech to the front of the bank frank walks back to his car calmly backs out drives across the street to a gas station and starts to fill his tank whats going on he asks the attendant whos come out to see what all the excitements about i dont know the kid says something with the bank jeez no kidding frank says thats wild he watches as osborne comes out of the bank with one of the troopers and a citizen runs across from the ice cream parlor and starts pointing west with one of those emphatic they went thataway gesticulations one of the troopers rushes back to his car and races west frank fills up his tank i hope they get the guys he says and then pulls out and drives east doing the speed limit youre an idiot he tells himself or else youre just getting tired worn down it was the guy in the ice cream shop across the street you know him just cant place him damngetting old come on think think think its flirting with him skirting the edge of his memory carlo moretti a detroit guy a hitter for vince vena it was frank and patty were already having a tough time in their marriage theyd been trying and trying to have a baby to no avail theyd been to doctor after doctor but the word was always the same frank had a low sperm count nothing they could do they talked adoption but patty just wasnt into it she said she didnt blame himthat would be irrational and unfair she saidbut he knew that part of her deep down harbored a resentment she blamed his schedule the pressure he put on himself with not just the fish business but the linen business now too and he would answer that if they ever did have a baby he wanted to be able to provide for the kid offer his child a future so it was tough times their love life had turned into an anxietyridden chore and it was just on one of those days when she was most likely to get pregnant that he got the call from chicago to go to vegas and take care of this little problem truth was frank wasglad to get away for a few days you need the money he told himself and he did but the truth was that home was turning into a painful place and he was looking for excuses to get away that was part of the reason for the long hours at work part of the reason for taking the job in las vegas he and patty argued over it youre going off to vegas with your buddies she saidnow now frank thought when im supposed to be dutifully joylessly performing an act of love its work work she scoffed gambling away our money screwing hookers some kind of work i dont gamble i dont screw hookers so what do you do in vegas she asked go to shows he blew up itswork its how i make money how i put food on the table how i pay for doctors how i what kind of work she asked what exactly is it you do anyway you dont want to know he yelled just take the money keep your mouth shut dont ask questions about things that are none of your business none of mybusiness im yourwife you dont need to remind me that hurt her he knew it before the words were even out of his mouth and wished he could call them back out of the air she dissolved into tears i want a baby so do i his parting words going out the door still he had to admit that the long drive to vegas was a relief a few hours of solitude andquiet no arguments or recriminations no daunting sense of failure and time to think about the job because it was a tricky one donnie garth was the golden boy the wunderkind of the chicago real estate tycoons nobody knew how well hed done though until he up and bought the paladin hotel in vegas nobody knew he hadthat kind of money it worked out well for a while then garth got delusions of grandeur and actually objected to the skimming that the chicago mob was conducting in his casino frank was the one who drove carmine antonucci up to garths place in la jolla to explain it to him garths home was something elsea normanstyle mansion with a circular gravel driveway and a sixcar garage that housed among other cars a ferrari and an austinhealey there was no denying that garth had style he stepped out the front door that day a diminutive man with a yellow cashmere sweater tied around his neck a blue silk shirt open at the collar and white slacks over loafers frank remembers that he was dwarfed by the huge wooden door behind him he was all smiles and handshakes but you could tell that he was embarrassed that actual hoods had showed up at his door and nervous that the neighbors might see the kind of visitors he was getting visitors like carmine antonucci and frankie machine carmine was chicagos man in las vegas supervising the very profitable skim that garth wanted to mess with so carmine politely accepted the iced tea that garth offered waited while the butler went and got it drank a few social sips then pointed to frank and said take a good luck at this man do you know why they call him the machine no because hes automatic carmine said he never misses and if you continue to be an obstacle to the smooth running of my hotel im going to send the machine to see you youll never see him because youll be dead do we have an understanding we do garths hand was shaking like there was an earthquake you could hear the ice and the long silver teaspoon rattling in the glass thank you for the iced tea carmine said getting up it was delicious and refreshing wed love to stay for dinner thank you but i have to catch a flight and that was that frank never said a word he drove carmine back to the airport where a private plane flew him back to vegas and donnie garth started behaving himself except he soon had a problem what had happened was that donnie garth was going to take the kink out of his sore neck by taking a steam in the hotel spa and he was doing this when a piece of chicago muscle named marty biancofiore walked in marty had done some serious work for garth intimidating a few other prospective buyers who had also wanted the paladin so he got it in his head that he wasowed what he said to garth while they were both wrapped in towels was that donnie was going to give him a piece of the hotel or he was going totake a piece of garth and a very essential piece at that which sort of put the kink back in garths neck his hair was still damp when he called carmine now donnie garth was a firstrate pain in the ass but the paladin was bringing in a lot of money a lot more money than marty could ever kick up and garth was scared skulking around the hotel half afraid to come out of his office wanting extra security all the time so carmine finally put a call in to frank because garth had personally requested that guy the machine a lot of people had seen or at least heard about the beef between garth and biancofiore and chicago wanted to send a message you do not mess with one of our people they wanted biancofiore done right on the strip they wanted his body found and they wanted it ugly marty biancofiore was no civilian he had done some work for chicago himself hed be armed and on the lookout marty biancofiore wasnt going to open his door to no pizza guy he was the first man you actually had to hunt frank remembers you spent five whole days tracking him watching his patterns waiting for an opportunity thinking it through it would have to be at night he decided even frankie machine wouldnt try to take someone out on the strip in broad daylight no that would come later frank thinks now when chicago duked it out oldstyle with joe bonnano and they did just that luckily marty biancofiore worked the eighttotwo shift at caesars where hed been put on the primetime crew just to bust garths balls marty would work his shift stop at the bar for two comped vodkas to unwind then walk out to his car in the employees parking lot he always looked carefully around and unlocked the car with a remote key for fear of a bomb frank guessed he always looked into the car before he got in locked the doors quickly and drove straight home one night he called a hooker the other three he took a shower watched some television and went to bed it would be relatively easy to hit him at home frank thought break in when hes in the shower and pop him there but thats not how chicago wants it or that little punk garth whos demanding that a lesson be taught it would have to be the parking lot but how you cant just gun him down when he walks out of the casinotoo many potential witnesses and the risk of a gunfight breaking out is too heavy some civilian catching a stray bullet right on the strip would be unacceptable it was one of franks absolute rules you dont put civilians at risk guys in the game they know the risks and they take their chances but some joe lunchbucket who saves up his money for a vegas blowout doesnt deserve to die because someone gets sloppy so it has to be inside the car but if you shim the door the alarm will go off and that will be that you could steal the keys and have them copied get in and wait for marty but he checks the car out pretty good before he gets in and hed either run away or gun you down while youre lying on the backseat so how are you going to get in the car only one way marty has to invite you in and how are you going to get him to do that every man has a fatal flaw bap had taught frank that not in those words exactly but the point was that every man had a chink in his armor and it was just a matter of finding it bap had even listed them for him you got your lust your greed bap had said you got your ego your pride and then you got your wishful thinking what do you mean some people believe what they want to believe bap had said they want it bad enough marty was bragging to anyone who would listen how he had that little shit donnie garth shaking in his guccis how garth had better stay out of his way how he might just put him in the dirt anyway frank actually heard him mouthing this crap sitting at the bar after his shift and marty needed money frank did his homework marty had been hitting the sports book hard and it had been hitting him back harder he had lost a bundle on college football tried to get well on the mondaynight game but had only got sicker he owed a bundle to a nasty shy named herbie goldstein and was having trouble just coming up with the vig so when the call came from donnie garth martywanted to believe it and garth was a hell of an actor a naturalborn hustler who knew how to put up well afront he also knew by then how to follow instructions and he followed these to the letter frank sat with him when he made the call marty its donnie you better have good news for me marty were friends donnie said ive been thinking i want to do the right thing how about you take a hundred k we put this to bed a hundred fuck you frank listened while they negotiated a settlement of bap was right frank thought biancofiore believed it because he wanted to believe it it fed his ego and solved his financial problems what was it bap had said when you want to catch a fish you gotta give it the bait itshungry for cash donnie marty said frank nodded and donnie said but look marty this has to stay between you and me if word gets out that i can bepressured ill be shit in this town its nobody business but ours marty said thats great marty thanks garth said look ill get the cash then swing by your house this was the critical moment frank held his breath for a second before he heard marty say i think maybe someplace more public you dont trust me marty biancofiore just laughed garth said marty i cant hand you a briefcase full of cash on the floor of caesars palace marty thought about it for a second the parking lot he said my car ill meet you after your shift fuck that marty said noon because marty knew what they all knew no one no one was going to try to take him out in broad daylight right on the strip marty looked to frank frank thought about it for a second then nodded okay donnie said noon it is what are you driving these days whats your slot number get out of town for a few days frank told garth go back to your norman mansion throw a dinner party create an alibi sip some vintage wine with the beautiful people while i clean up your mess for you he thought so it was frank not donnie garth waiting in the parking lot when marty drove in that day marty didnt like it at all he rolled down the window and asked who the fuck are you wheres garth hes not coming what the fuck but frank saw him eyeball the attache case in his hand i have the money frank said do you want it people dont walk away from money bap had lectured him they should sometimes but they dont marty didnt he thought about itfrank could see him thinkingbut he didnt walk away instead he got out of the car and carefully patted frank down from his armpits to his ankles front and back im not wearing a wire frank said fuck the wire marty said im looking for a piece he didnt find one he got back behind the drivers seat flipped the door locks open and ordered get in frank slid into the passenger seat marty was holding a on his lap hey frank said i aint lived this long being careless marty said you said you got the money its in the briefcase that was the moment frank remembers now you figured if marty simply took the case kicked you out and drove away youd never get near him again if he opened the briefcase right there you were a dead man you were counting on his character his caution this was a man who checked his cars for bombs every night he wasnt going to take a briefcase away with him anyway you hoped he wouldnt show me marty said you want me to open it right here the fuck did i say frank lifted the briefcase onto his own lap slid the locks and the lid flipped open with a metallic click frank grabbed the silenced inside and fired five times through the briefcase lid then he put the gun back in the case got out of the car and walked away right down the strip frank went back to his hotel room wiped the gun down with isopropyl alcohol did the same with the briefcase chicago had offered a cleanup crew to dispose of the weapon but frank didnt trust anyone else to clean up after him hed chosen a for a reason knowing that the bullets after piercing the cheap briefcase would have the juice to enter martys skull but not enough to exit a parking lot attendant found marty about an hour later he thought the guy slumped on the wheel had had a heart attack until he saw the five holes in his head frank got into his car and drove the back route through the mojave found a decrepit mine smashed the gun into pieces and tossed it and the briefcase down the shaft yeah easy to get rid of the gun harder to get rid of the memories they dont stay down the mine shaft actually there had been instant fallout from the biancofiore job fat herbie goldstein started screaming all over town that he was out the that marty was evenless likely to pay him now that he was dead and thatsomeone owed him this money tell garth to pay him frank told mike pella are you fucking kidding tell him to sell one of his cars and pay the man frank said tell him the machine said so donnie garth paid herbie goldstein his k which is how frank became friends with herbie goldstein fat herbie sought frank out after he got his money from donnie garth goldstein actually got on a plane flew out to san diego and requested a sitdown with frankie machine they had it over lunch of courseif you were with herbie you wereeating now a lot of mobbedup guys had the sobriquet fat frank knew five of them personally but none of them could play seesaw with herbie goldsteintheyd just be up in the air looking down at almost four hundred pounds of herbie whod probably be sucking on a fudgsicle anyway herbie took frank out to lunch and said that was a decent thing what you did for me i just wanted to tell you in person i appreciated it it was the right thing frank said not everybodydoes the right thing herbie said not these days herbie picked up the lunch check which was no small thing then extended an invitation if youre ever in las vegas ill show you a good time frank didnt plan on going to vegas he really didnt but the invitation lingered in his head the harder he worked the longer hours the dutiful futile sex with patty the fights the silences all made the offer from the pound gangster seem like a siren song so one day after a chef gave him agita over a perfectly fine unit of yellowtail frank threw a few clothes in the car and headed to las vegas he pulled into town and gave herbie a ring ten minutes later he was unpacking his clothes in a comped suite at the paladin he took a nice long bath in the inroom jacuzzi then a nap then got up and got dressed to go meet herbie in the lobby herbie had two playboy models with him susan and mandy susan a petite blonde with an unpetite chest was herbies date mandy was for frank she had shiny shoulderlength brown hair full lips warm brown eyes and was wearing a dress that showed a body that deserved showing frank told himself that she was a platonic date thats all a companion for drinks dinner and maybe a show so he wouldnt feel like the third wheel they did the town god did they do the town the food the wine the showsfrank was never allowed to reach for his wallet not that a bill came anyway it never did herbie left a big tip and that was it they got the best tables bottles of the best wine came over with compliments of the management and they got invited to parties in the greenroom after the shows and then there were the women fat herbie goldstein was not an attractive man although he did bear an uncanny resemblance to pavarottiif the tenor had gone on an allpudding diet for a couple months that is and he wasnt charmingif anything herbie had a kind ofanti charm where the wordrepulsive came from frank guessed herbie repulsed most peoplewith his voracious consumption nonexistent table manners and the rivers of sweat that always seemed to be running down his fat cheeks or pooling in his armpits his clothes were rumpled and usually had food stains on them he had a mouth like a sewer and most people in vegas would cross the street to avoid running into him but herbie pulled women there was just no question about it frank never saw herbie after dark without an absolutely dropdeadgorgeous woman on his arm and they werent hookersthey were dancers and models and goodtime girls they accepted presents from him for sure sometimes fairly big presents like condos or cars but it wasnt just the money they really seemed to like being with herbie and the more time frank spent with the guy the more he did too but that first night they rolled back into the paladin around am when frank went to say good night to mandy his playmate she looked at him funny you dont like me she asked i like you fine what is it i dont turn you on hed had a hardon all night you turn me on a lot then lets go make each other feel good she said mandy im married she smiled its just sex frank no it wasnt after nine faithful years of marriage the last few of them fairly unhappy nothing was just sex mandy did things that patty would never have thought of and wouldnt have done if she had frank was starting in on his usual sexual routine when mandy stopped him and said gently frank let me show you how to please me she did for the first time in his life frank felt this sense of freedom about sex because it wasnt a struggle or negotiation or an obligation it was just pure pleasure and when he woke up in the morning he wanted to feel guilty but the fact was he didnt he just felt good it didnt hurt that mandy had already gotten up and left leaving only a little note telling him that she felt well and truly fucked with one of those little smiley faces above her signature herbie came by to take him to breakfast you should try some jew food herbie said when frank went for the bacon and eggs he ordered frank an onion bagel with lox cream cheese and a slice of red onion it was delicious and the contrasts of tastes and texturessharp creamy soft and crispywas a revelation to him herbie knew what he was talking about when you really got talking with him it turned out that herbie knew a lot about a lot he knew about food wine jewelry and art he had frank over to his house to see his collection of erte and his wine cellar you would never call herbie a cultured man by any means but he had some surprises in him take the crossword puzzles for instance it was herbie who turned frank on to the puzzles and herbie could do the sundaynew york times puzzle in ink sometimes frank wasnt so sure herbie needed to write anything down at allhe might have all the words in his head and he was a walking dictionary although the funny thing was he didnt use any of those words in his conversation ever i guess im what you would call an idiot savant he said one day when frank asked him about it although when frank looked up the termidiot savant he realized that no idiot savant would know the expression you and mandy got along huh herbie asked as they were walking out of his wine cellar the day after frank had shattered his marriage vows with multiple and creative acts of adultery i guess you could say that we have two different girls tonight herbie said very nice girls very nice frank left vegas five days later in need of a vitamin e injection but otherwise feeling rested and satisfied he went back a lot after that mostly getting comped at the paladin sometimes staying somewhere else and paying his own way because he didnt want to abuse the situation the wise guys were banging vegas for everything it was worth and why not the skim was flowing the only problem was the bosses wanted more and more of it and other families were looking to get in on it so the skimmers got to the point that they werent just skimming they were tapping deeper and deeper into the well but theres only so much water in a desert sooner or later it would have to end but none of them saw then that it was going to be sooner it was just one continuous party then and frank after years of working his ass off was partying with the best of them what hed do was hed put in sixteenhour days in san diego at his businesses all week then leave friday after lunch and drive to vegas and spend the weekend most times hed make it back on monday but sometimes he wouldnt patty didnt seem to care theyd pretty much given up on having a kid pretty much given up on the marriage itself so she seemed almost relieved to have him gone on weekends he made a couple of halfhearted invitations for her to come with him but she recognized them for what they were and turned them down wed be the same people in vegas as we are here she said once i dont know frank said maybe we wouldnt he really tried one time well go for drinks dinner some nice shows he said maybe back to bed afterwardfor more than turning over and going to sleep is this the routine youve got down with your bimbos she replied there werent any bimbos not yet but he didnt bother to deny it let her think what she was going to think what difference did it make anyway so he went to vegas by himself he was never alone for long while frank enjoyed the solitude of the long drive listening to his opera tapes on the car stereo singing along without bothering anyone he was ready for some companionship by the time he got there if you couldnt find company in las vegas in those days it was because you wanted to be alone so hed check into his room shower change clothes then go over to herbies place herbie had taken some of his shark money and bought a nondescript little club tucked away in a strip mall among a bunch of autobody shops it was far away from the strip the casinos and the usual spots the feds had under surveillance and that was the point you didnt know about herbies unless you were supposed to and if a tourist or a citizen waiting for his car to be fixed happened to wander in he left in a hurry with a polite but firm this place aint for you friend herbies was for wise guys period for some reason or another herbies became the hangout of choice for the california guys they were all back from the joint now and all in vegas living large off the skim mike was backhed actually moved to vegas thinking it was going to be his big chance and he was usually sitting at a table with peter martini aka mouse senior who had just been made boss and peters brother carmen was usually there and so was their nephew bobby a nightclub singer and of course you had herbie sitting doing his crossword puzzles with sherm simon in the corner that became known as little israel so there were plenty of guys to hang out with and sometimes frank sat at one of the tables and listened to the bullshit sessions but mostly hed go back into the kitchen and cook those were good times standing at the stove listening to the guys while whipping up thelinguine con vongole andspaghetti all amatriciana thebaccala alla bolognese andpolpo con limone e aglio it was almost like the old days when he was a kid back when san diegos little italy was still intact and people still made real meals frank had really missed cooking as he spent more time at work and less time at home and he and patty had slipped into the routine of having their dinners separately herbie had a beautifully equipped kitchen and imported the best ingredients so the cooking was a pleasure and a joy and listening to the guysthe conversations the jokes the ball busting hanging out with mob guys frank thought was like being frozen in some perpetual junior high school time warp the conversations were always about sex food farts smells girls small dicks and homos and crime of course the only thing at herbies being cooked up more than pasta was crime most of the scores never came off of coursethey were just bullshitbut some of them did there were plots to get in on the legal brothels north of the city a plan to sell machine guns to motorcycle gangs a very serious discussion on how to make counterfeit credit cards and franks personal favoritemikes theft of three thousand tshirts and two hundred twentyinch tv sets from the convention center what are you going to do with two hundred tv sets frank asked mike after the score had actually come off what am i going to do with three thousand tshirts mike asked frank was going to ask him why hed stolen the tshirts in the first place but then he realized that it was a stupid question akin to the why climb mount everest querythe answer was of course because its there the truth was that wise guys would steal anything even stuff they didnt want and couldnt use just because they could steal it anyway these things kept frank amused and it wasnt just the guys it was also the women it had been tough that first time cheating on patty but then frank started seeing all kinds of women at first in the gravitational orbit of babe magnet herbie goldstein then on his own he saw models showgirls croupiers dealers and tourists who were in town for a good uncomplicated time which frank gave them he took them to nice dinners to shows always treated them like ladies and was a generous caring lover frank found out that he really liked women and that they returned the compliment except patty he treated her badly and she returnedthat compliment he talked about it with sherm one night during a quiet moment at herbies why cant you be with your wife the way you are with your girlfriends different breed my friend sherm said different species entirely maybe we should marry the girlfriends i tried it sherm says twice and and they turn into wives sherm said it starts to happen when theyre planning the wedding this metamorphosis from sex kitten to house cat it doesnt work you dont believe me ask my lawyer youare a lawyer ask mydivorce lawyer sherm said tell him i sent youhe has a boat named after me i dont think its them frank said i think its us once we stop trying to get them into bedbecause now theyrealways there we stop making the effort we turn them into wives i think its just the way of the world my friend sherm said the way of the world i dont think so frank thought he resolved to go home and give it a real try with patty again treat her like a mistress instead of a wife and see what happened but he didntit was easier to go to bed with showgirls or just hang out with herbie it was always good spending time with herbie working thenew york times sunday crossword over bagels and lox with an opera broadcast as a background or drinking a wine that herbie had discovered or chuckling over the plots and plans of mike pella the martini brothers and the rest of the crew they were good times they all ended when he had to go kill jay voorhees jay voorhees was the security chief at the paladin in charge of making sure that the casino wasnt being skimmed so in the interest of efficiency he was also in charge of the skim he was good at it the harry houdini of the counting room the way he could make coins and bills escape from lockboxes then the fbi got to him started to put pressure on him and he caved ran to mexico where the feds couldnt get to him fine as far as it went but chicago wasnt looking to extradite him they were looking to make houdini disappear for good because voorhees knew everythinghe could give up carmine donnie garth everybody then the whole house of cards as it were would come tumbling down they had to find voorhees and put him out people think its easy to disappear it isnt its hard and its tiring and its expensive as hell moneyhemorrhages when youre traveling anyway and when youre on the move and trying not to leave any footprints it bleeds all the faster youre trying to use cash everywhere but you see it just flying out of your pocket and you go to the plastic unless youre prepared to go off the radar its a difficult trick to pull off and jay voorhees wasnt prepared he had just panicked and run and it was only a matter of time before he figured out that the feds would offer him a pretty good deal to trade up and hed get tired of running and come in from the cold frank had to find him first we can put a crew down there carmine antonucci said anything you need i dont want a crew frank said bunch of doofs tripping over one anothers feet a pool of potential witnesses when the feds flipped them five years down the line no he didnt want a crew just operating expenses in cash because he didnt want to leave any footprints either and there were a lot of footsteps frank followed voorhees from mexico city to guadalajara then across to mazatlan and cozumel then to puerto vallarta and all the way down the tip of baja to cabo aconnection develops between hunter and prey guys deny it as airyfairy bullshit frank thought but they all know it happens you track a guy long enough you get to know him youre living his life one step removed and he becomesreal to you you try to get inside his head think the way he thinks and if you succeed at that in a strange way you become him and he becomes you for the same reason if he has any instinct at all he begins to feel you as he runs as he tries to outthink you to anticipate your moves and counter them he gets to know you too youre on the same roadby necessity you go to the same places eat the same food see the same things share the same experiences you develop things in common youconnect frank missed him by three days in mexico city talked to a cabbie who drove him to the airport bribed a baggage agent who put him on a flight to guadalajara he wasnt sure but he might have glimpsed him on the cross of squares there outside the cathedral going to pray frank wondered maybe he bought a little clay modelamilagro from one of the street vendors and left it at the altar with a contribution and a request for a miracle he missed him by one night at his hotel found out he went to the train station he might have lost the trail there except that voorhees used his amex to check into a hotel in mazatlan frank went to the resort town and just walked the beach asking everybody if theyd seen him throwing around money he didnt expect to get an answer and he didnt hide the fact that he was therehewanted voorhees to know flushing the bird is what bap had called it the bird might be safe hiding in the bush but it sees the hunter and flies and thats what kills it voorhees fled to cozumel frank right after him voorhees checked in and out of secondrate hotels one time frank missed him by an hour he actuallysaw him in cabo at a cheap hotel on the pacific side drinking a beer and picking at a plate ofcamarones he was gaunt and thin his slacks were bunched up awkwardly around his waist voorhees sawhim too he definitely did he made you frank thinks now he looked at you with those scared haunted eyes andknew voorhees paid his check and left the place and frank followed him but there was no place to do it so frank let him get on a bus and go he knew voorheess string was running out in every town hed gone to the hotels had gotten a little cheaper the meals a little skimpier he had started on jets then had rented cars and taken trains but now he was on a rundown rural bus and a bad one at that frank checked the routethe bus was headed on the single road up the east coast of baja now his options werent radial they were linear he had trapped himself along this spine of coastline with the ocean on one side and impenetrable desert on the other and all he could do was make his way from one little fishing village to the next frank enjoyed that trip if enjoyment is a concept that can be hooked to hunting a man down in order to kill him but he savored the leisure of the bus trip with nothing to do but marvel at the stark countryside or read or watch the startlingly blue water of the sea of cortez he liked playing with the kids on the bus holding a baby that one time so the mother could get a break and he reveled in the relentless sun and the baking soothing heat those were good days those days following jay voorhees up baja frank was almost sorry that it was about to end voorhees went to ground in the little village of santa rosalia hed found himself a little fishermans shack on the rocky beach its what he should have done in the first place frank thought gone to a little town where he could have bought protection from the localcomandante we would have outbid him of course but it would have taken me longer to find him and maybe i never would have but that wasnt what happened what happened was frank spent the afternoon at a cantina in the village sipping a couple of beers and doing crossword puzzles in a little englishlanguage magazine that some tourist must have left behind it was a long slow crawl to sunset the dusk muted and subtle on an easternfacing coast but when the blue went out of the water he headed down to the beach to the thatched shack that voorhees had managed to procure with his dwindling bankroll the man was sitting on a roughhewn chair outside smoking a cigarette and staring out at the water ive been waiting for you he said when he saw frank frank nodded i mean youre the guy arent you voorhees said only a slight quiver in his voice the guy they sent yeah voorhees nodded he looked more worn out than scared there was this look of resignation on his face almost relief not the hard edge of fear that frank had expected yeah frank thought or maybe its just the soft glow coming off the ocean at dusk that takes the edge off maybe its the fading light that makes voorhees look tranquil voorhees finished his cigarette took the pack from the pocket of his faded denim shirt and lit another one his hands were shaking frank leaned over and helped him hold the match steady voorhees nodded his thanks after hed gotten a couple of drags down he said its thebullet im afraid of the thought of it smashing in my head you wont feel anything its just the thoughtyou know my head blown away that doesnt happen frank said lying do it now he told himself do it before he knows its happening voorhees started to cry frank watched the water well up in his eyes saw the man bite his lip and try to hold it back but the tears overflowed and rolled down his cheeks and then voorhees just lost it his head slumped and his shoulders bobbed up and down as he sobbed frank stood there and watched aware that he was violating one of baps key precepts you dont need to give them last words or last rites bap had lectured you aint a warden or a priest get in do the job get out no bap wouldnt have approved of this scene voorhees finished crying looked up at frank and said im sorry frank shook his head then voorhees said a doctor in guadalajara wrote some scrip for me tranquilizers frank already knew this the doctor had given it up to him for a couple of hundred in cash so much for the hippocratic oath i still have most of them voorhees said i mean i think i haveenough frank thought it over for a few seconds ill have to stay with you he said that would be okay voorhees got out of the chair and frank followed him into the little shack frank went into a canvas bag that had once been voorheess carryon and now contained all his earthly goods he took out a vial of pillsvalium tenmilligram dosageand a bottle of vodka about twothirds full they went back outside frank sat down on the sand voorhees sat back down in the chair shook a handful of pills into his hand and swallowed them with a swig of vodka he waited a few minutes then did it again then a minute later took the last of the pills and sat sipping on the vodka bottle as he looked out at the ocean beautiful isnt it he mumbled to frank beautiful a second later he lurched back in the chair then forward and he slumped over onto the rocks frank picked him up and put him back in the chair he went back to the village found a working telephone and made a call to let donnie garth know that he was safe frank went home from that job to find that patty had changed the locks on the doors tired angry and sad he kicked the front door in called a locksmith buddy at two in the morning to put new locks in then went upstairs got into the shower sat down under the steaming water and cried the next night he drove to garths houseto do what exactly he didnt know he parked across the street and sat in the car for a long time garth was having a party he watched the expensive cars and the chauffeured limousines pull into the circular driveway and he looked at the beautiful people in their beautiful clothes get out and go to the door it looked like a benefit a fundraiser for some charitythe men were in black tie the women in evening dresses their hair up exposing long graceful necks adorned with glittering jewels how many people frank asked himself have to die so the beautiful people can stay beautiful question for the ages the picture window was open and there was a golden glow inside frank could see garth flitting around playing the social butterfly making jokes and glittering conversation and frank figured it had to be his imagination but he thought he could hear the laughter of elegant women and the clinking of priceless crystal it would have been an easy shot he knew even through the glass use something fast and heavy like a sniper rifle steadied against the car window squeeze the trigger and blow donnies boywonder brains all over his lovely guests nowthat would have been a benefit to a lot of people frank thought if he had known thenbut he didnt then he thought it might be fun just to walk in there stroll up to garth in the middle of the glittering crowd and say donnie your tits out of the wringer again i killed jay voorhees for you same way i killed marty biancofiore see what your highclass friends would have to say to that but he thought probably nothing theyd probably get off on it so he sat in the car and watched san diegos finest come and go it was in theuniontribune the next morning on the society page how donnie garth had raised almost a million dollars for the new art museum frank used the page to wrap fish when the news got out that the former chief of security of the paladin had died of an overdose in mexico guys in the know just naturally assumed that frankie machine had forced him to take the pills frank never did anything to disabuse them of the notion it was just a technicality anyway he thought you cant slide on this one just because you didnt hold the gun to his head just because you gave him a choice cut the guy a break i dont knowmaybe itwill mean a couple of centuries less in purgatory more likely a slightly nicer niche in hell me and donnie garth at the same party at last garth flipped later of course the feds got him in a room and he gave up the whole thing frank waited for the call to come but it never did it took him years to figure out why donnie garth got a pass he is one smart son of a bitch carlo says theyre sitting in the parking lot of a burger king in el centro sixty miles east of borrego and hard by the mexican border jimmy has the rest of his crew spread around the town he took the burger king sent jackie and tony to mickey ds joey and paulie to jack in the box how comewe get jack in the box paulie had complained what you want burger king jimmy had asked yeah okay well fuck you i get burger king jimmy had said burger kings got better french fries and the sodas arent so gassy youre cooped up in a car with another guy hours at a time you dont want gassy sodas now he looks at carlo and says he didnt get to be frankie machine by being stupid he got away carlo says now hes got money hes got an open road we dont know where the fuck he is he could be anywhere chill jimmy says one fucking phone call ill know right where he is carlo looks at him impressed and skeptical at the same time who you gonna call ghostbusters dave watches the little red light blink on the electronic map the gps device placed in the bank bag with the money is working perfectly i thought he would have gone down to mexico troy says mexico is a dead end dave answers machianno knows that hell yes he does dave thinks he sure made it a dead end for jay voorhees the bureau had always liked frank for that piece of work but could never come close to pinning it on him classic frankie machine troy studies the map it looks like hes headed for brawley he says they keep an eye on the screen into the evening the light stops in brawley and beeps steadily in the same location they run a crosscheck and it comes up positive franks gone to ground in the ez rest motel two blocks off the the ez rest motel jimmy says punching off the phone lock and load rock and roll carlo starts the car lock and load rock and roll he loves jimmy but hes kind of an asshole the ez rest motel where carlo asks brawley california they look at the road atlas brawley is only about an hour away ladies and gentlemen jimmy intones in his best michael buffer imitation for the thousands in attendance and the millions watching around the worldlets get ready to rumble the brawl in brawley the brawl in brawley carlo chuckles asshole the town of brawley is an oasis in the desert back during the depression the wpa put thousands of guys to work digging a canal from the colorado river west into the desert the result is that the area around brawley produces some of the best alfalfa in the world its startling to fly over ityouve seen nothing but miles and miles of stark bleached brown and then suddenly there are these rectangles of emerald green driving into it is less dramatic but the town does come as a welcome relief to the desert and it has everything a small agricultural town has to offera strip of fastfood places a couple of banks a big agricorp grain elevator and some motels frank finds the place hes looking for pretty quickly and settles in lies down stretches out and closes his eyes jimmy walks up the stairs to the second floor of the motel he isnt doing any comedy bits now hes mainlining adrenaline his asshole gripped tighter than a whitecollar con at his first day in the showers whats waiting up in that room after all isfrankie machine he might be an old dude but theres a reason hegot to be an old dude jimmy knows all the stories and if even half of them are truejimmys heard the story about how the machine walked into that bar in san diego and gunned down those brits before they could even get their hands off their teacups nevertheless if you want to be the man you got to be the man whobeat the man so jimmy is psyched for the opportunity and jimmy has a plan the machine probably has the chain lock hooked so carlo has one of those dea warrantservice battering rams to smash the door in with then jimmy will step in and put a few into frankie ms head hopefully the old fuck is asleep anyway jimmy the kid nods and carlo swings the battering ram the door isnt exactly fort knox material anyway and caves like the yankees against the red sox jimmy goes in frankie m isnt in bed he aint anywhere in the room jimmy the kid suppresses his adrenaline rush and swings his gun in a controlled arc sweeping the room in precise vectors left to right no machine then he hears water running the old bastard is in the shower didnt even hear the door cave in now jimmy can see the steam from under the bathroom door he grins this is going to be easy andclean jimmy nudges the bathroom door open with his foot his hands are on the out in front of him in the approved fbi shooting stance except he dont see nothing in the shower no shape of a man through the thin shower curtain he yanks the curtain open with his left hand and sees a noteducttaped on the shower wall with the little gps monitor jimmy grabs the note and reads did you think you were playing with children jimmy hits the deck he bellycrawls out of the bathroom and back toward the front door carlo is already down sitting propped against the wall with his hand pressed against a wound in his shoulder blood seeping between his fingers his other hand limply holding his gun paulie lies on the balcony floor mewling and clutching his right lower leg looking at jimmy like a wounded soldier looks at a bad officer like what have you gotten us into and how are you going to get us out its a good fuckin question jimmy thinks as he curls up as tight as he can against the door frame and tries to peer through the balcony rails he cant see where the shots have come from he searches for a motion a reflection anything but he cant lamp a single thing that might help him he only knows the next shot could smash into his head on the other hand if frankie m was shooting to kill both carlo and paulie would already be dead are jackie and tony hit too jimmy looks down in the parking lot for their car and can just make them out slumped down in the front seat their hands on their guns looking up at him jimmy makes a small gesture with his hand stay down stay put i need a doctor paulie whines shut up jimmy hisses im bleeding out paulie cries no you aint jimmy thinks looking at his leg the bullet didnt hit an arteryit was precisely placed to stop but not to

squarely on the kids forehead he doesnt recognize this kid the one whos squeezed against the door making himself as small as possible not small enough frank thinks he doesnt know leg wound either which makes sense hes too young for me to have ever worked with him frank thinks or maybe thats just a process of getting older that everyone looks young to you the kid crouching in my sights is no joke he made a mistake but he isnt a clown a clown would have come running out of that room this guy had the sense to get low and crawl out of there even the way hes holding himself nowlooking around not panicking not overreacting about his wounded crew controlling his mensays that the kid has something frank can see it in the kids eyes hesthinking thinking men are dangerous so take him out frank thinks you cant afford to have this guy on your tail he resettles his aim and squeezes the trigger the bullet smacks the wood a half inch above jimmy the kids head his whole body quivers and then he fights for control of himself and wins a dumber guy would have thought that frankie machine had missed but jimmy is smarter than that frankie machine doesnt miss frankie was sending a peace message i could have killed you if i wanted but i didnt jimmy the kid waits five minutes then starts cleaning up the wreck of the wrecking crew carlos gotten over the shock and can walk so he and jimmy haul paulie down the stairs and into a car then they drive out on the highway a little ways because even the cops have woken up in this sleepy town to the fact that something out of the ordinary has gone

whatyou know old man dave hansen walks into the room at the ez rest motel the local cops are all over the place going nuts because this is athrill the runofthemill shootings in this part of the country usually involve drunkmojados on a saturday night or whitetrash tweekers any old time of the week so a shootout in a motel is a big deal dave examines the bullet mark on the door frame unlike frank to miss a shot he turns around and looks at the agricorp sign thats pure frank good shooting angle down no shooting angle back up dave walks into the bathroom and sees the did you think you were playing with children note no frank i didnt i should have known youd suss out the gps i should have known you were smarter than that tired worn down on the run youd still keep your head young troy asks what happened what happened dave says irritably is that hes frankie machine but to be honest its a good goddamn question what the hell did happen here who came to hit frank before we got here and how did they know where he was frank drives across the desert hes always liked the desert at night even in winter it has a soft feel to it speaking of soft frank thinks thats whatyoure getting you should have killed themall left a bloodbath back there that would make any guy in the business reluctant to take the contract on you especially the crew chief the one who was the spitting image of old tony jacks no nottony jacks his younger brother whats his name billy was thatbillys kid frank vaguely remembers something about billys kid doing a stint for something what was it extortion maybe the kid was precocious had his own crewwith some stupid tag the wrecking crew that was it worked out of an autosalvage place and were chopping cars the kid had a rep even in the joint and now its making more sense the combination sent vince out to clip me vince was cautious and used cutouts getting teddy migliore to send john heaney to mouse junior to set me up makes sense makes sense the migliores answer to the combination they kick up from their sex businesses porn prostitution strip clubs okay fine but ive never had anything to do with any of those be honest he tells himself what about that night at solana beach and the strip club wars the damn thing was the strip club business had started as a limo business it was back in vegas had collapsed and mike and frank were pretty much alone down in san diego unless you counted the detroit guys which frank didnt the migliores always did their own business and they always seemed to do it without getting busted frank didnt care anyway he was out of it by then threeplus years of relative peace and quiet and life was good he had his home his wife his little fish business and the limo service was booming in the easymoney eighties and then patty got pregnant it was the most amazing thing back in the seventies they had tried and tried with no luck then as their relationship deteriorated they had stopped trying then stopped making love altogether then one night they went out to dinner they had a little wine had a little time together and then they went home fell into bed andboom when patty told him the news he was over the moon so coming into the summer of they were about to have a baby you want to pick up a little easy money mike asked him one day frank didthe baby was due in a couple of weeks and a little extra cash sounded good whats the job he asked the job was that this banker was having a weekendlong party for a bunch of business associates all they had to do mike told him was drive a couple of cars provide security at the party sounds good frank said theres one little thing mike said of course frank thought theres always one little thing what the guy putting this party together yeah donnie garth im out frank said come on mike said is thisyou talking frank asked mr theres nothing i hate more than a rat pella garths the biggest rat there ever was im amazed hes still on top of the dirt hes connected frankie mike said bigger than you and i can conceive of ive done enough work for donnie garth frank said pass they asked for you personally frank who did old man migliore mike said and the guy from new orleans marcello frank asked i dont have anything to do with marcello yeah but garth does mike told him hes president of an s and l and the guy from new orleans has an interest so do the migliores so thats how donnie garth has kept breathing frank thought he bought his way out he paid for his pass what do i have to do frank sighed just drive mike said hang around the party make sure everything stays copacetic im telling you its a straight job yeah frank thought a straight job the straight job started with him driving one of the s ampl officers to a bank in rancho santa fe where the guy took out fifty thousand in cash and then told frank to drive him to price club price club frank wondered what are you going to buy with fifty k at price club women they met the madam in the parking lot what was her name frank wonders now karen that was it she drove up in a mercedes convertible and the bank officer leaned out the window of the limo to give her the cash when they were driving away the guy said i have an mba in finance from wharton and this is what ive becomea pimp what was that guys name frank asks himself now sandersno saunders john saunders another wasp who was shocked and appalled that his hands got dirty frank didnt bother to tell him that pimps didnt pay money theytook it and that saunders wasnt a pimp but a procurer anyway he took the guy down to the harbor where garth owned a foot yacht and dropped him off pick up the girls at eight saunders said as he got out of the car he gave frank an address in del mar patty would have had a fit frank thinks now if she had seen the next part of the straight job you were working swinging by a brothel to pick up a carful of the most gorgeous working girls youve ever seen summer lorensen was the prettiest though she didnt have that worn hooker look instead she looked like your stereotypical cornfed midwestern farm girlblond blueeyed peachesandcream complexion the girlnextdoor type thatplayboy liked to use for the centerfold shespoke that way too with that sweet oh shucks manner and she even called him mr machianno it was her first time in a limo and she was all excited about that first time on a yacht and she was all excited aboutthat too the girls were all dressed to the nines and had clearly been chosen so that there was someone to suit every taste although any man would have been more than happy to have any one of them summer lorensen though she was something else so frank picked up one carload of girls mike picked up another and they drove to the harbor saunders was there to meet them on the dock he and frank and mike helped the girls in their high heels negotiate the step down onto the yacht then saunders said now look what you see on the boat who you see on the boat stays on the boat im counting on your absolute discretion discretion is us mike assured him smiling at frank like weve seen things that would make this yuppie fuck piss his pants and weve kept them to ourselves what do you have to show us well a lot it was almost comical at first when the girls stepped down onto the deck and these bankers stopped talking and justgawked almost drooled like fat men at an allyoucaneat buffet well they weremostly bankers you also had a couple of federal judges three or four us congressmen one senator and a few just general political types frank didnt know who they were but mike did and he stood there pointing them out by name how do you know all this frank asked my business to know mike said it could come in handy a congressman in your pocket tell me youre not thinking of blackmailing one of these guys franks philosophy was if the feds arent messing with you dont mess with them let sleeping dogs lie mike didnt answer because garth himself got up to make a welcome aboard speech to his guests the guy was actually wearing a captains uniform with the blue jacket white trousers and the billed hat he looked like a total doofus but then again he was a total doofus who owned his own bank well a savings and loan anyway so garth welcomed his guests greeted the ladies even used the what you see on the boatstays on the boat line got a good laugh when he said that as a ships captain he could even marry people the unions being legal as long as they were at sea which would be all night with that they shoved off and headed out into the harbor frank stood along the fore rail and watched as the men picked out their partners it was remarkable but even with the knowledge that these were working girls the partiers seemed to feel the need to chat them up first have a drink and flirt and the girls were prosthey laughed at the jokes posed prettily flirted back it wasnt long before they paired off and started to drift down into the cabins belowdecks discretion frank thought but inhibitions went south when the coke came out piles of it served up by john saunders like he was a waiter pimp and waiter frank thinks now thats the career an mba got you in the cokedup easymoney eighties the straight businessmen and the pols and the hookers were snorting it up with onehundreddollar bills more than one of which frank saw fly off unnoticed into the night breeze the coke turned the party into a floating orgy a maritime bacchanalia caligulameetscaptains courageous it was an incredible scene with the lights of san diego as a backdrop a reallife porn extravaganza was played out on the deck of garths yacht it seemed like the whole party was in on it except mike pella and frank and summer lorensen because it was franks job to keep her out of it saunders had come up to him earlier and said shes not part of the passaround pack shes for theafter party party the vip a list at donalds beach house keep the riffraff away from her what do you mean shes bait saunders said we have her slotted for a particular individual and not yet so summer sat with frank and mike most of the evening talking laughing pretending not to notice the scene that was evolving around them she told them about her high school days about going to college for a year but not really liking it and dropping out eventually she told them about getting pregnant and having her daughter and how the boyfriend shed thought loved her just took off and sure guys came up to hit on her but frank or mike would quietly say shes not for you and there werent a lot of guys on this earth who would take on either mike or frank never mind both of them so it just wasnt a problem there was one guy who ogled her from a distance he was young maybe in his late twenties early thirties with the boyish face of a perpetual frat rat he never came close but from time to time frank would see him checking her out from ten fifteen feet away and he had this smarmy smile on his facenot bold enough to be a leer but confident like he had a secret and it was a good one mike noticed frank checking him out you know who that is mike asked no mike smiled and whispered the answer no kidding frank said taking another look at the senators son sure they already had one senator on the boat but just like there were bosses and there werebosses there were senators and there weresenators same as you had say bosses of kansas city or jersey or for that matter la and you treated them with respect even though they werent in the same league as bosses in chicago philly and new york so this guys daddy was asenator who chaired a key banking committee daddy might even be president someday not of some bank but of theunited states and even the one senator on the boat and a bunch of congressmen were treating junior with some deference even letting him cut in on the line to blow some coke frank and mike were watching this action when mike started to sing some folks are born to wave the flag ooh theyre red white and blue and when the band plays hail to the chief ooh they point the cannon at you lord and frank joined in with him on the chorus it aint me it aint me i aint no senators son son so that was itthey dubbed the frat boy fortunate son and fortunate son was checking summer lorensen out like something he thought he should own shes bait we have her slotted for a particular individual and not yet and she was amazing frank remembers her colleagues were giving blow jobs and doing threesomes and foursomes just feet away from her and she just kept chattering on about the girls basketball team at her high school and how nice the yacht was and how pretty the city lights were shining on the water caligulameetspollyanna she eventually fell asleep sitting in that deck chair breathing gently her mouth just open a thin sheen of perspiration glistening on the justvisible hairs above her upper lip the yacht came back toward the dock that morning like a plague ship bodies strewn about the deck in various states of undress moans emerging from unconscious mouths as the smell of stale sweat and sex cut through the salt air forty minutes out frank and mike helped saunders rouse the partiers get them dressed and pour some coffee and orange juice down their throats the guests left the boat happily exhausted and slunk into waiting cars and limousines the lucky few were invited back to garths housenot the one in la jolla but his weekend home ten minutes away in solana beach frank drove summer there she slept most of the way and only woke up as they were pulling into garths driveway wow she said honest to god frank thinks she actually said wow not that garths beach house wasnt worth a wow at million back in it should have been pretty impressive and it didnt disappoint it was long sleek white and modern its floortoceiling windows practically inviting the ocean in frank cant imagine what the place would go for now six seven mil easy mike pulled in and opened the door for a second girl a stunning redhead with green eyes sophisticated where summer was naive exuding an aggressive experienced sexuality in contrast to summers innocence whatwas her name frank tries to think alison alisonsomething she was from someplace in the south or at least she had the accent garth came out of the house followed by fortunate son who was dressed in nothing but a smile and the towel wrapped around his waist turned out that he was the entire a list you served her up frank thinks now served her like a special dish get a grip he tells himself now she was ahooker the fresh innocent virgin persona was part of her act itwas her hook her appeal it drove up her price the gorgeous girl next door you always wanted but couldnt have unless you were fortunate son then there wasnothing you wanted and couldnt have fortunate son wanted them both of course he did frank thinks who wouldnt be honest with yourselfif you could have everything you wanted wouldnt you take it and if you knew you were going to get what you wanted you wouldnt have been in any hurry either nobody was going to take it away from you so why not wait if you were used to getting anything you wanted maybe the waiting was better than the getting the girls said they really wanted to take showers they went inside for a while and came out in bikinis then everyone went for a long walk on the beach with frank and mike trailing behind out of earshot but within sight nobody went in the water frank remembers well summer ran in up to her knees and ran back yelling that it was cold and fortunate son wrapped his arms around her and rubbed her back to warm her up then they all went back to the house where lunch was served outside on the deck you and mike sat in the kitchen frank remembers and ate with the cook you kept the door open so you could see what was going on outside funny the things you rememberthe men drank beer and the girls had mimosas after lunch the girls said they were sleepy and the men said they could use a siesta too and everyone repaired to separate bedrooms frank and mike agreed to split a watch and frank took the first one when mike relieved him frank went back to his car stretched out on the front seat and fell sound asleep when he woke up he walked back to the house to see what was up he looked down at the living room through the bluetinted glass summer dressed in an open white robe over her bikini was on her knees on the lush white carpet alison was kneeling beside her gently kissing her neck donnie garth and fortunate son sat in two big black leather easy chairs watching a bowl of cocaine was set on the chrome and glass coffee table the remnants of lines looked like white dust alison nuzzled summers neck and summer said if you do that i cant stop you alison said i know and reached around and unclasped the top of the bathing suit alison dipped her head down and kissed one breast and then the other and gently pushed summer down on her back and then slid down herself kissing her along her stomach and then across the top of her panties as summer moaned and said ive never done this before alison sat up and pulled the panties off then opened summers legs and laid down between them and soon summers hips started to roll then her back arched and her fingers dug into the lush white carpet it was straight from a bad porn movie frank thought a parody an actthe corruption of innocencebut a good one simultaneously stupid obscene and compelling summer was a good actressshe alternately resisted and succumbedand toward the end she lay with her head in alisons lap as fortunate son his dick coated with numbing cocaine moved in for the final act thats when the radio squawked in mikes car mike wasnt paying any attention so frank got in and answered it it was the office dispatcher christ im glad i reached you she said patty went into labor shes at scripps frank hustled out of the car i gotta go he told mike mike was transfixed on the scene inside the house now patty went into labor mike didnt take his eyes off the window go go frank jumped back into his car and sped out he made it to the hospital in time and was in the room when jill was born he held his daughter in his arms and his life changed like that frank learned laterwith the rest of the suckersthat the savings and loan industry was the biggest bustout scheme in history dwarfing anything any wise guy ever managed to put together heres how the scam worked garth and the other s ampl guys would get themselves savings and loan operations make unsecured loans to themselves and their partners through shell corporations then default on the loans and drain their s ampls of all their assets garth took his own hammond savings and loan down for a billion and a half bones identical in shape to your classic mafia bustout frank thinks now except we only managed to do it with restaurants and bars maybe the occasional hotel these guys busted out the whole country to the tune of billion and congress hit up the working guy to pay for it the whole s ampl house of cards eventually came tumbling down and garth and a few of the others did some time polishing their short games at various club feds and the senators and congressmen who had been on the boat literally and figuratively got on cnn to proclaim what a disgrace it all was karen wilkenson did a couple of years for pandering john saunders went away for a year for misuse of bank funds fortunate son went on to become a us senator summer lorensen had a sadder ending frank remembers they found her body a few days later in a ditch off the road on mount laguna she ended up a victim of the green river killer who picked up prostitutes raped and killed them then stuffed their mouths with rocks the police didnt catch him for years not surprising back then the cops had a phrase for the murders of prostitutes and junkies no humans involved but frank felt bad thinking about that sweet girl lying off a road with rocks in her mouth but then he forgot about it he was busy the strip club wars were about to break out eddie monaco looked like huckleberry finn that is if huck were fifty years old and had just gotten laid blondhaired blueeyed eddie had this boyish innocent look about him and he could always make people laugh nothing seemed to bother eddie ever life was a party full of booze broads and buddies and he was no donnie garth eddie was a legitimate tough guy who had done stints for extortion and counterfeiting with a sheet eddie couldnt get a liquor license of course so he had a front guy who technically owned the pinto club but everyone knew that the club didnt belong to patrick walsh the pinto was eddie monacos the strip club sat on kettner boulevard in what had been little italy just a few blocks away from lindbergh field frank and mike were running limos out of the airport and mike made sure that every businessman who came into san diego got the word about the pinto club well pick you up at your hotel went the pitch deliver you to the club deliver you safely home you can drink all you want you dont have to worry about a dui and if you happen to want some company on the way backsay one of the girls we can arrange for that too no extra charge and if you want to write it off no problemwell give you a clean receipt we can even give you a restaurant check if you want it to prove you were going to a business dinner so seeing as how frank was taking customers there all the time and seeing as how hed usually end up driving them home as well he ended up hanging out there a lot the girls were pretty he had to admit that eddie monaco knew how to find talent and he was generous with it you want anything hed tell frank you dont even have to ask a sandwich a drink a blow job its yours eddie liked having mobbedup guys around it kept things copacetic and gave the place a whiff of notoriety and danger which brought customers through the door what did he call itgangster chic and anyway mike and frank were driving a lot of business up to those doors so a meal a little booze a hummer in the back room what was that peanuts to eddie monaco frank would accept the free food and the comped drinks but he never took eddie up on the bjs there was something sad enough about the girls already without them having feign enthusiasm on their knees in the office and besides with a toddler at home he was trying to be faithful to his wife it wasnt that hard to do the strippers looked sexy at firstit was because of the lights the pounding music the atmosphere of undiluted eroticismbut the appeal wore off in a hurry especially when you hung out at the bar and got to know them talked with them on their breaks then sooner or laterusually soonerthe same tired depressing stories came out of their mouths the childhood sexual abuse the cold distant fathers the alcoholic mothers the teenage abortions the drug addictions especially the drugs these girls were so coked up it was a wonder they could everstop dancing unless they hooked up with some sugar daddy they were just caught in the spin cycle until they were usedup coke freaks with more lines on their face than up their nose and then they were out the door and a fresh crop came in there was never a shortage of girls there was never a shortage of anything not in the world of eddie monaco eddie had five vintage cars including the rolls he usually drove around in he had womenlots of women and not just the dancers eitherand the women had lots of jewelry that came from eddies fingers eddie had a big house in rancho santa fe and a condo in la jolla eddie had nice threads rolex watches and wads of cash the other thing eddie had a lot of was debts they went with his ambitions nothing was too good for eddie and nothing was too good for the pinto club he spent millions remodeling the placemillions he didnt havebut he wanted the pinto to be the premier topless club in california the base for a whole string of clubs eddie wanted to be king of the strip club world and he didnt mind spending money to get there problem was he was spending other peoples money eddiewas the king of opm hundreds of thousands of dollars of it but it didnt seem to bother him at all hed pay off his old debts in fresh opm and that way he just kept kiting the debt around somehow people were always willing to give him money one of them was a loan shark named billy brooks billy used to hang out at the pinto ogling the tits and ass and cruising for customers his two goons were usually with himgeorgie yoznezensky known for obvious reasons simply as georgie y and angie basso who was actually eddie monacos favorite dry cleaner when he wasnt breaking legs for billy angie was your typical goombah but georgie y georgie y was acase a tall gangly immigrant from kiev with thick wrists and a thicker head a guy so stupid and violent even the russian mob up in the fairfax district didnt want him hanging around somehow he hooked up with billy and billy gave him occasional work even getting him a job as a bouncer at the pinto eddie gave him the job as a favor to billy and why notbilly had loaned eddie and billy wanted to get paid back eddie blew him off billy would keep coming by the club asking eddie for his money at first eddie would tell him tomorrow i promise or next week billy sure thing hed put him off with free girls who would take billy back into the office for a blow job or down the street to a motel for a quickie but billy wasnt satisfied with pussy billy wanted hismoney and he wasnt getting it and he had to sit there and watch while eddie rented entire clubs for a night and threw himself a party or drove around in his rolls with playboy models cuddled up to him or gave cnote tips to doormen and coatcheck girls and just generally threw money around like paper airplanes and didnt pay billy penny one it didnt help that eddie was handsome eddie was cool and that billy was neither he had a mutt of a face and this hangdog expression bad hair and bad skin it must have been frank thought years later like richard nixon watching bill clinton pull chicks if eddie had just been nice to the guy things might have gone down different but eddie got tired of billy nagging him all the time and started blowing the guy off ignoring him not returning calls brushing right past him in the club like he wasnt there what am i billy said to mike pella one night an asshole this was new years eve and they were sitting at the bar of the pinto club where billy had arranged to meet eddie to talk about the situation the fact that it was new years eve had not sat well with patty new years eve shed complained i thought we could go out i have to work work she said hanging around with a bunch of whores theyre not whores frank said well some of them arent he thought theyre dancers what they do isnt dancing its the busiest night of the year do you know the tips ill make frank asked besides he thought going out on new years eve to a restaurant or a hotel paying double for the same meal which was usually subpar with slow service and a mandatory percent service charge thrown into the deal when i could be out making good money look well go outtomorrow night ill take you anywhere you want to go no one goes out on new years night patty said so we can get a table frank said big fun patty said two cheap people in an empty restaurant ill call you at midnight frank said well smooch over the phone for some reason that didnt seem to mollify her she didnt even speak to him when he left when frank got to the club he sat at the bar listening to billy brooks bitch to mike mike and billy had done time together in chino so they were old friends as frank sat there that night listening to billy whine about his eddie monaco problem he knew what mike would say about that and mike did no offense billy mike said but you should know people are talking the way youre letting eddie laugh at you it cant be good for business no it cant frank thought a loan shark has two assetscash and respect you let one guy not pay youand throw it in your face in public to bootand pretty soon the rest of your customers get the idea they dont need to pay you either word gets out that youre a sucker a pussy a wimp and then you can kiss your money goodbye it aint ever coming back principal or interest then youd better give up the shylock business and go into something youre more suited tolike nursing or library science this was what billy brooks was facing and it was a problem because eddie monaco was a tough guy and he had his own mob connections if billy just took eddie outlike he ought tohe could have serious problems with the migliores it was an interesting dilemma truth was everyone was watching to see how billy brooks would handle the situation im in a hell of a situation here mike billy said thats all he had to say all he had to say and frank knew that eddie monaco was a dead man mike pella was never a guy to let any grass grow under his feet theres money in tits and ass mike had told frank all those years ago big frank wasnt so sure if mike had meant big tits big asses or big money but whatever hed meant hed been dying to get into the topless club business and this was his chance the very next day new years day mike went to eddies condo in la jolla mike waited until noon because eddie probably hadnt gone to bed until eight or nine in the morning eddie opened the door blurryeyed smiled when he saw it was mike hey guy what mike shot him in the face three times billy brooks got instant respect and a piece of the pinto club mike figured that if billy had a piece of the club that meant that he did too now mike wasnt just dropping customers off at the door or coming in for an occasional drink he started hanging around the club all the time like he was one of the owners which in his view he was all of mikes crew started hanging therebobby bats johnny brizzi rocky corazzoand mike would comp their drinks their meals their backroom blow jobs mike was running up a tab at the pinto as long as his arm and pat walsh didnt have the stones to ask him to pay and neither did billy and mike never thought anything of it he figured billy owed him which he did and mike being mike he wasnt content to take the freebies sit back and watch the money roll in no he had to squeeze the club for everything it was worth what he did was he started selling the girls their coke it was a lucrative sidelinesell blow to the girls let them build up an expensive habit then put them out to the business trade to let them pay for their jones then take percent of their hooker money mike even bought an apartment building near the club andgave the girls the first and last months rent knowing that the coke habit would take the rest of the rent money angie basso and georgie y were always there to shy the girls the rent money and then they really had them hooked the girls could never catch up and that was the point pretty soon mike was gettingall their moneytheir tips their hooker money their porn money that was mikes next entrepreneurial maneuvertake a girl who was hopelessly behind on the vig and the rent and give her the chance to make some money doing a porn video a year down this road billy came to frank about it hes going to ruin the business billy said the cops are all over the place ive had five girlscount them fivebusted on drug and prostitution charges he has a sixfigure bar tab what do you wantme to do frank asked i just drive a limo thinking you brought him in on this billy you didnt want mike you should have handled your problems yourself yeah butshit frank shitnothing billy anyway frank thought i have problems of my own like a divorce patty was threatening one i cant really blame her frank thought im always working im never home and when i am home im asleep other than that she spends most of her time wondering where i am what im doing who im doingeven though ive told her fifty thousand times im not sleeping with the girls still they had argued about it and the last fight had been a doozy you knew the deal frank had said you knew who i was when you married me i thought you were a fisherman yeah right frank said frank baptista chris panno mike pella jimmy forliano come to a fishermans wedding with envelopes of cash you grew up in the neighborhood

night well i guess theyre smarter than i am she told him if things didnt change she was going to file frank had all this on his mind when billy was bitching about mike running the pinto club into the ground its none of my business he told billy you have a problem with mike take it up with mike yeah good advice three nights later mike grabbed frank at the bar and told him they needed to have a little talk with billy this guy is giving me shit can you believe it mike said this fucking ungrate thatsin grate mike blinked you sure yeah because itsun grateful notin grateful mike said i just did it on a puzzle frank said he was spending a lot of his waiting time these days doing crossword puzzles i looked it up anyway mike said we gotta straighten this fucking billy out mike i dont have to

they went for a cruise in franks limo east on kettner into the warehouse district billy brought georgie y along for protection frank drove georgie y rode in the front with him and mike and billy sat

should give you what i gave him georgie y reached into his pocket for his gun frank cranked the wheel steered the limo to the curb and with his other hand trapped georgies wrist against his waist it wasnt easygeorgie y was a strong boy billy was trying to bail out he was fumbling with the door handle when mike started shooting three blasts made franks ears ring he couldnt hear a thing he just saw georgie ys lips mouthing the wordjesus then he turned and saw billy slumped against the car door his right shoulder a mass of blood and a bullet hole in his face but he was breathing frank jerked georgies pistol away from him put it in his own pocket then said come on i have some towels in the trunk frank looked around no other cars no cop cars with sirens screaming he got out opened the trunk grabbed the towels then went around to the backseat get the fuck out of my way mike mike got out of the car and frank slid in he wrapped towels around billys shoulder and then pressed another hard against the head wound georgie get in here he felt the big man flop onto the seat hold this tight against his head dont let go georgie y was crying georgie you dont have time for that frank said do what i tell you frank got out grabbed mike and pushed him into the front passenger seat then he went around got behind the wheel and tromped on the gas pedal where the fuck you think youre going mike asked the e room he aint gonna make it frankie thats between him and god frank said i think you already did your part mike hell talk frank he wont talk he didnt billy knew the rules he knew that if he had been fortunate enough to survive one gunshot to the head he wouldnt luck out the second time so he stuck with the story hed been coming out of the club and some junkie tried to rob him he never saw the guy he never saw anything else either the bullet hit a nerve and left him permanently blind youre going to pay him frank told mike billy keeps his share of the cluband youre going to cut him in on the shy like you said mike didnt argue he knew frank was right and besides frank always thought that mike felt bad about shooting billy even though hed never admit it so billy still owned the pinto club but he didnt come around much after he got out of the hospital watching strippers couldnt have been that much fun for a blind guy but billy brooks kept his mouth shut it was georgie y they had to worry about mike did anyway the cops are all over this fucking thing mike said to frank one night they know billys story is bullshit theyre going to press you and me frank we can stand up but i dont know about georgie i mean can you see him in an interrogation room no frank thought i cant and thanks by the way he said for putting me in the way of an accessorytoattemptedmurder beef this temper of mine mike said so what are we going to do about georgie have the cops contacted him yet mike shook his head its the yet im worried about we cant clip a guy on a yet frank said we cant mike you do it im done with you frank told him my hand to god ill turn my face away from you so georgie y kept his life and his job as a bouncer at the club the only difference was now he went out and busted legs for mike instead of for billy he even started dating one of the dancers a skinny little thing named myrna and they seemed to get along pretty well so that should have been the end of it it wasnt the strip club wars were just beginning frank will never forget the first time he saw big mac mcmanus hell nobody ever forgets the first time they saw mac a sixfootsix pound black man with a shaved head and a cut body comes walking into the place wearing a tailored leopardskin dashiki and carrying a diamondstudded walking stick you tend to remember the moment frank was sitting in a booth with mike and pat walsh when big mac strolled in big mac paused on the landing just inside the front door taking in the scene more to the point he let the scene takehim in which it did about everyone in the place looked up and stared even georgie y was looking up big mac mcmanus had a couple of inches on georgie who seemed to have the sense that he should be doing something even though he didnt know what that was he looked over to frank for direction and frank gave him a subtle shake of the head like leave it alone georgie this is out of your league georgie let big mac through big mac descended the stairs into the club he had three guys with him three white guys frank got the sly joke right away the black man had an entourage and they were white mac walked right over to the booth and said billy brooks thats me walsh said mac mcmanus mac said he didnt offer to shake hands i want to buy your club its not for sale i have controlling interests in the cheetah the sly fox and bare elegance to name a few mac said i want to add the pinto to my portfolio ill pay you a fair price with a generous profit figured in did you hear the man mike asked he said its not for sale excuse me mac said but i wasnt talking to you do you know who i am mike asked i know who you are mike pella mac said smiling youre a wise guy whos done stints for assault extortion and insurance fraud the word is that youre with the martini family but the word is wrong youre more of an independent operator with mr machianno here its a pleasure to meet you frank ive heard good things frank nodded meet my associates mac said this is mr stone mr sherrell and last but not least mr porter stone was a tall muscled blond california dude sherrell was shorter but thicker with black permed hair that had just gone out of style both men were dressed casually jeans and polo shirts porter was medium height medium build his hair cut short he wore a dark suit white shirt and a tie and had a cigarette between lips that otherwise held nothing but a continual smirk his black hair was greased straight back and it took frank a second to figure it out before he realized that the guy was going for the bogart look and almost made it too except that bogie had a soft side and there was nothing about this guy that was soft they all nodded and smiled mac took a card from his pocket and laid it on the table im having a little gettogether sunday afternoon at my place he said im really hoping that you gentlemen can attend very casual very mellow bring dates if youd like but there will be an abundance of ladies there say two oclock or thereabouts he smiled turned and left with stone and sherrell at his heels porter paused made a special effort to get franks eye then said nice meeting you blokes blokes mike said when porter had walked away british frank said check them out mike said it didnt take long to get the rundown horace big mac mcmanus was a former california highway patrol officer who had done a fouryear stretch in the federal pen for counterfeiting now fortysix he was a major player in the california sex trade it was true that he was a silent partner in the clubs that he had mentioned he was also a bigtime porn producer and distributor and probably ran hookers out of both the clubs and the movie sets he lives frank said get this on an estate in rancho santa fe he calls tara the fuck is that gone with the wind frank said john stone was a cop jesus shit mike said he was mcmanuss partner before mac got busted and hes still on the chp he has a piece of all macs clubs and he spends most of his time helping mac run his business righthand man sort of thing mike asked more like a partner danny sherrell was the manager of the cheetah his nickname was chokemaster was he a wrestler or something mike asked frank shook his head porn actor oh mike said thenohhhh what about the brit his name is pat porter frank answered beyond that we dont know much about him he came over here about two years ago sherrell hired him as a bouncer at the cheetah he must have worked his way up in the world jesuscops mike said what are we going to do frankie go to a party i guess tara was amazing the house had been built to match the antebellum mansion in the movie the only difference was that all the servants were white not black a white teenager in a red vest ran up to franks limo opened the passenger door and was surprised to find that there was nobody in the back just me frank said flipping him the keys be careful with it frank walked onto the huge expanse of soft green lawn where tents and tables had been set up he was wearing a suit but he still felt shabby compared to the other guests who were all arrayed in various forms of expensive casual california cool lots of white linen and cotton khaki and cream mike had gone the blackonblack route he looked just like a goombah and frank felt a little ashamed that he was embarrassed you seen this spread mike asked they got shrimps they got caviar tritip beef champagne little party my ass he does this every other sunday frank said youre kidding me beautiful place beautiful grounds beautiful food beautiful wine beautifulpeople that was the thingall the people were dropdead gorgeous handsome men incredibly lovely women were like mutts here frank thought i guess thats the point mac made an entrance onto the lawn dressed in an allwhite linen suit and gucci loafers with no socks he had a woman on his arm who was wearing a slinky summer dress that revealed more than it hid i know that chick mike said yeah right no iknow that chick mike said then a few seconds later he blurted thats miss may thats miss fucking may mcmanuss grooving apenthouse centerfold mac and miss may worked through the guests pausing and smiling and hugging but it was clear that mac was working his way over to frank and mike when he did he said gentlemen im so glad you could find the time mike frank this is amber collins frank was praying that mike wouldnt bring up his revelation he didnt he just gawped a pleasure to meet you nice to meet you frank said do you have everything you need mac asked something to eat something to drink were good frank said how about a tour of the house mac asked sounds good said frank amber mac said ill miss you but could i ask you to play hostess to the other guests the house was unreal frank who appreciated quality recognized that mac did too he knew good stuff and he had the money to pay for it all the fixtures the plumbing the kitchen appliances were topoftheline mac led them through the enormous living room the kitchen the six bedrooms the screening room and the dojo im into hung gar kung fu mac said six six frank thought two and a half bills cut like stone and a martialarts black belt god help us if we have to take big mac mcmanus down in back of the mansion mac had his own private zooexotic birds reptiles and cats frank didnt know his zoology all that well but he thought he recognized an ocelot a cougar and inevitably a black panther i love animals mac said and of course all the movements of kung fu are patterned after animalsthe tiger the snake the leopard the crane and the dragon i learn just by watching these beautiful specimens you got a dragon here in a manner of speaking mac said i have a komodo dragon but the dragon is a mythical beast of course you keep its spirit in your heart they walked back into the house this is like the playboy mansion mike said as they walked back through the main room hefs been here mac said you know hefner mike asked mac smiled would you like to meet him i can arrange it lets go to the study sit down have a dialogue the study was a quiet room in the back of the mansion all the furniture was dark teak african masks adorned the walls the carpet and sofa were zebra skin the large chairs were some kind of exotic leather that frank didnt recognize large builtin bookcases held a collection of volumes on african art history and culture and the floortoceiling cd racks contained an archival collection of jazz do you like jazz mac asked seeing frank eye the collection im more of an opera guy puccini you got it yougot it mac said he pushed a few buttons behind his desk and the opening strains oftosca filled the room it was the bestquality sound that frank had ever heard and he asked mac about it bose mac said ill set you up with my man mac pushed another button and a butler came in with a tray with two amberfilled glasses which he set on side tables next to the chairs singlemalt scotch mac said i thought you might enjoy it what about you frank asked i dont drink or smoke or do drugs he sat down in a chair opposite them shall we do some business were not selling the club mike said you havent heard my offer frank took a sip of the scotch it was smoky and smooth and a second later he felt its warmth permeate his stomach congratulations on the pinto club mac said youve done very well with it but i think that i could take it to the next level in ways that you cant hows that mike asked horizontal integration mac said i take my adultvideo actresses and book them into the clubs take my star dancers and put them in the videos we do that now mike said in a cheap way mac said im talking about headliners names in the industry people you cant afford similarly you pimp your girls to traveling salesman for a couple of hundred bucks our girls go with millionaires youve told us why you want to buy the club mike said not why we should sell it you can sell it now and make a profit mac said or you can wait until i drive you out of business and lose money i control six clubs in california another three in vegas pretty soon ill be in new york the headliners the names will work my clubs and no others another six months to a year you wont be able to compete at best youll be a bottomfeeding operation selling draft beer to joe lunchbucket i might consider selling you fortynine percent mike said but i wouldnt consider buying it mac replied iwould consider an eighty percent share believe me youll make more with that twenty points than with your current one hundred he waved his hand as if to encompass his estate and frank got what he was trying to say boys look at my home and then look at yours hes right frank thought it was the move to maketake a profit from the sale of the eighty points then let big mac make money for them what would we have to do with the club if we sold you this interest mike asked nothing mac said go to the mailbox pick up your checks and that was the problem frank saw mike loved the club he loved playing owner being the man this was the flaw in the plan that mac couldnt see he hadnt correctly gauged mike pellas real interest id want to maintain some kind of managerial voice in the operation mike said you mean sell coke to the girls and shylock them the money mac asked smiling no that has to stop the business is growing up mike pella youd better grow up with it or what or ill drive you out of business not if youre dead you wont is that really the road we want to walk down mac asked you tellme mac nodded he took a deep breath and closed his eyes as if he was meditating then he exhaled opened his eyes smiled and said ive made you a business offer mike pella i encourage you to consider it in a businesslike fashion and get back to me in a timely manner in the meantime i sincerely hope that you enjoy the rest of your afternoon if youd like amber can introduce you to some friends of hers who are unattached mike liked he hooked up with one of ambers friends and they found their way to a bedroom in the guest house frank went back outside and enjoyed the food the wine and the beautiful people macs associates were there of course john stone was in the full swing of the party frolicking in the pool with a couple of young ladies while danny chokemaster sherrell played his faithful wingman porter wasnt in the pool he was in his same dark suit sucking on a cigarette and every time that frank glanced his way porter was checking him out from behind a whirl of smoke either the guy is queer for me frank thought which is very doubtful or he has an agenda either way frank wasnt going to let it ruin his enjoyment of the party food which was excellent he was munching on a shrimp satay when mac approached him youre too smart for those people mac said youre wasting yourself come work with memake some real money in a classy environment im flattered frank said but mike and i have been together a long time every additional day is a waste thanks for the offer frank said but no thanks mikes my guy ill stick with him i respect that mac said no offense none taken but try to get him to do the smart thing will you mac said the smart thing is always good for everybody but mike didnt see it that way later that night even as he was relating the marvels of sex with a futurepenthouse model he was saying you know were going to have to kill that moolie no i dont know that frank said as a matter of fact i think you should sell him the eighty points youre fucking kidding me right im serious as a heart attack no fucking way frankie mike said no fucking way hes acop mike hes anex cop mike said and an excon once a cop always a cop frank said they stick tighter than we do and hes got a cop partner so its the same thing i aint selling the pinto mike said he called mac to tell him so the next week inspectors started coming around the placefire inspectors health inspectors water inspectors they all found something wrong and none of them took the usual c note instead they wrote the place up the following week chp cars started parking across the street customers would pull out of the lot and get stopped for dui jerked out of the car made to walk the line blow into the tube the whole nine yards even if they werent legally drunk it was a hassle undercover cops started coming into the placesniffing around the mens room for dope pretending they were johns looking for working girls trying to buy coke from the bartenders customers started to be afraid to come in it hurt business somethings gotta be done mike said to frank and frank knew what that something was you want to start a shooting war with the chp he asked mike mac called and upped his offer by ten grand as a peace gesture mike told him to go fuck himself the next week two girls were busted for prostitution and another for possession the following morning pat got a call from the liquor commissioner who was threatening to yank the clubs license mac upped his offer again mike told him to fuck himself in the ass privately he wasnt so confident what the fuck are we going to do he asked frank what the fuck are we going to do sell him the club mike had a different answermore of a traditional wiseguy response he firebombed the cheetah lounge he was very careful to do it after closing even making sure that the janitor was out then he and angie basso launched two very wellbuilt molotov cocktails through the window the joint didnt burn to the ground but it was going to be a long time before it opened again just to make sure mac got the point mike phoned him with condolences gee he said its too bad the fire inspectors werent out there mac got the point he got it so well that angie basso got jumped coming out of his drycleaning business late at night pat porter and chokemaster sherrell dragged him to the edge of the sidewalk held his hands over the edge and jumped on his forearms snapping both his wrists you shouldnt play with fire porter told him what am i going to do angie asked mike the next night i cant even take a piss by myself dont look at me mike said but he responded he had to or give it all up so three nights later frank waited in the backseat of a car parked across the street from bare elegance waiting for the chokemaster to lock up mike was in the drivers seat because frank didnt trust him to make a good shot im just going to shoot him in the leg mike had said youd screw up and hit the femoral artery frank had told him then sherrell would bleed out and wed be in a fullscale war id aim for his dick miked said couldnt missthat target mike had rented a couple of sherrells old porn videos and shown them in the back room of the club frank was halfconvinced that mike had picked the chokemaster for a target out of phallic jealousy anyway now he sat low in the backseat of a work car and watched while sherrell came out said good night to the bartender pulled the metal screen down and started to set the padlock frank stuck the rifle through the cars open window sighted in on the fleshy part of sherrells right calf and fired sherrell went down mike hit the gas and that was it frank knew that the bartender would come back and get sherrell to the hospital the chokemaster would be on crutches for a couple of weeks if that all in all it was a very tempered response to the assault on angie basso whose wrists would take months to heal if anything it was ade escalation of the war but instead the other side kicked it up a notch frank saw it happeningliterally he was at the airport waiting for a pickup when he saw pat porter walk into the terminal frank gave him a little space and then followed him in where porter met a direct flight from heathrow and warmly greeted two men as they got off the plane they were what the brits would call hard men frank could see that by the way they walked and carried themselves heavily muscled but graceful like athletes one was barrel thick and wore a rugby shirt over jeans and tennis shoes the other was thin and a little taller sporting an arsenal football club jersey porter had brought in a crew they showed up at the pinto club two days later it was late afternoon on a tuesday just when the afterwork construction crowd would start to come in pretty quiet not dead frank was sitting in his regular booth grabbing a quick cheeseburger and a coke before the evening rush started and hed have to leave to make pickups he spotted the british crew as they came through the door so did georgie y who left the bar where he was sitting with myrna and started toward the englishmen they smiled like he was a meal walking their way frank waved georgie over to the booth instead frank georgie said i dont like them coming in here did i ask what you like frank said myrnas up go watch her dance think about what shell be doing later tonight with you frank what did i say georgie i have to repeat myself now georgie gave porter a bad look then took a seat ringside and watched myrna gyrate her little body in a bad imitation of eroticism porter walked over to franks booth his two boys still decked out in their sporting gear on either shoulder frank didnt ask them to sit porter was in his uniformdark suit buttoned collar skinny black tie he looked at frank and said you know in the end its going to come down to me and you what is this shane frank asked laughing looking at porters face he knew one thing for sure about him pat porter didnt like being laughed at me and you porter repeated frank looked over porters shoulder then what are they here for to make sure no one else steps in porter said i know how you guineas are frank went back to eating his cheeseburger im on a clock sam spade he said chewing if you have a point make it otherwise frank jutted his chin toward the door im going to kill you frankie machine porter said or make you kill me ill take door number two frank said porter didnt get the joke he just stood there like he was waiting for something what frank thought am i supposed to jump up and draw were going to do b westerns on kettner boulevard frank finished the last bite of his burger took a swallow of the coke then stood up and slammed the heavy glass into the side of porters face rugby shirt started in but suddenly frank had a pistol out he cocked it pointed it at the two sidekicks and said really apparently not rugby shirt and arsenal stood there frozen keeping the gun on them he reached down to where porter was now kneeling with blood pouring down the side of his face grabbed the mans tie wrapped it around his neck and with his gun on the other two brits dragged porter across the floor up the stairs to the landing and out the door he waved the pistol at rugby shirt and arsenal and said out youre dead mate arsenal said yeah out they walked out the door frank came back into the room stepped carefully over the broken glass and blood and sat back down in the booth he signaled to the waitress for the check everyone was staring at himthe waitress the bartender the three construction workers sitting at a table myrna and georgie y they were all wideeyed what frank askedwhat im in a bad mood all right he thought i havent seen my kid awake in three weeks my wife is threatening to call a lawyer im trying to eat a burger before i work all night and some brit has to come in and hassle me with bad movie dialogue i shouldnt have toexplain myself to you people get me some club soda and a few bar towels he said ill clean it up frank the waitress said thank you angela frank said but i made the mess ill clean it up we have cheesecake today frank thats okay honey im watching my figure he cleaned up the blood and broken glass and was more than normally alert when he went out in the parking lot to start making his pickups when he got back with his first customer mike was waiting for him laughing dont youever fucking lecture me about my temper again the blood came out of the carpet okay mike looked at frank then grabbed him by the cheeks and said i love you i just fuckinglove you all right he turned to the whole bar i just love this fucking guy two weeks later it happened it shouldnt have wouldnt have except that mike suddenly had a group of japanese businessmen who wanted to party and he needed both limos to take care of them so frank would be driving instead of doing what he had planned to do which was make a pickup of some shy money it was supposed to have been a very simple nosweat errandthis junkie boyfriend of one of the dancers had borrowed some money and was going to make his first payment on the vig have georgie do it mike said he can swing by the guys place on his way in so frank called georgie and he was happy to do it frank and mike went out and drove the japanese around and when they got back to the club it was one in the morning and myrna was sitting at the bar two other strippers holding her shoulders as she sobbed hysterically it took frank thirty minutes to get the story out of her she had gone with georgie to make the pickup the junkie lived in an apartment building in the lamp they were going to pick up the money on the way in to work so thats why she was with him they pulled into the parking lot and georgie told her to wait in the car she said that was fine because she needed to get her makeup on when georgie got out of his car three guys got out of another did you recognize them frank asked myrna nodded then broke into another fresh bout of sobs when she recovered she said frankie one of them was that guy you beat up the other day he had bandages on his face but i recognized him the other two were the guys who were with him frank felt sick as myrna told the rest of the story georgie tried to fight them but there were three of them one of them kicked georgie in the head and his legs buckled under him she got out of the car and tried to help him but one of the guys wrapped his arms around her and held her then the guy with the bandages took something out of his pocket and hit georgie in the face with it the other guys grabbed georgie and held him and this guy just kept hitting him and hitting him mostly in the stomach but sometimes in the head too and when they let georgie loose he just fell to the ground then the guy with the bandages on his face kicked him over and over and over again in the ribs and in the crotch and in the head he kicked georgie one last time in the head myrna said and georgies neck kind of snapped back and then the guy with the bandages came over and said she broke down again what did he say myrna frank asked he saidtell you she took a deep breath and looked him in the eyes it was supposed to beyou frank itwas supposed to be me frank thought porter got this junkie to set me up but poor dumb georgie walked into it instead if it had been me thered be three dead brits lying in that parking lot now instead of georgie wheres georgie now frank asked in the hospital myrna sobbed hes unconscious they said he isnt going to wake up he has a sister ive been trying to get her number frank and mike were bedside fifteen minutes later georgie y was all tubes and needles a respirator was doing his breathing for him they sat there for three hours until the sister arrived from la she gave the okay to pull the plug frank and mike went to the junkies apartment hed split of course but the dancer was home at her place wheres your fucking boyfriend mike asked her after he kicked the door in i dont know i havent mike punched her in the mouth then stuck the gun barrel through her broken teeth wheres your fucking junkie boyfriend bitch you lie to me again the little shit was hiding in the bedroom closet junkies arent smart mike ripped the door off its runners yanked him out and punched him in the gut frank took a pair of the girls panty hose out of her chest of drawers and shoved them into his mouth then he ripped the phone out of the wall and tied the guys hands behind his back with the cord they walked him out to the car frank drove while mike held the junkie down on the floor in the back they drove out to the river floodway and pushed him over the edge the floodway was dry and the junkie was pretty beatup by the time he landed on the bottom mike and frank slid down and pulled him up to his knees the junkie was puking and starting to choke because the vomit was going back down his throat frank pulled the panty hose out of his mouth and the junkie puked then he gasped i swear i didnt dont lie to me frank said he squatted down and spoke quietly in the junkies ear i know what you did you have one chance to save yourself now tell me where they are they hang out down in carlsbad the junkie said some english place the white hart mike said frank nodded pulled his gun and fired into the junkie until the chambers were empty mike did the same they got back in the car and drove to the white hart they both knew the place the bar had warm beer bangers and mash and satellite feeds of soccer games so a lot of the socal british expats hung out there a pubstyle sign with oldfashioned lettering and a painting of a white deer was hung over the door and a union jack was stretched across the one window wait here frank said when they pulled into the parking lot he reloaded the fuck that mike said im coming with you this ismy thing frank said just have the motor running and the car in gear okay mike nodded he handed frank his own pistol frank checked its load then asked you got a kit in the trunk sure mike popped the trunk open clean frank asked the fuck am i mike asked some beaner robbing a eleven frank got out of the car walked back to the trunk and found what he expecteda twelvegauge sawedoff shotgun a bulletproof vest a pair of gloves and a black stocking he took off his jacket slipped on the gloves then buttoned up the vest and put his jacket back on over it then he stuck both pistols into his belt tucked the shotgun into the crook of his arm and pulled the black stocking over his head see you in a minute mike said frankie machine frank stepped through the door the place was nearly empty just a couple of guys at the bar the bartender and rugby shirt and arsenal were all sitting at a table drinking pints and looking up at a soccer match on a television set bolted high on the wall near the ceiling arsenal turned when the door opened the shotgun blast blew him out of his chair rugby shirt tried to stand to pull his pistol from his waistband but frank unloaded the second barrel into his stomach and he crumpled onto the table where is porter frank asked himself the mens room was at the back of the bar frank let the shotgun drop to the floor took both pistols from his belt and kicked the door in porter was braced against the sink his pistol raised he was wearing his usual black suit but his fly was unzipped and his hands were dripping water he fired and frank felt the three shotsthunk into the vest right over his heart knocking the air out of him and then he saw the look of alarmed surprise in porters eyes when he didnt go down frank fired twice with the gun in his right hand porters head smashed back against the mirror cracking it then he slid down the sink and onto the floor blood pooled onto the yellowed tiles theyll never get that out of the grouting frank thought as he dropped the gun turned and walked out of the bar mike had the car in gear frank got in and mike drove slowly out of the parking lot onto the street and then pulled on the bap would have been proud where to mike asked tara frank said sometimes you just have to go in usually you try to be careful you set everything up youre patient and you wait until the moment is exactly right but sometimes you just have to go in they stopped off at mikes condo in del mar first mike had an arsenal tucked away in the guest bedroom closet frank picked out two snubbies a wellington over and under tengauge an ar and two hand grenades when they got to tara there was no guard at the gate and it was open what do you think mike asked i think theyre waiting for us inside frank said i think we drive in and they ventilate the car sonny what sonny corleone mike said you guys ever watch anything else youguys they drove the car around the back got out and climbed over the wall frank knew they must have tripped off motion sensors but nothing happenedno lights no alarms still he thought mac must have nightvision cameras linked to the sensors and hes probably watching us now on the monitor thats okay you knew when you came in that you were going to fight the battle on his terms it was like being back in vietnam charlie never fought except on his own terms if you found him it was because hewanted you to find him frank carried the ar and had the shotgun slung over his back he liked the automatic rifle for rangethe shotgun wouldnt be that useful until they got inside if they got inside they had to walk through the zoo to get to the house it was weird because the animals were awake at night the birds started to squawk and he could hear the cats pacing in their cages see their eyes flash red and like vietnam frank expected to see other flashes break up the nightthe muzzle flashes of an ambushthen he realized that he and mike were between the shooters and the animals and mac wouldnt take a chance on one of his pets getting shot accidentally the pool glittered a cool blue it was lit up but there was nobody out there not anyone they could see anyway theyre inside the house frank thought or better on the roof waiting for us to get in so close that they cant miss any second the night sky is going to light up like the fourth of july frank edged around the pool then flattened himself on the patio at the edge of the house and signaled mike to do the same then he trained the rifles night scope on the roof and scanned it left to right he didnt see anything but that didnt mean they werent up there lying flat against the dormers or behind the chimneys it was about fifty feet of open lawn to the back of the house cover me he whispered to mike then ducking as low as he could while still being able to run he dashed toward the house and threw himself flat against the wall he took one of the grenades out of his pocket hooked his finger inside the pin got ready to flip it up onto the roof and then waved his hand to mike mike lunged off the ground and raced to the house and they stayed there for a few seconds pressed flat against the wall catching their breath the sliding glass door was locked frank smashed the glass with the rifle butt then reached in and pushed the door open mike pushed past him and went in with his shotgun at his cheek and swept the room nothing frank leapfrogged past him to the next wall and they made their way through the house like that they found mac in the dojo shirtless and barefoot wearing only the pants of a blackgi he was slowly and rhythmically slamming roundhouse kicks into a heavy bag the bag doubled up and popped toward the ceiling with every kick the solid wham of the impact echoing through the empty room a jazz flute played quietly on the sound system a stick of incense burned in a holder on the floor frank stayed twenty feet back and kept the rifle trained on him a man of macs size and athletic ability could cover that distance in a stride and a half and the kick would be lethal mac turned his head to glance at them but didnt stop kicking i left the front door open for you he said you went to a lot of needless trouble upset my animals and you broke my slider they beat the kid to death frank said mac nodded and kicked the bag again the motion looked both smooth and effortless but the bag flew up toward the ceiling and then dropped again with a shudder i heard mac said i didnt authorize it i dont approve of it lets just fucking shoot him frank ive left myself vulnerable to you as a gesture of my sincerity mac said and of my contrition if you want to kill me kill me im at perfect peace he stopped kicking the bag frank backed off two more steps and kept the rifle trained but mac knelt on the floor rested his haunches on his heels took a deep breath of the incense closed his eyes and opened his arms with his palms held flat up the fuck is this mike asked frank shook his head but neither of them shot a long minute went by then mac opened his eyes looked around as if he was a little surprised and said then lets discuss business you should know that you are behind the information curve mr porter has decided to pursue his own agenda his exact words were im tired of working for some jumpedup monkey the monkey in question being myself that being the case i am willing to accept a fifty percent purchase of the pinto club and if you want me to kill pat porter ill kill him thats already been taken care of frank said mac got to his feet and smiled thats what i thought youd say life was really good for a while theyd had to lay low in mexico for a few weeks with the cops and the media all over the strip club wars like vultures it had everything that the eleven oclock news guys could want and moresex violence gangsters and more sex stripper after stripper gave onair interviews and one even held a press conference then some new horror took the pride of place and the media moved on the cops had a longer attention span four murders in one night apparently related put a lot of heat on the homicide guys and the fbi came in on the oc angle and started a turf battle everyone liked mike pella for the georgie yoznezensky murder but for a change mike was actually innocent of that so it never got any traction myrna kept her mouth shut and mike got her a job at a club in tampa the stripper with the junkie boyfriend just split town and frank heard years later that shed overdosed in east st louis as for the three brits gunned down in ninety seconds at the white hart nobody at the bar could identify the shooter and the guns had no prints and were untraceable eventually the san diego cops and the feds decided that it had been a london turf battle fought out in mission viejo and they put it in the cold file so mike and frank took a vacation in ensenada and then came back to the sweet life because being partners with big mac mcmanus wascake mac had the golden touch he was like this king this magnificent emperor of an enchanted land where milk honey women and money flowed in streams but frank didnt get in on any of that he turned down mikes offer of a piece of the pinto because the feds were all over it he kept working the limo thing plowing the money into his fish business or socking it away against the proverbial rainy day he would go to the sunday afternoon parties sometimes though to get in on the buffet youre going to pick up whores patty would say no im not it was a tired old argument sundays should be for your family patty argued youre right frank said lets all go nice patty said now you want to bring your wife and daughter to anorgy she had a point there frank had to admit although he never took part in the sexual escapades mostly he and mac would repair to the dojo and work out mac taught him martial arts taught him in fact the move that would save his life on the boat almost twenty years later theyd work out hardhitting and kicking the bag then doing some sparring then hitting the weight bench where theyd spot for each other then theyd go and sip fruit juice and talk about life business music philosophy mac taught frank about jazz and frank got him into opera they were good times they couldnt last it was the coke frank never knew when mac started doing it but it seemed like all of a sudden thats all he was doing mountains of coke would go up macs nose and he would take what seemed like a harem into his bedroom and disappear for days after a while he stopped taking the harem and just disappeared by himself to emerge late in the afternoon if at all and demand more coke it changed him mac started to be angry all the time hed fly into sudden unpredictable rages and launch into long barely coherent rants about how he did all the work and all the thinking and how nobody appreciated him then came the paranoia they were all out to get him all plotting against him he doubled the amount of security around the place bought dobermans that he let prowl the grounds at night installed more alarm systems and spent more and more time huddled alone in his room he stopped going into his dojo altogether the heavy bag hung still and unused a lonely symbol of macs decline frank tried to talk to him it didnt do any good but mac loved him for the attempt all these people he said to frank one night when they were sitting alone together at the pool all these people are hangerson theyre all parasites not you frank machianno youre aman you love me man to man it was the truth frank did love him loved the memory of the distinguished generous genius that mac had been and could be again instead of the paranoid mean incoherent shell he had become mac looked awfulthe oncetight body was sagging and thin the man rarely ate his eyes were dilated and his skin looked like dark brown parchment paper these people mac continued will kill me no mac frank said but they did john stone came to frank one day at the sunday party that autumn and said hes cheating us who is our partner stone said he gestured toward macs bedroom where mac was holed up as he usually was those days and the sunday party wasnt what it used to be either fewer and fewer people came and those who did were mostly the hardcore sex and coke freaks no way frank said dont tell me no way stone said half our money is going up that niggers nose frank didnt want to believe it but the cheating talk only got worse stone and sherrell met with mike to show him the figures frank refused to be there he had it rationalized six ways to sunday a mac wasnt stealing b even if he was he was making them so much money they were better off with him stealing than without him c mac wasnt stealing but mac was he knew mac was stone confronted mac with the evidence and mac threatened to kill him kill him and his whole family kill them all hes gotta go mike said to frank frank shook his head no ones asking you for yourvote frankie mike said the decisions been made i just came as you know acourtesy because i know the guy is your friend you just came frank thought because you wanted to make sure that frankie machine wouldnt take it personally see it as a grudge respond the way i did over georgie ys killing well you have a legitimate concern there the guys down in the lamp mike added theyve signed off on it letting frank know that if he decided to do something about this hed be taking on detroit too what do the migliores have to do with it they own strip clubs mike said this moolie getting toxic affects them too they dont like it headlines are bad for business hes gotta go frank let me do it what let me do it frank said you guys are scared shitless of him youll panic and just blast away until theres nothing left of the man if it has to be done let me do it quick and clean i owe the man that much hes my friend frank found him in the dojo the sound system was blasting out miles daviss bitches brew frank walked in and saw mac standing on one shaky leg kicking the heavy bag with the other the bag barely moved and mac didnt even notice him frank walked up and put two slugs into the back of his head then he went home got his old longboard out of the garage and gave it a good waxing then he took it out into the water and let the waves pound him he never went back to the limo business or the pinto club patty filed for divorce later that year frank didnt contest it he gave her the house and custody of jill four more bodies frank thinks as he drives through the desert english pat porter and his two boys and mac four more candidates but not exactly strong ones hell all that was almost twenty years ago even back then the word was that people in london were relieved that porter and his crew hadnt cashed in on their roundtrip tickets and mac hed had no family no people and the sdpd hadnt exactly rushed to investigate the murder of a crooked excop of course mike lost the pinto club without mac to restrain him he ran it into the ground and ended up burning it down before the irs the bank or the other creditors could take it away from him then he got popped for the arson and went in for a ten spot the migliores eventually took over the whole san diego strip club business and the prostitution and porn that went with it with the combination as their grand protectors but what does it have to do with me frank wonders is it possible that the feds have reopened one of the strip club war cases and are going after the migliores so theyre eliminating potential witnesses including yours truly if thats the case maybe mike is in the dirt instead of the wind frank pulls off the road tired it hits him like a cold hard wave this fatigue thisdespair this acknowledgment of realitythat he can run and fight run and fight andwin every one but that eventually inevitably hes going to lose hell frank thinks ivealready lost my life the life i love anyway frank the bait guy is already dead even if frankie machine ekes out survival that life is gonemy home the early mornings on the pier the bait shack seeing my customers sponsoring the kids the gentlemens hour all gone now even if i live and patty and donna and jill whats left of them now for me brief tense meetings in hotels somewhere hurried embraces in the thick air of fear maybe a quick kiss a fast hug how are you whats new maybe therell be grandkids someday jill will send pictures to some post office box or maybe i can check in on one of those internet sites watch my grandchildren grow up on a little laptop screen if life is just running now why bother why not just swallow the gun right here jesus he thinks youve become jay voorhees this is what kills you surer than a bullet he makes a phone call the nickels been expecting it a call from frank on the backup phone four in the morning hes in that surreal half sleep when the phone rings frank thank god sherm look theres a clean passport and airline tickets waiting for you in tijuana sherm says you can be in france tomorrow morning the eu wont extradite on a capital crime everythings taken care of for patty and jill godspeed my friend am i going to walk into another ambush friend what the hell are you talking about sherm listens to frank tell him about the ambush at the bank and the gps monitor that led to the motel in brawley frank you dont think what am i supposed to think sherm frank asks who knew about that bank you and me they came frankie sherm says i gave them nothing i swear who came some wise guys sherm says and the feds the feds that buddy of yours sherm says hansen they have warrants out for you frank for vince vena and tony palumbo tony palumbo frank thinks that must have been the guy with the garrote on the boat you know anything about this palumbo sherm word on the street sherm says is that he was an fbi undercover an informant the guy behind the gsting indictments gsting frank thinks strip clubs teddy migliore and detroit who were the wise guys frank asked i dont know sherm says all i know is i gave them nothing frank whereare you yeah right sherm sounds legitimately hurt after all these years frank whatim thinking sherm you have to trustsomebody frank is that right frank thinks who there were three people who knew about the existence of that bankme sherm and mike pella the only one i absolutelyknow didnt flip on me is me so id better find mike and i dont know where he is theres somebody who might though can i trust dave because weve been friends for twenty years and because he owes me one it was in dave hadnt made it to the gentlemens hour in two weeks frank knew why everyone in san diego knew what was keeping the fbi busythe disappearance of a sevenyearold girl from her upstairs bedroom in the suburbs carly macks parents had put her to bed the night before and when they went to wake her in the morning she was gone just gone terrifying frank thought when he read about it in the paper a parents worst nightmare he couldnt imagine how the macks felt he knew that moment of sheer panic when he lost sight of jill at the mall for ten seconds to wake up and find her gone right from your own house her own bedroom unimaginable so frank didnt expect to see dave for a while the fbi always drew kidnap cases and he heard dave on the radio saying they were doing everything they could to find little carly mack and asking anyone with information to step forward the media were all over this thing like gulls around a fishing trawler demanding that the cops find little carly as if dave needed the proddingfrank knew hed be working this one thats why he was a little surprised that morning to see dave paddling out the tall agent was making a beeline for the break saw frank then jutted his chin toward the shoulder frank paddled over and met him there in the spot away from the break where a lot of the older guys went to wait for a wave or just take a breather and talk story dave looked bad normally serene no matter what was going on or how much pressure he was under that morning dave had black circles under his eyes and a look on his face that frank had never seen ragethats what it was frank decided daves face showed rage talk to you dave asked sure dave had quite a story to talk carlys parents tim and jenna mack were swingers jenna had been in a local bar with a girlfriend named annette the night before cruising for people to take home shed gotten hit on by a middleaged guy named harold henkel and shot him down about ten oclock jenna and annette gave up on finding any fresh meat annette phoned her husband and he came over to the macks for the same old foursome a little disappointing perhaps but better than nothing jenna went upstairs to check on both kidsfiveyearold matthew and little carlyand found they were both sleeping she kissed them both on the cheek shut their doors then went to the recreation room theyd built in the garage and got on with the party all four of them admitted to drinking some wine and smoking a little weed annette and her husband went home around am neither annette nor her husband had left the rec room before heading home tim and jenna didnt look in on the kids again before they went to bed about nine oclock the next morning the brother matthew went into carlys room to play with her she wasnt there matthew didnt think anything of it and went downstairs to have a bowl of cereal tim asked him if carly was awake and matthew answered that he thought she was downstairs jenna was still asleep tim searched the house and didnt find carly getting scared he went and looked around the neighborhood then called the neighbors by this time jenna was up and she was starting to panic matthew was crying they called the police within fifteen minutes guess who lives a block and a half away dave asked harold henkel frank said dave nodded we brought him in he owns an rv that he keeps parked out in the street said he was gone all that weekend out in the desert near glamis the rv was spickandspan frank you could still smell the pinesol jesus god monday morning he took his jacket and some blankets to the dry cleaners dave said i got a warrant searched his house and his computer the hard drive was full of kiddie porn the son of a bitch did it frank he took that little girl but hes shutting down on me and hes about to lawyer up if i charge him hell never tell where carly is what if shes still alive frank what if he stuck her out in the desert someplace and the clock is running down daves eyes were brimming with tears the man was about to lose it frank had never seen him like this before nothing even close how can i help you frank asked we have to find out where she is frank dave said and fast if shes alive we have to find her before its too late if shes deadthen the evidence is deteriorating every second ifwe ask him frank we lose her but if someone else could make henkel talk why are you asking me dave frank asked already knowing the answer because dave answered youre frankie machine dave booked henkel that night without charging him warned him not to leave town then drove him in a darkened van out the back exit of the federal building to protect him from the press took him downtown where he could get a cab to wherever he wanted you might not want to go home dave warned him the media have your house under siege henkel got into the first cab he saw a block later frank stopped the cab and mike pella came off the sidewalk got into the backseat and jammed a needle into henkels arm before the man could react when henkel woke up he was back out in the desert naked and tied to a chair a man about his own age and just a little smaller sat on a stool in front of him whistling an aria as he meticulously ran the blade of a fishskinning knife down two sharpening rods that were set at fortyfivedegree angles from a board first the right side then the left the right side then the left this was an expensive sharpening tool that frank had bought to keep his even more expensive global kitchen knives in top shape there were few things in the world frank despised more than a dull knife one of them however was someone who would harm a child that was the top of the list he noticed that henkel had come to small wonder that jenna mack hadnt been interested henkel was a big man with a roll of fat around his middle balding on the top of his head with a saltandpepper mustache and goatee around a full mouth pale blue eyes that were just now widening in confusion and fear his rv was parked twenty feet away in a ravine in the desert where am i he asked who are you frank didnt say anything he just kept running the blade down the two rods enjoying the sound of steel on stone what the fuck is this henkel yelled he strained against the ropes that held his arms tightly bound against the chair looked down and saw his ankles securely ducttaped to the legs of the chair frank just kept whistling an aria fromgianni schicchi are you a cop henkel demanded a fine tone of panic had seeped into his voice fuckinganswer me frank slid the blade down one rod then the other one then the other slowly carefully my lawyers will crucify you henkel yelled stupidly frank looked at him now then tested the blade against his thumb and winced as it cut him he set the blade on his lap removed the two stone rods put them back in the case and carefully replaced them with two titanium bars then started the whole process all over again the sun was just starting to come up faint and pink it was still cold out there so henkel was shivering anyway but now he started to shake with fear he started to scream help help even though he must have known it was hopeless a desert rat like henkel would have known that they were out in the middle of the anzaborrego desert state park and that no one was going to hear him he must know this frank thought just the way he knew that no one was going to hear carly macks screams frank ran the bar down one rod then the other one then the other henkel started to sob then his bladder let go and urine ran down his leg onto the duct tape at his ankles his chin dropped to his chest and his head bobbed up and down as he cried frank finished thegianni schicchi aria and switched to nessun dormaran the blade down one bar then the other one bar then the other he tested the blade again nodded his satisfaction and carefully stored the bars back in their case he got up from his stool laid the blade against the skin on henkels chest and said harold you have a decision to makeprison for life maybe a lethal injection or i skin you henkel moaned im going to ask youonce frank said harold wheres the girl henkel gave it up hed left carly in an old mine shaft just eight miles from this spot is she alive frank asked trying to keep the quiver out of his voice she was when i left her henkel said he didnt have the guts to kill her after hed raped her so hed just left her for dead frank set the knife down took a cell phone from his pocket called dave and gave him the location then he said to henkel were going to sit here until it checks out and if youve lied to me you piece of crap ill take five hours to kill you and god himself will turn a deaf ear henkel started to mutter an act of contrition while youre praying frank said pray that that little girl is still alive she was barelyshe was close to hypothermia and severely dehydrated but she was alive a weeping dave hansen called frank as they were loading her on the chopper and frank he said thank you keep it out of the papers frank said dave did of course so did henkel frank untied him and left him out there with a warning that none of this had ever happened that henkel had confessed to the fbi and that if any other story emerged he wouldnt last a day in prison mike drove in whisked frank away and the feds arrived ten minutes later that night frank sat in front of the television watching the reunion of carly with her mom and dad he cried like a baby henkel never opened his mouth he pled out got years and survived two of them as the cellblock pinata until some biker on a crank rush got carried away and ruptured his spleen henkel died before the emts ambled to the scene charges were dropped against the biker for lack of evidence mostly because twenty other guys came forward to claim the honor and would have testified to it in court and anyway the prosecutors had better things to do the macks moved out of the city and quit the lifestyle frank and dave never spoke about it except for one time during the first gentlemens hour after carly mack had been found alive i owe you one was all dave had said nothing about frankie machine or what he knew about franks other life nothing about how frank had gotten henkel to give it up just i owe you one daves pushing his longboard into the back of his van when frank comes up behind him very sketchy surfing in a rainstorm frank says god only knows what toxic crap is pouring out of the storm drains youre just begging for hepatitis you have the right to remain youre not arresting me dave why not because you owe me one its the truth and dave knows it lets prove everyone wrong he says and get in out of the rain frank gets into the passenger side of the van the two men sit there looking at the ocean as raindrops splatter against the windshield you catch anything good frank asks mostly slop dave says where the hell have you been running did you run into a guy named vince vena by any chance frank stares at him he washed up in my jurisdiction dave says thanks a heap weird tides in weather like this frank says missed it bythat much if iwere to say i killed him frank says which im not id say it was selfdefense how about tony palumbo dave asks was that selfdefense too as a matter of fact bullshit frank dave says getting angry youre taking out the gsting witnesses what are you talking about palumbo was one of my guys dave says an undercover had been for years who paid you teddy migliore detroit heres how they paid me dave frank pulls the neck of his sweatshirt down to show dave the scar which is still angry and red your boy tried to take me out dave he had a garrote around my neck that doesnt make any sense dave says palumbo wouldnt be the first uc to work both sides of the fence frank says besides was vena one of your witnesses i was hoping he would be after i indicted him dave says but you took care of that you have this backward dave they tried to killme they didnt get it done he tells dave what mouse junior had to say about his discussion with john heaney and his confrontation with teddy migliore about a crew from detroit trying to take him out dave looks at his old friend two decades of gentlemens hours you get to know a man and then there was the carly mack case whats gsting have to do with me frank asks nothing that i know of dave says tell me the truth frank yells im trying to save my life here i can help you frank yeah like you helped me in borrego frank asks like you helped me in brawley you had sherm simon wired dave you had the gps put in with the money you tracked me and you gave me up to detroit i tracked you dave admits but i didnt give you up to anybody youre a dirty cop frank says looking into daves eyes for confirmation he doesnt see it what he sees is that his old friend is angry he hasnt seen him like this since the carly mack case come in dave says i wont go into the program frank says whatever else i am im not a rat then youd be about the only guy who isnt i cant answer for other guys frank says i can only answer for myself these guys are trying to kill you dave yells and youre going to stand up for them what has pete martini ever done for you orany of these guys ever you have a daughter frank on her way to med school whats jill going to do with you six feet under jill is taken care of frank says so is patty you stubborn bastard can you give me my life back no dave says but i can give youa life back even if its true frank thinks its not good enough i have an ask dave payback for carly mack anything dave says i owe you one all i can figure is that this has something to do with something mike pella and i might have done back in the day frank says ive been out of the loop for a long time now i dont know whats what i have to know if mikes dead or if hes alive where the hell he is i thought you might know something about that i cant do that frank frank looks at him for a second then opens the door to get out shut the door frank frank shuts it dave says i need your word you wont kill him so mikes alive and the fbi has him under surveillance its all hooking together i just want to talk with him frank says the sky is a pearl gray and like a pearl shiny in the rain almost translucent its pretty frank thinks he watches a wave swell on the outside start to build a thick wall of water rolling in a whitecap dancing on the edge like a tightrope walker pella has no involvement with gsting dave says so we like him for the goldstein murder kaboom the wave explodes with a dull bass roar in franks head he feels like hes drowning held under in the impact zone thats not possible frank says dave shrugs hes in palm desert under the name paul otto you guys have him under surveillance dave shakes his head hes in the program frank mikes a rat frank had been retired for a while back in retired from thelife anyway no more limo business no more strip clubs no more oc he was working his bait shop his fish business his linen service and his rental managements when mike pella came to him to talk

the wide shoulders though still wide were a little stooped las vegas should beour thing mike told him not new yorks not chicagoslas deck chairs on thetitanic frank thought a bunch of hyenas squabbling

blackjack its all corporations now lawyers and guys with mbas peter is ready to make a move mike said take back whats ours make our family a real family again how many times have we heard this real family chorus frank asked we heard it from bap we heard it from locicero then regace then mouse before he went away the first time mouse before he went away thesecond time its for real this time what makes this time different herbie goldstein mike told him fat herbie frank thought pavarotti lookalike herbie the will rogers of the pastry counter the man who never met a doughnut he didnt like this guy is mouses ticket to the show time had not been kind to herbie hed done an eightyear stretch for using funny plastic and stealing stamps stealing stamps thats what it had come to frank thought in prison herbied had not one but two bypass operations and a couple of toes amputated because of diabetes now he was out running an autobody shop so he could launder shylock money through it and dick insurance companies on car repairs at the same time herbie doesnt have any juice frank said he does now mike said turned out that herbie had the arm on a billionaire casino owner named teddy binion who gave herbie to put on the street then herbie did a very smart thing he turned it all over to an indian an indian frank asked indiangambling mike prompted this guy goes to reservations gets them to build a casino gets the management contractand the shy business on the chronic losers hes getting from both endshe gets the skim and he gets the vig from the money he puts out on the street or the dirt roads or whatever the fuck they have on these places chief running deer or whatever the fuck his name is kicks to herbie who kicks to binion who has a wicked coke and showgirl habit which herbie provides him both so so mike explained binion is in hot water with the nevada gambling commission over his drug use and his friendship with known mobster herbie goldstein hes a half hour from seeing his name in the black book which means hell be forced to sell the casino so hes going to let herbie come and bust it out skim the fucking shit out of it and get this mike said binion trusts herbie so much he gave him all his jewelryhundreds of thousands of dollars worthfor safekeeping herbies got them in a safe in his house he held up his wrist and showed frank his new patek philippe watch herbie

therebesides i want you to have this shot its your chance to be aplayer you want to sell bait the rest of your life as a matter of fact frank thought i do that would be just fine mouse senior asked me to ask you mike said he would consider it a favor which translated meant it was a command performance they met at dennys dennys frank remembers thinking at the time this is what its come tolunch meetings at dennys shiny menus and greasy chins the martini brothers were studying the menu like it was thedaily racing form arguing over the fresh catch of the day item you see a ocean out there carmen asked pointing out the window at the desert no mouse senior answered then how the fuck can it be fresh i think it means it was fresh when they froze it mouse senior replied heres frank ask him hesells fish what about it frankie they catch it flashfreeze it then overnight it frank told him taking a seat next to mike is thisyour fish mouse senior asked him i dont sell to chains so should he get the fish carmen asked no frank felt like his head was about to come off the sheer tedium mouse senior set his menu down thanks for coming frank no problem peter carmen nodded his thanks and frank nodded back it took about a year and a half to order all on separate checks frank asked for an iced tea thats it mouse senior asked thats what youre having for lunch an iced tea thats all i want frank said thats like antisocial mike said no offense intended frank replied the truth was that frank liked food too much to eat any of this stuff and more important he had a lunch date following this summit meeting he had met this stunning dancer named donna the night before at the tropicana she had said shed go to lunch with him but not dinner and he was going to take her out to someplace really nice lets get down to business carmen said when the food arrived herbie goldstein hes a greedy selfish miser mouse senior said a little dab of tuna salad on the corner of his lip that fat jew boy is making money hand over fist and not paying anybody fat jew boy frank said whats that what youre herbies big friend all of a sudden mouse senior asked no ive been his friend foryears frank said so have

insisted tonight frank said everybody looked at him i have a date today frank said it was agreedfrank and mike would have a talk with herbie that night and get him on board but frank mouse said if herbie doesnt do the right thing then then ill take care of it frank said then it will go the other way he thought and that was it the guys finished their meals happy with the knowledge that they were about to use fat herbie goldstein to bankroll their takeover of las vegas then went up to the counter to pay their separate checks frank said his goodbyes visited the mens room and waited there until they had all left then he walked past the table and saw just what hed expected three bucks and change in tips the cheap bastards had sat there for two hours and left three bucks and change frank took two twenties out of his wallet and laid them on the table lunch with donna was great he took her to a little french place off the strip and the lady knew her away around a menu they were at the table for two and a half hours talking drinking wine eating good food enjoying each others company she was from detroit originally her father had spent his life on the ford line and she knew she didnt want that life she was good at dancingshe had the body and the legsso she studied dance ballet until she got too tall then tap and jazz she went to vegas with a boy she thought she was in love with got married but it didnt work out he liked hitting on cocktail waitresses even more than he liked wailing on me donna said the boy went home she stayed she met an entertainment director in the buffet at the mirage and he got her an audition for the line at the tropicana she went to bed with him out of gratitude and because he was a nice guy but nothing came of it except that she got the job i saw other girls she said sleeping around getting into the coke thing trying to party their way into something better i realized that therewas nothing better and the party scene was a deadend street so i pretty much just did my job and went home and washed my hair she did get married again to the chief of security at circus circus the marriage lasted three yearsno kids thank godand then she discovered he was sleeping around with chip girls and was blowing their money hitting on eighteen why am i telling you all this she asked frank im usually a very reserved person its my eyes frank said i have kind eyespeople tell me things you do have kind eyes you have fantastic eyes she told him all about her business plan im going to stay on the line for two more years she said then im going to open a little shop what kind of shop womens clothing she said a boutique upscale but not out of reach where he asked here in vegas i think so he leaned across the table a little have you ever thought about san diego she didnt go back to his room with him that afternoon but she did agree to go out to san diego when she got a couple of free days he offered to buy her airline ticket and get her a hotel room but she said she preferred to pay her own way i decided a long time ago she said that a woman in this world needs to take care of herself i prefer it that way i like it i didnt mean to insult you frank said you didnt she said i can see your heart he and mike met up that night and went over to herbies house they rang the bell and there was no answer but they could hear the television and there were lights on the door was unlocked so they let themselves in herbie frank called they found him in front of the tv slumped in his big easy chair three bullet holes in the back of his head his mouth gaping open jesus mike said this wasnt supposed to happen frank said surprised that he felt an angry heat coming up on his face the place was a mess it had been tossedburglarized we better get out of here mike said one second frank said he pulled his shirtsleeve down over his fingers picked up the phone and dialed gave them herbies address and said that the resident there had suffered a heart attack what the fuck frank mike asked i didnt want him decomposing frank said as they walked out he doesnt deserve that he didnt deservethis look mike said as they were driving away half the hustlers in town knew what a pack rat herbie was what are you saying frank asked this was a coincidence could have been anybody you know better than that frank checked out of the mirage got into his car and drove all the way to la it was morning when he got to westlake village and found mouse senior at his coffeehouse drinking an espresso munching on apain au chocolat and reading thelos angeles times he looked surprised to see frank who ordered a cappuccino and an apricot danish and sat down next to him its probably better you dont come to see mehere mouse said at my place of business you want to go someplace else no its okay this once mouse said so did you get herbie straightened out no frank said looking into his face youdid it was there just a flicker but it was there before mouse composed his face looked irritated and asked what are you talking about you gave the nod frank said half wasnt good enough for you you wanted a bigger pie to cut up so you gave the nod mouse put thatboss tone in his voice the nod for fuckingwhat exactly to have herbie done mouse set his newspaper down herbies gone yeah how do you i saw the body theres a million junkies in vegas mouse said they all knew what a pack rat herbie was any one of them interesting frank thought he used the exact same phrase as mikewhat a pack rat herbie was he shook his head three twentytwos to the back of the head professionals herbie made a lot of enemies in his cut the crap what are you drunk mouse asked talking to your boss like that frank leaned across the table what are you going to do about it mouse what are you going to do about it mouse didnt say anything thats right frank said he was walking away when the young waiter came over with the coffee and danish you dont want your nothing personal frank said to him but your coffee is garbage and your pastry is crap you serve cheap shit to suckers who dont know any better i know better he walked out and waited for the blowback it didnt take long two days later mike showed up at the bait shop that was stupid what you did up in westlake mike told him you here to straighten me out mike looked hurt the fuck could you ask me that id do them before i took a run at you we should have our own fucking thing anyway not be tied to those limp dicks watch theyll find a way to fuck this binion thing up what happened mike frank asked when we left the table we were supposed totalk to herbie i dont know i was gone mouse has something to answer for frank said dont get crazy on me mike said its one thing to go insult a boss in his place of businessyou get a pass for that because youre frankie fucking machine its another thing you go looking to square herbie on a fuckingboss let it go so we just let them get away with it hey frank mike said herbie wasnt exactly saint francis of fucking assisi himself he didplenty believe me what were going to do now is swallow the shit smile like it was chocolate cake and get back to business which they did as usual mike was right you have an exwife to support frank told himself and a kid who needs orthodonture you have a mans responsibilities and you cant go getting yourself killed to get revenge for herbie goldstein as it turned out la never took over vegas not even a piece of it teddy binions jewelry collection got cut up and made an appearance on the street for a while but the martinis never succeeded in taking over his casino and busting it out binion held on until he died of an otherinflicted drug overdose and his young wife and her young lover took the fall for that the only one who prospered from the deal was mike pella who worked the indian gambling thing and gave it serious legs it was everything mike had always wanted a longterm integrated scam in which he took from the front the middle and the back ends he would have been a very wealthy man if he hadnt screwed up but we always do frank thinks now thats the trademark of the mickey mouse mafiawe always find a way to screw up usually over something stupid that was certainly the case with mike who was on easy street until he lost his temper and beat up a guy in a parking lot before mike slipped on the banana peel he was raking in money from indian gambling and never cut frank in on a penny not that frank expected it or even wanted it what he expected was what he gotmike saying i mean after all you never reallydid anything with herbie right no mike frank thinks nowyoudid the martini rico trial has been delayed again ostensibly because the feds think they have new evidence to link the martini brothers to herbies killing but there are two guys left who could connect the martinis with herbies murder frank thinks mike pella and me mikes in the wind and i havent been indicted but mike thinks im cooperating with the feds and thats why he tried to have me whacked because mike killed herbie why didnt i see it frank thinks as he rolls south on the it was always mike who was pushing for herbies murder he knew about the jewels he knew about the money and he was going to use the goldstein windfall to bankroll starting his own family mike knew damn well when we went over to herbies house that the fat man was already dead it was all an act now the feds are back on it mike thinks i know the truth and that im giving him up hes cleaning up his tracks and im one of them mike pella comes home from the bar turns the living room light on and finds frank machianno sitting in the lazboy with a silenced pointed at mikes chest hello mike mike doesnt even think about running this is frankie machine were talking about here so mike says you want a beer frankie no thanks you mind if i have one anything comes out of that fridge but a budweiser frank says ill put two in your head itll be a coors if thats okay mike says walking over to the refrigerator lite man my age has to watch the carbs you too frankie you aint no kid anymore either he gets his beer pops the tab off with his thumb and sits down on the sofa across from frank you look good though frankie must be all that fish you eat why mike why what why did you flip frank asks you of all people mike smiles and takes a drink of his beer i respected you frank says i looked up to you you taught me about this thing about things arent what they used to be mike says peoplearent what they used to be nobodys loyal to anybody anymore things just arent that way and youre rightimnot the man i used to be im sixtyfive years old for chrissakes im tired frank looks at him and heis different funny frank thinks how i see him the way he used to be not like this his hair is white and getting a little sparse his neck is thin in his collar and the skin is wrinkled so are his hands wrapped around the beer can there are lines on his face that never used to be there do i look that old frank wonders am i kidding myself when i look in the mirror and look at this place a used lazboy a crappy sofa a cheap coffee table a tv set a mr coffee a microwave a refrigerator and thats it nothing made with love or care nothing that looks lived in no pictures of loved ones an empty place an empty life god is this my future i dont want to die in the joint okay mike is saying i want to sit down with a beer fall asleep in my own chair watching a ball game with the miss july foldout on my lap im tired of all this mafia crap and thats what it is all crap theres no honor no loyalty never has been we were fucking fooling ourselves were in our sixties now and the better part of our lives is over so its about time we grew the fuck up frankie im just tired of the whole thing and i dont want no part of it no more if youre going to shoot me now fine shoot me if not god bless you killed herbie frank says you got me mike says and you were afraid i knew and id rat you out on it frank says and that would queer your immunity deal so you put a contract out on me i wasnt going to do that mike im not a rat im not you so if youre worried im going to tell the feds mike laughs theres no joy in his laughter no fun its bitter angry cynical frankie he says who do i work for now dave hansen sits at his desk staring out the window at the buildings of downtown san diego rain pelts the window like little stones occasionally a gust of wind brings the rain in sheets striking the glass with a sound like a flock of birds flapping their wings taking off as if something had startled them most days you can see the ocean from this window and the ridges of tijuana across the border today he can barely see across the street its all just fog and rain tears for frankie machine why frank asks why what why do the feds want me dead his head isscreaming its crazy what mikes telling me that the feds told him to put a contract on me it doesnt make any sense the feds going to mike then mike going to detroit to get the job done whats in it for detroit what can mike offer vince vena why ask why mike says they didnt tell mewhy frank they just told mewhat youre rightthey made me for herbie told me if i did them a favor i could keep my immunity deal the favor was you who who what who reached out to you franks asks whos running this thing theyd kill me if i told you that frank mike says frank gestures with the pistol barrel like ill kill you if youdont but mike smiles and shakes his head that aint you frankie you dont have it in you always your fucking problem mike drains his beer and gets up we got us a bitch of a situation here though dont we i dont see any way out of it you sure you dont want a beer i could sure as hell use another he walks to the kitchen hey frankie you remember summer of yeah that was a good summer mike says as he opens the refrigerator door he smiles and starts singing some folks are born to wave the flag ooh theyre red white and blue and when the band plays hail to the chief ooh they point the cannon at you lord he reaches into the refrigerator turns back and points the at frank frank shoots him in the heart twice it was suicide mike didnt have the stones to pull the trigger on himself so he got me to do it frank thinks as he leaves the house and gets into the car mike just didnt want to live anymore frank understands its what happens this life of ours piece by piece it takes everything away from you your home your work your family your friends your faith your trust your love your life but by that time you dont even want it anymore they take him on a downhill curve on highway jimmy the kid waits with whats left of the wrecking crew paulies on injured reserve with his leg wound but carlo carlo is a gamer dude carlo knows the diff between hurt and injured and hes going to be there when the whistle blows besides hes got a little payback to deliver and payback as they say is a bitch it was jimmy who figured it out sooner or later frankie m would go to mike pella to try to get this straightened out pella was his wingman his boy his goombah so it was a simple matter of finding out where the feds had pella stored then putting a net around it and waiting for frankie m to fuck up which he did rode right into the old box canyon there are only four roads out of ramona and three of them break off the same intersection so when frankie m turns north on the they know they got him its the worstpossible route for the man to take because it winds down the edge of a steep canyon a stone cliff on one side of the road the big drop on the other so as frankie m goes into the canyon they put a car behind him jimmys car waits at a turnoff on the other side of the road about two miles down its like one of them old westerns jimmy thinks the dumbass cavalry goes riding into the canyon where the apaches are waiting for them frankie m is custer and im geronimo he doesnt see it coming thats the thing fatigue heartache the sheer grind of being on the run combine to make him careless of course they wouldnt hit him at a protected witnesss house that would be giving the game away they wouldnt hit him close but wait until he was miles away then do it and make it look like an accident so he doesnt see it until its too late the silver lexus coming up behind him fast then a black envoya big heavy suvroars up passes the lexus and pulls alongside frank jimmy the kids in the envoy bopping his head up and down like hes listening to some of that hiphop crap then smiles at frank and jerks his wheel to the right the envoy bumps into franks car sending it toward the edge of the cliff frank manages to correct it but jimmy rams him again the physics are against him something the businessman in frank knows is that numbers never lie arithmetic is absolute a heavier vehicle at greater speed is always going to win the contest he tries to pull out letting off the gas so he can cut behind the envoy but the lexus has him boxed in and bangs him forward franks only hope is that a car comes up the other way and forces the envoy to swerve but even that wouldnt be any good because thered be no place for the envoy to go and some citizen would get killed which is the only thing i can say for myself frank thinks i never took out anyone who wasnt in the game only players he manages to stay on the road for the top part of the sweeping curve but physics are physicsnumbers dont lieand the bottom half is too much for the little rental car especially when jimmy the kid bashes into it again to make sure frank looks over and sees jimmy waving byebye then he goes over the edge they say your life flashes in front of you sort offrank hears a song the surfaris doing wipeout hahahahahahahahahahahahaawipeout that insane sarcastic laugh then the famous drum solo then the guitar riff followed by the drum again he hears it all the way down wipeout actually surfers have about a gazillion expressions for going over the edge of a big wave wipeout certainly off the lip over the falls in the washing machine franks been there before tumbling over and over and over wondering if its ever going to stop if youre ever going to come to the surface if you can hold your breath long enough to see the sweet sky again only that waswater this is earth and trees and rocks and brush and the horrible sounds of metal being crushed against all of the abovethen the sound of a gunshot which at first frank thinks is the coup de grace but is the gunpowder of the air bag going off the bag smacks him in the face then along the sides and the world is this tumbling pillow this unfun ride as the car plunges down the side of the canyon scraping against everything in its way its the scraping that saves his life the car scrapes against a tree limb which slows it down then against the side of a boulder then tilts over the edge of a narrow ravine slides over and finally comes to a stop against an old post oak the guitar riff fades out hahahahahahahahahahahahaa wipeout we should go down there and check carlo says they have the envoy and the lexus pulled off to the side of the road they cant see the car where its plunged into the little ravine but they can see the flames shooting out of it check on what jimmy the kid asks you can grill hot dogs on him yet the police and fire sirens have already started what we should do jimmy says is get the fuck out of here and they do frank crawled out during the last guitar riff it hurt like crazy just to unsnap the seat belt never mind open the door and tumble out and its even crazier when he hit the ground the ribs are at least cracked if not outandout broken and his left shoulder is a bulge down closer to his elbow than it should be and he doesnt even want to know whats going on with his right knee doesnt matter he has to get away from the car he knows hes taking a chance moving at all that a broken rib might puncture a lung or the internal bleeding might turn into an internal hemorrhage and then game over but it beats getting flashfried when the car goes fourth of july bellycrawling a good fifty feet away before the explosion he gets flat to the ground and digs his face into the dirt before it goes off the concussion is like a blow against his whole body and he feels his ribs burn like heis on fire but im alive he thinks and i shouldnt be he stays flat to the ground for a couple of minutes for one thing he needs to catch his breath for another thing jimmy might be coming down for a kill shot and he knows the firemen and cops will be all over this place if theyre not up there already when he catches his breath he grabs his left shoulder and pops it back into place biting his arm to suppress his scream he lies back down and gasps for air and its a good thing its raining or the fire might spread faster than frank can crawl away from it as it is the flames are just burning gas and air and not catching on the wet grass or the sodden trees frank starts to crawl away along the canyon bottom he figures he needs to get a good quarter of a mile from the accident and he knows what hes looking fora place to hole up until dark it takes him a half hour to find ita crevice under a rock on the facing canyon wall a thick mesquite bush hides the entrance and the overhanging rock will give him some shelter against the wind and rain he crawls in theres just room enough in there for him to pull himself painfully into a fetal position looking farther down in the canyon he can see the firemen spraying the car with a heavy blast theyll be looking for a body frank thinks and they wont find one but the cops will track the rented car back to jerry sabellico so that cover is blown and his whole survival kit is in the carhis clothes his weapons his money everything so this is what it comes to frank thinks as he tries to work his way into a more comfortable position shivering in a cave in pain everything gone waiting for night jimmy the kid waits for the hour then turns the local radio news on the traffic reporter chirps that both lanes of highway on the grade just past san pasqual road are closed due to a onecar accident a car went through the guardrail and plunged into the canyon she says however no fatalities have been reported motherfucker is what jimmy says your boy machiannos on quite a tear yes sir dave sits across the desk from the regional director called on the carpet as it were first vena and palumbo the rd says now pella for chrissakes dave a witness in the program gunned down in his own house hows that going to look not good you have a gift for understatement dave doesnt reply proving hedoes have a gift for understatement anyway the rd says it looks like machiannos back at his old career find him hansen find him and stop him yes sir dave gets up to leave and hansen machianno killed a federal undercover agent the rd says we dont really want to provide this piece of shit with a lawyer do we meaning dave thinks as he walks out the door hes not being ordered to find and stop frank hes being ordered to find him and kill him it takes him two hours to make it to the top of the canyon aching and sore frank picks his way through the brush and rocks in uncertain moonlight and fog he gets to the top and walks along the edge of the road throwing himself flat when he sees headlights coming each time he goes down it hurts more and its harder to get up but he has to keep doing it because he knows theyll be looking for him jimmys sitting in the passenger seat with one of those big halogen lights theyd gone to costco and bought it when they heard the radio news shouldnt we get right back there carlo had asked he wont come up till dark jimmy had said if hes alive at all either way we got plenty of time so theyd gone to costco its a good thing i brought my card jimmy says now he shines the light along the side of the road as they cruise slowly up and down the canyon tony joey and jackie are in another car doing the same thing in the other direction its likerun silent run deep jimmy thinks with the japanese destroyers steaming back and forth waiting for the american sub to surface because it has to come upits running out of oxygen like frankie m you see anything carlo asks bigfoot jimmy says where i was pulling your pud asshole jimmy says hey that bigfoot thing is no joke carlo says i saw a documentary on the national geographic channel national geographic dont mess around jimmy the kid isnt listening hes thinking it through what hes thinking is that frankie machine is a cockroach you just cant kill this motherfucker yeah but you got to so think a good hunter thinks like his prey so think like frankie m okay youre hurt maybe bad you aint moving so fast youre going to go to cover during daylight and try to move by night you gotta get out of that fucking canyon and you aint going out the other side because its too steep too high and there aint nothin back there anyway so youre going to come back up the way you came youre going to come back up the road because you dont have a car anymore and youre going to have to find transportation somehow okay but how youre fifteen hard miles from the nearest town where you can rent a car even if you do your id is going to ring bells as a guy who crashed and burned his last rental but youre frankie machine so you aint gonna even try that so that leaves you two choices you either hitch a ride or you steal a ride nobody in his right mind is going to pick you up and you aint going to stand out in the open on this road with your thumb out anyway because you know were looking for you and so are the cops so youre going to boost someones sled cool but how no red lights out here no stop signs no gas stations so whats left whats out here where people are going to stop then it hits him shit jimmy says turn around hurry whats up were going parking danny carver is about to get bare tit finally what he gets for dating a mormon girl other chicks are passing out blow jobs like skittles but shelly will not give it upat all dannys been at it for three monthstaking her to the movies to the mall going bowling playing freakingminiature golf and the most he can get is a quick kiss no tongue he would have dropped her on like date two if she werent so goddamn hot blond hair big blue eyes and thatrack it took two months just to get her to go parking with him at all come out here to the roadside parking lot where in the daytime the treehuggers park their cars to go hiking down in the canyon but at night the place is like health class you got droves of teenagers out here studying sex ed like its going to be on the sats and tonight shelly isinto it her hand doesnt even come down on his like a castle gate when he starts to unbutton her blouse i am in danny thinks thank you god i amin oh mygod shelly says oh yeah you theman ohmygod her body stiffens and shes looking over his shoulder its her father danny thinks sixfootsix mormon who shoes horses for a living dannys body stiffens he looks back over his shoulder bigfoot is in the window its like one of those stories you used to tell on camping trips about the guy with the hook except this guy doesnt have a hookhe has a gun and he gestures for danny to roll down the window danny does im not going to hurt you the guy says to danny yanking him out of the car i just need your vehicle all danny can do is nod as the guy slips past him into the drivers seat frank looks at the girl you can get out now he says and button your blouse huh shelly does both frank puts it in reverse and takes off jimmy the kid sees the two teenagers standing out in the parking lot the boy has a cell phone in his hand were too late jimmy says were too fucking late he rolls down the window what kind of car are you the triple a guys danny asks what kind of car a celica danny says silver jimmy the kid roars off were going to have to call my dad shelly says frank dumps the celica off in point loma and walks back to ocean beach if you can call it walking more like limping hobbling like some old bmovie monster frank thinks emerging from the swamp its a good thing its pouring like hell and the rainphobic san diegans are off the streets so they cant see this messedup bleeding freak lurching along the sidewalks theyd call the cops and that would be that frank doesnt want to go back to his safe house its risky goingback to anywhere but he has no place else to go and he has to go someplaceget out of the elements clean his wounds get some rest figure out his next move he unlocks the door of his narragansett street pad not knowing what might be waiting for him in there the cops the feds the wrecking crew but nobodys in the apartment frank gets out of his wet bloody clothes and gets into the shower both to get warm and wash his wounds the spray stings like needles he gets out gently daubs himself dry and looks at the blood left on the towel then he finds the hydrogen peroxide in the medicine cabinet sits down on the edge of the bathtub and looks at the deep scrapes on his legs he takes a deep breath then pours the peroxide on the wounds sings che gelida manina to distract his mind from the pain it doesnt really work he examines the wounds then pours more peroxide into them until he sees the chemical bubble up then he repeats the process on his arms and chest he gets up slowly finds gauze pads and medical tape and dresses the wounds it takes him a long time hurts to move his right arm anyway and hes tiredbonetired part of him just wants to lie down and give up just lie there until they come and put two in the back of his head but you cant do that he tells himself as he applies the gauze and wraps the tape around it to hold it in place you have a daughter who needs you so keep your head in the game he makes himself a pot of strong black coffee and sits down to think it over what the hell was mike trying to tell you that he was working for the feds that the feds forced him to set you up but why why would they want me dead doesnt make any sense maybe it was just more mike pella bull like him going to the refrigerator to get the gun knowing he was about to make his curtain call and going out singing some old song they used to like back in the day back in the summer of some folks are born to wave the flag ooh theyre red white and blue and when the band plays hail to the chief ooh they point the cannon at you lord ooh they point the cannon at you lord frank thinks keep going finish it theres something there it aint me it aint me i aint no senators son son it aint me it aint me i aint no fortunate one no no frank thinks not fortunate one fortunateson and not the summer of the summer of summer dave hansen is concernedon multiple levels first frank promised he wouldnt kill mike pella and then he did frank machianno is a lot of things and one of them is a man of his word so its troublesome second barely twelve miles away from pellas body a car goes over the edge of the canyon crashes and burns and yet no victim is found the driver is traced back to a rentalcar company except no one named jerry sabellico holds an arizona drivers license there was a jerry sabellico but he died in so it has all the markings of a professional cover a pro crashes a car twelve miles from a murder site where frank machianno is the main person of interest you dont have to be sherlock holmes larry holmes or even john holmes to put that one together third the crash was no accident no professional ever speeds away from a hit ever and besides frank in particular does fiftyfive miles per hour in order to get the best gas mileage and drives slower than that in wet conditions four frank went to pick up his mad money at a bank in borrego who knew about the bank sherm simon and through him me then frank goes to see mike pella who knew about mike pella me well not meexclusively us so dave has some mixed feelings when he gets on the buzzer and calls young troy into his office theyre all working on the machianno file now and troy has been at it diligently helping dave check dbas and shell companies to see if they can find any properties frank might own where he could be hiding whats up troy asks adjusting his cuff links i have a lead dave says on machiannos location really where dave gives him an address summer lorensen frank thinks nineteen eightyfivethe party on donnie garths boat then the scene at his house thats what mike was trying to tell me its all about fortunate son frank looks at the clock its in the morning and theres nothing he can do about it for a couple of hours at least the best thing he can do is get a little sleep but its too much effort to get out of the chair and it hurts too bad to move so he just leans back and shuts his eyes troy drives carefully through the rain even though theres little traffic on the streets this time of night but he can barely see in the slashing rainhis front and rear wipers are putting up a brave but losing fight against the buildup of water on the glass he drives down through the lamp gets out of his car near island puts his umbrella up and walks into a phone booth an umbrella to walk three steps dave thinks watching him from a car a block away with a cell phone clipped to your belt who are you calling dave wonders you dont want a record of he doesnt pause to think about it though therell be time to grab the phone records in the morning he has to get over there before the people on the other end of that phone whoever they are jimmy the kid giacamone sets the phone down lets rock and roll he says carlos beginning to think that jimmy is a real asshole jimmy knows hes got to get in and out fast a quickie in the sticky wham bam thank you m hes in a race with the feds to see who gets there first no consolation prize for second place no gift baskets or allexpensepaid weekends at a secondrate resort thank you for playing and we hope you had fun winner take all way it should be so jimmy and the wrecking crew roll up at the address hard and fast and with bad intent no more time for subtletyjust go through the door shoot anything that moves hope you get the machine before the machine gets you thats good jimmy thinks as the car skids to a stop i should go in the studio and cut thatget the machine before the machine gets you next hiphop hit out of motor city eight mile my rosy ass he gets out of the car the address is a jack in the box dave parked across the street can make out a crew when he sees one even in the pouring rain don winslow the winter of frankie machine dave goes back to his house and works from his study it doesnt take too long the patriot act gives him carte blanche access to phone records and he has the number that troy dialed within five minutes its a cell phone of course and thats more complicated he still tackling it on his computer when barbara comes in with a pot of coffee and some oatmeal cookies one of those nights she asks he nods theyve been married thirtyfive years shes been through more than one of these nights you look worried she says i am taking this one personally i suppose its one of the things she loves about him that he cares about his cases theyre not just numbers to him even after all these years pretty soon she says a few more months and you wont have these nights she kisses him on the forehead want me to wait up i dont even know if im going to make it to bed ill wait she says just in case it takes three more hours to wade through the recordsthen he tracks it down troy called donnie garth daylight finds frank in san diego counting on the fog and the hour to shield him from view and the gun at his hip to protect him from harm frank hobbles down toward eleventh and island where the old men sleep on cardboard on the sidewalk limping past the line of the sleeping homeless he listens to their mumbles and their groans smelling the body odor of caked night sweats and stale urine and the stink of rotting skin he stops at the door of the island tavern and bangs on it the place is closed but he knows hell find the heavy drinkers in there for their eyeopeners after a minute the door cracks open and a jaundiced eye peeps out corky there frank asks who wants to know frank machianno frank hears some muddled conversation then the door opens and the old manfrank searches for the guys name remembers its bennylets him in and points to the bar detective retired corky corchoran sits on a stool hunched over the bar a squat glass of whiskey by one hand a cigarette in the other frank sits down next to him long time corky long time back in the daybefore the bottle and the bitterness got himcorky was a damn good cop on the arm like a lot of guys hed take an envelope to overlook the gambling and the hookers but corky was a straight arrow on the serious things and all the guys knew it you beat a woman you hurt a civilian you killed someone outside the lines corky was after you and if corky was after you he was going to get you but that was a long time ago buy you a drink corky i thought youd never ask corky was never a big man but he seems to have shrunk frank thinks as he signals benny to bring another and his hair is thin and dry his skin yellowish drawn tight over the bones in his face i need your help corky corky finishes his old drink then takes franks and knocks it back what can i do you for summer lorensen corky looks at him blankly and shakes his head back in franks prompts him you were homicide then all those prostitute murders no humans involved no humans involved frank says thats right her body was found up on mount laguna in a ditch off the road corky sits there thinking about it for a long time just when frank thinks the old cop has drifted back into the enchanted forest corky says she had rocks in her mouth thats right frank says it went unsolved but the department later laid it on the green river killer corky pulls a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket and lights another his hands tremble wasnt no green river killer we laideverything on that fucking guy he was a oneman clearance sheet how do you know frank asks how do you know it wasnt him corky shifts into that crystal clarity that winos sometimes get they dont come often and they dont last long but hes in one now and frank hopes he stays there long enough first corky says she was beaten to death not strangled the green river killer strangled his victims she had trauma marks on her throat but they were made postmortem two there was no sign of intercourse he raped his girls three she wasnt killed out there along the road how do you know no blood smears frankie shed stopped bleeding a long time ago but she had rocks in her mouth frank says so fucking what corky asked her real killer couldnt read a newspaper so if you knew the department shut me down corky answered it came down from on highlay off the lorensen file move on no humans involved corky takes another long pull from his cigarette beginning of the fucking end for me frank he says the top of the slippery slope frank reaches into his wallet pulls out two onehundreddollar bills and presses them into corkys hand it brings back old times stay out of sight frank says dont let anyone know you were talking with me corky stares at him you gonna take them on frank take my advice dont do it you dont want to end up like me youre okay corky i wont see another summer frankie and then hes gone eyes sunk back in his head with the thousandyard stare and frank realizes that corky corchoran is in a place where he lives alonesomewhere in the past maybe somewhere in the future nowhere in the here and now and hes right frank thinkshe wont see summer and neither probably will i he pats corky on the shoulder ill see you not if i see you first frank turns to leave hes almost out the door when he hears corky say hey frank frank turns around we had our day didnt we corkys smiling yes we did corky nods damn right we had our fucking day frank walks back out into the foggy morning all right think think who else was there that night donnie garth for one but thats not going to get you anywhere there was another girl the redhead what was her name alison but it was over twenty years ago who would know where she is now he finds karen wilkenson on the polo grounds they sit in the valley where rancho santa fe meets del mar the grass unusually green and lush in this wet winter beautiful now as the early morning mist rises off the flats shes in the stables inspecting her horses theyre actually ponies frank thinks not horses the last time he saw her was in a price club parking lot twentyone years ago when a bank vice president was handing her an envelope of cash to provide girls for the party karen eventually served two years in some camp fed but she landed on her feet when she married a rancho santa fe realtor with old san diego money whores land on their backs when they fall madams on their feet shes still attractive in her late fifties the facelift was skillfulher skin looks young and taut and her eyes still have a shine ms wilkenson frank asks shes standing outside a stall stroking the ponys nose softly talking to the animal she doesnt turn around its mrs foster now she says and i no longer do interviews goodbye im not looking for an interview frank says then what are you looking for she asks whatever it is im sure i cant provide it goodbye im looking for a woman i knew as alison twenty years ago frank says nostalgia or obsession karen foster asks and now she turns around to get a look at frank neither frank says i want to ask her about summer lorensen karen says you dontlook like a police officer im not then i dont have to talk to you she says goodbye then you dont care who murdered her i loved that girl like a daughter karen says i wept for days as i did for alison what do you

karen says who are you what do you want i want to find who killed summer lorensen the police said that they found that man she says but we both know better dont we mrs foster frank asks she glares at him i dont know what youre talking about no no she says and if you persist in harassing me ill call some men and have you tossed out of here dont bother frank says im leaving and mrs foster what when you call donnie frank says tell him frankie machine says hello hes in san diego thats impossible tell that to karen foster he was just there where rancho santa fe shit it gets worse he was asking about summer lorensen silence for a few seconds this shit has to stop garth says you dont shut this down our end of the deal is off you said you could shut down gsting dave sits in a van outside of garths house tapping into a conversation hes having on the phone the other voice is unmistakable teddy migliore dave goes back to the office he feels sick to his stomach troy talks to garth garth talks to teddy teddy sends detroit hitters out to whack frank because of something frank knows about a summer lorensen summer lorensen summer lorensen theres something there lurking deep in the back of his head but it wont come to him he gets on the computer it only takes a few minutes to get a hitsummer lorensen was a prostitute murdered back in the summer of but what could that have to do with donnie garth or frank machianno for that matter dave goes back at it searching for a nexus between garth and the lorensen woman nothing comes up then he searches for a connection between garth and the date of lorensens killing bingo hammond savings and loan a boat party with prostitutes had ended up in the conviction of a savings and loan officer named john saunders for misuse of bank funds a madam named karen wilkenson got a couple of years for pandering it was all part of the whole savings and loan scandal and the party had occurred the night before the lorensen murder he types in the name karen wilkenson and in a few seconds finds out that she married and is now karen foster tell that to karen foster he was just there where rancho santa fe shit it gets worse he was asking about summer lorensen is it possible dave thinks donnie garth killed this girl somehow frank knows about it and then garth goes to his old mob connections to kill frank offering the shutdown of gsting in exchange but what makes donnie garth think he can shut down a federal operation maybe the reason that a young fbi agent is feeding him information dave looks over his shoulder and doesnt see troy he walks down to the mens room and spots the rookies pressed trousers underneath a stall he waits until he hears a flush then sees the trousers come up when troy opens the stall door dave hansens fist slams him back in blood from the kids broken nose sprays over his white shirt and his french cuffs dave grabs him by the throat turns him over and pushes his head into the toilet donnie garth dave says jerking troys head up what dave forces his head back down and says donnie garth you little shit is he paying you how much he lets troy up again the young agent gasps for air then he says im not working for garth i just report to him who are you working for dave asks troy hesitates dave starts to force his head back down then troy gives it up donnie garth has the shower blasting hes standing under the spray looking out through the glass at the ocean when suddenly frankie machines standing there with a pistol in his hand garth shuts the water off frank hands him a towel remember me garth nods wrap yourself up frank says garth wraps the towel around his waist frank gestures for him to get out and sit down garth takes a chair by the window frank sits down across from him i put two people in the dirt for you frank says garth nods again frank smiles im not wearing a wire youre the rat not me you know i always wondered how you got a pass on all that you get a pass on everything dont you donnie garth doesnt answer well frank says youre not getting a pass on this on what garth asks he looks small and old sitting there in the towel water dripping down his skinny legs into the thick carpet summer lorensen frank says he raises the gun and points it at garths chest it wasnt me then who was it garth balks as if hes trying to decide who hes more afraid of whoever it is frank says theyre not sitting here about to put one in you donnie and i am i saw you through the window that night the little act between alison and summer then i walked away what didnt i see the senator garth says couldntperform it was all set upthe lorensen girl wasbegging for it part of the act but he couldnt get it up she did everything to him believe me but it was a nogo then what happened she laughed what she laughed garth says i dont think she meant anything by it i think it was just her you know but he got mad he just went off go on you were there you know because you cant tell one janitor from another can you donnie me or mike cleaning up your messes for you whats the difference your shit gets cleaned up you dont have to look at it its clear to him now what happened they carried her body out to the car and mike drove her out on that lonely road and dumped her had the afterthought to strangle her and stuff the rocks in her mouth and fortunate son walks away clean it would have been manslaughter he would have done what two or three years tops maybe nothing at all but his political career would have been ruined we couldnt have that could we not over some whore no humans involved and everything stays quiet until mike starts to take heat over the goldstein murder so he starts looking for something to trade and hes got a big oneexcept hes not going to put himself in the bullseye so he puts me thanks mike so fortunate son starts to clean up his past and reaches out to donnie who reaches out to detroit to do it for him because these guys never do their own dirty work they have people likeme to do that what did fortunate son offer the combination hell hes going to be presidentwhatcouldnt he offer them did he use you as a gobetween frank asks tell me the truth donnie garth nods his eyes are wide with fear hes quivering and sweating and franks disgusted that he sees the front of the mans towel stained yellow frank pulls the hammer back hears garth whimper frank eases the hammer down and lowers the gun look frank says theyve already tried to kill me and theydid kill alison demers theyre going to clip anyone who knows anything about what happened that night including you or do you still think youre going to get a pass why shouldnt you frank thinks you always do if i were you frank says id run but he knows he wont the donnie garths of the world dont believe that people kill them they believe that people killfor them frank calls information and gets the number of the senators office id like to speak to the senator please may i ask whos calling tell him its a buddy from his solana beach days i dont think hes going to be available sir see and i think he is frank says why dont you tell him its about summer and well see whos right a minute later fortunate son gets on the phone if you record your calls frank says i suggest you shut the machine off who is this you know who it is frank says ill wait fortunate son comes back on the line a few seconds later okay speak you know who this is i have a pretty good guess you have the wrong guy frank says the wrong chauffeur i know its hard to tell the little people apart but it was mike pella in the limo that night not me if it had been me none of this would have happened because i wouldnt have let you beat a girl to death and get away with it i dont know what youre talking about frank holds the little dictaphone up to the receiver and plays donnie garths narration hes lying fortunate son says yeah frank says look i dont care ishould care that you killed that girl and now you killed that other one but the point is i have a life i want to live and a family to take care of so heres the deal senator i want a million dollars in cash or i go public with this i know i cant go to the cops or the feds because you own them but ill go to the media and then at the very least your career is over maybe we cant make you for the girls murder but we can put you at the scene and thats all it will take perhaps we could take the position that a million dollars senator in cash frank repeats and i want you to deliver it personally thats not going to happen fortunate son says which frank asks the cash or you me fortunate son says then send your pimp garth frank says and tells him where and when a long silence then how do i know i can trust you im a man of my word frank says are you i am then we have a deal we do fortunate son hangs up the phone frank turns off the tape recorder hes not a childhe knows theyre not coming with any million dollars theyre coming to kill him i could run frank thinks and i could make a good run of it i could stretch it out for years maybe but what kind of life is that watching myself slowly become poor jay voorhees until im relieved when they finally catch up with me no kind of life at all so let them come lets get this thing done it isnt right jimmy the kid yells illgo i can take him out he says despite ample evidence to the contrary garth says look this has been decided by who garth doesnt say anything which pisses jimmy off look i know who were working for i know the whole fucking thing how your senator couldnt get his macaroni al dente how he killed the girl how frankie m dumped her body it wasnt machianno garth says it was the other one pella pella then why the fuck were we trying to clip frank jimmy asks he doesnt know anything he does now garth says yeah jimmy thinks because youre a limper dick than your politician buddy and you spilled it all to him i can take him its been decided nothing has been decided until we talk to my uncle tony jimmy says weve talked to your uncle tony garth says he gave the okay hes already put it into motion jimmy feels like his head is going to blow off he cant believe what hes hearing uncle tony tony freaking jacks signing on to a sleazy deal like this uncle tony is a man uncle tony is oldschool he digs his cell phone out of his pants pocket and punches in the number it takes a few rings before the old man comes to the phone uncle tony this guy is trying to tell me easy kid tony says i can take him uncle tony you cant jimmy the voice is harsh clear and decisive this deal has to be completed successfully frankie m goes then gsting gets shut down fuck gsting jimmy says fuck the migliores and their clubs we can live without it dont be stupid tony says you think this is just about a bunch of strippers grinding their naked twats on laps smarten up this is just the down payment nephew let the senator cunt make this deal and then hes ours all the way to the white house better than kennedy better than nixon because we got this son of a bitch by the balls by theballs now hang up the phone and do what you got to do jimmy hangs up as always uncle tony is right but it still sucks what theyre going to do don winslow the winter of frankie machine jill machianno balances her ski bag between her hip and the wall as she unlocks the front door of her apartment she has the door open and is reaching for the ski bag when the tall redheaded woman comes up to her jill machianno yes im donna a friend of your fathers jill gives her a stare as cold as the snow she was skiing on i know who you are i dont want to frighten you donna says but your fathers had an accident oh my god is he hes going to be fine donna says but hes in the hospital is my mother with him shes out of town somewhere donna says your dad asked me to find you and take you to the hospital im parked across the street jill sets her skis and luggage inside the door shuts it and follows donna to her car dave hansen is at shores well at least theres plenty of parking he thinks as he pulls into the public lot across the street from the little playground donnie garth is already out there standing by the vacant lifeguard tower looking out at the gray sea he looks vaguely ghostlike in his hooded white slicker or dave thinks like a hopelessly out of place klansman dave gets out of the car and steps over the low wall onto the beach are you wearing a wire garth asks no are you im going to have to pat you down dave lifts his arms and lets garth feel him for a wire satisfied garth says lets go for a walk they head north toward scripps pier this summer lorensen nonsense garth says i dont know what you think you know but youdont know what youre fooling with see i think i do dave says thats the problem youre damn right its a problem garth turns to look at him rain drips off the edge of the hood onto his nose youre a few months away from retirement take your pension and go fishing visit the grandkids forget about all this what if i dont there are certain people who want you to know garth says that if you persist with this crusade youll leave with nothing youll be a security guard on the night shift if youre not in jail that is in jail for what start with cooperation with a known organized crime figure frank machianno garth says youve been protecting him or how about your collusion in the torture of harold henkel or assaulting a federal agent theres plenty hansen more than enough trust me and without friends to protect you oh you want to be my friend you need to decide who your friends are dave garth says you choose wrong you end up as a disgraced cop with nothing choose right you can live a happy life christ why would you sacrifice your future for some secondrate hit man anyway hes afirst rate hit man donnie dave says as you of all people should know garth stops and turns around ill walk back by myself if frankie machine contacts you we expect you to do the right thing do you understand dave looks over the mans shoulder at the waves id rather be out there he thinks in a wave under a wave anything would be better than this do you understand garth says yeah i understand frank sits in the little shack in the hills outside of escondido hes known about the place for yearsit sits up a dirt road in a canyon above the orange groves its a place to hidemojados they live up here away from themigra and go down just before dawn to pick the oranges then return at dusk except there are nomojados now you dont pick oranges in the winter in the rain nevertheless he can smell the tangy scent of the orange trees below makes him nostalgic sad that he wont be around to taste the oranges in the spring he has one gun and four bullets it wont be enough theyll be coming with an armyso four bullets or forty or four hundred or four thousand it wont make any difference because theres only one of you and you cant win this battle all those cliches about lifetheyre all true if you could cook one more meal ride one more wave have a chat with a customer smile at a friend hug your lover hold your child if you had more time youd spend it differently if only you had more time stop feeling sorry for yourself he thinks after all youve got it coming youve done a lot of bad things in this world youve taken life and thats the worst thing there is you can justify it all you want but when you look back at your life with your eyes open you know what you were all you can domaybe maybe is get a small measure of justice for a dead woman take the rocks from her mouth maybe give her daughter a chance for a real future the way youd like someone to giveyour daughter a chance jill whats she going to do you have to take care of your own daughter he calls sherm frank thank god i thought dont thank him yet frank says look i need to know it was the feds frank sherm says they had me under it was your buddy dave hansenhe had me wired he passed the info along it doesnt matter now frank says all that matters is that jill and patty are taken care of if you flipped on me you flipped on me im sure you had your reasons its blood under the bridge frank there are some properties frank says you know how to dig them out something should happen to me liquidate the assets make sure jills medical school is paid for you can count on it frank they have to let me take care of my family frank says they can do what they want with me butthey have to let me take care of my family that was always the way back in the old times patty and jill will be taken care of sherm says you have my word its hard to hear the tone of a mans voice over the telephone especially these tinny cell phones but frank is satisfied by what he can hear its all he can do anyway trust the nickel to do the right thing by the money even if sherm did betray him if theres a trace of honor left in this thing theyll let a man go out knowing his family is taken care of hey sherm frank says you remember that time down in rosarito you were wearing that big sombrero i remember frank those were good times hell yes they were goodbye sherm go with god my friend frank has set this up so theyll have to come uphill and into the sun he wants every little edge he can get even though it wont make any difference in the end but take say jimmy the kid out with you youve done a good thing maybe itll count in my favor when i answer to the man go with god he hears the car before he sees it then the engine noise stops smart frank thinks theyre coming in on foot theyll give the cabin lots of room work around it and come in from all sides he settles in lays the pistol barrel on the windowsill and gets ready to put one in the first head that comes into sight a head appears but he doesnt shoot because its donna they have jill she says what im sorry frank she says they have jill franks barely listening as she tells him the deal he hears her words hes taking them in but all thats really running through his head are the wordsthey have jill they have jill they have jill they have jill they have jill your faith your trust your love your life your child tomorrow morning she says four am beneath ocean beach pier you come unarmed but with a certain package they want do you know what theyre talking about frank yes you give them the package theyll release jill to me donna says you go withthem frank he nods how long he asks have you been with them forever she says since i was fifteen years old my father was a drunk he used to beat me up it wasnt the worst thing he did tony jacks stopped him he took me out of there he saved me frank when he was done with her he found her a job and a husband she tells frank when jay left donna says i was sad but i wasnt heartbroken i didnt really love him i never went back to tony but i stillowed him frank you have to understand that i kept an eye on things in san diego for him thats all you gave them my daughter i didnt know donna says crying now i just thought they wanted to talk to her frank i didnt know they were going to dothis tell them ill be there frank says with the package and ill go with them if i see jill see her safe he knows they wont let her go knows that theyll kill her please god please let her not be dead already please give me even a small chance to save her and now he knows that fortunate son is behind all this because no wise guy in the world was ever low enough to kidnap someones daughter it would take a politician to do that but who do you trust normally if a family member is kidnapped you go to the fbi but you cant do that because the fedsare the kidnappers or a wise guy would go to other wise guys to get justice thats how this whole thing of ours started anyway wasnt it ma figlia ma figlia my daughter my daughter but you cant do that because the other wise guys all want to kill you go ahead kill me but let my daughter go but they wont do that because the wise guys have been corrupted by the politicians lie down with dogs you get up with fleas the irony is i could have killed mouse seniors kid and billy jacks kidthey were both in my sights and i let them walk but i didnt because im a father too and it just isnt done it just isnt done so who do you go to who do you trust youve always been able to trust yourself but can you trust yourself to gun down the army theyre going to bring and keep jill safe in the process maybe maybe in your prime you could have done it but youre twenty summers past your prime youre old and youre tired and youre hurt you cant trust yourself to do this so where does that leave you more important where does that leave jill the answer is too awful to contemplate face it frank says there is only one chance and its not even a very good one but its the only one reluctantly he sets down his gun and picks up the phone dave hansen remembers a breakfast he had with frank machianno at the obp cafe a few years back some months after the carly mack case it was after an especially flat session at the gentlemens hour and frank was in a rare bad mood it was something in the paper about a crackdown on organized crime and frank just went off on a rant nike pays twentynine cents to achild for making a basketball jersey then turns around and sells it for one hundred and forty dollars frank said andim the criminal walmart sends half the momandpop stores in the country the way of the buffalo while they pay the kids who maketheir cheap crap seven cents an hour andim the criminal two million jobs have gone adios in the past two years a working man cant afford a down payment on a house anymore and the irs mugs us like drunks at an atm then sends our money to a defense contractor who closes down a factory lays off workers and pays himself a sevenfigure bonus andim the criminal im the guy who should get life without parole you could take the crips the bloods the jamaican posses the mafia the russian mob and the mexican cartels and all of them put together couldnt rake in as much green in a good year as congress does in a bad afternoon you could take every gang banger selling crack on every corner in america and they couldnt generate as much illgotten cash as one senator rounding the back nine with a corporate ceo my father told me that you cant beat the house and he was right you cant beat the white house or the house of representatives they own the game and the game isfixed and it isnt fixed forus sure every thirtyeighth blue moon theyll whack one of their own send a human sacrifice to some club fed for a couple of years as sop to the masses and an example to the others of what happens to a rich white guy stupid enough to let that fifth ace fall out of his sleeve in full view of the public but letme slip on the cosmic banana peel and i am going to the maximum hole with the rest of the losers for the rest of my life you know why the government wants to shut down organized crime were competition thats it thats whats behind the oc task force your fbi rico rico big government and big business that is the workingdefinition of racketeering in conspiracy a felony happens every time two suits take a piss together in the senate mens room so the government wants to beat down organized crime thats hysterical the governmentis organized crime the only difference between them and us is theyremore organized that was franks rant on organized crime dave didnt believe it then but he sure as shit believes it now not that it matters he thinks i have to do what i have to do i have the rest of my life ahead of me the rest of the guys are coming along the beach but dave is coming in by boat from the water it seems only fitting its cold and dark coming on four in the morning on a winters day in san diego the famous sunshine doesnt start for a few hours and the real sunny warm days dont start for a couple of months but the storm is over now the big swell has blown itself out and the waves fall gently on the shore frank walks along the beach toward the base of the pier his body hurts his chest so tight with anxiety he can barely breathe first he sees the lights of the pier then the faint glow of a flashlight then he sees someone walking through the mist toward him a young man frankie machine the man asks frank nods jimmy giacamone the man says as if he expects frank to recognize him frank just looks at him so the man adds jimmy the kid giacamone frank doesnt respond to it jimmy the kid says i could have taken you frankie machine id a had the chance wheres my daughter shes coming dont worry jimmy the kid says i gotta pat you down first frankie frank raises his arms jimmy pats him down quickly and efficiently and finds the little tape cassette in franks jacket pocket this is it frank nods wheres my daughter just so you know jimmy says i dont approve of any of this this thing with your daughter im oldschool wheres my daughter come on jimmy the kid grabs him by the right elbow and leads him along the beach when they get under the pier he says i got it i got him hes clean a group of men come out of the mist like ghosts their flashlights in one hand their guns in another there are five of them the whole wrecking crew and donnie garth except he doesnt have a gun he holds out his hand and jimmy the kid gives him the tape he pops it into a dictaphone listens for a second and nods bring her to me frank says garth swings his flashlight up and down an endless minute later frank sees jill walking toward him through the fog with donna at her side daddy she looks like shes been crying but she looks strong its going to be all right baby daddy frank reaches out and holds her tight whispers into her ear go be a doctor make me proud she sobs into his shoulder daddy shhhhh its all right he looks up at garth i made copies theyre in safedeposit boxes all over the world if anything should happen to my daughtera robber shoots her she gets hit by a car she falls off a horsethere are people who will distribute this tape to every major news network jimmy the kid looks at garth let her go garth says listen shut up garth says i said let her go jimmy hesitates then nods his head at donna and says get her the fuck out of here donna starts to take her but jill grabs franks neck and wont let go daddy theyre going to kill you theyre not going to kill me baby he whispers im frankie machine donna slips the gun into his hands then pushes jill to the ground and falls on top of her frank shoots jimmy the kid between the eyes then one of the wrecking crew then another carlo gets a shot away before a bullet blows the back of his head off the shock knocks frank to the ground and he tries to aim at the fourth guy but sees hes going to be too late dave hansen sees the same thing haloed by the pier lights its a tough shot from a boat even with a rifle but he makes it and puts a round between the guys shoulder blades frank rolls swings his gun to the fifth man and shoots him in the heart garth is running frank gets up to chase him theyre neither of them young but donnie garth hasnt been through what franks been through the past few days so he starts to pull away frank sees that his legs arent fast enough but he knows a bullet will be he raises his gun to shoot then a searing pain burns in his chest and his left arm is numb at first he thinks its the bullet but then he feels his heart crack like a breaking wave and he cant breathe and the pain is awful he gets off one last shot and has the satisfaction of seeing donnie garth drop then frank stops grabs his chest and topples into the sand daddy jills voice is the last thing he hears dave hansen waits until the senators press conference is almost over the senator stands behind the podium flashing his trademark smile to the reporters and asks are there any more questions dave raises his hand the senator smiles down at him and nods do you know your rights dave asks the senator looks at quizzically you have the right to remain silent dave says stepping up toward the platform two secret service guys get in his way but dave holds up his fbi badge and pushes through them anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law dave says as he twists the senators hands behind his back and cuffs him cameras are going off and the bright video lights are striking dave full in the face he doesnt care you have the right to an attorney this is ridiculous the senator says this is just a political and if you cannot afford one dave says smirking one will be appointed for you what am i being arrested for the murder of summer lorensen dave says he starts walking the senator through the crowd heading toward the waiting car the media are closing in around them like a crosscurrent in the impact zone dave opens the door pushes the senators head down nudges him into the seat and closes the door again he gets into the front passenger seat and tells the intimidated young agent to step on the gas daves in a hurry hes already missed the gentlemens hour and he doesnt want to be late for frank machiannos funeral the crowd is immense frank the bait guy was loved in the community there are fishermen here and surfers and the little league kids with their families and students from the drama club and soccer kids and soccer moms and the teenagers who played hoops underneath the baskets that frank paid for and the local vietnamese are out in force and men are telling their sons how they caught their first fish on the pier at franks annual fishing contest and old surfers are telling their wives what frank used to be like back in the days of the long endless summers and one vietnamese guy is telling his kids how frank stood up for him just a few days ago who isnt here dave thinks as he takes a seat in the front row beside patty and jill is the mickey mouse club the ones that he hasnt already arrested are in the wind but hes going to pick them up soon because they arent that good or that smart and donna isnt here shes already in protective custody but donna is too classy to have come anywayshe wouldnt have wanted to cause any more pain to the grieving daughter and widow the flag is draped over franks coffin it was in his will that he wanted a closed casket so his friends would remember him the way he was in life not like some wax dummy the morticians made up dave stands as the marines fire their rifles into the air and the bugler plays taps its long and slow beautiful and sad under the warm sun of the false early spring day thats okay though dave thinks spring was always franks season the marines fold up the flag and hand it to patty who shakes her head they hand it to jill she takes it and smiles a tight smile brave dave thinks like her old man theres one last thing to be done it also came straight out of franks will a second later the recorded music comes out of the sound system ma quando vien lo sgelo il primo sole e mio il primo bacio dellaprile e mio il primo sole e mio epilogue if hanalei pier isnt the longest in hawaii it certainly is the prettiest jutting out from a soft palmlined beach with bali hai and the green mountains of the na pali coast rising in the background and early mornings are beautiful soft and warm yearround even in the hour before the sun rises the hour when the bait guy arrives to get things set up in his little shack at the end of the pier so that everything will be ready when even the earliest fishermen arrive to try their luck they know the bait shack is open because they can smell it even before they see itthe smell of fresh roasting kona coffee wafts down the pier and into their noses if theyre regulars or even if theyre nice and polite pete the bait guy will probably pour them a little cup and make them listen to a little opera and tell them a funny little story about how he had to fix the garbage disposal because hiswahini cant remember not to shove mango peels downda kine its a lot of work being me bruddah hell say what he wont tell them is about how he had a heart attack on a different beach and woke up in the icu and then in the witness protection program he wont tell them that and neither will his friend from the mainland who comes out about every year and surfs with him in the mornings during what is called even in kauai the gentlemens hour no pete will just smile share a joke and maybe an odd word from one of his crossword puzzles and theyll leave the bait shack with everything they need and smiles on their faces and a good feeling to start their day everyone loves pete the bait guy
