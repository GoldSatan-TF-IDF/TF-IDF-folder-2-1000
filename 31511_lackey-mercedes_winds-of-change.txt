winds of change by mercedes lackey prologue for long years the rich northern kingdom of valdemar ruled by queen selenay and her consort daren had been under siege by the forces of hardorn arrows of the queen arrows flight arrows fall by the sword ancar its ruthless and cunning leader had first tried treachery against the rival countrys court that had been foiled by the heralds of valdemar the judges lawgivers and lawenforcers of their people he could not corrupt them for it was not in the nature of the heralds chosen for their duties by the horselike creatures called companions to be corrupted he then tried direct attackthat was foiled by the forces of neighboring rethwellan to the south brought by an old promise of aid long forgotten in valdemar those forces included the mercenary company of the skybolts commanded by captain kerowyn granddaughter of the mage kethry whose own story is related in the oathbound and oathbreakers kerowyn brought more with her than just arms and fighters she brought with her an ancient and powerful enchanted weapon the sword her grandmother had borne need who for reasons then unknown could be commanded only by a woman with her she brought the king of rethwellans own brother prince daren the lord martial of his country also the younger brother of selenays former treacherous husband the result was the successful defeat of ancars forcesand the choosing of both daren for he was nothing like his brother and kerowyn by companions much to the consternation of some of selenays nobles and daren and selenay had loved each other at first sight five years later they had produced both progeny and an uneasy peace although ancar continued to make attempts across the border and insinuated spies inside valdemar but the one thing of which all felt sure was that they were safe from magic in fact few people in valdemar even believed in real magic although the mindmagic of the heralds was commonplace an ancient barrier attributed to the work of the legendary heraldmage vanyel seemed to hold the working of real magic at bay inside valdemars borders if not its effects further it seemed as if there was some prohibition about even thinking of real magic those who discussed it soon forgot the discussions those who witnessed it soon attributed their memories to dreams even old chronicles that spoke of it were forgotten and those who tried to read them found their interest lagging and put them away without a memory of why they had sought them out in the first place but one day it became plain that this barrier was no longer as effective as everyone believed and hoped the queens first marriage made the decision that the time to have the same manner of magic its enemies wielded and perhaps new magics as well she fought for the right to seek out the mages of other lands herselfmore successfully after a magicallyenhanced assassin sent by ancar nearly killed herand set off with the sword need and one other herald skif to find mages for valdemar she had not gone far beyond rethwellan when she deduced that she had not done this alonethat the companions had acted on her behalf and were in fact forcing her toward a goal only they knew angered by this and swearing that she would follow her own path in this venture elspeth turned off the road she had been intended to take and headed instead for katashinain and the nomads of the dhorisha plainswho she hoped would lead her to the mysterious hawkbrothers of the pelagirs the last of the heraldmages herald vanyel had been reputedly taught by them magics pawn magics promise magics price and she hoped that she could find either allies or teachers there the shinain had their own set of plans for her once they learned of her destination they intended to test her watch her and allow her to face some of their enemies as she crossed their land meanwhile the sword she carried that she had thought was only a magic weapon proved to be more than that in her hands it awakenedand proved to be a oncehuman mage of times so long past that there was no record of her previous life or anything need referenced in the chronicles of valdemar together the heralds their companions and the newlyawakened blade crossed the dhorisha plains only to find themselves going from old dangers into newfor the tayledras territory they headed for following a map that the shinain shaman kraheera and trevalen gave to elspeth was as much under siege as the kingdom of valdemar among the hawkbrothers a former mage darkwind ksheyna had been fighting his own battle against enemies within and without without were the forces led by the evil adept and changemaster mornelithe falconsbanenot the least of which was his halfhuman daughter the changechild nyara within the clan was splitphysically for more than half their number including all of the children and lesser mages were stranded in the intended site of a new vale when their heartstone cracked and split in leadership for darkwind was the leader of a faction that wanted to bring in help from outside to heal their heartstone and bring back the rest of the clanwhile his father who led the mages swore this could not be done but darkwinds father had been subverted by falconsbane and even in the heart of the vales was still under his control it was darkwinds father the adept starblade ksheyna who had actually caused the fracturing of the stone darkwind was aided by a pair of gryphons and their young who had served as surrogate parents to him when his own mother died and his father turned strange and alien treyvan and hydona did their best to support him but despite being powerful mages in their own right there were few in the vale who would listen to their advice falconsbane elected to close his hand tighter around ksheyna vale and sent his daughterunder the ruse that she was escaping his power to seduce young darkwind nyara herself sick of her fathers mistreatment was not aware of falconsbanes larger plan loyalty to his lover dawnfire kept darkwind from succumbing to his attraction to nyara but by falconsbanes reckoning it was only a matter of time before he had both father and son in his grasp elspeth bearing an enormously valuable artifact and a powerful if untrained mage herself aroused falconsbanes avarice as soon as she came within his reckoning he turned some of his creatures that had been searching the plain for the artifacts guarded by the shinain to pursue elspeth and meanwhile in pursuit himself of an old hatred for gryphons he launched an attack on treyvan and hydona and their young and in the wake of the attack he managed to trap dawnfires spirit in the body of her bondbird and slay her human body along with the spirit of the bird on discovering that the young gryphlets had been contaminated by falconsbanes power nyara confessed her hand in the matter and was confined in a corner of the gryphons lair elspeth skif and the rest arrived at the borders of the ksheyna territory pursued by falconsbanes creatures darkwind and the gryphons came to their rescue and recognized both the sword and the companions for what they were unsure of what to do with them darkwind led them back to the lair there skif met nyara and fell in love with herand the fascination was mutual things that nyara knew and confessed proved to darkwind that his father was in thrall to the evil adept he succeeded in breaking falconsbanes hold on his father and in destroying the creature through which the control had come but that alerted falconsbane to the fact that they now knew who and what he was and presumably what he had planned he permitted dawnfire to overhear that he was planning to meet with ancar of hardorn to discuss an alliancethen allowed her accidental escape the name meant nothing to dawnfire but a great deal to the heralds this was their worst fear realized that ancar should unite with a truly powerful adeptbut need who had centuries of experience recognizing trickery pointed out that dawnfires escape was a little too easyand that they would be leaving both the gryphlets and possibly even herself unguarded to disrupt a spurious meeting so the allies planned a reverse ambush lying in wait for falconsbane when he came to take the young ones falconsbane was cannier than they thought he detected the ambush at the last moment and mounted an effective attempted to take control of the gryphlets but need deflected the magic and turned it against him using it to purge the unsuspecting young ones of his taint he attacked skif but before he could kill the herald he was attacked by his daughter nyara in the first open act of defiance in her life nevertheless falconsbanes powerful magics and allies succeeded in taking down both companions and trapping hydona all would have been lost but for the tenacity of darkwind and the gryphonsand the intervention of the shinain swordsworn the black clad servants of the shinain and tayledras goddess who had been secret players in events all along they surrounded the combatants and forced falconsbane to a stalemate snarling in rage the adept escapedbarelyleaving behind a trail of blood and the survivors hope that a shinain arrow had been fatal but the intervention of the shinain was not complete the swordsworn and the two shaman took up dawnfirewho trapped in a birds body was fated to fade and die leaving nothing of her human self behind before the eyes of the heralds and the rest the goddess herself intervened on dawnfires behalf transforming her into a shining avatar in the shape of a vorcel hawk the symbol of the shamans clan and in the awed confusion afterwards nyara vanished taking need with herat the blades parting insistence that nyara required her more than elspeth did but the clan was united once more and darkwind agreed to take up his longdenied powers again to teach elspeth the ways of magic that she might return home an adept so dawns the new day chapter one elspeth and gwena elspeth rubbed her featheradorned temples hoping that her fears and tensions would mercifully go and leave her mind in peace for just once today this isnt what i expected i wish this were over herald elspeth heir to the crown of valdemar survivor of a thousand and one ceremonies in her twentysix years brushed nervously at a nonexistent spot on her tunic and wished she were anywhere but here here was the southern edge of the lands held by the tayledras whom valdemarans spoke of as the fabled hawkbrothers here was a roughwalled cave presumably hewn by magic just outside the entrance to ksheyna vale here was where elspeth the heir was stewing in her own juices from anxiety elspeth was still getting used to these people and their magic as far as she could tell the cave hadnt been there before yesterday then againthe walls didnt have that raw new look of freshly cut stone and the sandy uneven floor seemed ordinary even the entrance a jagged break in the hillside appeared to be perfectly natural and healthy plants lined the edges greenery grew anywhere roots could find a pocket of soil to hold onto and the smell was as damp and musty as any cave shed ever seen during her heralds training maybe she was wrong the cave might always have been there but its entrance may just have been wellhidden now that she thought about it that would be a lot more like the style only hawkbrother she knew darkwind ksheyna he wasnt inclined to waste time or energy on anythingmuch less waste power he took a dim view of profligate use of magery something hed made very clear to elspeth in the first days of their acquaintance if something could be done without using magic that was the way hed do ithoarding his powers and doling them out in miserly driblets that was something she didnt understand at all when ou had magic shouldnt you use it darkwind didnt seem to think so neither did the chronicles she had read of heraldmage vanyels time and before incredible things were possible to an adeptand that of course was why she was here if shed dared shed have used her powers now to shape a more comfortable seat than the rock she perched on just inside the caves entrance that at least would have given her something to do instead of working herself up into a fine froth of nerves over the coming ceremony she glanced resentfully at skif he looked perfectly callm as if preoccupied his dark eyes were focused somewhere inwards and if he was at all nervous none of it showed on his squarejawd face in fact the only sign that he wasnt a statue was that he would run a hand through his curly brown hair once in a while elspeth sighed it figured he was probably so busy thinking about nyara that none of this mattered to him the only thing that being made a tayledras wingbrother meant to him was that hed be able to stay in hawkbrother territory for as long as it took to find her assuming the sword need let him find nyara the blade not only used magic well itshewas a person a woman whod long ago traded her aging fleshly body for the steel form of an ensorceled sword it wasnt a trade elspeth would have made need could only hear se feel through the senses of her bearer and in times when her bearer wasnt particularly mindgifted or when she had no bearer at all she had drifted off into sleep shed been asleep for a long time before elspeths teacher herald captain kerowyn had passed her on to her pupil but somethingvery probably something elspeth herself had donehad finally roused her from that centurieslong sleep once she was awake need was a hundred times more formidable than she had been asleep she had quite a mind of her own too she had decided once elspeth was safely in the hands of the hawkbrothers and the immediate troubles were over that the changechild nyara required her far more than elspeth did so when nyara chose to vanish into the wild lands surrounding the tayledras vale need evidently persuaded the catlike woman to take the sword with her that left elspeth on her own to follow her original plan find a teacher for valdemarans with magetalent and get training hersellf among the few hundredodd things she hadnt planned on was being made a member of a tayledras clan how did i get myself into this she asked herself willingly and with open eyes her companion gwena replied the sarcastic acidity of her mindspeech not at all diluted by the fact that it was a mere whisper you could have gone looking for keros greatuncle the way you were supposed to hes an adept and a teacher you could have followed quentens very clear directions and he would have taken you as a pupil if necessary i would have made certain he took you as a student but no you had to follow your own path youelspeth considered slamming mental barriers closed against her companion and decided against it if she did gwena would win the argument by default i told you i wasnt going to be herded to some predestined fate like a complacent ewe she snapped back just as acidly taking gwena entirely by surprise the companion tossed her mane as her head jerked up with the force of the mental reply her bright blue eyes going blank with surprise i also told you elspeth continued with a little less force and just a touch of satisfaction that i wasnt going to play questing hero just to suit you and the rest of your horsey friends i will do my best by valdemar but im doing it my own way besides how do you know keros uncle would have been the right teacher for me how do you know that i havent done something better than what you planned by coming here and making contact with the shinain and the hawkbrothers vanyel was certainly a welltrained adept and the chronicles say that the hawkbrothers trained him gwena snorted scornfully and pawed the ground with a silver hoof i dont know whether youve done better or worse she replied but you were asking how you got yourself into thisthisbrotherhood ceremony and i told you elspeth stiffened gwena had been eavesdropping again that was a purely rhetorical question she said coldly meant for myself i wasnt broadcasting it to all and sundry and id appreciate it if youd let me keep a few thoughts private once in a while gwena narrowed her eyes and shook her head my was all she said in reply we are certainly touchy today arent we elspeth did not dignify the comment with an answer if anything gwena was twice as touchy as she was and both of them knew why the only way for elspethor skifto be able to remain in the lands guarded by the tayledras was to be made wingbrothers to the clan of ksheyna but that required swearing to certain oathswhich none of their informants had yet divulged saying only that theyd learn what those pledges were when they actually stepped into the circle to make them elspeth had been trained in diplomacy and statecraft from childhood and undisclosed oaths made her very nervous indeed it wasnt so bad for skifhe wasnt the heir but for her well the things she pledged herself to here could have serious consequences for valdemar if she wasnt very careful she carried with her the crowns authority the fact that a forgotten oath had made a crucial difference to valdemar in the recent past only pointed up the necessity of being careful what she swore to here and now nervous skif asked in a low voice startling her out of her brooding thoughts she grimaced of course im nervous how could i not be im hundreds of leagues away from home sitting in a cave with you you thief former thief he grinned excuse me former thief and a bloodthirsty barbarian shaman from the dhorisha plains trevalen cleared his throat delicately pardon he interrupted in the tayledras tongue but while i am both shaman and bloodthirsty i am not i think a barbarian we shinain have recorded history that predates the mage wars can you say as much newcomer for a moment elspeth was afraid she had offended him then she saw the twinkle in his eye and the barely perceptible quirk of one corner of his mouth trevalen had proved to have a healthy sense of humor over the past few days as they waited out the response of the ksheyna council of elders to their petition to remain she had heard him refer to himself as bloodthirsty and a barbarian more than once in point of fact the shaman seemed to enjoy teasing and challenging heri stand rebuked oh elder of elders she replied formally bowing as deeply as she could she was rewarded with his broad grin which grew broader as she continued of course the fact that you dont do anything with all that recorded history has no bearing at all on whether or not youre barbarians of course not he replied blandly evidently wellsatisfied with her return volley dwelling overmuch upon the past is the mark of the decadent we arent that either point taken she conceded defeat and turned back to skif so im here in a cave waiting for some authority to come along and demand that i swear something unspecified which may or may not bind me to something id really rather not have anything to do withwhy should i be nervous skif chuckled and she restrained herself from snarling now think a bit he told her fondly but as if she were thirteen again youve read the chronicles both vanyel and his aunt swore the wingbrother oaths they had to or they couldnt have gone in and out of the vales the way they did if there was nothing in the oaths to bother them why should you be worried do you want that alphabetically or categorically she kept herself from reminding him that she was the heir after all she had tried long and hard to make him forget that very thing instead she continued because that was a long time ago and a different clan we dont know if things have changed since then or whether the oaths differ from clan to clan they do not differ trevalen said serenely and they have not changed in all of our recorded history many shaman of the shinain swear to wingsib and believe me the oaths our goddess requires of us bind us to far more than your own oaths to your crown and country and she can move her hand to chastise us at her will i think you need not be concerned well that was some comfort anyway elspeth had seen for herself how the shinain goddesswho was so darkwind said also the goddess of his peoplecould and did manifest herself in very tangible fashion and she had a sure and certain taste of how seriously the shinain took their oaths to protect their land from interlopers well if trevalen knew all about the oaths and felt comfortable with them she probably didnt have to worry much this would be the first time she and skif had been permitted inside the vale of ksheyna itself the hawkbrother mageor was it scoutdarkwind had dismissed it with a shrug as not what it once was with no indication of what it could be like and trevalen if he knew what the vale was like in its prime was not telling descriptions in the chronicles of vanyels time had been sketchy hinting at wonders without ever revealing what the wonders were probably because they didnt know gwena said most of the sarcasm gone from her mindvoice vanyel and sayvsavil had too much on their minds to give descriptions of where theyd been besides why describe somewhere no one else would be allowed to visit it might tempt them to try and that would be fatal the tayledras tend to perforate first and apologize after are you snooping in my head again elspeth replied with a bit less venom than before no youre echoing at me gwena told her candidly i cant help it if your surface thoughts echo down our link unless you block them and i cant help it if you forget to block because youre nervy all right all right i stand rebuked i apologize elspeth carefully put up her lightest shields and went back to her brooding there was a fourth party sharing the title of wingbrother with them but shaman kethra had sworn her vows a long time ago she was considerably older than trevalen though not as old as his superior kraheera and she had been a wingsib for at least a dozen years she was a healer as well as a shaman and she was tending to darkwinds father adept starblade darkwind seemed reluctant to discuss what mornelithe falconsbane had done to his father and elspeth wasnt about to press him for answers she did want to know however and badly not because of morbid curiosity but because one day she might need to know just how one adept could so completely subvert another one of weaponmaster alberichs precepts was that anyone can be broken if it was possible she might find herself on the receiving end of an attempt to break her shed like to know what she could expectelspeth had been a bit surprised that trevalen was staying on though he had said only that his own master had asked him to remain with ksheyna because it is important whatever it was it couldnt have anything to do with what falconsbane had done to the clandarkwind and kethra were tending to that could it be because of what had happened to dawnfire the memory was so vividly etched in her mind she had only to think of the hawk dawnfire to relive what shed seen the shinain stood in a rough circle below dawnfires perch the red shouldered hawk had taken a position just above the door of the gryphons lair her head up and into the wind her wings slightly mantled then one the shinain a woman put her hand up to the hawk dawnfire stared measuringly at her for a moment then stepped down from her perch onto the proffered wrist the woman turned to face the rest like all the other shinain who had come to their rescue this one was clad entirely in black from her long black hair to her black armor to her black boots but there was something wrong with her eyes something odd elspeth had sensed a kind of contained power about her the stirrings of a kind of deeplyrunning energy she had never felt before the woman raised dawnfire high above her head and held her there a position that should have been a torment after only a few moments no matter how strong she was tayledras hawks were the size and weight of small eagles and dawnfire was by no means the smallest of the kind but as the woman continued to hold dawnfire aloft the entire group began to hum softly at first then as the volume increased and as the ruins rang with harmonics dawnfire started glowing at first elspeth had thought it was just a trick of the setting sun but the light about the bird grew brighter instead of fading then dawnfire spread her wings and grew larger as well as brighter before long elspeth couldnt even look at her directly she had averted her eyes for the light from the hawk was bright enough to cast shadows kraheera had looked at her and said dawnfire has been chosen by the warrior she hadnt known what that meant then she did now when the light and sound had faded and she was able to look at the bird again she saw that it was no longer a redshouldered hawk it was a vorcel hawk the emblem of kraheeras clan and the largest such bird she had ever seen although the light had dimmed it had not died and there was an otherworldly look in the hawks eyes that had made her start with surprise it was the same look as in the eyes of the female warrior who held her their eyes held neither whites iris or pupilsonly a darkness sprinkled with sparks of light that were visible even where elspeth stood as if instead of eyes they had fields of stars that was when she had remembered the description of the shinain goddessand had realized exactly what she was looking at small wonder the memory was as vivid as it was it wasnt every day an ordinary mortal saw a living goddess and her avatar she eyed trevalen with speculation no matter how casually the elder shaman had treated the event afterward she wondered if he hadnt been just as surprised as everyone else by the appearance of his goddess from what little she understood change came to the plains seldom and slowly when kerowyn had regaled them with tales of her shinain cousins had she ever said anything about their goddess creating avatars elspeth didnt remember anything like that so maybe this was something new for them maybe that was why trevalen was here to watch for dawnfires and to try and figure out the reasons behind his goddess actions well if that was the case he must have told the hawkbrothers or at least their leaders on the surface none of this seemed to have anything to do with herbut elspeth didnt take anything for granted anymore after all why should the shinain have shown up at all then who could have predicted shed get involved with the tayledras and wind up adding their enemies to her own rather formidable list i ought to ask him later if im right about all that maybe we can help each other out gwena walked to the entrance of the cave and looked outimpatiently elspeth thought her mindspoken words to her chosen confirmed that i wish i knew what it was they were spending so much time doing in there she said theyve certainly been keeping us cooling our heels long enough at this rate that ceremony of theirs wont be over until dark elspeth wondered why she was so impatientthe companions werent the ones being sworn in even though they wouldnt be permitted in the vale until the heralds were evidently by common consensus the tayledras regarded the companions as creatures that simply didnt require oaths to hold them hmm that requires thought do they think gwena is some kind of avatar herself the idea was kind of funny if they ever listened to her moaning and griping theyd soon lose that particular illusion i rather doubt gwenas hiding that kind of secret not that she hadnt been hiding other kinds of secrets this plan for elspeths future that the companions had been plotting for one and there were othersshortly after nyara had vanished taking need with her elspeth noticed that gwena was missing worried about hersince gwena had been injured in the fight with falconsbanes magebeastsshe had tried to find her companion and when she failed tried to mindtouch her when that failed she had been alarmed and had gone looking for her gwena had been perfectly all rightbut shed been locked in a selfinduced trance shielded even against the prying of elspeths thoughts and when shed come out of it shed been very unhappy to find her chosen standing there tapping her foot impatiently waiting for an answer under pressure from both elspeth and skif she reluctantly admitted that she had been in contact with another companion in valdemar all during this journey elspeth had expected that companion to be her mothersand had been both surprised and relieved to find that it was actually rolan the companion of the queens own herald talia then she had been annoyed though she hadnt made much of an issue about it she hadnt known that companions could relay messages that farand so far as she was aware no one knew that little fact was it just gwena and rolan or could others do it too one way or the other it was one more thing that the companions had been hiding so how much more could they do that they hadnt revealed gwena had said crossly that elspeth should have expected that arrangements would be made and elspeth had been forced to agree after all she was the heir and shed been allowed to go haring off into the unknown with only one herald to guard her back for all that shed managed to get complete agreement from the council and heraldic circle it was still rather irresponsible if queen selenay had not had a way to get news about her errant offspring shed likely have had strong hysterics before a month was out especially after elspeth departed from the agreedupon itinerary and vanished into the dhorisha plains still she hadnt much liked the idea that little reports on her progress were being sent back home as if she was some kind of child on her first outing without mama on the other hand gwena had told them when elspeth pressed her for exactly what shed been telling rolan that the reports shed been sending rolan were edited heavily edited in fact was what the companion had said rather glumly which was just as well if selenay had the smallest inkling just how much danger elspeth and skif had gotten themselves intoshed have found a way to haul me back thats what shed have done and plunked me down in nice safe embroidery classes for the rest of my natural life how could she possibly explain to her mother that ever since shed started on this tripeven before shed startedshed had the feeling that the crown wasnt something she was ever going to wear even if she had tried to tell her selenay would have taken it the wrong way shed have been sure that elspeth had some premonition of doom and there shed be in embroidery class again away from all possibility of danger what an awful idea and it wasnt a premonition of doom or anything like one it was just the feeling that she was never going to rule that one of the twins was going to have the throne and the other the other would be kings own not a bad arrangement since they arent at all alike wouldnt be the first time that sibs were monarch and monarchs own her fate was something else entirelythough what she hadnt the faintest notion even though her conscience bothered her now that she was so far away from home shed been doing some useful work assigned to kerowyn and the skybolts and though she would never have believed it when she left haven she was homesick she kept telling herself that there wasnt much she had been doing that couldnt be done by talia and daren and that though she wasnt a foreseer shed never been wrong when she got really strong feelings about something there was something she had to do and it was tied up with learning magic shed said as much to gwena whod agreed with her even though you arent following the course wed planned for you shed added too bad so im a stubborn bitch i do things my way or not at all and if mother gwena and rolan dont like it im not at all sorry so there nyah nyah she grinned to herself at her own childish thought really it was a very good thing that the messages were going through rolan to talia and only then to selenay rolan had more of a sense of humor than gwenaand a little more tolerance and talia knew her former charge very well indeed further talia had told elspeth privately that she thought the queen was reacting like most mothers to the evidences of her daughter growing up and developing a mind of her own badly oh not as badly as she could have but all things considered it was much better for elspeth to be off beyond mamas reach for a while by the time she returned it might be possible for queen selenay to admit that her daughter wasnt a foolish headstrong stupid child anymore ive managed to acquire a little sense anywaygather yourself my dear gwena mindspoke interrupting her thoughts theyre coming for you finally elspeth glanced out of the corner of her eye at skif and trevalen skif looked as if he were concentrating on every word that the hawkbrother called iceshadow spoke actually he probably was his command of the tayledras tongue wasnt anywhere near as good as hers odd shed slipped right into the language as if she had known it most of her life oh thats probably because its like shinain and kero taught me some of that trevalen wore that inscrutable face that kero always put on when she was determined not to let anyone know what she was thinking gamblingface she called it the more she thought about it the better she liked the idea of approaching trevalen later to see if they could do anything for each other she felt a lot more comfortable around himaround any of the shinain reallythan she did around the tayledras that was probably because she could read him a little he and kethra reminded her of kero well that shouldnt surprise her kero had trained her and kero had in turn been trained by a shinain swordsworn so there was a lot of shinain attitude and thinking patterns in the way kero looked at things a good bit of that had rubbed off on her pupil without a doubt the tayledras however were very exotic and darkwind had been so hard to read that elspeth had given up even trying i wonder if they seem that way to trevalen they hadnt had much of a chance to see the vale as gwena had predicted it was sunset when the hawkbrothers came for them and most of the vale was shrouded in shadows as they passed through it elspeth had gotten some impressions that had taken her breath away howeverof luxuriant growth that made any forest shed ever seen look sparse by comparison and trees so enormous her mind refused to accept their size the companions had trailed along behind as they followed a wellworn path past curtaining vines covered with cascading flowers the size of her hand and bushes with leaves bigger than a saddle elspeth couldnt wait to see the place in the daytime darkwind himself had come to fetch them as their sponsor into the clan kethra was trevalens with him had come at least a dozen more tayledrasand elspeth had done her best not to stare but it had been very difficult she had thought that darkwind was a typical hawkbrother and she had been just a little disappointed given the hints in the chronicles of how strange the hawkbrothers were at his shoulderlength mottledbrown hair and his drab clothing the chronicles had talked about moondance and starwind being as brightly plumaged as firebirds and shed cherished images of brilliant colors and weird clothing maybe things that didnt look like clothing at all she wasnt disappointed any longer the dozen tayledras with darkwind had been garbed as wildly and beautifully as she could have wished every one of them had hair that was waistlength or longer white as ice and twined with feathers crystals bells slender chains or strands of silk matching theircostumes that was the only word she could arrive at clothing certainly wasnt adequatenot for robes with layered sleeves that trailed on the ground hugged the arm like silken skin were scalloped bejeweled embroidered and tapestried garb didnt describe tunics and gowns that mimicked feathers leaves flower petals frozen waterfalls every one of the dozen was unique every one was incredible and complex and yet the costumes werent any less functional than say valdemaran court gear although she wouldnt have known how to move in those outfits without tripping over something she felt for the first time as if she had truly left the world she knew and had stepped into the pages of a tale even darkwinddrab disappointing darkwindhad been transformed although his hair was still shoulderlength he had somehow managed to get patterns dyed into it she assumed it was dye it might not have been how would she know it might have been magic birds flickered whitely against a dark gold background every time he moved his head as if his hair was a forest in autumn with doves flying through it and his costume was as fanciful as the restalthough a little more practical he had eschewed trailing sleeves and hemlines for embroidery and something that stayed fairly close to his body but he was just as eyedazzling in his way as the others were in theirs he smiled shyly when he saw the surprise and approval in her expression but said nothing simply gesturing for her and skif to follow him into the depths of the vale kethra led trevalen in a similar fashion the rest of the tayledras came behind with magelights bobbing above their heads and the companions bringing up the rear above t walls of the valley and the tops of the towering trees the sky still glowed blue with the west a warm goldin the shelter of the massive branches dense blue shadows obscured all but the trail they walked they had emerged in a clearing ringed and paved with stone in the very center of the circular area stood a cracked and halfbroken stone with a brazier at its foot all of it lit by more magelights this strange monolith she assumed was the heartstonedamaged its wild energies barely restrained by multiple layers of shielding darkwind had warned her to keep tight personal shields about her when she was near it she saw no reason to argue with him even through her protections she felt something vaguely wrong with the stone a kind of sickness about it it wasnt something she could put a finger on or point to but the uneasy feeling was definitely there iceshadowwearing an elaborate costume that made him look as if he was half a man and half a delicate frozen fountaintook his place before the stone in the transparent unwavering illumination of the magelights he could have been a dream an illusionan ice sculpture brought to life then he moved gracefully holding up his handsand with no more preparation than that elspeth found herself surrounded by a blue glow that was quite familiar truth spell bright havens did we get it from them or did they get it from vanyel the other question that occurred to her with a touch of envy was how iceshadow had managed to call the spell up with no preparation and in no more than a heartbeat it took her a good bit of time to call up a truth spell and she was one of the best in her class at that particular exercise iceshadow hadnt even needed to think about it so far as she had been able to tell he just gestured and there it was that was as impressive as all the lightnings and thunders shed seenand cast fighting falconsbane and his creatures iceshadow had not only cast the spell as easily as breathing he had made it look effortless iceshadow lowered his arms and a white horntufted owl drifted down out of the trees to land on his shoulder he watched the three of them serenely for a moment and then folded his hands in his sleeves do you bring any illintent into this vale he asked conversationally was this the beginning of the oathtaking it must be she shook her head and skif mouthed the word no iceshadow smiled slightly and continued still calmstill casual is it your wish to be made a brother of this clan they both answered with nods now iceshadow sobered the owl settled itself and turned unblinking eyes upon them as if it too was weighing the truth of their intent elspeth was suddenly hyperaware of everything about her the faint cool breeze on her back the way it stirred iceshadows clothing skifs hair the fringe on trevalens sash the way the blue light from the spell reflected in the onlookers eyes the call of a bird somewhere out in the vale iceshadow took a deep breath and spoke in a soft voice that still carried incredible intensity hear then the privileges of brotherhood to come and go freely within all lands held by tayledras ksheyna to call upon your brothers in times of need to ask of us teaching to make your home among us hear also the responsibilities of brotherhood to keep the secrets of the clan to neither bring nor lead strangers among us to keep our lands and guard them as we do to answer to our need if no other oath prevents to teach when it is asked of you aid when it is asked of you give shelter and succor to your brothers of the clan of tayledras and of shinain can you be bound to these conditions yes elspeth breathed it would not have been unreasonable to swear them to absolute secrecy or to require that they pledge a formal and complicated alliance to the clan skif seemed just as surprised as he answered in the affirmative the breeze gusted past again and the owl roused its feathers shaking himself vigorously before settling down to resume his stare at them iceshadow watched them as unblinkingly as his owl then there is another vow you must make iceshadow continued but it is one that you must not make in ignorance so listenwatchand heed he gestured again and as elspeth caught her breath in startlement a globe of glowing white mist rose up from the pavement between them obscuring everything on the other side of the circle as elspeth turned her attention from the hawkbrother to the globe of starlight she saw that there was a picture forming in itshe bit her lip when the picture cleared this time with a feeling of incredulity and horror she had seen her own land ravaged by warfare but this was beyond anything she had ever dreamed in her worst nightmares encased in the glowing globe was the image of a devastated land the viewpoint was from the edge of a blasted crater so wide she literally could not see the other side she blinked and swallowed finding it hard to comprehend destruction on so vast a scale and nauseated by the very idea that such a thing could have happened to see a place that must once have been green been full of people animals trees and plantsto see it not only ravaged but utterly annihilatedthe shock of it drove any real thoughts from her head for a moment beside her trevalen started in surprise as if this was something he knew about but had not expected to see here this was the homeland long and long ago iceshadows voice drifted across the silence a voice filled with such sadness and loss that it seemed as if what elspeth saw might have happened a day ago rather than centuries ago this was the homeplace of the people called kaledain this was all that remained at the end of the first and last conflict the mage wars the scene shifted to a group of armed subdued people all with the long black hair and golden skin of the shinain gathered on the edge of the crater there was some confusion as they and their animalshorses huge dogs hunting cats and birds of preymilled about and then it was apparent that about half of them were packing up and moving off away from the crater while the rest stayed we fled from the destruction and returned when we could this was what we found and there was mourning and confusion then came anger at what had happened at what had caused it there was dissent over what the people should do some wished to renounce all magic some to make further use of magic to keep the clans alive in this new and alien world there was no compromise possible between those positionsdissent became argument and argument became hate that was when rather than turn dissent to feud the two sides agreed to divide and with this decision came the sundering of the clans those who renounced magic became the shinain while those who sought magery removed themselves from the rest calling themselves tayledras after the birds that they had helped to bring into being these our fathers and mothers went north again the scene shifted to something that had probably been a forest once now it was another kind of nightmare instead of lifelessness twisted and contorted wildlife ran riot the vegetation grew so thick it formed a solid green wall on either side of the road except that it was hard to tell some of the flora from some of the fauna there were plants that groped after the passing clansfolk and animals that were rooted to the spot like plants some watching them with indifferent eyes others that screamed unendingly there were creatures she halfglimpsed through the veils of vines hanging from every branch that made elspeth shudder as she tried to make sense of the confusion of color and motion the group shown was attacked by things that were horribly worse than the creatures falconsbane had sent against themthings that seemed to be nothing but teeth and claws with armored plates covering everything but their joints iceshadows voice made her jumpthe five clans that were now tayledras found that the lands beyond the homeland were ravaged by the forces of twisted and tainted magic no human or bird could survive there for long either they must starve for they could not spare a moment from defense to grow or hunt their food or they must give up defense and perish at the hands of the monsters that inhabited these lands they despaired for there was nowhere else for them to go the scene fogged for a moment and reformed the band of tayledras had made a camp on the top of a hill the earth scorched bare by fire with a temporary palisade of thorny branches about the campbut it was obvious it could not last for long against any kind of attack they knew they could go no farther iceshadow concluded so as their kindred that would become the shinain would do they prayed to their goddess and she answered here is her answer to their plea nothing elspeth had watched prepared her for what happened as the mist clouded again suddenly there was no ball of glowing mist with pictures in it before her suddenly there was no clearing no hawkbrothers no skif no light no sound no world only herself a sky full of stars stretching in every direction including down and out of this starry nothingness arose a whitehot flame that was too bright to see clearly she changed from moment to moment and the raw power emanating somehow also a woman from her made elspeth tremble shed have fallen to her kneesif she could have figured out how to do so in the midst of all this starry space i have heard your prayers she said in a voice that filled elspeths mind leaving no room for anything not even fear there is a price to be paid for what you ask and that price is in your lives and your freedom she gestured and in the palm of her hand was cupped the weirdly twisted landscape of the forest the clansfolk had entered terrible magics have warped this land and only magic can heal it again therefore i offer this that you have asked of me i shall grant you safety here long enough to establish each of you a clan holding i shall teach you the means of creating a place in the midst of the holding wherein you shall dwell in protection i shall grant you the knowledge of adepts to use and concentrate the magicand a knowledge even adepts have notto create a center of such power that the greatest of the mages who caused these changes would look upon you with envy to this you shall swear in return you will cleanse these landsrestore them to what they were before the wars you shall destroy the creatures of evil intent cherish and succor the innocent victims of this catastrophe and find shelter for those that are merely animals meaning neither good nor ill you shall destroy those old weapons you may find that they may not be misused again you shall cleanse the land you holdand then you shall move on to another place to begin again all of your children that are magegifted shall follow this path all who are not shall guard and aid the ones who are you shall be the healers and protectorsand you shall never permit the magics you manipulate here to be used for ill nor shall you permit strangers within your ranks unless they be sworn to the clans this you must do at whatever cost to yourselves abruptly the vision was gone elspeth shook her head blinking and still trembling with reaction more than a little disoriented there was nothing now in the clearing but what had been there when they entered even the glowing mist was gone she tried to shake off the effect of the visionif that was what it had been she had been there for a moment she didnt at all doubt that she had experienced exactly the same thing as those longago hawkbrothers had what she couldnt understand was why skif didnt seem particularly affected but trevalen looked just as dazed and bedazzled as she felt long ago when she was younger she had first heard the story of king valdemar and the first appearance of the companions and had thought it a very pretty tale now she had the glimmering of what king valdemar just might have experienced when his prayers were answered it shook her to the soul it made her understand why some people became ardent abject devotees of deities iceshadow was silent for a long moment while she and trevalen gathered their scattered wits elspeth thought that he watched her particularly closely although she couldnt be sure of that finally he spoke again this is the last oath you must swearthat you will aid your brothers of the clan in their duty as your own oaths permitand that never will you use what is taught you here for the sake of your own power pride and status he held his hand up to forestall their immediate answers i shall not ask you to swear never to use it to harmfor one day you may find yourself facing an enemy who would destroy far more than you if he is given the opportunity to do so but you must never use your learning for selfish purposes to increase your own importance to make your life one of pointless leisure to merely indulge your fancies can you swear to that elspeth heaved a sigh of relief that was enough like the oaths a herald took before the circle that the wording made very little difference she gave her assent with a much lighter heart grateful that all of the vows shed been asked to make seemed to take into account the fact that those outside the clan had other duties and oaths of their own that might take precedence now as long as both sets of promises never come into conflict i should be all right throughout the entire oathtaking the blue glow of the truth spell remained steady around all three of them now iceshadow banished the spell with another gesture just as the deepening blue of the sky above them took on the goldenred streaks of the last moments of sunset elspeth looked up for a moment as some movement against the luminous blue above caught her eye and discovered that what had attracted her attention was the steady circling of a bird over their clearing a bird of prey by the shape nothing unusual not here in the heart of a tayledras clan territory but something about the bird made her take a second closer look it was big much bigger than she had thought at first in fact it was easily the size of the largest eagle she had ever seen but it had the distinctive tailstriping of a vorcelhawk that was one bird she would never again mistake for anything else a vorcelhawk the size of an eagle or largerand unless it was a trick of the light it was glowing dawnfire the thought was inevitable she glanced back down at trevalen only to see that he was watching the hawk as well though noone else seemed to notice that it was there the expression on his face was a most peculiar one he looked both excited and obscurely disturbed at one and the same time the hawk made a final circle above then spiraled upward to be lost in the scarletandgolden glory of the sunset trevalen licked his lips and looked down again reluctantly it seemed to her he caught her watching him before she could look away and something in his eyes made her nod once slowly admitting without actually saying anything that she had seen the bird as well his lips formed the merest ghost of a smile and he turned his attention back toward iceshadow less time had passed than she had thought the tayledras adept was only now finishing his words of acceptance admitting them into the clan as wingsiblings and welcoming them as allies and friends she shook her head again feeling another shiver of disorientation time was doing strange things around her today and skif didnt seem to be affected by any of it was it because she was a mage or was it something else entirely or was it just nerves not that it really mattered at the moment the ceremony wasnt quite over yet although the formal pledging of vows was darkwind had explained this afternoon as he brought them to the cave to wait that iceshadow wanted to talk to her skif and their companions before he unleashed the rest of the clan on them he wants to give you a clearer idea of what youre getting involved with he had said she had wondered at the time if he was joking a little or being completely serious but iceshadow was indeed walking across the paving toward them with another strange hawkbrother at his side and darkwind and the companions following behind the other tayledras drifted off seeming to melt into the luxuriant foliage so i meet the heralds at last the adept said as he got within easy conversational distance of them the last of your kind to be within a clan waswhat he looked to the other tayledras for an answer near seven hundred years ago the stranger supplied elspeth noticed now that he was near enough for her to note details that he was very pale very tiredlooking there were lines of pain around his eyes and mouth he made a little grimace that was ktreva though they always werehmmunconventional i would say innovative starblade iceshadow chided gently the experience certainly did them no harm and much good from all i have heard out of the tales at his naming the stranger elspeth took a moment for a second closer but covert examination of him so this was darkwinds father they didnt look all that much alike but that could be illness and the differences in their hair as much as anything starblade was wearing a moreconservative costume than the rest of his fellows in fact there was something about it that seemed very similar to the one darkwind was wearing something that invoked birds and their wings without actually imitating feathers as if they had been designed by the same mind interesting the ktreva tayledras that welcomed the heralds back thenthat would have been moondance and starwind ktreva wouldnt it she replied obviously startling all three of the hawkbrothers and earning a covert grin of approval from trevalen that was in the chronicles of herald vanyels time i read them and that was why i came here to try and find more tayledras if i could the heralds were vanyel ashkevron and his aunt savilvanyel was the last of the heraldmages the chronicles said that he spent quite a lot of time there in ktreva vale especially when he was young and that starwind taught him most of what he knew about magic that is quite true young one starblade replied his voice warming a little with what sounded to her like approval or at least that is what our records told me iceshadow my friend would it be possible for us to move to somewhere a little less formal for the rest of this he gestured apologetically to her and to skif and trevalen i am sorry but i fear i must beg your indulgence and find a place to sit what about the fishpond over there darkwind asked pointing with his chin somewhere behind iceshadows shoulder its quiet enough and there shouldnt be anyone there after the sun sets good enough his father repliedgratefully elspeth thought there should be room for your large friends and seating enough for all of us iceshadow gestured to the younger hawkbrother to lead the way elspeth followed him and the rest trailed behind her by now it was becoming quite dark and she was grateful for the magelights iceshadow and starblade produced she found that distances were deceptive in the vale the ornamental fishpond darkwind spoke of was actually hardly more than a stones throw away from the heartstone circle and yet it might easily have been halfway across the vale once they had arranged themselves around it there was no way of telling that the heartstone was anywhere nearby well starblade said once he had settled himself in a comfortable chair formed of the roots of a tree with moss cupped where a cushion would be elspeth took a second similar seat and found it incredibly comfortable iceshadow has asked me to explain to you just what sort of aahsituation you have unwittingly involved yourselves in and since i am the partial cause of that situation i think it only fair that i make the attempt elspeth met his eyes and recognized what she saw there pain mental and physical this conversation was going to cost him somethingbut she had seen some of that same pain in darkwinds eyes whenever he had spoken of his father and she knew that starblade had put that pain there the man was right it was only fair she settled herself and nodded to him decisively go ahead she said i dont think anything you say is going to make us change our minds but i was trained as a tactician i like to know what i can expect she smiled slightly good or bad starblade nodded gravely and leaned forward he cradled his right hand around his bandaged left handsurely there must be a story behind that as well this was either going to be very short or very long whichever it was it was going to be interesting she had told the truth about not changing her mind she only hoped what she learned wasnt going to make her regret her own decisions it was a little too late for regret now it was not however too early for strategy it was never too early or too late for that chapter two the celebration i know you are an outlander but i know not how much my son has told you of our troubles here starblade began with a sober glance at darkwind so i shall tell my tale from the outset and beg your patience if i repeat what you know he glanced down at the pond with its patient colorful carp skimming just below the surface of the water i shall be as brief as i can he paused for a moment clearly organizing his thoughts mornelithe falconsbane he said at last it all comes down to him darkwind nodded grimly but said nothing the heartstone starblade closed his eyes but not before elspeth had seen another shadow of pain pass across them its shattering is his doing but by my hand i was foolish and vain i thought myself clever and i found out differently he caught me through my foolishness and my pride he broke me and he used me terse speech but obviously each word cost him dearly through me he set his darkness upon the heartstone disrupted our magics broke it from the inside and in so doing caused the deaths of many of our mages because of me threefourths of the clan are lost somewhere in the wilderness how elspeth asked puzzled i mean how could you lose that many people starblade toyed with a glassbeaded feather braided into his hair when a clan moves it is our way to establish the children the lesser mages the weak and the old with the bulk of our scouts and warriors to protect them at a new site we send them by means of a gate we drain the stone of its power and send it to the new stone then we follow but when we filled the stone with all the clans power in preparation for diverting the power to the new site the heartstone shattered and the adept holding the gate open died with the shattering we had no one among us who could use the heartstone damaged as it was to go to them by gate we barely know the true location of the rest of the clan for the scouts who had found the new place were with them and they couldnt reach you without sending badlyneeded fighters elspeth supplied i take it none of the lesser mages were able to build these gate things only an adept can master the gate spell iceshadow replied and we fear that even if they had one who could cast it the stone is too unstable and there may be no way of bringing a gate near to it all the scouts that knew the overland way to the new vale are at that vale darkwind repeated our number would be decimated trying to get to them by footleagues traveled are hardwon going northand they cannot come to us burdened with the old the young the sick his father nodded indeed soto make the bad much the worse falconsbane continued to work through me keeping the clan from reaching for help keeping the adepts still remaining from stabilizing the stone and keeping those who knew me well at a distance starblade averted his eyes from darkwind but the reference was plain enough he hoped i think to wear us down until he could penetrate our defenses at his leisure and usurp the stone and the power it still held but he had not reckoned on our clever allies the gryphonsand he had not reckoned on the courage and good sense of my son he couldnt have guessed nyara would turn against him either skif put in with a hint of pride nonor the appearance of you and all that you represented trevalen told him his eyes showing a hint of sardonic humor to tell you true there was an unexpected marshaling of powers from all sides falconsbane certainly did not plan on that nor the involvement of the shinain that was his downfall if he lives still he cannot be prospering iceshadow put in shinain arrows found a mark in him that much we know and he has lost much in the way of power and creatures i wonder at that shinain do not often miss in such attacks their goddess oft assists the arrow to the mark but despite that i doubt that he lives starblade sighed i think that the arrows of the shinain found their mark that he fled only to die there has been no sign of him or his creatures and his escape was by bloodmagic with his own blood that is an act of finality among mages elspeth shrugged i dont know one way or the other about him but the point it seems to me is that he has left the vale in one snarled mess starblade nodded and smoothed his braided hair back behind his ears my son has said he will teach you in the use of your magegift that is a good thing i thinkbut he will need to relearn much as he teaches you it would be hazardous for you to do much practice of that learning within the vale itself though you would be protected from threats that are outside the vale the stone is yet dangerous gwena stamped a hoof and snorted agreement bobbing her head vigorously elspeth nodded she felt the same starblade bore many years experience and knew the magics involved as only a tayledras adept could better to err on the side of safety i think darkwind said slowly that we may practice outside the vale for some time in relative safety it will only be as we approach the greater adeptmagics that we will need the shieldings of the vale by then the council and i should have come to some decision on the stone iceshadow told them either we shall have begun to heal it ourselves or we shall have found a way to deal with it he glanced at elspeth with a certain amount of expectation in the look she sighed knowing what that look meant if youre wondering if you can count on my help with this heartstone of yours i do remember those oaths i just took she said with a little shake of her head i cant say i like the idea of mucking about with that much power gone wrong but what i can do i will both iceshadow and starblade gave her nods of approval but she wasnt quite done what i need to know here is thishow much more trouble from outside can we expect while were doing all this starblade i hope youll forgive my asking this but you were a point of weakness before just how vulnerable are you to more meddling starblade wet his lips with the tip of his tongue before replying to meddlingi would say not at all even if falconsbane still lives and as i said i do not think that he does iceshadow and kethra have changed all the paths that made me open to him to have me so his slave again he would have to have me in his hand he would break me fasterfor i am that much more fragile than i wasbut he would have to have me to break me and elspeth raised an eyebrow and i shall not leave this vale until i walk through the gate to a new one he told her i have been broken and am mending but i am still weak to be broken again and i will not chance it for tuhe sake of all of us elspeth nodded satisfied but skif frowned what about attack he asked are you weaker to attack thansayiceshadow starblade looked mildly surprised by the question ithink not he said immediately the weaknesses i have still require someone who knows me to exploit and to have me if not within physical touching certainly within sight skif glanced over at trevalen who shrugged the only magics i know intimately are those of the goddess he said i am of no help nor hindrance in these things these are good things to know starblade i thank you for telling them i cant think of any more questions skif admitted im no mage and im no help to you frankly ill be a lot more help in finding nyara and that damned sword she carries now that i need to know something of starblade said immediately and elspeth found herself the focus of every eye in the little clearing she fidgeted a little uncomfortably i dont know as much about need as id like she replied reluctantly she predates the mage wars i think at least i didnt recognize anything she showed us when she let us into her memories so shes either very old or from awfully far away i would say very old darkwind opined toying with a feather in a gesture uncannilyand probably unconsciouslylike his father i would say she is as old as the oldest artifact i have ever seen she gave me the impression of great age as great as any of the things i have stumbled upon in the ruins elspeth tilted her head back and took a deep breath of the cool flowerscented air using the moment to think what i do know is she was a member of some kind of quasireligious order with gods i never heard ofmale and female twins she gave the hawkbrothers a glance of inquiry all three of them shrugged as if the reference meant nothing to them either well even though at one time shed been a warrior she called herself a magesmith elspeth closed her eyes for a moment to call up the memories that need had shared with her and skif as to how she became a sword in the first placesomeone attacked the order while she was gonewiped out the older members enslaved the young girls stole everything they could carry the only ones left were need who was too old to fight and a young apprentice so need took a special sword that shed forged spells into spells of healing and luckand forged herself into it as well how iceshadow asked genuinely interested elspeth shook her head it wasnt something id have done she did some kind of preparation then she killed her human body with the blade so that she could move her spirit into the sword then as long as the girl carried her need could give her both the skills of a fighter and of a mage smith all three of the adepts looked startled at that how could that be starblade asked well she could operate on her own as a mage or through her bearer elspeth told him or she could direct her bearer if the bearer was magegiftedthat was how she worked with me after i refused to let her take me over but for fighting skills you had to let her completely take control of your body she grimaced im afraid i wouldnt let her artifact mage or no she didnt much care for my attitude a hint of smile appeared around starblades mouth darkwind grinned openly why am i not surprised by that the younger mage said to no one in particular elspeth was glad that the darkness hid her flush darkwind seemed to have an uncanny ability to poke pins into her pride maybe it was just illluck or bad timing she licked her lips and kept her temper i think that she wasnt used to being thwarted she said carefully captain kerowyn who had her before i did told me that i would have to be prepared to counter her that shed have me haring off to rescue whatever female nearby was in trouble whether or not it was a good idea to poke my nose into her problems that though was while she was still elspeth thought a moment as i remember she called it being asleep i gathered that the personality was dormant unconscious for a long time need never told me why the blade may not have wanted you to know why trevalen said smoothly certainly if you contradicted her will she would not be so free with revealing secrets thats true she acknowledged anyway she didnt start to wake up again until i was at katashinain so i dont know as much as id like to about her i think she is likely to take over nyara i think that after years of her father molding her to his whim and will nyara is inclined to be manipulated like that skif bristled and started to say something darkwinds thoughtful statement forestalled him that would not be entirely ill for her the hawkbrother said quietly especially sinceit seems at least to meneed has no intention of doing anything detrimental i think she seeks to make her bearer a stronger woman it is just that she does not like to have her will thwarted elspeth smiled ruefully i can testify to that she said it seems to me this might be a good thing for the changechild starblade added thoughtfully despite what has happened ii can feel pity for nyara she and i he faltered we have much much in common what falconsbane did to herit is very like what he did to me it may be that this sword if it has healing magics like those of kethra and iceshadow can reverse some of the things that were done to the girl even as kethra is aiding me i hope that is so for her sake and for ours there didnt seem to be anything else to say elspeth sat there awkwardly for a moment until iceshadow cleared his throat conspicuously if there is naught else that we can tell you he said elspeth shook her head so did skif not that i can think of she replied although i probably will come up with a dozen questions i should have asked just before i drop off to sleep tonight iceshadow chuckled starblade nodded knowingly if you can recall them when you wake feel free to ask them iceshadow said rising in the meantimewe hold celebration to welcome you to the clan and vale your fellow ksheyna are anxious to see you they are as curious about you as you are about them in a way that statement was something of a relief it meant that the secretive hawkbrothers were human enough to be curious for all the time she had spent in darkwinds presence there was more that was a mystery about him and his people than there was that was familiar in that case she replied rising from her own seat lets not keep them waiting any longer elspeth followed darkwinds direction as iceshadow escorted starblade in another directionpresumably to rest we have had little enough to celebrate of late darkwind told the two heralds and their companions in a quiet voice as he shepherded them down yet another path bordered by wild growth the stalemate with the stone the constant harassment on our borders the separationit has been difficult for everyone here add to that my fathers attempt to foster dissension between the scouts and the mages and there was more tension than many could bear that particular dustup was all because of falconsbane wasnt it skif asked i hope thats been settled id just as soon not find myself in the middle of a private quarrel you wont darkwind actually chuckled as elspeth hid a sigh of relief its been settled i can pledge you everyone is ready for a good celebration the fact that you are the cause of itand are strange outlanders into the bargainwill make you very popular that gave elspeth a bit of a qualm not because she was illatease at the idea of being the focus of so many strangers but because of what darkwind had called her outlander she was a stranger here there was nothing in this place that would remind her of home if darkwind seemed alien to her his words were a reminder that she must be just as alien to him and by extension to his people she wasnt used to being the stranger it made her feel disconnected and unbalanced and now for the first time since she had arrived she felt completely alone completely without roots and felt a wave of terrible homesickness wash over her at that moment she was within a breath of weeping her throat closed and she couldnt speak her eyes clouded and she stumbled but when she looked up she found herself on the edge of another clearing but this one was full of lightpeople her training took over there were people waiting to meet her out there she was the heir to the throne she was a herald her homesickness could wait she must put on a good face for them impress them so that they would see that valdemar was worth aiding she blinked once or twice clearing her eyes the companions skif and darkwind got a pace or two ahead of her giving her the chance to compose herself further she took a deep breath another then followed them out into the radiant clearing she had expected magelights and magelights there were in plenty but the chief illumination came from the moon the soft silvery light blurred and softened details and as she looked around her she suddenly realized that not all of the exotic occupants of the clearing were human hertasi the shy lizardlike creatures that were roughly half the height of a very tall man she had seen once or twice before in colored beads and satinsand the gryphons of course their presence was a welcome surprise and she waved at treyvan when she knew he had seen her she hadnt known that the gryphons were coming and treyvans widebeaked grin from across the clearing chased away the last of her homesickness she couldnt help herself the gryphon grin was so contagious it left no room for such trivialities hydona saw that treyvan was staring in their direction and turned to see what he was looking at when she saw them she nodded her smile matched her mates and welcomed the newcomers with a warmth that surpassed species boundaries the gryphons occupied one entire nook of the clearing all by themselves but beside them were three graceful horned creatures that elspeth guessed must be dyheli and scattered among the hawkbrothers were a handful of twolegged creatures whose feathers were real and growing from their heads not braided into their hair tervardi elspeths years of protocol schooling kept her from staring even though she would dearly have loved to along with the gryphons and the hertasi these creatures were the stuff of legend in valdemar legend said the tervardi were shapechangers that they sprouted wings and turned into real birds when they chose one of them turned and elspeth caught sight of a still serene face with a mouth rimmed by something that was either a small flexible beak or hard stiff lips the creature gestured before she turned back to her conversationgroup and elspeth saw the stunted colorful feathers the last vestige of her wings covering her arm as she moved hesitantly into the clearing she realized that the previous occupants werenot ignoring her but permitting her politely to fit into their group that was certainly more comfortable than being mobbed and was exactly what a similar gathering of heralds would have done she looked around there were birds everywhere some sleeping on perches some awake and perched on shoulders or poles the companions both had joined a small group of mixed humans and nonhumans along with trevalen somehow darkwind and skif had vanished she had no idea how but it left her on her own with all those people carefully politely not looking at her she felt more conspicuous than she would if they had been staring at her she hurried across the rest of the grassy space between her and the gryphons odd that of all of that gathering they were the strangest physically and the most familiar in every other way sssso treyvan greeted her extending a taloned foreclaw in a token of welcome you are now tayledrasss clansssssib do you feel any different well yes and no she replied noi mean im still a herald and im still everything i was before but yesss hydona spoke gently i think perhapsss it isss homesssicknesss she blinked surprised and in an odd way grateful how did you guess the female gryphon nodded at the rest of the gathering we arrre the only two of our kind herrre asss well except for the little onesss we know how ssstrange you musst feel she flushed embarrassed that she could have missed something so very obvious of course its just that you and darkwind are such friends it never occurred to me treyvan laughed if it neverrr occurred to you then i would sssay that iss a compliment on how well we have come to fit in herrre he exclaimed and trrruly the humansss of the valesss arrre not that unlike the humansss of our own landsss ah she replied vaguely not knowing what else to say oh where are the little ones therrre hydona indicated another corner of the clearing with an outstretched talon there in the shadows the two young gryphlets were sprawled on the grass listening sleepily to what appeared to be a very large wolf so how could they be listening except that it wasnt speaking that isss a kyree they arrre not often in thisss vale hydona said as if she had heard elspeths unspoken questions it isss a neuter it hasss taken a liking to the little onesss and hass been kind enough to tell them taless sssince we arrived i believe it iss called she turned to her mate for help torrl treyvan supplied promptly it wass a great friend of dawnfire and iss sstill a great friend of darrrkwind kyree neuterss are often verry fond of little oness of any speciessss it iss a good thing the childrren arrre both sstrong mindspeakersss and that of course was how the kyree was telling tales to the young gryphlets directly mindtomind as the kyree who helped vanyel at the last had spoken to stefen elspeths mouth had gone very dry this was like being inside of a tale herself the experience being made even more dreamlike under the delicate illumination of magelights and moonlight she managed not to jump as something tugged at the hem of her tunic she looked down quickly it was one of the hertasi carrying a tray laden with fruits and vegetables that had been carved into artful representations of flowers it offered the tray to her and she took one she hadnt the faintest notion of what shed taken but she didnt want to offend the little creature by refusing it slipped into the crowd and she bit cautiously into her prize crisp and cool it had a faint peppery taste and a crunchy texture encouraged by her success when the next hertasi came by this one with a tray of drinks she took a glass with more enthusiasm this proved to be a light wine she sipped it and continued to chat with the gryphons deliberately keeping the subject light asking innocuous questions about the kyree and the other nonhumans until other tayledras drifted up to join the conversation gradually she began to relax and to enjoy herself when a touch on her elbow made her turn she found that darkwind had found his way back to her he handed her a slice of something breadlike with something like a tiny decorative flower arrangement atop it and slid into the group beside her your friend skif and my brother seem to have discovered that they have much in common he said by way of joining the conversation and they have gone off to discuss weaponry knives i think she shook her head that figures offer to talk about knives and youll have skifs undivided attention for as long as you like do i eat this or wear it he chuckled you eat it i think you will like it it is smoked fish she nibbled the edge of it tentatively the smoked fish she was used to generally had the consistency and texture of a slab of wood and tasted like a block of salt dipped in fish oil she was pleasantly amazed at the indescribable blend of delicate flavors as darkwind chuckled again at her expression she devoured it to the last shred i have been asked he continued both to her and to the gryphons to request the presence of my good friends treyvan and hydona at the waterfall and my wingsib elspeth at a gathering of the scouts ssso treyvan replied what isss at the waterrfall and whom kethra iceshadow and my father among others darkwind told him and i am told a very large selection of fresh fish and uncooked meat and fowl some of our more sensitive guests like the dyheli and tervardi might be distressed by refreshments of that nature so we took them out of the way wissse hydona acknowledged but the little onessss torrl assures me that they are not too far from falling asleep darkwind answered and when they do drift off the hertasi have promised to keep an eye on them i am famisshed treyvan said with a look of entreaty at his mate across the clearing elspeth noticed the kyree raising its head from its paws and looking directly at them every parent deserves some time without the young she heard just as clearly as if the kyree was her own companion they are too tired to get into mischief that i cannot distract and anything that wishes to harm them will have to come at them through not only me but all the defenses of the vail and i suspect the large white hooved ones hydona gave in elspeth readily understood her reluctance to have the gryphlets out of her sight considering all that had happened to them but the kyree was right if the little ones werent safe here none of them were they rose to their feet folded their wings tightly against their sides to avoid knocking anything or anyone over and took their leave darkwind led the way up and down yet another path this one ended beneath one of the enormous trees she had only glimpsed through curtains of bushes and vines there were quite a few tayledras gathered beneath it but for the first few moments all her attention was taken up by the tree itself simply put it was so large that an entire house could have been built within the circumference of its trunk a curving staircase had been built around it leading up to a kind of balcony three stories above the clearing soft lights hung from the bottom of the balcony preventing her from seeing anything above that level but she had the feeling that the staircase continued upward when she shaded her eyes and peered upward she caught sight of other fainter lights near the trunk halfobscured by the enormous branches the chronicles had once referred to the hawkbrothers as the treedwelling tayledras and she knew that darkwind lived in a kind of elaborate platformed treehouse so it looked as if that was the norm for the hawkbrothers rather than a concession to danger at least now she knew why they made a point of cultivating those enormous trees such marvels could support not one but several dwellings when she turned her attention back to the gathering she discovered that most of the tayledras here were dressed very like darkwind in relatively plain clothing and with hair either cut or bound up to be no longer than just below the shoulders dyed in patterns of mottled brown and gold they looked more like the shinain than the mages did and it wasnt just that their hair wasnt whiteits because theyre scouts fighters she realized after a moment like darkwind they couldnt wear clothing that interfered in any way with fighting movements nor could they afford to indulge themselves with elaborate hairstyles like darkwind they had a certain economy of movement nothing dramatic nothing theatricalnothing done just for the effect there were strong welltrained muscles under those silken tunics hard bodies that saw furlongs of patrolling every day she felt herself relaxing further in their presence even before darkwind began introducing them to her these were people who although they were familiar with magic had very little to do with it they were somehow more downtoearth than the mages in their sculptural robes and they were more like heralds than anyone she had met yet she took careful note of the names as they were introduced to her the habit of someone born into politics winterlight and stormcloud brightmoon and daystar earthsong thundersnow and firedanceshe matched names with faces with smiles shy or bold with personality quirks darkwind had explained the tayledras habit of taking usenames names that described something of what the person was like she had to admit that it wasnt a bad system it was much easier to match a name with a face when winterlight one of the few scouts to grow long hair had a thick mane that when he was persuaded to unbraid and unbind it looked like moonlight pouring down on snowwhen daystar was as sunny of disposition as the twinsand when firedance was always in motion never quite still mercurial in temper and bright with wit she wondered if she ought to take a usename as well though it shouldnt be hard for them to remember elspeth skif gwena and cymry four names were easier to remember than an entire clanfull these are the ksheyna scouts darkwind said when hed finished the introductions confirming her guess that there wasnt a mage among them not all of them of course we still have a full patrol out tonight but enough for now i think any more of us and you would be overwhelmed with names and faces she smiled but said nothing this wasnt the time to point out that shed coped with four times their number at ordinary state dinners true she had talias and kyrils help and the nobles and dignitaries didnt look quite so alikeyou are lucky elspeth the young fellow called stormcloud told her truly we are in festival gear now if you were to see us tomorrow you might find it hard to tell one from the other earthsong nodded vigorously there is a tale among outlanders that we are all mageborn copies of a single tayledras i can see how they would think that she replied after a moment of consideration imagining them all garbed in darkwinds drab scouting clothing with their hair bound up against snags if the womenalready slender and athleticbound their breasts it would even be difficult to tell male from female of course im sure you dont do a thing to encourage that now do you she was pleased when they laughed at her sally sometimes the most difficult thing about dealing with a new people was finding out what they considered funny and as she had discovered on her own knowing what made someone laugh was the surest shortcut to making him your friend oh no of course not firedance exclaimed eyes wide and round with mock innocence why would we ever do anything like that the others laughed again at his disclaimer then settled themselves back where theyd been before darkwind brought her into the clearing we were just having some music and a little dancing earthsong said as he picked up a flat drum we thought you might like to see and hear some of it so we asked darkwind if hed go pry you away from the gryphons not that were great artists winterlight spoke up quietly but we do enjoy ourselves and i think music is better than any amount of words at telling people about each other a language that needs fewer words thats what our bards say she replied looking for an inconspicuous spot to put herself and finally giving up and taking a seat on one of the trees enormous roots winterlight gestured in agreement and picked up something that she didnt recognize a trapezoidal box strung like a harp he set it on his lap and pulled a couple of hammers from under the strings then glanced at earthsong the young scout evidently took that for a signal he began to produce an elaborate rhythm on his flat drum with a single doubleended stick winterlight listened for a moment then joined him not by plucking the strings as elspeth had expected but by striking them deftly with the hammers within a few moments others had joined in either on instruments of their own or simply by clapping some of their instruments were things that elspeth recognized most werent with sounds that were notquitelike anything she knew the music was far from unpleasant there were unexpected bellsounds in the rhythm a wailing wind instrument that added an unearthly element like a singing hawks scream and the occasional whistling improvisation by one of the scouts it was quite infectious and she found herself clapping along with it it wasnt much longer before the tayledras got up to dance here was another difference between the hawkbrothers and her own people at home folks danced in groupsring dances or setpieces with a definite sequence to the steps the tayledras danced singly or in couples or trios at most and there was no setpattern to the dance steps the nearest she had ever seen to this kind of exuberant chaos had been at a herald celebration when a number of the younger heralds just in from the field had gotten involved in a kind of dancing contest demonstrating the wilder steps from their various home villages two or three songs later she noticed that some of the original contingent had vanished somewhere and there were a few additions wearing costumes more like those of mages than of scouts she started watching the onlookers as well as the dancers and figured out from overheard bits of conversation that there were dozens of these little gatherings scattered all around the vale although this was probably the most lively several scouts turned up in the next few moments with wet hair attracted by the sounds of the music from the pools in which they had been swimming that it seemed was the essence of a tayledras celebration to roam people came and went sampling little bits of this and that food music conversationshe decided to do as the natives were doing taking the opportunity to explore the vale a little and slipped off by herself wandering down a randomly chosen path until she heard the sounds of a softer melody than the dancing music she discovered a single singer a woman in silverygray slender as a birch tree playing a huge diamondshaped wirestrung harp there were a half dozen of the mages listening to her sitting on benches arranged in a halfcircle around her and elspeth stayed through three songs before moving on she found her way back to the original clearing by now the gryphlets were sound asleep oblivious to all the light and movement and the sounds of conversation around them both companions were still there with that relaxed attitude and cheerful earsup tailswitching pose that told her they were enjoying themselves their conversational partners were torrl the kyree two of the mages one of the scouts and an old hertasi seeing them she relaxed as well since they were enjoying themselves as she wandered off again it occurred to her that this was the one thing that was often missing from parties that the heralds helddirk and talias wedding had included the companions but all too often they were left out of things as she watched gwena and cymry she made a mental note when she got home again that was one thing that would change shed find a way to make certain they werent left out again they were as responsible for the success of the heralds as the heralds themselves surely they deserved that much consideration gwena turned around at that moment and gave her an unmistakable wink before returning to her conversation even if they do snoop in our heads but she was smiling as she chose another path not looking for anything in particular but thinking that a swim might be nice she heard water trickling off to one side and someone giggling she didnt really stop to think she just started to make her way down the little path suddenly darkwind slipped in front of her stopping her before she could part the branches that shielded the end of the path pardon he said apologetically the marker beside the pathit was turned to face red it means that the giggling changed to an umnistakable gasp of pleasure elspeth found herself blushing never mind she whispered backing up hastily i think i have a good idea what it means she turned and started back toward the clearing darkwind intercepted her again oh no he said earnestly no if they had not wanted to be disturbed the marker would have been blue no the red marker means that they would welcomeahall other he coughed participants y she blushed even deeper her ears and cheeks aflame shed always been told that the heralds were uninhibited brothers had even fewer inhibitions at the hawkit seemed th iii thought perhaps no one had warned you he continued if perhaps you might want to enjoy one of the hot springs i can take you to one where there is nothing more active than hot water what else could she do but accept gracefully and hope that by the time they reached this spring her blushes would have cooled a curtain of steam announced the location of the spring but when darkwind pulled aside the branches at the entrance and waved her into the area around the pool she found herself flushing all over again there were about ten of the hawkbrothers she remembered seeing at the dancing all soaking muscles that must certainly be complaining but they werent wearing much except hair darkwind one of them hailed fifteen splitjumps beat that if you can oh yes the young woman next to him said mockingly fifteen splitjumps indeedand now you see him soaking here because he could scarce walk when he completed the fifteenth sunfeather the young man exclaimed indignantly you werent supposed to tell him that darkwind peeled off his tunic as elspeth averted her eyes and slowly took off her boots perhaps you should think less about splitjumps and more about what sunfeathers expectations for the evening were before you tried to displace your hipjoints he suggested mildly then you might have the answer as to why she revealed your secret as the rest of the tayledras teased the discomfited dancer darkwind removed the rest of his clothing and slid into the water beside sunfeather the springfed pool was quite a large one the dozen tayledras were scattered about the edge of it each one of them lounging at full length and they were hardly taking up more room than a dozen peas in one of the collegium kitchens biggest pots the analogy to a pot was a lot more apt than she had thought when she finally got up enough courage to shed the rest of her clothing she slid into an unoccupied niche the hot spring was a good deal hotter than she had thought not quite painful but not far from it steam rose about her face and turned her hair limp but after a moment she stopped thinking she was about to have her hide boiled off and began to enjoy the heat she slipped out again after a relatively short time she was not used to turning herself into a scalded turnip much to her surprise someoneperhaps one of the ubiquitous and nearinvisible hertasihad left a towel and robe beside her clothing for the rest of the evening she alternated between the larger clearing and the one the scouts had taken for their dancing one of the mages treated the group to a guided flight of befriended firebirdslike the fireworks displays at home except that these fireworks didnt fade or die gwena loved every moment of it although elspeth would have liked to have seen the firebirds come closer the demonstration was very impressive especially when they flew among the branches of the huge shadowshrouded tree that wouldnt have been possible with real fireworks she lost track of time wandering around the vale as fatigue caught up with her and her nerves relaxed finally she found herself back beneath the tree most of the lights hanging from the balcony had been extinguished but there were more people human and not they were all people to her now after an evening of trading jokes with hertasi commiserating with tervardi on the likelihood of a bad winter and telling the dyheli exactly what had happened to nyara so far as the dyheli were concerned nyara was still their heroine she hadnt known that their entrapment had been a setup by her father to ensure that the ksheyna would look on her favorably she had acted in the belief that she was saving them they knew that and honored her for it so the facts of her disappearance were of great interest to them they promised elspeth that they would watch for signs of the changechild and report anything they learned back to the tayledras scouts all but the most diehard of dancers had given up by now elspeth found herself a seat in the shadows trevalen was the center of a cluster of the scouts who were trying to persuade him to dance finally he shook his head shrugged and gestured to the musicians hawk dance iceshadow called back trevalen laughed indeed he said taking a stand in the middle of the illuminated area what else would i do for you but only on condition that darkwind follow with a wind dance elspeth hadnt seen darkwind before trevalen called out his name but when he waved agreement from across the clearing she saw that he had stripped off the fancier overtunic and now looked more like the darkwind she knew in a deepcut sleeveless jerkin and tight breeches his only ornaments the feathers in his hair trevalen had changed after the ceremony into his shinain finery of scarlet black and gold embroidered vest with fringe to his knees fringed and belied armbands loose breeches with fringed kneeboots all of it topped with a horsehair and feather headdress like some strange birds cresthe was a striking sight the drummer began first trevalen marked the time with one foot the fringe shivering with each beat when the instruments came in trevalen leapt into action elspeth soon saw why it was called the hawk dance trevalen was aloft more often than he was on the ground whirling flying leaping he never paused never rested no sooner did his foot touch the ground than he was in the air again his arms curved like wings cupping the air elspeths heart kept time with the beat her eyes unable to leave him he didnt seem much like a human at the momentmore like a creature akin to the tervardi or the firebirds but then perhaps that was the essence of being a shaman the dance came to an end on a triple beat and one of the highest leaps of the dance that left trevalen standing still as stone exactly in the same place where he had begun the dance elspeth had no idea how he had known the music was about to end she had heard nothing to signal the end of the piece it left her staring dumb with astonishment and delight trevalen sat down on a root amid the shouts and applause of the others darkwind took the shamans place in the center of the circle composed himself and nodded to the musicians this time the music began slowly with a glissando on the odd hammered instrument followed by another on the harp a softer echo of the first then darkwind began to dance the tayledras and shinain music were related that much was obvious from a root similarity of melody but dancing and music had changed from the time the two races were one either the shinain had gotten wilder or the tayledras had become more lyrical or both darkwind didnt leap he floated he didnt whirl he flowed he moved as if he had no bones flew like his own bird glided and spun and hovered there was nothing feminine in the dance for all of that it was completely supremely masculine besides his supple grace what elspeth noticed most of all were his handsthey had to be the most graceful pair of hands she had ever seen darkwind finished the dance like a bird alighting for the night coming to rest with a final run from the harp there was a faint sheen of sweat over his body and face shining in the moonlight as he held his final pose he was so completely still that he could have been a silver statue of a forest spirit looking up in wonder at the stars that was the image that elspeth took with her as she slipped out of the clearing and found one of the hertasi she asked the little creature to show her the quarters darkwind had promised were waiting for her here the little lizard grinned at her and led her down so many twisting dark paths that she was soon lost not that it mattered at the moment darkwind had also pledged that he would send someone to lead her about until she knew her own way she recognized the area once they got near it they were very close to the entrance to the vale the farthest they could be from the heartstone and still be inside the vale shields the hertasi showed her a staircase winding up the side of a tree for a moment she was afraid that she would have to climb up several stories and she wasnt sure she had the head for it but the hertasi scrambled up ahead of her and her waiting quarters proved to be a mere single story above the floor of the vale a set of two rooms built just off the stairs lighted and waiting for her she fell into the bed as soon as the hertasi left herbut for a surprisingly long time she lay looking at the moon as sleep deserted her she felt a little less like a stranger but no less lonely skif had nyaraor at least he had the dream of nyara wherever he was now she still had no one only her duty her omnipresent duty to learn everything she could about magic learn it quickly and bring it home to valdemar that was cold comfortand no companyon a silvered moonfilled night chapter three darkwind and vree darkwind accepted the applause of his fellow scouts along with a damp cloth and a healthy gulp of cold water it had been a long time since he had performed the wind dance in full although dance was a part of his daily workout he enjoyed it and enjoyed the applause almost as much it was good to know his skill could still conjure approval from his brethren the outlander elspeth had been watching the dancers when trevalen began his display he knew she had enjoyed the hawk dance from the look on her face she had probably never seen anything quite like it before he thought shed enjoyed his dancing as welland he meant to talk to her afterward he was disappointed after hed caught his breath to find she had gone he settled for a moment to let his muscles recover he felt them quivering with fatigue as he sat down he had pushed himself in this wind dance to far closer to his limits than he usually tried to reach the steps which appeared deceptively easy required perfect balance and control a required fully as much effort to sustain as trevalens more energetic hawk dance he listened to some of the others discussing dances and dancers past nodding when someone said something he particularly agreed with no one else wanted to follow his performance and some of the players took that as a signal to put their instruments away and rest their weary fingers as darkwind settled his back against the tree and slowly sipped his water he considered the outlanderselspeth in particular they were less of an enigma than he had feared they would be although he still wished he knew a great deal more about their culture elspeth was more of a problem than her friend skif simply because of her position as his student she was sometimes fascinating sometimes infuriating often both she compounded his own problems as he resumed his position as an adept as his father had pointed out he had a great deal to relearn how much darkwind was only now figuring out what starblade didnt know was that his son was already giving elspeth lessons even while he was retraining his own powers elspeth posed a peculiar hazard that of halfknowledge she had full training in the gifts of mindmagic though no true training in her magepowersbut some of the mindmagic disciplines were similar enough to give her a grasp on magery but without controls her sword had at one time provided some guidance and tutelage but elspeth had a great deal to learn about even rudimentary magics without the blade need about to keep her in hand he had not felt safe about having elspeth walking around loose without beginning those early lessons in basic control what he had not reckoned onalthough given her quick temper he should have anticipated the difficultywas her impatience with him she wanted answers and she wanted them immediately and when he was already impatient with himself he didnt feel like explaining himself to an outlander who had barely even seen magic in action before she came south her insistence on forcing years worth of learning into a few weeks was enough to drive the most patient of savants to distraction much less her current teacher she can be so irritatinghe leaned his head back and stared up into the pattern of faint light and deep darkness created by moonlight magelights and tree branches there was randomness no discernible pattern just as there was no discernible pattern to his life a season ago he would never have been able to imagine the events of the past several weeks a year ago he never would have believed his life would change in any meaningful way except for the worse he sighed and ran his hand through his hair fluffing it to cool and dry it elspeth was a disruption to an already confusing situation the problem was she had the infuriating habit of being right now and again in matters of magicmatters in which she had no experience and little knowledge hed dismissed all of her suggestions initially then when shed been proven right a time or two hed thought at first that it was pure luck no one could always be right or wrong after all but a day or so ago hed finally seen the logic to her ideas successes in general when she saw something that she thought could be done magically but that he had never learned her theories turned out to be in principle correct one case in point that still annoyed darkwind was treating the lesser lines of power as if they were a web and the mage was a spider in the midst of that web shed reasoned that anyone working magic within the area a mage defined as his web would create a disturbance in the lines of power which the mage at the center would feel in the same way a spider felt an insect in its web the advantage of this was that it was a passive detection system there was nothing to alert the intruding mage that hed been detected it was nothing hed been taught hed been certain it wouldnt workuntil she sketched a diagram extended a few tendrils of energy and proved to him that it would it had been something of a shock to his alreadybruised pride and he followed along numbly as she refined the idea as if it werent enough that she was attractive in her unadorned way she had to be innovative too the magelights dimmed sending the boughs above vanishing into shadows and he looked back down from his perusal of the branches to find that everyone had left the clearing but him the celebration was winding down as couples and groups sought ekeles or hot springs and the rest not ready to seek beds gathered in the meetingcircle or beside the waterfall he stretched his legs carefully to make certain they hadnt stiffened up on him they werent cramping as hed feared he was in better shape than hed thought apparently but he didnt feel much like rejoining the rest who were still celebrating he rose slowly and began pacing making a point of walking as silently as he could it was a lot easier to do that here on the clear paths than out in the forest there was no point in losing his hardwon scouting skills just because he was resuming his position as an adept there was a tayledras saying no arrow shot at a target is ever wasted no matter how many break it meant that no practice or lesson however trivial it might seem was a loss now reclaiming his magery he was discovering the downside of that saying i didnt realize how much id forgotten until i started trying to teach her he admitted to himself if shed just be a little more patient with mewhen something went wrong elspeth wasnt particularly inclined to sit and wait quietly until he got it right again magic wasnt simple spells had to be laid out methodically and when something got muddled a responsible mage couldnt just erase things and start over spells gone awry had to be unmade generally darkwind had to retrace his steps carefully in order to find out exactly where hed made those mistakes only then could he undo what hed done go back to the beginning and start again constructing correct paths whenever he was forced to do that elspeth would invariably ask questions at the worst possible time when interruptions would be the most irritating she never seemed to know when to keep quiet and let him work why was she in such a hurry to master every aspect of magic mastery took time and practice surely she was bright enough to realize that even now he realized she was irritating him how can she do that he asked himself pausing in his pacing for a moment to examine his reaction how can she annoy me when she isnt even here it has to be me not heras he folded his arms and pondered the question he recalled something that seemed to have nothing to do with elspeth it was the reason why he had given in so quickly to the demand that he perform the wind dance and it had nothing to do with trevalens request either hed have found some excuse to perform that dance before the evening was over no matter what the reason stormclouds boast of fifteen consecutive splitjumps challenge he couldnt resist it and elspeth annoyed him because she challenged him in a way no one else ever hador at least no female ever had he wasnt facing the challenge of a teacher toward a students potential nor precisely was he facing the risks of an explorer there was though that annoying realization that he didnt have the safety of being able to lord skill over her he was as uneducated in his way as she it didnt sit well with him but that was the truth of the matter therein lay the challenge she was a virtual equal now that he had identified the source of his irritation he realized that wasnt going to be able to do anything about it perversely he enjoyed the frustration just as he enjoyed elspeths company though she grated on his nerves she was too impatient but that was not damning there was no reason why she shouldnt intrigue him just as what he was teaching should be a challenge to her she was after all a bright student alert and eager hmm thats not the only challenge she represents he enjoyed her company quite a bit more than he was fully willing to admit of all the possible partnerings he could have made tonight he had only considered one she attracted him quite as much as she irritated him although he was certain that he was not ready emotionally for anything as deep as he had shared with dawnfire and there had only been one consideration that held him back from offering elspeth a feather tonight sadly that consideration was a major one one that was going to require any association with herother than pure friendshipto be choreographed as carefully as any major spell she was an outlander he had no idea of the ways of her people it might be that the folk of valdemar took sexual liaisons very seriously they might even reserve sexual activity for formal bondmates only until he knew more about her and her people he was not going to take the risk of offending her or her country by propositioning her even if she would accept an apology the offense would continue to taint everything he did or said to her lust is easy to come by after all i couldnt enjoy it with too much worry anyway there is simply too much at stake to permit a night of pleasure to complicate matters not to mention the possible repercussions of bedding the designated heir to a foreign monarchy who knew where that would lead he doubted anyone would declare war over it but what if a liaison with elspeth would make her subject to problems when she returned home she was too important a personage ah now theres another thing that irritates me he began walking again turning his steps out of the clearing and down the path that led to the waterfall at the end of the vale now that hed figured out what it was that was bothering him it might help to have a talk with someone about it he could do his best to try to watch his own reactions but there wasnt a great deal that he could do about elspeths attitude its this heir to the throne business she never actually says anything about it but she radiates it as ifshe doesnt wear a crown but she carries herself as if she did as if she is always thinking that shes being watched and admired that she is an important person and expects everyone else to be aware of that never mind that the only tayledras around who knew of her land were starblade and iceshadow who had studied the old histories never mind that even those two had no interest whatsoever in her country and the heralds who populated it except as a curiosity and as it had impact in the past on tayledras concerns treyvan and hydona might have some ideas about his concerns they were ambassadors of sortshydona was female that could help in either case they might have some idea how to deal with another outlander particularly an impatient highranking annoyingly impressive female outlander at the waterfall all the magelights had been extinguished the moon was still high overhead though providing plenty of illumination pouring down over this end of the vale and touching the mist rising from the falls with silver the two he sought were still there lazing beside the pool like a pair of creatures from legend both gryphons looked up at his footfall but to his disappointment he saw that they were not alone the shaman trevalen was with them and he felt a certain reluctance to discuss one outlander in front of another for that matter he wasnt certain he wanted to discuss elspeth with anyone except the gryphons he trusted them unfailingly nevertheless since they had seen him and nodded greetings it would have been impolite to ignore them and walk on it would be even worse to return the way he came it isnt going to do any harm to make some idle chat and her highness elspeth isnt a problem i cant cope with on my own if i just think carefully before i say or do anything so he approached the little groupwhich he saw as he grew nearer included the gryphlets the little ones were tucked under their mothers wing quietly sleeping curled together into softly huffing balls of wings and limbs trevalen brought the younglingsss when they began to fret and did not want to sssleep without usss near and have you had enough of ccelebration treyvan said softly as he neared the shaman lounged beside hydona along the edge of the pool his hair wet and rebraided looks as if trevalen has been swimming i didnt know that the shinain knew how to swim i didnt think there were any bodies of water on the plains deep enough for them to learn quite enough i think he replied and nodded to the shaman your hawk dance is very good wingbrother in fact i dont know that ive ever seen better i should like to see you dance one day in full home regalia with a proper set of shinain musicians and singers if you enjoyed my dance you should see my brother i learned it from him trevalen stretched and turned to look him straight in the eyes i have been greatly curious wingbrother and i think you will be willing to answer an impertinent question was it my imagination or was there an air of desperation about all of this as if folk were doggedly determined to enjoy themselves darkwind had been wondering if he was the only one to notice that it was not your imagination he replied quietly i thought not trevalen nodded your people escaped the hand of falconsbane by a very narrow margin whether it was the hand of the goddess or of chance or both together there was little they could have done of themselves to free this clan from his influence i wondered if they knew how narrow their escape was your father for instance they know darkwind replied carefully steering the conversation away from his father that was another whole situation he was not quite ready to deal with yet they simply dont dwell on it and they know that our troubles are not yet over which accounts for that desperate enjoyment you noted but the urgency iss lesss hydona said all that hass occurrred hass bought ksheyna time thisss celebrrationit wass a good thing it iss a relief from the tenssion bessidesss other changess arre coming darkwind decided to leave that typically gryphonishmeaning crypticremark alone you could be reading iceshadows mind he smiled after all the troubles the fear and the other things no one wants to talk about like discovering what had been done to my father it was just a good idea to give everyone something pleasurable to think about for a little while a relief he scratched hydonas neck ruff absently and she halfclosed her eyes with pleasure one of the gryphlets rolled over chirring contentment in its sleep a day or two of rest isnt going to alter the heartstone question but it might make all the difference in letting us gain a fresh outlook tre valen raised an eyebrow but said only some look as if they need a rest more than a fresh outlook starblade for instance dont ask too many impertinent questions shaman i might answer them and you might not care for the answers i am not altogether certain that the shinain are ready to embrace the problems of their cousins no matter how many wingsib oaths are sworn what you do not officially know you need not act upon treyvan raised his head from his foreclaws you look rrready for a frresh outlook darrkwind he said as darkwind tried unsuccessfully to suppress a yawn the outlook you may have frrom yourrrr bed i think youre right he admitted glad of the excuse to escape from a conversation that was becoming increasingly uncomfortable he didnt particularly want to discuss the problems of ksheyna at least not now when his tired mind and tongue might let things slip he would rather were not revealed the way he felt about starblade for instance his heart was still sore and shaking from the revelation that the cold critical father of the past several years had not been the father who had taught him his first lessons in magicand who had worn the costumes his son had designed for him with such open pride the fact that starblade had worn one of those costumes tonight which was not only the wingsib oathing but the first time he had taken part in the social life of ksheyna since darkwind had freed him had left him on very uncertain emotional ground in a very real sense he had a new fatherbut darkwind was years older and there was deepset pain between them it was going to take some time before his feelings were reconciled he imagined it was much the same for starblade the only difference between what he and his father had to cope with was that starblade had known the truth but had not been able to act upon it while darkwind had been able to act but had not known the truth equally painful situations he yawned again and this time did not take the trouble to hide it i think i must be getting old he said my ability to celebrate until sunrise is not what it once was and i did promise young elspeth that her lessons would continue when we both arose from sleep he ignored trevalens suggestive smirk so rather than finding her waiting at the foot of my ekele i think i will seek my own bed and see if i might wake before she does a good plan chuckled trevalen zhaihelleva and to you all he replied and rose from the soft turf beside the pool brushing off his seat he retraced his steps this time heading for the path that ultimately led out of the vale even though he was reconciled with starblade the fluctuating power of the heartstone made him uncomfortable and he disliked having to sleep near it starblade and the rest understood and his eccentricity of maintaining a dwelling outside the safe haven of the vale was no longer a subject of contention his path tonight however was not a direct one three times he had to interrupt his path with detours to avoid trystsinprogress he should have expected it really the end result of a celebration was generally trysting all over the vale of whatever tastes and partners so why am i going back to my ekele alone hed never lacked for bedmates before actually if he hadnt been so choosyor was it preoccupiedhe wouldnt have lacked for bedmates tonight he could say that he mourned for dawnfire and that would have been partially true he missed her every time he thought of her with an ache that he wondered if he would ever lose she had been the one that hed thought would actually work out as more than a bedmate their interests and pleasures had matched so well the fact that she hadnt died made the situation worse in some ways she had become something he could see but could not touch now at least after much thought the first sharp sorrow had passed the sorrow that had been like an arrow piercing his flesh now what he felt was the pain of an emotional bolt lodged in place poisoning his blood with regret he also knew that dawnfire would have been the first to tell him to get on with his life if she had been with him if he had lost another lover she would whisper to him to take a bedmate and some pleasure to ease the pain that was just her way another thing he had loved her for so why hadnt he taken one or more of those offers for companionship tonight because he didnt want any of them they simply didnt fit his real if vaguely defined desires and to tell the truth he wasnt sure what he wanted elspeth was the only person tonight who had attracted him but along with every other way she made him react he was afraidafraid that she might draw him into a deeper relationship than he intended she would leave the vales and return to her valdemar and his people were here there could be nothing lasting between them emotionally save wistfulness over what might have been but they would be spending most of their time together now that she was a wingsister it was his duty to teach her and hers to help defend the vale for as long as she dwelled here the council had made it clear that he was responsible for her if it turned out that elspeth was equally attracted to himthat her ways were similar to his people in the matter of loveplay and they became more than casually involvedperhaps they could pursue some of the techniques in which sexual magic could be tuned and sublimated and in so doingno i couldnt do it i just lost dawnfire i cant lose another lover im not made of such stern stuff he finally reached the path to his ekele without incidentwithout encountering anything more hazardous than a flight of moths that in itself was a pleasant change the sharp bite to the air and the faint aroma of leaves in their turning reminded him that there were other changes on the wind that were not so pleasant autumn was at hand winter would follow and although the vale would remain green and lush outside it the leaves would fall and snow and icestorms would come winter would bring a new set of dangers from outside predators would grow hungry and the fear that kept them away from the vale in the summer might not be enough to overcome their hungers insistence winter would make it difficult for infatuated young skif to track the changechild and it would be much harder for the remains of ksheyna to trek across the country in search of the rest of the clan if that was ultimately what they had to do to reunite despite the fact that ksheyna territory was now much safer than it had been before the confrontation with mornelithe falconsbane darkwind had reverted to his old habits the moment he passed the barrier at the mouth of the vale it only took one slip at the wrong time to make someone a casualty tayledras had been killed even in tamed territories simply by thinking they were secure he kept to the deepest shadows walked silently and kept all senses alert for anything out of the norm the moon was down beneath the level of the trees by the time he reached his ekele he kindled a tiny magelight in the palm of his hand andwith some misgivingloosed the ladder from its support above and lowered it by means of another exercise of magic with a tiny spell he tripped the catch that held the ropeladder in place if this had been in daylight hed never have used magic hed have had vree drop the triggerline to him he still felt uneasy about using anything except mageshields outside of the vale true falconsbane was no longer out there watching for the telltale stirrings of magicuse and waiting to set his creatures attacking anything outside the protection of the vale but caution was a hard habit to break especially when he wasnt certain he truly wanted to break it still the presence of the magelight made climbing the ladder a lot easier and the use of the spell eliminated the need to scale the trunk in the dark to release the ladder it was worth the risk at least tonight perhaps now there were many things that were worth the risk of attempting them skif could hardly believe what hed just heard he rubbed his tired eyes and stared across the tiny firepit at his new friend the conversation had begun with knives in general proceeded to other things such as forging tempering balance and point structure throwing stylesbut it had just taken a most unexpected turn forgive me but im notahas good in speaking tayledras as elspeth did you say what i think you said wintermoon chuckled and passed him a cup of a spicybut hed been assured nonalcoholicdrink poured from a bottle hed asked one of the hertasi to bring i will speak in more plain words the scout told him slowly reaching for one of the sausages warming on the grill above the coals of their fire i wish to help you to find the changechild nyara if you tell me aye i shall come with you you say you have no true learning in woodstracking i am not a poor scout i think i would be of real help hes one of the best scouts and trackers in ksheyna chosen cymry told him her ears were perked up showing her excitement and interest hes being very modest the dyheli told me hes one of the few that can even hunt and track by night maybe even the best he wanted wintermoons helpwanted it badly he needed it without it all hed do would be to crisscross ksheyna territory virtually randomly hoping to come across some sign of nyara with wintermoons skillful help he would be able to mount a systematic search but was this a test of his oaths and his loyalties iuhi dont know what to say he stammered watching the tall tayledras with his strange hair and pale eyes wintermoon i want your help more than i can say but youre a scout a hunter a good one what about the clan dont they need you i mean im a wingbrother but doesnt that mean i need to think of the good of the clan first wintermoon blinked slowly and turned away toward the trees he held up a gauntleted wrist that was the only warning skif had that something was happening a heartbeat later a huge white shape hurtled by his ear soundlessly as he winced away the shape hit wintermoons wrist and folded its wings it resolved itself into a great white owl which swiveled its head and stared unblinkingly at him before turning back to wintermoon reaching down with its fierce hook of a beak and nibbling the fingers of his free hand gently this is ktathi wintermoon said stroking the owls head gently corwith is in the tree above there are not many tayledras who bond to the greater owls you didnt answer my question skif said pointedly ah but i did wintermoon transferred the owl from his wrist to his shoulder where it proceeded to preen his hair he sighed and gave skif a look full of longsuffering patience there are not many tayledras who bond to the greater owls while my bondbirds can hunt by day they prefer not to they are also a different species from the hawks and falcons and there is instinctive dislike between them and the birds of other scouts it can be overcome but it requires great patience he shrugged as the fire flared up for a moment from the cooking the flare flushed the owl with ruddy light more patience than i care to give thus i hunt by night and mostly alone that makes me something that can be done without when times are not so chancy in other words your absence wont cause any problems skif persisted clutching the cup the owl found wintermoons ear and began nibbling it wintermoon sighed and gave it his finger instead the new plan is for mages to help the scouts he explained there will be more watchers your friend elspethshe is clever and will make up for my absence so i am free to aid you there is a hole in this somewhere cymry said skif agreed he could sense it what is it that you arent telling me he demanded is it something about nyara the owl let go of wintermoons finger roused its feathers and settled staring at cymry as if it found her fascinating wintermoon nodded i thought perhaps you might think that and yes it concerns the changechild but you must pledge not to take offense offense he asked cymry why would ioh of course they still dont trust nyara they want her under control and they probably feel the same way about that damn sword can you blame them she asked reasonably about the sword no he replied then to wintermoon you tayledras dont trust nyara or the blade do you the rest of the clan wants you to go along and make sure she isnt out there trying to set up some more trouble for you wintermoon nodded quite i beg pardon but that is only the truth of the matter but skifi do wish to help you for yourself you are not schooled in tracking you have said as much yourself think of it this way he grinned i have no wish for your friend elspeth to be sending me out in an icestorm to find you oh im not that bad he replied with a rueful smile ive had some field training but it was all in valdemarthere were herald waystations all over and you cannot track or trail wintermoon repeated he turned to cymry lady you cannot track or trail either nor can you see as well at night as my corwith and ktathi can nor do you know our territory cymry bowed her head in agreement and skif i would like to help you for i know that you feel very much for the changechild his face sobered i do not know if the changechild is near as dangerous as the council think she might be i think she deserves to have someone looking for her that will give her that benefit i think it is a good thing for her to have someone besides yourself that will do that you are a wingbrotherbut an outlander as well i am ksheyna skif was well aware of what the tayledras meant just as his own word would hold more weight in valdemar than wintermoons no matter how many oaths the latter swore so wintermoons held more weight here if there were any doubt as to nyaras allegiances wintermoons opinion might well be the deciding factor and it would be a very good thing to have company out there in the wilderness take his offer cymry urged hes a good man he could become a good friend all right wintermoon skif said decisively i would be very very glad to have you help me cymry wants you along and i never argue with her never she snorted welli never argue with you when youre right good wintermoon rose to his feet then held up his wrist again for the second time a white shape dove past skifs ear this time the owl came in from the side then swooped up and alighted on wintermoons gauntlet with grace and silence this is corwith he said transferring the owl to his other shoulder we three will be most happy to give you our help then i shall see you in the morning make that when we wake up skif amended its already morning wintermoon squinted at the west where the moon was going down so it is well the night is my chosen time of departure when i am given a choice that will be good there will be fewer eyes that will see us leave zhaihelleva wingbrother may your dreams bring you peace and good omens and yoursfriend on impulse skif offered his hand wintermoon took it after a moment clasping first his hand then his wrist as wintermoon vanished into the darkness under the trees and skif turned to climb up into the ekele that had been given him cymry reached over and nuzzled his shoulder that was well done she said warmly i like him i think we might have accomplished more than we realized i think youre right he answered yawning ive got a good feeling about this so good a feeling that for the first time since nyara disappeared he fell asleep immediately instead of lying awake and staring at the darkness and for the first time it was a calm sleep untroubled by dreams of silken skin and crying catpupiled eyes chapter four skif and cymry skif tied the final knots on his packs expecting at any moment to have a hertasi pop its head over the edge of the treehouse with a summons from wintermoon it was difficult to tell time here where the position of the sun was obscured by the towering trees and where the temperature seldom varied by much but he thought hed awakened about noon there had been cheese fruit and fresh bread waiting in the outer room of his little treehouse along with all of his belongings and cymrys tack brought from the gryphons lair by hertasi or one of the scouts he presumed they were the only ones who knew where his possessions were besides of course the gryphons he and elspeth had stayed with the gryphons since they had first arrived here in ksheyna territory they were kindhearted creatures but certainly not pack animals hed assumed he would have to go fetch all of the gear himself this was yet another instance of tayledras thoughtfulness or at least of hertasi thoughtfulness he was even more surprised and delighted to discover that every bit of his clothing had been cleaned and neatly folded before being put in the pack and all but one of his hidden knives and garrottes from said clothing laid out neatly by the pack old habits die hard he descended long enough to clean himself up at a hot spring set up as a kind of bathhouseand to thank the first hertasi he saw for having his things brought he found the lizard first he was a little ashamed that he couldnt tell the difference between individual lizardcreatures surely there was a way and it seemed doltish not to know it he covered it as best he could by asking the diminutive creature to pass on his thanks to the others the hertasi didnt seem to mind in fact it thanked him and showed him where to go to bathe and find provisions for his journey back in the treehouse he launched into packing feverishly the strange provisions hed gotten from a hidden kitchen arealearning only then where all the food for the celebration had come fromweighed much less than the dried fruit and beef and travelers bread that the valdemaran forces heralds and guards alike carried into the field just so that they were marginally edible marginal was all he asked for they cant taste any worse than the clay tablets they expect karsite troops to eat starch for shirts or old glue would taste better that much he was certain of some folks would rather eat their saddles than the karsite field rations i trust you are ready wintermoon called up from below startling him he went to the balcony and looked over the edge beneath him were the scoutnow with his hair bound up in a tail and wearing clothing identical to the kind darkwind had wornand a pair of handsome dyheli stags one carried a light pack the other did not even have a cloth on its back beside them was cymry looking up at him with merry blue eyes as if she was amused by his startlement im ready he replied to all of them im pretty much packed look out im going to toss the stuff down wintermoon and the rest backed up a little giving him room for the drop he dropped the saddle and the pack containing his clothing and nonbreakables over the edge of the balcony he brought the rest down the staircase slung over his back by the time he reached the ground wintermoon had already saddled cymry for him and was waiting for the rest of the gear you should try the shinain saddles the tayledras scout observed as skif pushed aside an enormous leaf that overhung the trail to join them i think you both would find them more comfortable maybe skif replied dropping his pack on the ground and holding up the hackamore for cymry so that she could slip her nose into it but the shinain dont have to contend with anything other than the plains weve got a lot of different terrain to cross a lot of jobs to do and sometimes we have to be able to sleep in the saddle or strap ourselves on because of wounds he faltered for a moment as an ugly memory intruded he resolutely ignored it and continued ill try their saddles some time but weve put a lot of time and work into that design and im not sure theres any way to improve it cymry nodded which apparently surprised wintermoon skif was going to ask where his birds were when one of them dropped down out of the tree to land on the laden dyhelis pack and the other followed to land on the unladen ones horns the stags were both evidently used to this the second dyheli held his head steady until the owl hopped from the horns to wintermoons shoulder mobile tree branches the tayledras grinned so i see i told elspeth that i was going out to hunt for need skif told the scout i told her that i didnt think we could afford to have a major power like that out loose and not know where it was or what it was doing she agreed but i dont think she believed that was the only reason i doubt you could fool your friend on matters of the heart wintermoon replied at least not for long except perhaps for her own i have noted that few people are good judges of their own hearts skif flushed and decided not to answer that statement have you got any ideas about where we should start looking he asked instead i mean i know you havent had much chance to think about this since last night but actually i have wintermoon interrupted surprisingly i spent some time last night reviewing what i would do if i were in her place so i know where she might be i thinkor rather i know where we need not look here he pulled out a map from a pouch at his belt and spread it on the ground skif pulled the last buckle on cymrys packs tight and crouched down on his heels beside the scout cymry craned her neck around to look over his shoulder here is the vale wintermoon pointed at an oval valley on the rim of the craterwall that marked the rim of the dhorisha plains nyara will not have run to the west neither south nor north to the west and south were her fathers lands to the west and north that is untamed unhealed tainted land full of creatures that are as bad or worse than anything that her father commanded and she knows this skif asked wintermoon snorted she cannot have avoided knowing no matter how closely he kept her mewed if she had any contact with the world outside his walls she would have known we had intended to bracket the area between this vale and the new onewell that is of no matter now she will not have gone west unless she is an utter fool nor will she have gone south because thats the dhorisha plains skif said absently studying the map yes so that leaves east and north she may have gone eastshe can go eastbut here he indicated a shaded area on the map this pattern means that the lands here are healed if she goes there she will encounter farms and settlements if she goes further she must meet towns villages and people who are unused to seeing creatures that are not wholly human she will surely encounter traderoads traders caravans no i do not think she would go very far to the east and if she went due north skif asked ahagain she will encounter a border this time the territory guarded by another clan they may not be as kindly disposed toward her as we certainly since they will not know her they will regard her with suspicion and even hostility wintermoon sat back on his heels so you see she must be within this area his forefinger described a rough oblong on the map those are the lands we once claimed but we have let run wild as we pulled back our borders that is where i think we shall find her skif nodded and considered the map none of it is very far from where the scouts patrol he observed in fact we could go out there and start our search and come back to the vale every few days to see how matters are progressing hereand whether or not were going to be needed after all my thought exactly the scout said picking up the map and folding it he stood up stowing the folded parchment in his pouch again in this way we fulfill our own wishes and our duty to the clan as well he gave skif an odd sideways grin that skif returned why do i have the feeling that youre as good at that as i am he asked slyly getting your own way by threading through rules and obligations i mean what i wintermoon replied widening his eyes innocently then he laughed come we are birds of the same flock you and i we know each other yes he turned and mounted the second stag bareback saving skiff from having to answer that question skif took his time mounting settling himself into the saddle with a sigh not that he didnt enjoy partnering with cymry but it had been a long journey and hed been glad it looked as if they were staying in one place for a while well it had looked that way until hed realized that nyara was gone and wasnt coming back now they were on the trail againoh you wont be in the saddle as much as you think cymry told him affectionately dont forget wintermoon is going to have to look over the ground out there very closely for clues actually if i were you id let him teach me about tracking in the wild i think you could learn a lot from him i know ill be paying attention skif was a little surprised at her matteroffact acceptance of this excursion he had more than half expected her to object to leaving elspeth on her ownafter all he was supposed to be looking after her wasnt he he was supposed to be her bodyguard and he was supposed to keep her from getting into too much trouble elspeths quite capable of taking care of herself chosen as she has remindedyou more than once this time the tone was teasing lighthearted but she quickly sobered there is no way that ancar can get to her hereeven if he could learn where she was shes got to go her own way now you know that you know shes going to have to deal with things you cant even guess at whatever trouble shes likely to get into i dont think its going to be anything a couple of arrows or knives would fix skif ducked out of the way of a branch stretching over the path and sighed that no matter how his pride felt about it was only the truth she was a mage now under the protection and tutelage of mages he would be as out of his element as if he tried to teach a candlemaking class and i dont have any of this magegift whatever it is he added probably id only be in the way probably id get myself in trouble without ever helping elspeth probably cymry agreed nyara nowthats something you can do something about i think you should if nothing else when you find her youll discover for yourself if there can beor ever wasanything between you two and youll finally stop worrying about her while her words were practical the tone of her mindvoice was unexpectedly sympathetic she was his best friend barring no one else she knew all of his secrets even the ugly ones he stared at the trail ahead and at wintermoons back for a while thinking about that thinking about how close they were cymry were you ever in love he asked abruptly bright havens what a question she exclaimed me in love why do you want to know after all these years hed managed to surprise her becausei dont know if im in love or notor if i was ever in love with anyone silence fell between them for a heartbeat i thought if you were ever in love youd be able to tell if i was am whatever they reached the barriershield at the end of the vale at that moment the tingling of energies as they crossed it distracted skif from his question when they emerged into slightly cooler air on the other side cymry shook her head and shivered her skin as if she was shaking off flies skif yes i do know something of emotional involvement that doesnt simplify matters any you werent in love with elspeth i can tell you that much she said slowly that was a combination of a lot of things including my dear chosen the fact that you finally saw her as a very attractive woman for the first time and had a predictable reaction he choked turned it into a cough when wintermoon looked back at him in inquiry cymry wasnt usually so frank with him or blunt you made matters worse im afraid by acting far too strongly upon those feelings id kind of figured that part out he replied wryly but now this time she shook her head i honestly dont know you have some very strong feelings but i cant sort them out any better than you can well at least the companions didnt know everything sometimes he wondered about that they certainly didnt go out of their way to dispel the idea that they did skif turned his attention to the woods surrounding the trail trying to get used to these new forests so that he could learn to identify what was a sign of danger and what wasnt he did the only thing he could do he assumed that this area was safe and studied it anything that differed from this might be dangerous most of his experience outside of towns consisted of the single circuit hed made with dirk when he first got his whites and his occasional duty as courier and messenger at neither time had he really had to deal with wilderness with places where people simply did not live he had traveled roads not gametrails spent nights in waystations not in a tent or a blanket roll under the open sky even on the journey here the first time he had encountered true wilderness was when they descended into the dhorisha plains there on that trackless expanse of grassland there had been no real sign of the hand of man perhaps that was why the plains intimidated him so much never had he felt so completely out of his element maybe that had been why he had persisted in clinging to elspeth well here was wilderness again once outside the vale there were no tracks of any kind for the tayledras went to great lengths to avoid making them the only creatures making trails of any sort were wild ones deer bear boar even the dyheli did their best to avoid making trails for trails meant places they could be ambushed skif couldnt help wondering if the only reason wintermoon rode the dyheli stag now was to keep from leaving human footprints the signs of fall were everywhere in the dying drying grasses in the leaves of the bushes which were just starting to turn in the peculiar scent to the air that only frosttouched leaves made this wasnt a comfortable time of the year to be traipsing about in wild country on the other hand it would be harder for anything hostile to hide once the leaves started falling in earnest if there was anything noisier for a skulker than a carpet of crisp freshlyfallen dry leaves skif had yet to run into it even in his days as a thief and a street brat hed known that and stayed clear of rich folks gardens in the fall and he was not looking forward to camping out in the cold riding through chill autumn rainson the other hand it probably wouldnt get horribly cold this far south at least not for a while yet game would be plentiful at this time of year a lot of it birds and animals in their first yearinexperienced or just plain stupid which to a hunter translated as easy to catch darkwind had quoted a shinain saying about that one day when vree brought back a rabbit that couldnt have been more than two months old if it gets caught it deserves to be eaten on the whole skif agreed with fresh meals volunteering their lives to their owls arrows and snares they might not even need to resort to their traveling rations much maybe this wasnt going to be so bad after all cymrys ears flicked the way they did when she was mindspeaking and he caught the barest edges of something in the back of his mind but he couldnt make anything out just a mental sound it was as if he was several rooms away from two people having a conversation no matter how hard he strained all he could hear was a kind of murmur in the distance who are you talking to he asked her puzzled he hadnt thought cymry could mindspeak with anyone except himself and another companion elivan she replied shortly elivan whothen the dyheli that wintermoon was riding turned its head on its long graceful neck and gave him a look and a nod the dyheli she was mindspeaking the dyheli frustrated he tried to make sense out of the faroff murmuring unable to make out a single word even more frustrating he caught wintermoon in a kind of listening attitude and heard a third voice join the other two in what sounded like a brief remark whatever they were saying wintermoon seemed vastly amused skif got a look at his expression as he ducked to avoid a lowhanging vine and he looked like someone who has just been let in on a private joke skif felt a surge of resentment at being left out just how much mindmagic did the hawkbrother have why couldnt he hear the dyheli if wintermoon and cymry could and was it only wintermoon who had that particular gift or did all the tayledras share it theyd been free enough with information about real magic why keep this a secret except that they werent exactly keeping it a secretnot from skif anyway unless they couldnt block what they were doing but in that case why did cymry tell him matteroffactly that she was talking to the stag the murmur of faroff voices stopped finally wintermoon signaled a halt at the edge of a tiny crystalline stream the tayledras dismounted and the two dyheli moved up sidebyside to dip their slender muzzles into the water another sign of the stags intelligencethe packladen stag was not being led and wintermoon made no move to limit their drinking i could use a drink too dear cymry prompted him skif slid out of his saddle to let cymry join them wintermoon strolled over stretching to relieve the inevitable stiffness of riding any distance at all we are at the edge of the territory ksheyna still patrols he said after this point the hazards begin it may be dangerous to break silence if i note anything i shall warn your lady mindtomind why not warn me skif asked doing his best not to sound sullen but afraid that some of his resentment showed through anyway wintermoon only looked mildly surprised because i cannot he replied the mindtomind speech of the scouts is only between scouts and those who are not human his brow furrowed as he thought for a moment perhaps you caught the edge of my conversation with elivan i apologize if this seemed rude to you but your cymry told me that you did not share the gift of mindspeech with one other than heror perhaps another herald i thought then that you did not hear us he shrugged apologetically i am sorry if you thought we had left you out apurpose many tayledras have this gift but i am one of the strongest speakers as was dawnfire sometimes it only extends to bondbirds i am fortunate that i share my brothers ability to speak with other creatures as well although i do not share his gift of speaking with other humans skif flushed that was one possibility that simply hadnt occurred to himthat wintermoon might not know that he was aware of the conversation without knowing what was being said well now i feel like a real idiotis that what makes the nonmages scouts and not something else he asked trying to cover his misstep wintermoon shook his head and smiled all tayledras have mindtomind speech usually only with their bondbirds he replied it is a part of us one of the many things that the goddess granted to us to help us survive here but although those who can speak with other creatures make the best scouts if they are also mageborn then magecraft is oft the course of their life skif looked beyond him for a moment across the stream it didnt seem any wilder or more threatening there than it did on this side frost had laced the trees on both sides of the stream perhaps because they were more sensitive to it the leaves were a yellowbrown and some had already fallen carpeting the ground and occasionally drifting off on the current of the brook jays called somewhere out thereor at least something with the same raucous scream as a scarlet jay a hint of movement on the other side of the water caught his eye and he turned his head slightly just in time to catch the tail of a squirrel whisking over to the opposite side of the trunkpresumably with a squirrel attached to it although if what hed been told was true that didnt necessarily follow just whats so bad out there he asked curiosity overcoming pride it doesnt look any different to me but i wouldnt know what to look for therenot much wintermoon replied scanning the trees and the ground beneath them with eyes that missed nothing farther outive heard there are wyrsa though at this season they do not run in packs bears of course and changebears treelions and changelions wild boars and changeboars perhaps bukto and wait a moment skif interrupted those namesthat was something hed been wanting to ask about and hadnt had an opening changebears changelions changeboarswhat are you talking about darkwind called nyara achangechild does this have anything to do with her yes and no wintermoon replied maddeningly skif stifled his impatience as wintermoon paused as if searching for the proper words do you not recall what you were shown by iceshadow how magic uncontrolled and twisted warped all that it touched here yes but wasnt that a long time ago he said thinking back to those images strange and only half understood the part where that bright light had appeared to the hawkbrothershed understood what the goddess had asked of them but he hadnt seen more than that light elspeth and the shinain had plainly experienced more than that not long enough the scout replied looking soberly out at the innocentlooking land beyond the stream there was a time when magic in all its colors and sounds worked together the time we call the mage wars shattered that order the structure of magicand its energieswere stressed to their limits in the great disaster that ended the final war those bonds were broken their crystalline patterns like branches of light to a mage became as distorted as pine needles dropped to the ground and every place they touched on a scale vaster than we can see they made the land dangerous and caused creatures that should never have lived to appear skif shook his head unable or unwilling to comprehend it wintermoon continued when we first came here and established this vale the land hereabouts was as fearful as anything you saw before the lady appeared we have tamed it somewhat and it is a fortunate thing that few of the magic twisted creatures breed true that also is due in part to tayledras magery but some do skif asked wintermoon nodded those we callchangebeasts they plainly have parentage of normal creatures but they have new attributes generally dangerous changelions for instanceoft they have huge canine teeth extending far beyond their jaws and have a way of being able to work a kind of primitive magic that can keep them invisible even when one looks directly at them so long as the changelion does not move that is a common change some are unpredictable or unrecognizable he hesitated gathering his thoughts when the parentage was human we call the result achangechild andin generaltrue humans do notmate with them he glanced sideways at skif gauging the effect of his words skif didnt take offense but he wasnt going to accept that particular judgment without a fight either why not he asked bringing his chin up aggressively i mean whats the difference who would care wintermoon sighed because it is said that to mate with a changechild is the same as mating with a beast because the changechildren are one with the beasts he held up a hand to stop the angry words skif started to speak i only say what is commonly thought not what i think but you must know that it is the common thought and there is no escaping it skif frowned so most tayledras would thinkif nyara and i made a pair of itthat i was some kind of deviant the hawkbrother sighed perhaps fewer in this clan than in others but some would and outside the clans altogether among outlanders who live in tayledras lands and hold loyalty to us or among those who trade with usthere would be no escaping it they would all feel that way to some degree so ill deal with it whenifit happens he nodded his understanding but not his agreement wintermoon continued there is another problem as well there are either no offspring of such a mating or as often as not they truly are monsters that are less able to reason than beasts this i know for i have seen it the few children of such a union that are relatively whole are like unto the changechild parent and that is only one in four not good odds wintermoon flexed his hands the likeliest to happen is that there are no children of the union i would say that is just as well so nyara is a changechild skif said thinking out loud just what makes her that and not someohvictim of an experiment by her father on a real human child that there are things the human form cannot be made to mimic wintermoon replied too promptly her eyes slitted like a cat furtufts on her ears oh this time skif expressed real skepticism thats not what darkwind told me he said that it was possible that shed been modified from a full human he said that it would take a lot of magic to do it but that if falconsbane was using her as a kind of model for what he wanted to do to himself he might be willing to burn the magic he did skifs assertion caught wintermoon by surprise thatwould make things easier the hawkbrother chewed his lip for a moment that would make her entirely a victim among other things that would bring her sympathy ive got another question cymry returned from the stream and came to stand beside him he patted her neck absently what if she wasnt a changechildbut she wasnt a human either wintermoon shook his head in perplexity how could she not be either if she was someone from a real race of her own he chewed his lip and tried to come up with an example look you dont call the tervardi changechildren or the hertasi what makes them different from nyara there are many of them wintermoon replied promptly they breed true they have colonies of their own kind settlements so how do you know that there arent settlements of nyaras kind somewhere he interrupted you didnt know there were gryphons before treyvan and hydona arrived he smiled triumphantly gryphons were upon a list handed down from the time of the mage wars wintermoon said immediately dashing his hopes as were the others every tayledras memorizes it lest he not recognize a friendor foe there is nothing on that list that matches nyara well so much for that idea at least she isnt on the foe list i suppose id better consider us fortunate nevertheless he couldnt help wondering if there could be creatures that were like the hertasi that simply hadnt made the allimportant list or if there were creatures that had developed since the mage wars that couldnt have made the list because they hadnt been in existence then oh this is ridiculous it doesnt matter what she is what matters is what she does every herald hed met had told him that as he grew up in the collegium they had been right then that should hold true now it will be dark soon wintermoon said glancing at the sky while they had been talking the quality of the light had changed to the thick gold of the moments before actual sunset filtered through the goldenbrown leaves the effect was even more pronounced as if the very air had turned golden and sweet as honey are we going to camp here or go on skif asked the question was pertinent if this had been an expedition with two heralds they would camp now while there was still light but it wasnt wintermoon had abilities and a resource in his bondbirds that no herald had we go on wintermoon replied promptly although we will feign to make camp if there is anyone watching us they will be deceived then once true night falls we shall move on it didnt take them long to unload the packs and cymrys saddle and make a sketchy sort of camp wintermoon unstrung and tied out a hammock and padded it with a bedroll then produced a second one and guided skif in setting it up that done they cleared a patch of forest floor and built a tiny fire as they sat beside the fire one of the owls lumbered into their clearing laden with a young rabbit it dropped its burden at wintermoons feet and before it had taken its perch on his shoulder the second followed with a squirrel in its talons well wintermoon chuckled as the second owl dropped its burden beside the first and flew to a perch in the tree above wintermoons head it seems that my friends have determined that we shall have a meal at least thats fine by me skif said and grinned i was about to dig out those trail rations i thought i heard something growlingi thought it might be a beast in the bushestwas only your stomach wintermoon teased as he began gutting and skinning the rabbit both owls hopped down from their perches to stand on the ground beside him waiting for tidbits they took the proffered entrails quite daintily seeing that skif had no hesitation about picking up the squirrel and following the scouts example when the darker of the two owls saw what he was doing it joined him abandoning wintermoon skif got two surprises the first that this little squirrel was built more like a rabbit than the scrawny creatures he was used toand the second that the owl took so much care in taking its treats from him that its beak never touched his fingers which one have i got he asked wintermoon how hungry is he likely to be ktathi the scout replied without looking up the scraps will suffice for now they will hunt again after we make our second camp this time for themselves give him what you wish to spare from your meal head entrails and the limbs from the first joint out seemed appropriate ktathi took everything that was offered with grace never getting so much as a spot of blood on his graywhite feathers skif offered the skin as well but the owl ignored it so skif quickly tossed it into the bushes as he saw wintermoon do that would have been foolhardy if they had been planning to stay for the bloody skins might well attract something quite large and dangerous but since they werentwell there was sure to be something that would find the skin worth eating and if there was someone watching them possibly following themwell if they try to go for the camp and theres something big with teeth still here theyre going to get a rude surprise when he finished his task he once again followed wintermoons example and spitted it on a sturdy branch to hold over the fire meanwhile the sun continued to set the sky above the trees turning first orange then scarlet then deepening to vermilionstreaked blue by the time the meat was done the sky was thick with stars he was halfway through his dinner when wintermoon said abruptly i envy you did you know that he looked up a little startled into the iceblue eyes of the man across the fire there was no sign of wintermoons dinner other than the pile of small neatlystacked bones at his feet each of them gnawed clean what did he do inhale the thing on the other handit was in the interest of the scouts survival to learn to eat quickly no telling when a meal might be interrupted by an uninvited unwelcome dinnerguest why he asked puzzled by the question what is there about me to envy im nothing special especially around heralds myliaisonstend to be brief and informal the scout replied one reason i wished to guide you was because starsong returned my feathers and i am at loose ends skif wondered if he should tender sympathy surmising from the content that returned his feathers meant his lover had dissolved the relationship but wintermoon evidently saw something of his uncertainty in his expression and shook his head smiling no this was not painful i have no wish to avoid the vale or her but i simply have no partner now and there is no one else i care to partner with at the moment so i am at loose ends and would just as soon have other things to think on he wiped his fingers clean on a swatch of dry grass and tossed it into the fire that is what i envy you do you see he said watching the grass writhe and catch strong feelings i have never experienced them skif coughed a little embarrassed i dont know that this is anything other than infatuation or attraction to the exotic still it is strong wintermoon persisted i have never felt anything strongly sometimes i doubt i have the ability for it the statement was offered like a gift skif was wise enough to know that when he saw it he searched his mind for an appropriate response the birds cymry prompted you feel strongly about corwith and ktathi dont you he countered wintermoon nodded slowly as if that simply hadnt occurred to him in such a context well then skif said and gestured palm upward then i wouldnt worry youre capable the way i see it we all feel strongly about things we just might not know we do valdemar is like that for heralds we lay our lives down willingly for our coun and monarch when we must but most of the time we just dont think about it if you encounter someone you can feel strongly about you will you havent exactly been given much of a choice of potential mates what with threefourths of the clan gone and your tendency to well stay to yourself true the scout sat back a little and only then did skif realize as he relaxed that he had been tensed my father thinks that being born without the gift for magery shows a serious lack in me sometimes i wonder if i have other less visible lacks before skif could change the subject wintermoon changed it for himto one just as uncomfortable what do you intend when we find nyara the scout asked bluntly we shall i promise you i am not indulging in vanity to say that i am one of the finest trackers of ksheyna iuhi dont know skif replied right now to tell you the truth all im thinking about is finding her once we do that he shook his head it just gets too complicated im going to worry about it when it happens what she says and does when we find her will give me my direction ah the scout replied and fell silent after all i spent less than a week in her company he thought i could have been misreading everything about her except that she had saved his life at the risk of her own shed attacked her own father a creature that had held absolute control over her all of her life and for skifs sake shed gone after falconsbane with nothing nothing but her bare handsor rather clawsand thoughts like that made him realize all over again just how alien she was yet that realization didnt change how he felt in the least whatever it was it was very strong and very real whats going to make a difference is whats happened to herand what happens to us if shes handling the things her father did to her and if we can find someplace where people will accept herand maybe even us that place might not be valdemar that was something he was going to have to admit they might not be able to deal with someone who had tufted pointed ears catlike eyes and a satinysmooth pelt of very very short fur it wasnt obvious but a close examination would show it the heralds were openminded but were they openminded enough for that to accept someone who looked half animal and he was going to have to go home eventuallythat question kept him thinking until wintermoon shook his shoulder after that he was too busy breaking camp and following the scout through the darkness to worry about anything else and when they finally made camp again he was too tired to think at all chapter five wintermoon corwith and ktathi the two hunters began using a different pattern than a follower might expect they were on the move from about midafternoon to after midnight with the owls helping him wintermoon was completely happy doing most of his scouting after darkness fell and even skifs nightvision gradually improved with practice he would never be wintermoons equal but he grew comfortable with searching the forest in the darkness there were advantages to this ploy that outweighed the disadvantages the strongest advantage being that with ktathi and corwith scouting for them there was nothing that was going to surprise themand nothing that would be able to follow them easily few creatures hunted the night by preference and those few though formidable could be watched for so for several days they hunted and camped and remained unmolested even by insects but skif knew that the situation could not last sooner or later they were going to run into one of the kinds of creatures that had driven the tayledras borders back in the first place sooner or later something was going to come hunting them that in fact was what he was thinking when they paused along a deer trail and wintermoon sent the owls up to quarter the immediate vicinity looking for disturbed areas or other signs of someone who was not especially woodswise cymry began acting a little nervous casting occasional glances back over her shoulder but wintermoon who was sitting quietly on elivan didnt seem to sense anything out of order his first real warning that something really was wrong and that cymry just wasnt being fidgety was when wintermoon suddenly tensed and flung up his hand and corwith came winging in as fast as slung shot landing on his outstretched arm and hissing with fear and anger skif held out his hand as wintermoon had asked him to do if one of the owls ever came in fast and showing distress ktathi arrived a moment later and ktathi hit his gauntleted wrist as if striking prey it was the first time that the owl had landed on skif and nothing in his limited experience in hawking with merlins and kestrels prepared him for the power and the weight of the bird as it caught his wrist and landed those thumblength talons closingeven with restrainton his wrist could easily have pierced the heavy leather of the gauntlet they did not although the claws exerted such powerful pressure that skif could not possibly have rid himself of the bird short of killing it ktathi hissed angrily and swiveled his head away from skif pointing back the way he had come before skif could ask what was wrong wintermoon cursed under his breath and the dyheli stag he rode tossed its antlers and reared its eyes shining in the moonlight wide with fear wintermoon kept his seat easily but corwith flapped his wings wildly to keep his balance tilredan the second stag the one laden with their provisions and extra gear bolted it was skifs turn to swear and not under his breath but he had reacted too soon in the next breath wintermoons mount followed the other stag and skif only had cymrys warning mindcall of hold on before she was hot on his heels hold on with an owl on one arm he dropped the reinsuseless in a situation like this oneand grabbed for the pommel of the saddle with his free hand deeply grateful that he had not given in to wintermoon and exchanged cymrys old saddle for a shinain model shinain saddles had no pommel to speak of ktathi continued to cling to his wrist mercifully refraining from using his wings to keep his balance one strong buffet to the head from those powerful wings would lay skif out over cymrys rump before he knew what had hit him instead the owl hunched down on the wrist making himself as small as possible leaning into the wind of their passing skif tried to bring him in close to his body but he wasnt sure how much ktathi would tolerate what in skif began a pack of something that scented us and is hunting up our backtrail cymry answered shortly not something weve seen before but something wintermoon and the others know worse than wolves worse than changewolves and smartwere running for a place where we can defend ourselves ktathi found it just before corwith sighted the pack he could only hope that an owls idea of what was defensible and theirs was the same sheer cliffs were fine if you could scale them and a hole in a tree would be all right if the tree was the size of a house but otherwise theyd be better off making a backtoback stand and he hoped his idea of nearby and the owls was the same too for behind him he heard an uncanny keening sound not baying not howling not wailingsomething like all three together the noise gave him chills and made the hair on the back of his neck stand up and it sounded as if it was coming from at least eight or nine throats he glanced back over his shoulder and saw nothing but his imagination populated the darkness if he heard eight how many were really in the pack twelve twenty fifty ktathi clutched his wrist a little harder and the deadly talons pricked him through the leather this was not a good way to carry the bird but there was no way to turn ktathi loose to fly the dyheli were nearly a match for a companion in speed and they were going flatout neither owl could have hoped to keep up with them by flying through the canopy which was why both birds were clinging desperately to their perches on his wrist and wintermoons but ktathi at least was having a lot of trouble holding on if the owl exerted a little more pressure cymry can you talk to ktathi he asked cymry frantically her mindvoice was colored with surprise and annoyance at what probably seemed like a supremely inappropriate question yes but this is no time he interrupted her tell him not to move im going to try something with him before he goes through my wrist he pulled his arm to his chest and brought the bird in close to his ty sheltered against his body this left the owl unbalanced with its ace shoved against his tunic but ktathi displayed his agility and intelligence somehow he managed to get himself reversed so that his head faced forward and his tail and wings were tucked down between skifs wrist and his chest now the bird wasnt having to fight the wind by himself he was braced against skif the painful pressure on skifs wrist relaxed that takes care of one problem cymrys muscles bunched and flexed under his legs the sound of hooves drowning out anything else except the chilling cries behind them the wailing behind them seemed closer skif didnt ask cymry if it was it wouldnt make any difference theyd either reach safety in time or not he just wished he knew how far it was to that promise of safety if he knew he might be able to guess whether they had any chance of making it or whether it might be better to turn and make a stand and he wished that he had wintermoons nightsight far superior to his own to him the moonfilled night was full of shadows his eyes couldnt penetrate there could be nothing in those patches of darkness or an enemy or a hiding place though the moon was bright there were still enough leaves on the trees to keep most of the light from reaching the ground the pack behind them cried again this time there was no doubt in his mind about the peril of their situation they were closer if he looked back he might be able to see them the brush obscuring the path behind them didnt seem to be slowing the pack at all in fact they were probably breaking a trail for the pursuers to follow along hed learned long ago that being the pursued in a chase was more difficult than being the pursuer he crouched a little lower over cymrys neck as low as he could without flattening the owl ktathi seemed to realize what he was doing and didnt object or struggle only giving him a warning stab with his talons when he crouched too low for the owls comfort soft feathers pressed against his chin and ktathi hunched down on his wrist so that the birds chestfeathers warmed his hand he glanced up saw the gray bulk of a rock formation looming ahead of them through the trees in this light it looked very like the one in which he and elspeth had sheltered when they first arrived in tayledras territory a moment later he saw that this one was bisected by a goodsized crack just like the one he and elspeth had used he seemed to spend a lot of time hiding in rock crevices lately whatever had happened to hiding in rooms behind drapes or under furniture he had a moment to thinkoh no not againand then cymry braced all four legs for a sudden stop skidding to a halt beside the dyheli at least the owls did seem to have some idea of what constituted a good shelter for the rest of the party the crevice would be a little crowded for three plus the two humans but it was better than facing what howled on their backtrail with nothing to protect their backs all three of them crowded into the narrow crevice between two halves of a huge boulder the rock was easily two stories tall and the crevice ended in the stone face of a second stone that was even taller there was barely enough room for cymry to turn around but that was fine less room for them meant less room for those things out there to try to get past them a strangled hoot and the booting of ktathis head against his chest reminded him to turn the poor owl loose he raised his arm and launched it clumsily into the air thrown off by the confined quarters and the fact that the owl was considerably heavier than a merlin it wasnt much of a launch or much help to the owl in gaining the air ktathi hit him in the side of the head with a wing recovered and got free of the crevice just as the pack reached them skif looked up when a note of triumph entered the wailing a strange yellowish flood burst through the bushes and into the area around the rocks dear godshe neednt wish for nightsight after all the damned things glowed now that he saw them he wished perversely he didnt have quite such a good view they lookedsuperficiallylike dogs they had the lean longlegged bodies of greyhounds the closecropped ears the long snaky tails and pointed muzzles but their faintlyglowing pale yellow hides were covered with scales each scale outlined by a darker yellow their heads shaped like an unholy cross between dog and viper held eyes that burned a sulfurous yellow much brighter than the bodies and rows of sharply pointed fangs they flowed they didnt run they drifted to a halt outside the entrance to the crevice and wound around each other in a vicious impatient evermoving tangle a snarl of ropes with teeth at one end a ball of vipers they confused the eye and baffled the senses with their hypnotic restlessness wintermoon slid off the back of his mount skif followed his example a moment later they couldnt get in the sharp hooves of cymry and the dyheli bucks awaited them if they tried not to mention the bows that skif and wintermoon unlimbered from the sheathes at each saddle but those who had taken refuge here couldnt get out either stalemate skif strung his bow and nocked an arrow to the string wintermoon shadowing every movement all right here we are now what what are those things skif asked quietly as the creatures continued to mill about in front of the crevice he blinked his vision clear as they blurred for a moment was that just his tired eyes acting up or were they doing it wyrsa wintermoon replied frowning as he sighted along his arrow he loosed it in the next moment but the wyrsa that was his target writhed aside literally as the point touched its hide evading the deadly metal hunting point in a way that skif would have said was impossible if he hadnt seen it himself hed never seen anything move so fast in his entire life wintermoon muttered under his breath tayledras words skif didnt know but recognized for intention if not content the tayledras nocked another arrow and sighted but did not fire they have no magic weapons but they do not tire easily and their fangs are envenomed wintermoon continued watching as the beasts flowed about each other once set on a quarry they do not give up they know how to weave patterns that confuse the eye and as you see they are swift agile alone we do not consider them a great problem but together in a pack they are formidable great skif replied after a moment so what do we do about them we kill them the hawkbrother said calmly and loosed his arrow this time although the beast he aimed at evaded the shaft the one that was behind it could not get out of the way and took the arrow straight in the chest in any other beast the wound might not have been fatal there was no blood and skif honestly thought the creature was going to shake the strike off even though it had looked like a heartshot but it stood stock still for a moment jaws opening soundlessly then toppled over onto its side the light died from its eyes and a moment later the light faded from its hide until it was a dull gray shape lying on the darker ground revealed only by the moonlight the entire pack surged to one side leaving the dead one alone for a moment they froze in place unmoving and silent he thought for a moment that they might prove wintermoon wrong that after the death of one of the pack they might give up and leave their quarry to go its own way but then they all turned burning hatefilled eyes on wintermoon then pointed their noses to the sky and howled again the sound was much worse at close range it not only raised the hair on skifs head it rang in his ears in a way that made him dizzy and nauseous the pack of wyrsa wavered before his blurring eyes and he loosed the arrow he had nocked without even aiming it luck however was with him two of the wyrsa dodged aside accidentally shoving a third into the arrows path a second wyrsa dropped to the ground fading as the first had done the moment it dropped the pack stopped their howling and tumbled hastily out of the way they stood near the bushes at the head of the path this time staring at the cornered quarry skif got the feeling that there were cunning minds behind those glowing eyes minds that were even now assessing all five of them two downhow many to go i cant make out how many there are of them they keep blurring together they advanced again as a body but with a little more separation between each of the beasts so that they could dodge out of the way without sending another into the line of fire he and wintermoon loosed another five or six arrows each without hitting any more of the beasts at least they had stopped their howling skif didnt think he could have handled much more of that after the last fruitless volley wintermoon nocked his arrow but did not bother to draw it instead he looked out of the corner of his eye at skif and said and have you any notions skif had been trying to think of something anything that could be done about the beasts shook his head wordlessly wintermoon grimaced one of the wyrsa separated from the pack when they held their fire and slunk bellydown to the ground to stand just in front of the crevice as if testing them when they didnt fire on it another joined it and another until all of them had gathered directly before the entrance to their shelter while they were moving one at a time skif got a chance to count them there were eight in all not counting the two dead hed gone against worse numeric odds but never against anything with reactions like these creatures had were rather outnumbered if this were a tale he offered our rescue would come out of the woods at this point a herd of dyheli perhaps something that would come charging up and flatten everything in sight or a mage that could kill them with lightning would that it were a tale wintermoon muttered his eyes following every move the beasts made the things move too swiftly to shoot if we had a way to distract them it might be possible to get at some of them before they figured out what we were doing are ktathi and corwith fast enough to avoid those things he asked could theyoh fly down and make strikes at their heads and eyes keep them busy while we tried shooting wintermoon shook his head emphatically uno he replied owls are agile flyers and silent not swift if they were to dive at the wyrsa the beasts would have them i will not ask them to do that well so much for that idea unlesswell they dont have to dive at them to distract them all right what about this he said thinking aloud can they fly just out of reach and hiss at them get them worked up into forgetting about keeping an eye on us maybe tease them into trying to make strikes even though theyre out of reach not for long wintermoon frowned not long enough for us to pick off all the wyrsa with arrows but what if we used the last of the arrows waited got the owls to tease them again then charged them all of us cymry and the dyheli too skif had a good idea that the hooved ones might account for as many as one wyrsa apiecethat would leave less for him and wintermoon we can always retreat back here if we have to it is worth a try wintermoon left his arrow nocked but did not sight it even as skif did the same two ghostly white shapes swooped down out of the dark treetops hissing and hooting the wyrsa looked up startled as the owls made another swoop at the third pass even though they were plainly out of reach the nearness of the owls and the taunting sounds they made broke through their control they turned their attention from their trapped quarry and began lunging upward at the birds wintermoon gave the wyrsa a few moments more to fix their attention on the new targetsthen pulled up his bow and fired his last three arrows just as fast as he could get them off skif did the same the wyrsa quickly turned their attention away from the owls but it was already too late each arrow had found a mark two more wyrsa lay dead and four were wounded it seemed that only a heartshot was effective in killing them the wounded wyrsa limped but did not bleed and in fact took a moment to gnaw off the shafts of the arrows piercing wuseless bow and drew his sword he though reandowasthheeypuwteruepehviesnnomore angry skif felt the heat of their gaze as he read satisfaction in those eyes as well wintermoon drew his sword as well and ktathi and corwith swooped down again harrying the wyrsa from above carefully gauging their flights to keep them just barely out of range skif would have thought that the ploy wouldnt work the second time but either the wyrsa had not made the connection between the owls and the attack or now that the last of the arrows was spent they had reasoned as a human would that the quarry would not be able to use the owls as the cover for an attack they grew frustrated by their inability to do anything about the flying pests and sooner than skifwould have thought turned their full attention back to the owls that was when wintermoon gave the signal to charge cymry larger and heavier than the dyheli charged straight up the middle of the pack striking with forehooves and kicking with hind before whirling and retreating to the safety of the crevice the dyheli came in on either side just behind her and trampled the wyrsa that dodged out of the way they too retreated as skif and wintermoon followed as a second wave swords out and swinging skifs world narrowed to his enemies and himself nothing more as always fear temporarily evaporated replaced by a cool detachment that would last only as long as the battle talia had told him that he was really temporarily insane when this came over himas emotionally dead and uncaring as an assassin he hadnt always been this way but like so many in valdemar the war with ancar had changed him he ducked away from snapping jaws and decapitated one wyrsa two more came for him poisoned fangs gleaming in the moonlight but one of the dyheli got in a kick that distracted the first and he fatally disemboweled the second when it couldnt limp out of the way fast enough cymry screamed a warning and he ducked the one that the dyheli had kicked hit it with the flat of the blade and knocked it into cymrys path she trampled it bones crunched and popped and a hoof crushed its skull as it snapped at her he saw movement out of the corner of his eye and struck at a third as it jumped for wintermoons back his strike wasnt clean he only sliced at its foreleg but that disabled it wintermoon finished that one off and skif looked around for more of the beasts there werent any more we did it skif could hardly believe it it had happened so quicklyhe leaned on his sword panting his heart still in his mouth over the nearmisses hed had with the creatures poisoned fangs very nearmisses the cloth of his breeches was torn in one place and his tunic damaged by claws we were lucky wintermoon said flatly very very lucky either these were very stupid wyrsa or your tactic took them by surprise one touch of a fang begins to dissolve flesh far worse than any poisonous serpent and wyrsa often travel in packs twice the size of this one we would not have defeated a larger pack this easily skif nodded and the battle fever that had sustained him drained out of him in a rush leaving him weakkneed and panting he cleaned his sword on a handful of dry grass and sagged against the stones that had sheltered them havens no if there had only been one more of those things i dont think we could have done this ive never seen anything move as fast as they did he closed his eyes as a rush of exhaustion hit him i think wintermoon said in a voice as drainedsounding as skif felt that we should camp now wintermoon decreed a fire after they cleared the carcasses of the wyrsa out of the way pitching them into the forest upwind of the camp for scavengers to squabble over not the easiest task in the dark they were heavier than they looked and their fangs were still deadly and had to be avoided then they collected arrows and arrowheads all that could be found there were more arrows in their packs but every arrow was precious and every brokenoff head might be needed by the time they had the fire going in front of their crevice there was something out there fighting over the remains with other somethings all of them squalling and barking skif wondered how they would dare to sleep he kept glancing at the forest where the noises were coming from even though he knew the chances that hed actually see anything were remote hopefully they hadnt attracted anything too largewe stay awake until they carry away the remains wintermoon said as if answering his thought skif was only startled by it for a moment he was probably pretty transparent and wintermoon had read his expression once the carcasses are gone the scavengers will go the fire will keep them away until then the nightscavengers are cowards and fear fire we had best not move away from it the hawkbrother settled down on his blanket roll got one of his packs and took out a small fireblackened pair of pots and filled both with water from one of their bottles he looked up to see skif watching him with puzzlement so long as we are confined to the fire we might as well make use of it he said the owls will only be able to hunt enough to fill their bellies they are too weary to hunt for us tonight i prefer not to resort to unembellished trail rations if i have any choice at all with that he reached into his pack for a slab of dried venison and a few other things he broke off bits of meat and dropped them into the first pot which was already simmering following that with the multicolored contents of a gray paper packet and a sprinkling of what looked to be herbs into the second pot went more herbs dried fruit and several small round objects that skif didnt recognize can i help skif asked i should warn you i tend to ruin anything i cook on my own but if you keep an eye on me i should do all right the scout chuckled and handed him a wooden spoon skif pulled the edges of his cloak a little closer around his body and stirred the meat pot as hed been directed he was very glad of the fire now that they werent moving or fighting the air though windless was very chilly he expected to see thick frost on the ground in the morning i have needed this myself wintermoon said breaking the silence i am often out alone and the hertasi do not care to be outside the vale or their settlements my lovers have always been casual so there has never been anyone to share suchdomestic chores with forgive me if i am stepping beyond the bounds skif said but i cant imagine why you seemed popular wintermoon coughed politely well none of the scouts have felt easy about having longterm affairs with one who hunts the dangerous hours of night by choice and no woman of the clans would ever consider a long liaison with a man who has no magic but you have magic skif felt moved to protest better than mine in fact wintermoon shrugged it is not magic by starblades definition he said too casually i do not know how these things are reckoned in other clans but it is that way in ksheyna skif stirred the pot vigorously and tried to think of a tactful way to approach the subject of starblade darkwind had been so relieved at the release of his father that he was likely to look no further but skif did not trust starblades ability to assess his own strengths and weaknesses tact had never been his strong suit he finally gave up searching and tried bluntness instead what do you think of starblade he asked now i meannow that he isnt being manipulated do you trust him much the same as i have always thought of him came the surprising answer not often and not a great deal this revelation has changed very little between starblade and myself whatever it has done for darkwind but skif began wintermoon looked up from his task briefly and the firelight flickering over his face obscured whatever faint expression it might have held starblade disassociated himself from me when testing proved me to have no real magic he said carefully do you really wish to hear this it is not particularly interesting why dont you let me judge that skif replied just as carefully it will help me to know ksheyna through you wintermoon raised an eyebrow at that but made no other comment so then he began my mother was a ktreva mage who came to ksheyna to look for a father for outclan children she bargained with starblade for twins male and female the male to leave the female to take back with her i do not know if my sister had magepowers but i did not and i am told i was a great disappointment to my father i did not know that and i only knew he was my father because i was told for i scarcely saw him at least you know who yours is skif replied with a bitterness that took him by surprise i dont if i have any sibs i dont know that either mother never got around to telling me anything she was too busy teaching me to pick pockets then someone decided to get rid of hera rival thiefand i was on my own he snapped his mouth shut appalled at the way he had simply blurted that out to a nearstranger things he hadnt told anyone except his dear friend talia you were a thief in a city wintermoon seemed more intrigued than anything else i should like to hear of this one day i have never seen a city you havent missed much he replied cities arent all that impressive and id give a lot to have a brother once again the tayledras dropped his eyes all of wintermoons apparent attention was again on his half of dinner at least i do have darkwind that is true i am actually glad that i am so much older than he if i had been younger i would have hated him for stealing starblades love and care but i was old enough to know that what occurred was no ones fault that without magic i would never represent anything but failure to starblade and that darkwind was no more to be blamed for that than the magic itself which declined to manifest in me still i stay away a great deal it is very easy to find myself envying him and envy oft turns darker he sighed as skif nodded he stared into the fire for a moment and continued i think i will never have other than mixed feelings for darkwind i do love him when he was very young it was easy to love him for his disposition was sunny and his mother treated us both as if we were sons of her body even as he came into his power he was not pridefulhe rather delighted in the learning in finding what could be donein showing it to me like any young man with a new accomplishment magic was like a huge and complex puzzle to him but at the same time there was always the envy i dont see how you could have gotten away from it skif put in quietly hoping he wasnt going to break wintermoons mood by speaking this was instructive it gave him an idea of how some of the more complex situations in the clan had evolved ah but i am also jealous wintermoon said with a lightness that did not in the least deceive skif darkwind has so many things come easily to his hand from his bondbird to his magic things that i must struggle to achieve and often have not even a hope of having women for instance if you have gotten the impression that he could have any partner in the vale that he chose you are substantially correct that is not the least because he wasor isa powerful mage they sat in silence for a while as their dinner cooked and ate in silence finally wintermoon broke it i think perhaps he told skif slowly that i have said too much you must think badly of me i do not ordinarily speak of such things even to friends i cannot think why i did so now maybe because were more alike than either of us guessed skif replied and if you dont mind i think id like to talk theres been something bothering me for a long time and i cant really talk about it to anyoneat home they wouldnt understand he looked straight into wintermoons eyes i think you might maybe it was that wintermoon was so strangeand yet so very like him maybe it had something to do with everything the entire clan had just endured maybe it was just time skif didnt know but when wintermoon nodded he drew a deep breath and began choosing the simple painful words to tell the story of his failure you know we are at war with a country to the east of us right wintermoon nodded and i told you that i was a thief once well for a little while i was working across the border because im used to doing things that areoutside a heralds usual skills he paused for a moment then continued keeping his voice as expressionless as he could i was supposed to be helping people escape across the border and i was working with a series of families that were providing places for escapees to hide as they fled across the country i lived with one of those families hunters the husband and wife bothhe hunted game she hunted herbs that wont grow in gardens they had two children an older boy and a little girl they werekind of the family i never had wintermoon nodded knowingly as darkwinds mother played mother to me exactly his stomach churned and a cold lump formed in his throat i never thought id like living out in the middle of nowhereand i used to tease them about being backwardsbut i kind of got to enjoy it then we got a message saying there was someone waiting at the next house in waiting for me to guide him to the place on the border i went and fetched himand damn if he wasnt just like me same background used to be a thief before he joined ancars army all that i trusted him i should have known better i should have but i liked him i trusted himhe had to stay a couple of days before it was safe to make the crossing we talked a lot he acted and reacted just like me teased the kids helped with the chores but i should have known i should have anyway it was finally clear and he went off i thought he made the crossing i left him though because i had to check back with the people hed stayed with before bring them some news and money that was when i found out that they were no longer there wintermoon interrupted that the plausible fellow you had trusted was a traitor how did you know skifs jaw dropped and wintermoon grimaced because i am older than you by more than you know the hawkbrother said gently i have seen a great deal remember who was the unwitting traitor in our midst to be effective one who would betray others must be likable and plausiblewhile all the time actually being something else entirely he must be a supreme actor projecting warmth and humanity while having a cold uncaring heart someone who was a criminal is likely to be all of these he looked up at skif thoughtfully i do not think he was likely to have been a thief though he may well have associated enough with them to have collected the tales he traded with you he is likelier to have been something darker i would say one who kills in cold blood for pay skif blinked and tried to collect his thoughts all he could think of to say was how old are you wintermoon did not seem surprised at the nonsequitur you are darkwinds age i would guess i am sixteen summers his senior he halfsmiled wryly it is difficult to determine the age of a tayledras even if you are of the clans yourself oh skif gathered his scattered and perambulatory wits and continued his story but this was the most difficult part to face ii went back as fast as i couldbut he swallowed the knot of grief in his throat he didnt close his eyes if he had hed see them hanging from the crossbeam of their own barn see what had been done to them by ancars toadies before they were hanged he still saw them at night the only one left was the little girl the family had managed to get her out before the troops caught them and she was hiding in the woods thank the gods she never saw any of it never knew what had been done to them i got her across the border left her with friends thenthen i went back against orders the bastard shouldnt have told so many stories he gave me more clues than he knew and i know cities i tracked him down and i did to him what had been done to them before i killed him wintermoon nodded and waited skif hesitated then continued nobody ever said or did anything even though they must have known what i did and id do it again i swear i would but part of you is sickened wintermoon said softly because what you did may have been just in the way of rough justice it may have beenexcessive he stared up at the sky for a moment it is better to kill cleanly he said finally if you did not you are at fault a creature like the one you described is not sane any more than mornelithe falconsbane iswassane but you do not torment something that is so crazed it cannot be saved you kill it so that its madness does not infect you skif was astonished after all he did to your peopleif you had falconsbane in front of you now i would kill him cleanly with a single stroke wintermoon said firmly i learned this lesson when i was a little older than you nowwhen i visited similar retribution on a very stupid bandit that had been tormenting hertasi and killing them for their hides it does no good to visit torments upon a creature of that nature it teaches him nothing and makes your nature closer to his and that is why you are troubled wingbrother you knew this all along did you not skif hung his head and closed his eyes yes he admitted finally i did wintermoon sat in silence a moment longer for what it is worth he said finally what was done was done in the heat of anger and in the heat of anger one loses perspectiveand sanity now you are saneand sickened do not forget the lesson wingbrotherbut do not let it eat at you like a disease let it go and learn from it skif felt muscles relaxing that he hadnt known were tensed and a feeling of profound relief there it was out in the open wintermoon had guessed most of it without skif having to go into detail and the result he had just discovered he wasnt alone in depravity after all he would never have guessed from wintermoons serene exterior others will forgive you this wingbrother the tayledras said softly but only you can forgive yourself you must never never forget i wont skif promised as much to himself as to wintermoon i wont he shook his head in part to clear it iafter that thoughi got myself assigned back at the capital i just lost my taste for adventure wintermoon chuckled in that case wingbrother why are you here i also couldnt resist elspeth its strange how even if you know inside that there isnt a chance youll pursue something anyway because the thought of it is so attractive ive known it for a long time but i wouldnt admit it to myself elspeth has her own plan for her life and my role in it is not as her lover still there it is the only way they were going to let her make this journey was if i came along he smiled and shrugged but when this is all over if im given a choice id like to have a place like that family had for me or maybe for their memory skif pursed his lips then looked back up at wintermoon oh id probably be awful at country livingid probably have everyone in the county laughing at me but it would be good trying i know id like to have a home a family he smiled a little wistfully nobody at haven would believe that of me you have seen enough blood enough death wintermoon surmised you fought in battles as a soldier yes once again he was amazed at wintermoons insight or was it something more are you talking with cymry the other man nodded and poked at the fire i told him only a few things cymry didnt sound at all apologetic when you started talking to him and it looked like you were going to talk about thati prompted him a little why he wasnt angry not really cymry was in and out of his thoughts so much she was part and parcel of him she was his best and dearest friend he loved her so deeply that he would sooner cut off his arm than lose her and if he knew nothing else he knew that she would never ever do anything to harm him in any way she had been a part of the revenge scheme although she had not known his plan until hed ambushed the bastard and begun and even then she kept silent after her initial protests he didnt think shed even betrayed his secret shame to other companions so why reveal it now because i thought it sounded and felt like you were ready to speak and he was ready to hear she replied matteroffactly and as much as being ready to speak you were ready to listen was i wrong he shook his head no no you were right thank you love wintermoon sat quietly through the silent exchange and watched skif and cymry alternately when the companion nodded he sighed and smiled thinly i hope you are not angered with us he said in half apology you see i had a similar discussion after my illconceived vengeance with iceshadow he is not a mindhealer but he is closer to being one than he thinks he has the insights at least the hawkbrother fixed him with a penetrating stare i will tell you this out of my own experience although you feel relief now this is likely to be the source of many sleepless nights for you you will lie awake look upon your heart and find it unlovely you will be certain that regardless of what i have said you are the greatest of monsters this is a good thing although you may forgive yourself you must never come to think that your actions were in any way justifiable but he chuckled ironically as iceshadow told me being a sane honorable human is not always comfortable he should go set up shop on a mountaintop somewhere cymry said hed make a prime wise old teacher hes already got the part about tormenting the students down perfectly wintermoon drew himself up and stared at her in mock affrontery i heard that he protested i meant you to skif grinned and the grin turned into a yawn wintermoon caught it and pointed an admonishing finger at him we still have work ahead of us and that work requires rest as you both know he spread out his bedroll by way of making an example and climbed into it stars light your path wingsibs he said pointedly and made a show of turning on his side and closing his eyes wyrsa have no respect for crisis of conscience well that about sums the evening up he thought as he rolled out his own bedroll and crawled into its warmth and then he thought nothing more for sleep crept up and ambushed him chapter six nyara and need nyara slicked back her sweatsoaked hair hardly feeling the cold as the chill breeze dried her scalp she licked salt from her lips and crouched in the shelter of the bushes for a moment surveying the open expanse of cracked and crazed pavement that kept the forest from encroaching on the foot of her tower though the stones were fragmented even melted in places they must have been incredibly thick for nothing but grass grew in the cracks it looked similar in construction to the ruins around the gryphons home though the towers age and makers were unknown to her there was no sign of anything waiting for her but she had learned to leave subtle telltales things easily disturbed by interlopers the random lines of gravel for instance not so random and placed so that one or more of them would be scuffed by anyone crossing the paving the faint threads of shields that would vanish if breachedor just as importantly if even touched by a mages probing with her feeble command of magic she could scarcely hope to build a shield that would hide her presence from a greater mage so she didnt even try instead she concentrated on things that would let her know if she had been discovered so that she had the time to run and hide somewhere else but once again her refuge seemed secure the threads were still in place the pavement clear nevertheless she stayed in the shelter of the evergreen bushes and sent a careful probe up into the heart of her shelter well that was all she mindsent anything more could reveal her location to lurkers there were creaturessome of them her fathersthat were nothing more than compasses for the thoughts of those who could mindspeak normally only the one spoken to could hear but these creatures could hear everything and could follow the thoughts of a mindspeaker from leagues away alls clear came the gravelly reply come on up kitten i trust you had good hunting now she relaxed nothing got past her teacher quite good she replied shortly no visitors none came the answer unless you count our daily cleanup committee she would have worried if they hadnt shown up anything bad enough to frighten off a vulture was a serious threat indeed im coming up she sent and only then arose from her shelter pushing through the bushes and trotting out into the openas always with a thrill of fear at leaving her back exposed to the forest where someone else could be lurking she padded quickly across the paving taking care to avoid her own traps the less she had to redo in the morning the sooner she would be able to get out to hunt the sooner she got out to hunt the more practice she would have she was under no illusions about her hunting successes the colder the weather grew the scarcer the game would become and the harder it would be for her to catch it she had never truly hunted for her meals before this and was no expert she was lucky lucky that game was so abundant here and lucky that she was getting practice now while it was abundant and a miss was not nearly so serious as it would be later in the winter the wall of her tower loomed up before her the mellowed gray of weathered granite the tower had that look about it of something intended to defend against all comers she took the neck of the pheasant she had caught in her teeth and set her finger and toeclaws into the stone and began climbing the scent of the freshkilled bird just under her nose made her mouth water just as well there had been no blood or she would have been in a frenzy of hunger as she climbed it occurred to her that it was not going to be pleasant if indeed possible to make the climb in winter ice snow or sleet would make the rock slippery cold would numb her hands and feet the prospect daunted her well no point in worrying about it now truly dismal weather was still a few weeks off and anyway there was nothing she could do about it at the moment not while she was clinging to sheer stone three stories above the pavement with another to go perhaps a ladder like the tayledras outside the vale use for their treehouses true she did not have a bird to let the ladder down for her or to hide the line that pulled it up but she had magic not much but she was learning to use every bit of what she had and use it cleverly a bit of magic could take the end of such a ladder up and drop it down again when she returned so many trips up and down that stone had taught her where all the holds were and now she didnt even need to think about where she was putting her hands and feet this was the most vulnerable moment in her daythis and the opposite trip in the morning there was a staircase up the inside of the tower but although it looked sound appearance was very deceptive it was in fact one more of her traps and defenses and anyone chancing it would find himself taking a two or threestory drop to the ground depending on how far he got before the weakened stone gave way beneath him but then she privately thought that anyone trusting his weight to an unproven stairin a ruined tower no lessprobably deserved what he found her mind wandered off on its own planning lightweight ladders and imagining what she might use to make them discarding idea after idea she came to the conclusion that she might be trying to make things a little too elaborate after all by virtue of her breeding she was a much better climber than the best of the tayledras a simple knotted rope might serve her better at that point her hand encountered the open space of her window and she grasped the sill with both hands and hauled herself up and over the stone slab she swung her legs inside and dropped down to the floor crouching there for a moment she took the pheasant out of her mouth and grinned as her teacher and weapon growled in her mind i hate it when you do that you look like a cat thats just caught someones pet bird but it is not a pet bird need she replied pertly it is my dinner so is the pet bird for the cat the sword said but nobody ever asks the bird how it feels about the situation she sat down crosslegged on the bare stone of the floor and began industriously plucking her catch if it gets caught it deserves to get eaten she told the sword you stole that from the hawkbrothers need accused she shrugged so that does not make it less true and like all hawkbrother sayings it is doubleedged if it gets caught it deserves to be eatento be appreciated used entirely and with respect and not robbed of something stupid like a tailfeather and discarded as useless i honor my kill and i am grateful that i caught it if it has a soul i hope that soul finds a welcome reward need had nothing to say in reply to that nyara smiled knowing that no comment was usually a compliment of sorts she put the best of the feathers aside the large wellformed ones she would use to fletch arrows the rest would go to stuff her carefullytanned rabbit hides need had been teaching her a great deal she had come to this tower with nothing but a knife she had filched from skif and the sword now she had clothing made from the hides of animals she had caught a bed of furs from the same source with pillows of fur stuffed with feathers on a thick pallet of cured grasses and that was not all over in the corner were the bow and arrows need had taught her to make and was teaching her to use need had already taught her the skills of the sling she had used to take this pheasant the sword had also unbent enough to conjureor steal by magica few other things for her things she couldnt make herself not many but they were important possessions a firestarter four pots three waterskins and a bucket one spoon a second knife and a coil of rope the latter was precious and irreplaceable she had used it only to haul heavy game and her water up the side of her tower are you going to eat that raw need demanded she licked her lips thoughtfully she was very hungry and had been considering doing just that but the way the question had been phrasedand the fact that her teacher had asked the question at allmade her pause why she asked is there something wrong with that if the sword could have moved it would have shrugged not intrinsically need replied but it gives the impression that you are more beast than human that is not the impression we are trying to give nyara did not trouble to ask just who would be there to observe her true there was no one except herself and her mentor at the moment but she sensed that need did not intend either of them to be hidden away in the wilderness forever she doesnt want me to seem more beast than human need had been trying to reverse the physical changes nyaras father had made to her now she had an inkling of why need wanted to make her look less like an animal perhaps she should have been offended when that thought occurred to her and she was in a way but rather than making her angry with need it made her angry at her father he was the one who had made so many changes to her body and mind that need had been incoherent with rage for days upon discovering them he was the father that had made her into a warped slave completely in thrall to him often unable even to act in her own defense need had done her best to reverse those changes some she had but they were all internal there was no mistaking her origin the slitted eyes alone shouted changechild if the world saw a beastthe world would kill the beast it was not fair but very little in nyaras life had ever been fair at least this was understandable predictable mornelithe falconsbane had never been that ever no one was here to see her now except need but when she finished plucking the pheasant instead of tearing off a limb and devouring it raw as her stomach demanded she gutted and cleaned it as neatly as any tayledras hunter or hertasi cook and set it aside she tried not to think about how loud her stomach was complaining as she uncovered the coals in her firepit and fed them twigs until she had a real flame once she had a fire she spitted her catch and made a token effort to sear it once the outer skin had been crisped she lost all patience she seized the spit and the bird and began gnawing need made an odd little mental sound and nyara had the impression that she had winced but the sword said nothing and nyara ignored her in favor of satisfying her hunger but when she had finished sucking each bone clean and neatly licking her fingers dry the blade sighed tell me how the hunt went she said and show me i saw the cockpheasant break cover beside the stream she said picturing it clearly as she had been taught i knew that the flock would be somewhere behind him the stalk had taken some time but the end of the hunt came as swiftly as even need could have wanted she had lost only one of her carefully rounded shot which splintered on a rock and took one of the juvenile males with the second she felt rather proud of herself actually for need was no longer guiding her movements in hunting or even offering advice although the blade could still follow her mentally if she chose it was no longer necessary for her to be in physical contact with her bearer to remain in mental contact when nyara had fled from the tayledras as well as her father she had no clear notion of where she was going or what she would do she had only known that too many things were happening at once and too many people wanted her their reasons ran from wellintentioned to darkly sinister and she had no real way of telling which from which so she ran and only after she had slipped out of darkwinds ken had she discovered herself in possession of elspeths sword she honestly had no memory of taking it the blade later confessed to having influenced her to bear it off making her forget she had done so at first she had been angry and afraid expecting pursuit the blade was valuable enough that her father had wanted it very badly but pursuit never came and she realized that elspeth was actually going to relinquish the blade to her such unexpected generosity left her puzzled it would not be the last time that she was to be confused over matters in which need was involved nyara had found the tower after a great deal of searching for a defensible lair need had rebuilt the upper story with her magic strengthening it and making it habitable it still looked deserted and both of them had been very careful to leave no signs of occupancy any refuse was taken up to the flat roof and left there vultures carried off bones and anything else edible and the rest was bleached by the sun and weathered by wind and rain eventually the wind would carry it away and it would be scattered below with the dead leaves youre doing well the sword said finally even if you do eat like a barbarian i dont suppose table deportment is going to matter anytime soon though nyara was silent for a moment now that her stomach was full and the little chamber warmed by the fire she had leisure to consider the blades remarks and feel a bit of resentment nyara appreciated all that need had done for her attempting to counter the effects of twenty years of twisting and abuse teaching her what she needed to survive still sometimes the swords thoughtless comments hurt im not a barbarian she said aloud a little resentfully ive seen darkwind bolt his meals just like i did darkwind is fully human you are not you are clever intelligent resourceful but you are not human therefore you must appear to be better than humans once again nyara was struck by the injustice of the situation but this time she voiced her protest thats not fair she complained theres no reason why i should have to act like some kind ofof trained beast to prove that im just as human as anyone else you were a trained animal nyara need replied evenly you arent any longer and we both know why nyara shuddered but did not reply instead she cleaned up the remains of her meal saving a few scraps to use as fishing bait on the morrow and took everything up to the roof as need had mentioned the vultures had been there already there was little sign of yesterdays meal although the wind was cold nyara lingered to watch the sunset huddled inside her crude fur tunic with her feet tucked under her need was right she had been little more than a trained animal her father had controlled her completely by such clever use of mingled mindmagic pain and pleasure that a hint of punishment would throw her into uncontrollable mindless lust a state in which she was incapable of thinking need had freed her from that need had worked on her for hours days spending her magic recklessly in that single area to heal her and release her from that painpleasure bondage need had watched the nomad healer working on the tayledras starblade from afar studying all that the woman did and applying the knowledge to nyara in this much she was free she would no longer be subject to animal rut although need had not been able to cure her tufted ears pointed canines or slitpupiled eyes the blade had put her in control of her emotional and physical responses must i really be more than they are to be accepted as an equal nothing less would do according to need and as she watched the stars emerge she came to the reluctant conclusion that the blade was right she had to be accepted as at least an equal to claim alliance with the hawkbrothers she needed them and knew it although they did not yet know how much they needed her she had information that would be very useful to them even if some of it was information they might have to get at using needs mindprobing tactics she would gladly submit to that to have their protection but to earn that did she have to give up what she was to take on some kind of mask of what they considered civilized that simply wasnt fair not after everything she had already been through what falconsbane had doneshe didnt want to think about and under needs tutelage she had not only undergone the pain that preceded healing but nightlyand sometimes dailyvisionquests she had to admit there was one positive result of that her real dreams were no longer haunted and her nightmares had vanished completely the sword was as hard a teacher as she could have imagined driving her without allowance for weakness not only did she take nyara through trials in her dreams and teach her the skills that helped her survive on her own but she launched nyara like an arrow against whatever target she deemed suitable giving her lessons in real combat as well as practice nyara had already defeated a wandering bandit and a halfmad hedgewizard both had been left for the vultures when they had seen only a female alone and attempted to take her in both cases need had ultimately taken command of her body as soon as she reckoned that nyara had gone to the very edge of her abilities and moved her with a skill she did not herself possess there would doubtless be more such in the future so why must she prove that she was something other than she was to be accepted no she decided as she watched the moon rise above the horizon it was not fair need wanted too much of her she descended to her towertop chamber only to find the fire burning down to coals and the sword silent she watched it for a moment then shrugged philosophically and heated just enough water for a sketchy sort of bath one advantage of her breeding besides her owlkeen nightsight was that the pelt of very short very fine fur that covered her body made bathing less of a chore than it was for full humans and one had to be very very close to her to learn that it was fur and not just smooth skin she wasnt entirely certain that either skif or darkwind had figured it out wellperhaps skif had he hadnt seemed to mind morning would arrive far too early although she intended to fish and not hunt it would still be better to do so in the early morning when the fish were hungry so as soon as she had cleaned herself she banked the fire and crawled into her bed of furs only then did need speak just as she was falling asleep lets explore that business of fair the sword said with deceptive mildness shall we nyara was no longer nyara no longer a changechild in fact she was no longer in the world or the body she knew except that she was nyara she was herself and someone else too she relaxed this was something she had experienced in needs dreamquests many times although this was someone shed never been before then she realized that this was different strange in a way she could not quite describe this lifewas ancient heavy with years and faded she felt the experience as if through a series of muffling veils each of which was a century her name was vena she was once a novice of the sisterhood of spell and sword now she was alone except for the sword that had once been her teacher the magesmith sister lashanand ahead of her was an impossible task a mage that lashan identified as wizard heshain had come to the enclave of the sisterhood with an army of men and lesser mages capturing the sisterhoods magenovices and slaughtering everyone else vena had escaped mostly by luck and by hiding in the forest surrounding the enclave until they all left she had thought she was completely alone until sister lashan had come riding up returning from her yearly trip to the trademarkets where she sold her bespelled blades to weapons brokers to profit the sisterhood when she saw her teacher shed had no thought but to escape with her to somewhere safe but lashan had other ideas she had questioned vena very carefully probing past the girls hysteria to extract every possible detail from her then she had sat in silence for a long long time her decision had not been the one that vena had expected to make their way to some other temple of the twins and seek shelter there since it was plainly impossible for anyone to rescue the captured novices from such a powerful magelord sister lashan had told her stunned apprentice that theythe two of themwere going to rescue their captive sisters she admitted that she did not know what he planned to do with the novices exactlymostly because there were so many things he could do with a collection of variously magetalented untrained mostly virginal young women but all of the fates she outlined to her apprentice were horrible eventually even vena had to agree they could not leave their sisters in heshains hands rescue was possible especially if rescue could come before the caravan reached heshains stronghold but there was no time to gather another small army to rescue them assuming that anyone could be found willing to commit themselves and their troops against a mage like heshain that had left only vena and sister lashan who had decided unbeknownst to her bewildered apprentice that her old wornout human body was just not going to be up to the task so instead she had chosen a new one a body of tempered steel a sword to be precise a bespelled blade the kind she had been teaching vena to make vena was still not certain how sister lashan who had ordered her to forget that name and call her need now had ensorceled herself into the blade she wasnt certain that she wanted to know it had certainly involved the death of the mage herself for she had found the sister spitted on her own sword she had thought that despair had overcome her mentor and had been overwhelmed with griefwhen the sword spoke into her mind now she was on the trail of heshain and his minions armed with a blade she scarcely knew how to use illprovisioned and without the faintest idea of what she was doing and winter was coming on in fact since the trail led northward she would be walking straight into the very teeth of winter but if she did not try to do something no one would she had no choice no choice at all all this she knew in an instant as if she had always known it and then she was no longer aware of nyaraonly of vena only of a moment that was dim and distant and yet now vena crouched above the road bellydown in the snow and tried to think of nothing there was no sign that heshain had any thoughtseekers among his menbut no sign that he didnt either despite her wool and furlined clothing she was aching with cold it had been a very long time since shed last dared to light a fire and she couldnt remember when shed last been warm she was hungry too the handful of nuts and dried berries shed eaten had only sharpened her appetite and down below her was everything she craved shelter a roaring fire hotfoodtrouble was it was all in the hands of the enemy and the enemy wasnt likely to share she felt sister lashanor rather needstudying the situation through her eyes she wasnt certain how need felt about it but it looked pretty hopeless from here the group that had captured the novices seemed to have divided up this was the hindmost bunch and the girls they guarded seemed to be the ones in the worst shape most were in deep shock some were comatose and carried on wagons the rest hardly seemed aware of their surroundings none of them were going to be of any help at allat least not until vena could physically get need into their hands for contacthealing was one of needs abilities but that could only happen after they were rescued and not before so just how was one halftrained magesmith apprentice going to successfuly take on twenty or more welltrained fighters cleverly of course needs voice grated in her mind there are twenty or more tired bored careless males down there what do you think would distract them the most women she whispered tentatively thinking of conjuring an illusion of scantilyclad girls and getting into the camp under the cover of the excitement but then what the illusion wouldnt hold past the first attempt to touch one of the girls unless need could somehow make it more than a mere illusionher teacher made a mental sound of contempt and a troupe of dancing girls rides up out of nowhere i dont think so dear these are also seasoned fighters theyre suspicious of anything and everything try to think like one of them look at their camp what are they doing as if she hadnt been doing just that ever since they cleared a space for the first tent and freezing her rear off too theyre eating she offered tentatively closer what are they eating venas mouth watered as she stared down at the common fire looks like winterrations beans and bread i think oh she would gladly have killed for some of those hot spiced beans and a piece of bread i dont see meat vena they dont have any theyre on winterrations and they havent been allowed time to hunt so they dont have any meat and these are fighters theyre used to having it they dont seem to have any wine either but i cant think of a way to get that to them without making them suspicious of their good fortune back down the ridge slowly im going to try calling in an elk i used to be good at this in the end it was a deer need managed to attract and not an elk but in all other ways it was precisely what she wanted old with broken antlers already looking thin this early in the winter the aged animal would not have outlasted the snows vena followed her directions carefully as they poisoned the poor beast by means of counterhealing hamstrung one leg as if it had just escaped from a wolf and drove it over the ridge and down into the enemy camp the men there fell on the weakened beast seeing only their good luck and never thinking that there might be something wrong with it other than exhaustion and injury the toxin need had infused into the deers blood and flesh was only slightly weakened by cooking a clever poison there was little or no warning to the victims of their fate most ate fell asleep and never woke by daybreak all twenty men were dead or dyingand vena came down into the camp to dispatch the dying and found herself in charge of eleven of her fellow novices not one of whom could be trusted even to look after the others much less find her own way back to safety confidently she turned to need for advice damned if i know what to do with them the blade replied i can heal their injuries but the rest is up to you demonsbane girl i only made blades before i made myself into one youre the one with the hands and feet and they know you they probably never even met me im fresh out of clever ideas time for you to come up with one or two so it was up to vena to deal with the girls to try to rouse some of them from their apathy and to figure out what to do with the rest and to drag the bodies of the poisoned fighters out of the camp to get her eleven charges fed and sheltered to make sure the horses were tended to it was nothing less than hard labor although she gave herself a selfish moment to build the fire back up and warm herself by that fire until her bones no longer ached then she took a little more time to stuff herself on the bread and oat porridge not beans after all that was cooking over the fireavoiding the charred venison and the pot of venison stew she freed the novices from their cages in the four prison wagons but most of them didnt recognize her and the ones that did reacted to her as if theyd seen a ghostterrified and huddling speechless in the corners she tried not to look too closely at them after the first encounter the girl wasnt one she had known but her eyes were so wild and yet so terrified that she hardly seemed human anymore she led the girl coaxingly away from there across the snow and into the only wagon without bars and chains the one that held the provisions when she offered the girl a blanket taken as an afterthought from one of the bedrolls beside the fire the poor child snatched it from her and went to hide in the darkest corner of the wagon she repeated the process until she got them all herded into the wagon where they huddled together like terrified rabbits their eyes glinting round and panicstricken from the darkness of the back during the long process of getting her former fellow students into the provision wagon shed tossed out everything else that had been in there now in the last of the daylight she sat on a sack of beans and went through everything she had thrown on the ground and all the personal belongings that were still in the camp she felt very strange rifling through other peoples possessions at least at first but soon sheer exhaustion caught up with her and she no longer saw them as anything other than objects to be kept or discarded in the snow blankets went straight into the wagon behind her hopefully the girls still had enough wit left to take them the best blankets she kept for herself as well enough food for the girls for a few days more and in a separate pack provisions for herself finally the unpleasant job she had been avoiding could be put off no longer she tethered all the horses next to the wagon then harnessed up one the gentlest the one she had marked for her own trying not to look at the bodies of her former enemies she threw a hitch of rope around their stiffening feet and towed them one by one to a point far beyond the camp leaving them scattered around a tiny cup of a valley like dolls left by a careless child then she returned to the shelter of the wagon and the noncompany of her charges all of that work had taken another precious day she got the girls fed and bundled up in blankets as best she could spending a sleepless night listening to the screams of scavengers when they found the bodies and making sure none of the eleven wandered off somewhere on her own it was possibly worse even than the nights she had spent waiting for the raiders to return in the end it was the horses that gave her the idea of how to move them and what to do afterward vena was a country girl where she came from a horse was a decent dowry for any girl a pair of horses apiece ought to be enough to pay for their care until someone could come get them later she roused six of the girls to enough selfawareness and enerjy that they could cling to the saddlebow of a horseeven if half the time they stared in apathy and the other half wept without ceasing the other five she put in one wagon with the rest of the horses following behind tethered in a long string then she coaxed need into using her magic to find the nearest farm it proved to be a sheepfarmers holding rather than a true farm hidden away in a tiny pocketvalley she would never have found it if not for need to the landowner she told the truthbut cautioned him to tell any other inquirers a tale she and need concocted about a plague that caused death and feeblemindedness killing all the men of a village where she had relatives and leaving only the healthiest of the girls alive she offered him the entire herd of horses save only the one she had chosen for herself to tend to the novices her only other condition was that as soon as possible he was to send a message to the nearest temple of the twins telling what had happened and asking for their aid for the girls as she had expected the offer was more than he could possibly refuse and when need read his thoughts to be certain he would keep the bargain she found no dishonesty winter was an idle time for farmers and herders he had a houseful of daughters and servants to help tend the girls and sons to find wives for it would be no bad thing to have a magetalented girl for a bride for one of his boys such things tended to breed true even if shock made the girl lose her own talent and a man could do much worse than have a wife who could work bits of magic to help protect herself and her home and to enrich the family if she was able to keep practicing hedgewizardry and kitchenwitchery was easy to learn it was having the power to make it work that was granted to only a few she agreed on their behalf that if any of them chose to stay with him and his boys there would be no demands for reparations from the sisterhood then she saddled and mounted her horse and turned back to the hunt they were now weeks not days behind the enemy but he was burdened with wagons and hysterical girls and vena was alone and now ahorse as she turned her mares head back along the trail need finally spoke demonsbane girl why didnt you put that fatuous sheepbrain in his place brides for his sonswhat did he think you were some kind of marriagebroker and where did he ever get the idea any of them would want to live out their lives making herbcharms and tending brats and lambs the sword grumbled on for a while and vena let her the novice had plenty of other things to think about most notably finding the nowcold trail of the rest of the captives it wasnt easy not with two weeks worth of wind and weather eating at the signs but she had the right gear for the job at last sheepskin boots and coat woolen leggings sweater and cotton undertunic and all the provisions and equipment she needed or at least all that she needed until the next encounter but she told herself she wasnt going to think about that until it happened finally she found the track halfmelted prints of hooves and wagonwheels in the snow and need finally finished venting her spleen vena waited for a moment both to be sure she had the trail and to be certain need was talked out look she pointed out after everything those girls have been through one or more of them are bound to change their minds about a life dedicated to high magery and the sisterhood that farmer was trustworthy and kindhearted not a bad thing in a fatherinlaw and the boys were a little rough around the edges but no worse than the lads in my home village you and i can never give back what those girlsour sistershave lost but we can at least give them options need stayed silent for a moment you could be right she finally said grudgingly i dont like it but you could be right vena decided not to tell her that she was having second thoughts herself she doubted shed survive long enough to consider being a farmers wife right now despite this early success she wasnt going to give herself odds on that nyara woke with the sun in her eyes and for a moment her arms and legs still ached with that longago cold her hands expected to encounter those heavy blankets instead of furs and she was exhausted with a phantom weariness that vanished as soon as she realized who she was and where phantom weariness was replaced by real weariness she lay where she was for a moment despite her resolution of the night before to get up early to fish dreamquests did not as a rule leave her tired nor did they leave her feeling a weight of yearsthats because i never took you back so far before need said and it seemed as if the sword was just as tired as her student ive granted you what i seldom grant my bearers now you know the name i had forgotten my name as a human but that wasnt what mattered to nyara suddenly she sat bolt upright and stared at the sword leaning against the wall with a feeling of anger and betrayal you didnt help her she accused you didnt help her at all i did what i could the blade replied calmly i was new to my form and my limitations i had as much to learn as she did but i didnt dare let her know that or her confidence would have been badly undermined ive had a long long time to learn more of magic nyara i didnt know a fraction then of what i know now nyara stared at the sword propped in the corner aghast you mean you did not know what you were doing oh i knew what i was doing i was herding us both into trouble but what else was i going to do there were all those youngsters in danger and if vena and i didnt do something about it nobody would nyara blinked and started to say but thats not f fair no it wasnt not to vena not to me and certainly not to the novices the blades matteroffact attitude took nyara aback she climbed out of her bed of furs as her thoughts circled around something she could not yet grasp need was not cruelnot on purpose at any rate she was driven by expediency and by a dedication to the longer view but she wasnt cruel so what was she trying to say she had sacrificed herself for the bare chance of saving the novices through vena the girl herself had done the same and it was all so unfit was unfair but so was what father did to me what he did to the hawkbrothers what happened to the gryphonslife was unfair she knew that and so did need but shed been complaining about that unfairness a great deal lately very good kitten need said in her mind youve figured that part out i find it a wonder that you can even grasp unfairness knowing so little else in your life besides it i am still working on that it seems inconsistent with what your thricedamned father taught you know this though oftentimes the concept of fairness can be a wall to accomplishing what must be done worrying over fairness can sometimes impede justice and that in itself is not fair nyara nodded as more awareness of needs teaching came to her now let me show you what real unfairness is venna clung with her fingers and toes to the side of the cliff and prayed that heshains thoughtseekers would not find her chapter seven treyvan hydona jerven and lytha darkwind had been struggling for several days now to maintain his dignity his composure and above all the signature tayledras detachment and failing dismally the cause ever and always was elspeth he wondered if all teachers felt like this or if he was particularly blessedor cursedwith a student so intelligent and quick that she threatened to run right over her hapless instructor i cant keep ahead of her and sometimes its all i can do to fly apace with her he confessed to treyvan as he helped the gryphon affix a set of shelves onto a wall of an interior room a bit of work that only small nimble human hands could manage treyvan and his mate had expanded the original lair quite a bit since things calmed down reconstructing the original walls of the building that had stood here then creating several rooms where there had once been only two why the gryphon would want shelves he had no ideabut then there were a great many things he still didnt know about the gryphons for all he knew they collected hertasi carvings and wanted to display them darkwind hammered on a stake and tied support cords from it finished flat boards such as the gryphons had discovered were hard to come by and he wasnt going to waste them on wall mounts he was using a variation on the tayledras ekele construction that of anchored cosupporting lines ssso what iss the trouble the gryphon asked genially you have had much more tutelage than she and access to more knowledge he lounged in the corner and watched darkwind with halflidded golden eyes not out of laziness but because he had just eaten and the gryphons like the raptors darkwind knew so well rested after filling their crops i cant do everything darkwind admitted with a touch of annoyance he shook his hair out of his way and aligned the support he was working on with the others i havent actively worked magic in years and my memory of what to do is a little foggy my magical skills arewellas stiff as muscles get if not exercised regularly and the magegift fades if not used asss any other attribute the gryphon agreed asss in hunting sswordsskill or musssic well mines creaky with disuse darkwind sighed and i cant relearn everything id forgotten and teach elspeth too it was all right l when she didnt know anything about magecraft because i could set her to work on something basic while i practiced something else but nowthat wont work anymore the gryphon stopped in the middle of a lazy stretch and blinked at him claws still extended back arched ssshe isss that quick shes that quick darkwind told him setting the last support firmly into the wall the problem is that her people have made quite a science of mindmagic and shes very good at it although she says she isnt particularly outstanding he snorted either its the one and only time ive caught her being modest or her people are frightening mindmages good enough to stand equal with an adept and in mindmagic there isss enough sssameness to give her a basssisss in true magic treyvan supplied isss there alsso enough sssameness to causse her trouble darkwind wedged the heavy shelf into the supportloops and eyed it critically ignoring the question for the moment how level do these have to be he asked what are they for booksss treyvan replied completing his stretch jussst booksss many of them ssso long asss they do not fall it iss level enough books where is he getting books he sighted along the shelf again it slanted just a bit but not enough for most people to notice or it just might be the uneven stone floor that gave the illusion that it slanted it was hard to tell it would certainly do for bookswherever the gryphons had gotten them and whatever they planned to do with them he couldnt imagine them reading either yes he admitted finally there is just enough that mindmagic has in common with true magic to make her ask me some really difficult questions and to occasionally get her in trouble and thats the problemif shes asking me questions im distracted from polishing my own skills and when she gets into trouble its sometimes difficult to get her out again because i am well rusty ive forgotten most of the specifics its more annoying than anything else at the moment but its going to be dangerous when facing an enemy and how would i explain that to her countrymen im sorry but i seem to have let your princess get killed i hope you have a spare can you not asssk anotherrr adept to train herrr the gryphon asked his crestfeathers erect with interest he sighed put his back to the wall and slid down it to sit braced against the cool stone thats just the difficulty you see i sponsored her as wingsib unless i really get into trouble shes my problem and my responsibility we dont have that many adepts in the first place and frankly none to spare to teach elspeth besides i can just imagine what would happen if she were to pull one of her impertinent little questions on say iceshadow and how would i explain that im sorry but your princess seems to have gotten a bit singed dont worry truly im sure everything will grow back as good as new treyvan scratched meditatively for a moment then said well what of me darkwind frowned not understanding the gryphons question what about you he asked the gryphon coughed and cocked his head to one side it ssseemsss to me that i could train herrr i am masssterrr and my ssskillssss while not adeptclasss arrre quite finely honed and in usssse i am sssurely good enough to ansswer herrr quessstionsss get her out of tanglesss and drill you both anything i cannot deal with you can sssurely anssswer sso long as the child isss not breathing firrre down yourr neck his beak gaped in that familiar gryphon grin besssidess i doubt ssshe will give me asss much backtalk asss sssshe givess you this was the answer to all his problems hed known the gryphon was some kind of mage hed seen it proven and levels were largely a matter of power rather than skill once one reached anywhere near to master would you he said eagerly would you really do that the gryphon made a chirring sound something between a snort and a chuckle i ssssaid that i would did i not of courssse i will it will be amusssing to teach a human again he eyed darkwind speculatively what isss more featherrrless sson i sshall drrrill you asss well i sshall assk hydona to help me darkwind suddenly had the feeling a sparrow must have when caught out in a storm he could bluff elspeth when he didnt know an answer or concoct a spurofthemoment fake that would hold until he recalled the real answer he wouldnt be able to do that with treyvan and what was more by the glint in treyvans eye the gryphon knew hed been doing exactly that on the other hand he needed the drill badly and treyvan was the only one likely to offer he didnt like to go to the other mages and beg for their help many of them were working themselves into the ground first shielding then trying to heal the heartstone the rest now that the rift between mages and nonmages had been dealt with were often working the borders with the scouts thanks to them there were proper patrols and reasonable work shifts and the scouts were no longer spread so thin that if one of them were ill or injured it meant a gaping hole in their border coverage those holes were how falconsbane had gotten in and out of their territory at his leisure but that meant there was no one darkwind really wanted to ask to help him retrain except starbladebut there were too many things between starblade and he that had yet to be resolved besides starblade had task enough in simply being healed there isss ssomething more about elssspeth iss there not treyvan asked the gryphons perceptiveness was a constant source of annoyance for darkwind it was impossible to be selfindulgent around them you have feelingsss beyond the ssstrictly necesssarrry sssomethinghmmperrsssonal he flushed not really he replied more stiffly than he would have liked im attracted to her of course but that would happen with any beautiful young woman that became my pupil its a natural occurrence in the studentteacher relationship when both student and teacher are young and their ages are close he winced at saying that hed sounded pompous and hed come perilously close to babbling but better that than have treyvan think there was more between them of coursse treyvan said blandly too blandly he could hardly take exception to that he could suspect that treyvan was teasing him but he could prove nothingwhich was of course exactly what treyvan wanted so long as darkwind couldnt prove a real insult the gryphon could tease all he wanted crazy gryphon treyvan and his sense of humor he thought sourly hed laugh at his own funeral anyway he continued as if treyvan had said nothing at all with you drilling her that wont come up i will be too busy with my learning as will she and i sincerely doubt she will have any interest in you as a uhm i wouldnt worry about it if i were you oh treyvan replied a definite twinkle in his eyes i wont darkwind gritted his teeth treyvan was trying to annoy him and there was no point in letting the gryphon know he was succeeding that would only encourage him and after all treyvan had put up with plenty of harassment from darkwinds bondbird vree the forestgyre had a fascination for treyvans crestfeathers and attempted to snatch them any time he had the chance no matter how often or forcefully darkwind warned him off sometimes much to treyvans discomfort he succeeded in getting a claw on them too once when treyvan was in molt hed even managed to steal one i suppose i can put up with a little teasing unlike vree treyvan is at least not snatching at body parts in his joking but he would rather that treyvan had chosen another subject for the teasing besides his feelings toward elspethhydona hissed and clacked her beak to get elspeths attention darkwind ignored her for he had learned that treyvan would use any moment of distraction to send lances of carefully tempered power at the hawkbrothers shields and treyvan was watching him very carefully without seeming to the advantage of the placement of the eyes on gryphon heads they had excellent peripheral vision a full threequarters of a circle and sharper than darkwind could believe despite treyvans comment about asking his mate darkwind had not expected that both gryphons would show up to tutor them but when he and elspeth traveled across the passthrough to the practice ground four wings not two lifted to greet them hydona hass more patience than i treyvan had said jovially and ssshe hasss taught morrre than i ssshe thought ssshe might be a better teacherr for elssspeth his eyes glinted that leavesss me morre time to tutorr you hydona trilled tutorr orr torturrre what about the young ones darkwind had asked worriedly trying to ignore hydonas remark the heartstone still isnt safe for little ones to be near even with all the shielding weve put on it they are at the lair treyvan had replied the evening of the celebrrration had an unexpected outcome the kyree torrl hasss decided to ssstay with usss to aid yourr folk in ssscouting and hisss young cousin rris arrrrived yesssterday to join him rris watches the younglingsss he ssays he isss glad to do ssso treyvan grinned hugely it ssseemss that we are sssuch thingss of legend that it isss worrth it to him to be the brrrunt of the younglingsss gamesss to be nearrr usss darkwind could only shake his head the kyree were large yes but by no means the size of a halfgrown gryphlet lytha and jerven could bowl him over without even thinking about it they would certainly give that poor kyree plenty of reasons to regret his offer i can just imagine the games theyll get up to pounce and chase scream and leap nocansendrrisrumpover tailunless of course rris was very agileor very clever if the former he could probably dodge the worst of their roughandtumble games and if the latter he could think of ways to keep them out of mischief without getting flattened i hope this rris has a great deal of patience my friend was all he had said your offspring are likely to think hes some kind of living tumbletoy treyvan had only laughed think on torrl he had replied young rrisss isss asss clever asss hisss cousin and verrry good i am told with younglingsss all will be well then darkwind had no more time to worry about the wellbeing of the brave young kyree who had taken on the task of tending jerven and lytha for their father launched him straight into a course of practice aimed at bringing him up to full and functional adept status in the shortest possible period of time it was aggressive and treyvan proved to be a merciless teacher interestingly enough he proceeded very differently from the way that darkwind had initially been taught in his years of learning before he had mastered the basics of manipulating energies and shielding then learned the offensive magics then the defensive but the first thing that treyvan drilled him in were the masterlevel defensive skills as now he was constructing a structure of shields onionlike in their layering while treyvan watched for any sign of weakness in them and attacked at that point the object was to produce as many different kinds of shields as possible so that an enemy who might not know every kind of shield a tayledras could produce would be defeated by one perhaps the third fourth or fifth the outermost was not so much shield as misdirection it bent the mental eye away from the wearer and refracted the distinct magical image of the mage into resembling his surroundings as if there was no one there beneath that was a shield that deflected energy and beneath that one that countered it yet deeper was one that absorbed energy and transmuted it passing it to the shield beneath it which simply resisted like a wall of stone and reflected the incoming energy back out through the previous layer it was the transmutational shield that was giving darkwind trouble it would absorb treyvans attacks right enough but it wasnt transmuting the energylances into anything he could use hold treyvan said finally as hydona lectured elspeth on the need to establish a shield and a grounding point first before reaching for nodeenergy he had been trying to get that through her head for the past two days finally with someone else telling her exactly the same thing it looked as if she was going to believe that he was right no shes going to believe the information was right he chided himself thats whats important not the source of the information if hearing it from hydona is what it takes then fine so long as she learns it now and not the hard wayno one in ksheyna had ever learned that lesson the hard way not within living memory but there were tales of a mage of kvala who had seized a node without first establishing a grounding point and discovered that the node was rogue nodes could go feral flaring and dying unpredictably without the stabilizing focus of a heartstone the node he seized had done just that it flared and with no ground point to hold him and shunt the excess away and no shield to shelter him he had burned up on the spot becoming a human torch that burned for daysor so the tales said in fact it had probably happened so fast that the mage had no notion of what had gone wrong but whether the tales were true or not it was still a horrible way to die maybe all she needed was for it to be a female that taught her he thought watching as her grave eyes darkened and lightened according to her mood her weapons teacher the talesedrinkin that she worships so is a female and so is her oldest friend and her companion is female maybe she just responds better to female teachers a reasonable thoughtthwap a mental slap across the side of his head woke him to the fact that he was supposed to be working not woolgathering once again treyvan had taken advantage of the fact that his attention had wandered to deliver a stinging reminder of what he was supposed to be doing damn you gryphon that hurt with his ears still ringing he turned his attention back to his teacher whose twitching tail betrayed his impatience if you do not pay heed i ssshall do more than ssswat you darrrkwind treyvan warned him that isss the third time today your thoughtsss have gone drrrifting he grunted an assent without mentioning that each time elspeth had been the cause of his witwandering he neednt have bothered treyvan brought it up on his own can you not worrrk about a young female without having yourrr mind drrift he asked acidly humanss alwaysss in sseasson darkwind felt his neck and ears heat up as he flushed thats not it he protested treyvan cut his protests short it mattersss not the gryphon growled now watch thiss time thisss is how the transsssmutation ssshould look to you crreate the texturrre sso pussh it frrrom you asss if rrreleasssing a brreath halt it herrre frrom yourr body darkwind blotted everything out of his mind except the sense of the powerflows and the magic that the gryphon manipulated as treyvan built the proper shield step by slow tiny step darkwind finally saw what he had forgotten treyvan had woven a complex texture into the shield in one area directing power only in and in another place filtering it out giving him two power flowsone from himself the other ready to take in energy directed at him by an enemy and transmute it that was the problem hed only allowed for the single powerflow from himself the energy coming in from outside took over the field that was supposed to channel power from himself into the first shield backpressure as in a wellspring with only the inevitable leaks to relieve that pressure once there since it wasnt shieldenergy it eddied or stood idleor worse waited to react with another color of magicin all cases more than frustrating potentially deadly in fact it never reached the transmutational part of the working so it never channeled to the last shield mentally cursing himself he rebuilt his shields this time the transmutational shield worked correctly giving him two shields for the personalenergy cost of one at least for as long as the enemy chose to sling spellweapons at him now you know how thisss ssshield can be countered yess treyvan asked when the shields had been tested and met with his approval two wayswell three if you count just blasting away with more energy than the shunt can handle darkwind replied the first is to find the shuntwhere hes groundedand use it to drain energy out of the shieldhooking into it yourself and taking the energy back if that happens the shield starts draining the mage thats holding it if you do that fast enough all his shields will collapse before he can react treyvans crestfeathers rose with approval and attack where the mage isnt expecting it he said that can be one of two thingsattacking through the shunt which is structurally the weakest part of the shield or attacking with something else entirely he thought for a moment at this point if i were the attacker id go for something completely unexpected like a physical attack send vree in to harass him toss an illusion at him demonsbanethrow a rock at him to make him lose his concentration treyvan laughed good nowcould you have done what the sssword need did could you now transssmute the energy of an attack and sssplit it he thought about that for a moment thought about exactly what the sword had done yes he said finally but only by doing what she didholding no shields at all between the attack and the transmutationlayer that might work for a thing made of metal and magic but it would be pretty foolhardy for a fleshandblood creature treyvan nodded neverrrthelesss he said pointing a talon at darkwind it did worrk and ssso long asss falconsssbane kept launching magical attackss against herr it continued to worrrk only if he had ssseen what ssshe wass doing and launched a physical attack or ssome otherr type of magic would he have failed he ssufferrred frrrom sshort sssight darkwind countered that statement with one of his own we were lucky he said flatly falconsbane was overconfident and we were damned lucky i have the feeling that if hed had the time to plan and come in force he could have taken us all the shinain and maybe even their goddess on and won treyvan hissed softly your thoughtsss marrch with mine featherlesss ssson he said after a pause and it isss in my mind that we ssshall not alwayss be ssso lucky in mine too darkwind nodded toward elspeth and tried to lighten the mood for one thing that woman seems to attract trouble the gryphons beak snapped shut and he nodded yesss sshe doess sshe hass attracted you forr one ssso let usss sssee if you can conssstruct thossse ssshields corrrectly a ssecond timeand thisss time hold them againssst me elspeth paid careful attention to every hissed word hydona spoke finding it unexpectedly easy to ignore the fact that her teacher was a creature larger than the biggest horse she had ever seen with a beak powerful enough to snap her arm off at a single bite even with a motivation to pay attention such as that the gryphon already made more sense than darkwind did neither she nor the gryphons were native speakers of the tayledras tongue hydona was being very careful about phrasing things in unambiguous terms that darkwind likely thought were intuitively obvious another case for being careful about what you assume in translation interesting that is a consideration i would expect of a courttrained person not a creature like hydona hydona related everything she taught elspeth to the mindmagic elspeth already knew that made a lot more sense than darkwinds convoluted explanations of powerflows and energyfluxes they seemed clear to him apparently and seemed to make sense except when he tried to fake she had seen bluffs in enough court functions to recognize the signs hydona clearly detailed making an anchor point and shielding for instance that was a lot like grounding and centering and was done for many of the same reasons when put that way elspeth stopped subconsciously resisting the idea of having to effectively doubleshield once against mental intrusions and once against magical attacks the other thing that made sense was that hydona had pointed out the sword need had done all that for her the sword was in itself a permanent anchor point radiating a seemingly ungraspable power into the earth forever acting as a ground for the bearer it was bonded to need had shields on it that hydona doubted were under conscious control anymoreif they ever had been she seemed to think that they hadnt been that they were some part of the sword itself before the spirit came to reside in it so that was how elspeth had managed to work magic without all the preparations the hawkbrothers and their large friends deemed necessary the precautions had been taken they simply hadnt been taken by her and now that need was no longer in elspeths possession elspeth was going to have to learn how to do everything need had done so that she could manage for herself with an ironic smile she thought how easily need could have become less a sword and more a crutch oh need would have forced her to learn it all anyway the only reason need had aided her for as long as she had was because they had been in something of an emergency situation in all probability need would have insisted on her learning to fend for herself as soon as there had been some breathing room obediently she watched as hydona led her through the steps of anchoring and shielding then practiced until they came easily first feeling the stable point in the powerflows about her and setting mental hooks into it then erecting a shield against mageenergies that was remarkably similar to mental shields hydona drilled her over and over and after a while the exercises stopped being something foreign and started feeling like secondnature best of all they took about the same effort it took to stay on a galloping horse she was a little surprised by how quickly it all came to her but hydona said nothing of it she seemed to think it was only natural now the gryphon said after shed repeated the patterns until she was weary of them and thought she could do them in her sleep here isss when you rrreach for powerrr when you arrre ssafe in yourrr protectionsss and anchored against fluxesss now there isss a leyline to the eassst of you a young one eassily tamedbut you do not know that ssso assssume you know nothing searrch for it when you find it rrreach forr it asss need ssshowed you and ssample it sssee if you can usse it orrr if it isss too ssstrong forr you she closed her eyes found the line hydona spoke of and reached for it dipping the fingers of an invisible hand into it as if it were a kind of stream and she wanted to drink of it she tasted it tested the textures the strength of the flow and the complexity it was very tame and bland not terribly strong kind of boring in fact compared with the rush of power she had gotten when shed tapped into the node under the gryphons ruins for the first time i cant do much with this she thought and began to trace it out to whatever node it was linked into without thinking twice about doing so she felt her skull resound with a hard mental thwap her eyes snapped open and she rocked back on her heels for a moment staring at the female gryphon aghast what did you do that for she cried angrily i was just you were jussst about to find yourrr way to the hearrtssstone hydona interrupted and that little child would have eaten you whole and ssspit out the piecessss a trrrained and warry adept can stand againssst it but not you she licked her lips and blinked i thought the heartstone was shielded i thought nobody but adepts could reach it now isnt that what all the mages have been working on since we got rid of falconsbane and ssso it isss hydona nodded but you arrre within the prrotectionsss of the practice ground the ssshieldsss do not extend herrre so that those who arrre trrrying to heal the ssstone can rrreach it without dissrrupting thossse sssame ssshieldsss so the adepts healing the stone come here to work she asked hydona nodded her voice rose with alarm if the shields didnt extend here isnt it dangerous for us to be here then i mean what if we interfere with whats going on therrre isss no one herrre at the moment hydona said calmly arrre you afrrraid reluctantly she nodded after all shed heard about the heartstone and how dangerous it was in its current shattered state she wasnt very happy being somewhere that had no protections against it the idea made her skin crawl a little with uneasiness good hydona said with satisfaction you ssshould be afrrraid verrry afrrraid it isss nothing to disssregarrd thisss ssstone it isss lightning harrnesssed but barrrely in itsss perfect sstate she refolded her wings and settled her tail about her forelegs now why werrre you wanderrring off like that she shuffled her feet uncomfortable beneath the gryphons dark penetrating gaze ithere wasnt much power there she stammered i wanted more than that i mean there was hardly enough there to do anything with morrre than you think hydona scolded gently tcha you arrre a child who hasss alwaysss had a forrrtune at herrr beck and hasss never learrrned how to make do with less the gryphon shook her massive head and the scent of cinnamon and musk wafted over elspeth you musst learrrn to budget yourrrssself she cocked her head sideways and watched elspeth with a knowing eye the mossst effective mage i know neverr rrossse above journeymanclassss he wasss effective becaussse he knew exactly what hisss limitsss werrre and he did everrrything possible inssside thossse limitssss he neverrr perrrmitted lack of powerrr to thwart him he sssimply found waysss for lesss powerrr to accomplisssh the tasssk that was the harshest speech shed ever gotten from hydona the closest the gryphon had ever come to giving her a scolding although the thwap a few moments ago was a great deal like one of keros lovetaps she rubbed her temple and considered the similarities between the two teachers delivered for your own good kero used to say well this is another kind of weapons work i suppose and what was it kero always says on the practice ground the weaponsmaster is the one true god and this is the same as the practice ground i guess she nodded meekly and hydona seemed satisfied at least for the moment ssso do asss i told you in the firrssst place find the line tesst it and link with it hydona sat back on her haunches and gave her a steady narrowedeyed look that elspeth interpreted as meaning she would not permit the slightest deviation from her orders so with a purely mental sigh she found the tame boring line of power again and tapped into it the amount of energy possible to get from a source so slight was hardly more than a trickle compared to the sunlike fury that was the heartstone this time she made the connection without even closing her eyes the relationship between the inner world of power unseen by physical eyes and the outer world no longer confused her part of that was simply all the work shed done with farsight over the years another instance of how working with mindmagic made work with real magic much easier ah but as hydona pointed out less power does not mean less effective power mindmagic is still strong if there are more heralds with the magegift after this i should be able to teach them in a reasonable length of timenot like the six or eight years it takes quentens students to become journeymen i could just work from their own mindmagic gifts outward when she finished her assigned task sealing the connections with a bit of a flourish hydona nodded with satisfaction good now channel the powerrr to me her beak opened in a hint of amusement at elspeths dropped jaw what you did not know sssuch a thing wasss posssible becaussse it isss not posssible in mindmagic ah but it isss possible in healing isss it not asss there are ssssimilaritiesss there are diferencesss asss well and those differencesss might kill you trrrussst yourrr intuition but neverrr asssume anything what hydona did not saybecause she didnt need towas that elspeth neednt think she knew everything just because she was wellversed in the magic of her own people all right so im a bonehead she reached a tentative hand to hydona and was relieved to find the gryphons shields down and hydona waiting for her touch she had no idea how to proceed with someone who was uncooperative or worse unable to cooperate it took several false starts before she was able to create a channel to hydona without losing the first one to the leyline but once she had it set up she was able to redirect the power without too much difficulty she was tempted to set up a channel from hydona to the line directly but she had a notion that hydona would be able to tell the difference and that the gryphon would not be amused hydona broke the contact and elspeth maintained the channel without drawing any more energy from it while she waited for the gryphons next instructions ssso you can ssseek sssample channel and sssend now we sssshall practice all of thossse hydona said genially we sssshall prrractice and prrractice until you can ssseek sssample channel and sssend underrr any circumssstancesss elspeth smothered a groan and broke her contact with the leyline neatly letting its newlyfreed power wisp away harmlessly this was starting to get frustrating hydona sounded more and more like kero with every passing moment if she starts being any more like kero the next thing shes going to do is quote a shinain proverb at me it isss sssaid thatwhatever isss prreparred forr neverrr occurrrssss hydona quoted that isss an ancient kaledain sssaying ssso let usss prrepare you for finding yourrrssself alone sssick wounded exhaussted ssssurrounded by enemiessss and needing powerrr and it will neverrr occurrr yesss elspeth could only sigh later after the gryphons were gone darkwind rubbed eyes that ached and burned with the strain of doublesight and was mildly surprised to find elspeth still there she sat quietly on a stone bench leaning against the curved marble wall of their corner of the practice ground with her eyes closed he wondered if she was waiting for him to show her the way outor just waiting for him he walked up to her and she stared up at him with eyes as tired as his own we should leave elspeth he said carefully uncertain of her temper as weary as she looked the others will be here soon to work on the heartstone and we shall be in the way well be more than in the way if what hydona said is any indication she replied getting slowly to her feet wed be in dangerand a danger to them well i would be anyway like having a toddling baby underfoot on a tourney field nobody would ever hit it on purpose butwell he nodded relieved there you have it truly would you care to come with me to find something to eat she hesitated a moment then shrugged im not hungry though all the more reason that you should eat he told her warningly until you are used to it the manipulating of mageenergies dulls the appetite you must take care that you do not starve yourself she looked at him in surprise and must have seen by his expression that he wasnt joking well thats not such a bad thing if youre on the plump side but hmm there are no fat mages he pointed out as he walked except those who habitually and grossly overindulge themselves those for whom overeating is either a selfindulged vice or a disease manipulating mageenergies also costs one in terms of ones own energies which means that you have just done work wingsib very hard physical work that deceives your own body he led her to the peculiar gatelike construction called a passthrough that led to the practice ground it was yet another way to ensure that the unwary and unready did not intrude on students at practice or the adepts at their work because of the wall about it the grounds could not be seen from outside nor the vale from within they were a place and a time unto themselves and in fact he sometimes wondered if time moved a bit differently there she shook her head as she recovered from the jolt of disorientation that accompanied the transition across the passthrough how do you ever get used to that she asked that kind of dizzy feeling i mean he raised an eyebrow at her we never do he said simply there is a great deal that we never get used to we simply cease to show our discomfort she said nothing but he caught her giving him a speculative look out of the corner of his eye for his part he was more concerned with finding one of the hertasirun kitchens before his temper deteriorated hunger did that to him and he couldnt always predict what would set him off when his temper wore thin he didnt want to alienate her the opposite was more like it but he often felt as if he was dancing on eggs around her he wondered if she felt the same around him there was no cultural ground that they could both meet on and yet they had a great deal in common the kitchen was not a kitchen as such just a common area a room in one of the few groundlevel structures that the hertasi kept stocked with fresh fruits bread smoked meat and other things that did not spoil readily those hawkbrothers who either did not have the skill or the inclination to prepare their own meals came here to put together what they pleased the fare was not terribly varied but it was good and at the moment darkwind had no inclination to make the trek to his own ekele for food not while his stomach was throttling his backbone and complaining bitterly he indicated to elspeth that she should help herself and chose some fruit and bread a bit of smoked meat and a handful of dosent roots that had a cheesy taste and texture when raw they found a comfortable spot to sit in an outoftheway clearing and fell to without exchanging much more than nods so what was it that hydona tutored you in he asked when the edge was off his hunger babysteps she made a face this is childish of me i know but she had me tapping into a very lowpower leyline over and over until she was certain that i could handle it in my sleep but i was working the node under the lair with need and she knows that so you wonder why is she insisting that you work with minimal energy he replied trying very hard to see things through her eyes elspeth nodded and nibbled a chasem fruit tentatively he licked the juice of another chasem from his fingers and tried to answer as he thought hydona would firstly there are some sources of power that are much too dangerous even for a single adept to handle yes even here in our own territory i mean besides the heartstone he nodded at her look of surprise there are pools of tainted magic like thinroofed caves left by the mage wars difficult to see from the surface and deadly to fall into that is what a healing adept must deal with and at the moment we have none there are even perfectly natural sources too strong for one adept to handle by himselfany node with more than seven leylines leading into it for instance or rogue lines which fluctuate in power levels unpredictably add in the tendency of lines to move and you find the only way to use these sources is with a group of adepts each one supporting the others each doing a relatively small amount of work so they have a reserve to deal with emergencies i can see why she doesnt want me to just tap into whatever powerful source i see elspeth replied impatiently but why is she insisting that i only work with a bare trickle of power when energy is everywhere ah but it isnt he replied happy to at last discover the misconception that was the source of her impatience there is a limit on all gifts no matter how powerful there is a limit on how far you personally can farsee yes she nodded slowly and focused on him intently paying very close attention to his words and when you mindspeak you can only do so within a given distance true he continued well power is not everywhereor rather great power is not everywhere there are places where there are not even weak leylines for a days ride in any direction there are places where even the nodes are weaker than the line you worked with today we are tayledras elspeth and we are enjoined by the goddess to cleanse these lands of magic to that end we concentrate it here the energy level is unnaturally high in and around a vale even one as damaged as this one and unnaturally high in and about the lands you call the pelagir hills which we call the uncleansed lands she swallowed the bite she had begun with a bit of difficulty so youre saying that when i get home i might find that theres no magic energy to work with she looked horrified and he hastened to assure her no i am saying that when you return you may find you have lower levels of energy available than you have here or the power may be there but buried deeply he ate the last of his fruit that is why there are schools of mages who build up reservoirs of power that are available to the masters and adepts of those schools and that is why bloodmages build power for themselves by exploiting the pain and death of others so you must know how to work subtly you must learn that raining down blows with pure power is not always the correct response it was not with some of falconsbanes creatures that you witnessed she shook her head whether stubbornly or for some other reason he couldnt tell listen he said hydona believes you are doing well once you have mastered the fainter sources of power and in using the energy you yourself have stored within you she and treyvan wish us all to take our places on the border she perked up at that and he smiled to see her interest really she exclaimed ive felt so useless i know you have to learn theory before you practice anything but but you came here to become a weapon against the enemy of your land i know he replied now pleasei know that you are impatient but believe me it is better to use little power rather than too much using a poleaxe to kill small game destroys the game thoroughly rendering it useless so it is with magic too much can attract things you do not wish to have to deal with as a dead creature can attract things more dangerous than it was to scavenge upon it master the subtlety hydona tries to teach you there will be time and more than time for the greater magics he watched her face she seemed thoughtful and he hoped she believed him because whether she knew it or not her life depended on believing himand sooner than she might think for hydona had not meant that suggestion in jest that both of them take up a scouts position on the border of ksheyna when they did that there were no longer any shields any protections or any rules it would be only themselves and the gryphons and it might well be that there were things out there that were more powerful and deadly than mornelithe falconsbane chapter eight so now im a scout on the border of the tayledras territories in the pelagirs me who never even rode circuit mother would have a cat elspeths heart raced every time a bird called an alarm or a stray twig broke even though she knew very well that potential danger was likely to be upon them long before there were any such warnings gwena was jumpy too and that didnt help her nerves any she had all her shields down toward gwena and whatever her companion felt she felt and vice versa or was it that gwena was jumpy after all the companion was ill at ease but it didnt quite have the feeling of nerves all right she said suddenly suspicious what are you hiding this time i wasnt hiding itat least not from you the companion temporized ive been keeping something from the others well maybe i have and maybe i haventi mean i dont know how much theyve guessed about cymry and me so i wasnt really hiding it from you but elspeth choked and coughed to cover it gwena dear you can stop babbling all right id say the tayledras know plenty about you two from the way darkwind dances around you and they arent telling me about what they know either so you might as well let this great secret out whatever it is because even if i dont know about it they probably do she couldnt hide her resentment at that and didnt try it was obviouswould have been plain even to a childthat the hawkbrothers considered the companions something quite special according them more reverence than they even got at home in valdemar but the tayledras wouldnt discuss the companions at all without one of them being present as if they were determined not to offend the companions or reveal something they shouldnt and even if there was nothing to this dancing about the bushes it drove elspeth to distraction well gwena said slowly i would have to tell you soon anyway it is not really all that complicated now that you know how to channel mageenergies and you know how to feed someone else and be fed in turnwellcan feed you elspeth was past being surprised she simply nodded and of course it would have been no use telling me this before i had the skill i know she closed her eyes and counted to ten very very carefully you arent keeping anything else back are you no gwena replied in a subdued voice no not really i can feed you if you need it but i subject to the same limitations you are except elspeth counted to ten a second time except gwena waited a long time and elspeth sensed that she was choosing her words very carefully except that you and i are a special pairing so special that distance doesnt matter between us thats all imdifferent that way its like a lifebonded pair working together ask darkwind about that some time if you like there are things a pair can do that even two adepts working together cant do a vague memory fluttered at the back of her mind something about a dark windy night the night when gwena had chosen her but the memory escaped before she could grasp it and she gave up trying to get it back after a fruitless moment of concentrating i wont say im unhappy to hear that she told gwena sincerely if things ever go badly for us you and i might need that edge idont suppose this means youre a mage toodoes it oh no gwena replied her mindvoice bright with relief no not at all i can just tap into nodes energylines and fields all companions can just most of them cant use it for more thanoh the usual healing themselves quickly extended endurance and running faster than a horse can and they certainly cant feed their chosen thats why were white you knowask darkwind about nodeenergy and bleaching she sat up straighter and looked up in the tree above her at darkwind who was taking the treeroad except that right now he was just sitting letting vree do his scouting for him before they all moved on to another spot on their patrol darkwind she whispered he looked down at her but did not give her the hand signal that indicated she should be quiet gwena says i should ask you about nodeenergy and bleaching she says thats why companions are so white because they use nodepower to increase speed and endurance she shook her head still trying to figure it out but darkwind seemed to get the point immediately his eyes lit up and he grabbed the branch beneath him he swung down off his branch perch like a rope dancer to land lightly beside her so that is the piece of the puzzle that i have missed he said cheerfully i think you need not fear lack of nodes and power in your land if all your companions are able to tap them to enhance their physical abilities that must mean that there is no scarcity of mageenergy well that was a great weight off her mind about bleaching she prompted he tugged at his own hair and she noticed that white roots were starting to show and that the color had faded to a dull tan use of nodeenergy gradually bleaches a mage the colormaking dies in skin hair and eyes and the color that is already there is leeched away i do not lie when i say that magery changes a person soyour companions use nodeenergy and thus are blueeyed silvercoated grayhooved silverhooved gwena said with dignity he chuckled softly and tapped her nose if you insist my lady he turned back to elspeth my hair is not white because as a scout i dye it tayledras all live with nodeenergy whether we are mages or no so nonmages bleach as well mages are silverhaired usually in their fifth year of practice any other member of the clan will have made the change at oh thirty summers or thereabouts even with dye i must renew the color every few days now that i am a mage again elspeth could only cast her eyes upward its like continuous sun on them then no wonder dye wont take on them she said the gods know weve tried often enoughyou know its damned hard to disguise a big white horse sorry gwena put in cant help it in a tradeoff between endurance and the rest of it and being unable to disguise them i think ill take the endurance elspeth said as much for gwenas ears as darkwinds and for gwenas ears only ill take you just the way you are oh great sneak and felt gwenas rush of pleasure much like a pleasantly embarrassed flush he shrugged it is the choice i would make besides now that you are a mage you may make her seem any color you choose by illusion before she could answer that he was back up in the tree again swarming up the trunk like a squirrel and hooking the branches above him with the peculiar weapontool he kept in a sheath on his back she still didnt see how he could possibly climb that quickly even with the spikepalmed climbing gloves he wore humans shouldnt be able to climb like that she was about to ask him what was going on when he gave her the hand signal indicating that she should remain quiet she and gwena froze statue still trusting to the bushes they sheltered in to keep them from sight she didnt dare let down her shields to probe about her darkwind had warned her of the danger of that and after hearing more about mornelithe falconsbane and the creatures he had commanded she was inclined to listen to him and believe but she was free enough to use every other sense and she did at first she couldnt tell that there was anything at all out of the ordinary but then she realized that the forest was a little too quiet no birdcalls no wind stirring the branches nothing but the little ticks the red and golden leaves made as they fell elspeth came the tentative mental touch as soft as the caress of a feather vree has found someone i sense only a void which means that there is someone inside a shield where vree sees a twolegged creature darkwind had told her that he would use mindspeech only if he had determined that an enemy could not hear it and had explained that he would test with a quick mental probe of his own too swift to fix on she had wanted to object but it was his land and he was used to scouting it she had to assume he knew what he was doing and evidently he didwere going to have to work out what i should do if someone ever does catch a probe and lock horns with you she interjected sending a mental picture of stags in full battle a rush of chagrin accompanied his reply you are right butnot now no she agreed not now what do you want me to do should i try a probe are the gryphons going to get in on this not unless there is no other choice he replied firmly we need to keep their existence as quiet as possible there are surely others besides falconsbane who might covet them or the small ones and you may try a mindmagic probe but i think you will encounter the same shields as i have no you and i will confront and warn him if he does not heed the warning we will deal with him he broke off his link with her so suddenly that she was afraid that something had locked him in mental battle after all but then a heartbeat later his mindvoice returned there is an additional complication he said dryly she looked up to find him looking down at her with a face full of irony it seems our intruder is a changechild her first thought had been it must be nyara her second thought had been that it couldnt be nyara but that it must be another of her fathers creatures running wild with falconsbane gone she tried a mental probe and discovered that just as darkwind had said the creature had very strong shields well beyond her ability to counter so the only way to learn anything about it was to confront it as she and darkwind watched the intruder from their respective hidingplaces she knew all of her guesses about it had been wrong she didnt know whether to be relieved that this interloper was not their nyara or not if it had been falconsbanes daughter the situation between herself and darkwind would have been complicated enormously her own instincts warred with her on the subject she trusted nyara to a limited extent and she certainly felt that the changechild had been greatly wronged and abused butbut nyara was incredibly potently sexually attractive she couldnt help herself elspeth would have to have been blind not to see that darkwind had wanted her as much as skif had and that if anything had kept them from becoming intimate it wasnt lack of attraction she suspected that his own innate suspicion lack of opportunity and perhaps something on nyaras part had kept him from playing the role of lover as it was that night before dawnfire had returned to them trapped in the body of her bondbird it had been skif not darkwind who had taken that role and perhaps guilt had kept darkwind at arms length guilt that kept him from taking a new lover when his former love was a captive confined to a birds body by the temptress father but falconsbane was dead or the next thing to it and dawnfire was out of reach of any of them that left him free and if he encountered nyara before skif did would he be able to stand against temptation a second time especially if nyara were to make overtures knowing men she didnt think so but at the same time discovering that this stranger was not nyara was a disappointment however brief their acquaintance had been elspeth liked nyara and felt a great deal of sympathy for her and she sometimes spared a moment to worry about her out there in the wild lands that ksheyna no longer held with a magesword who might not even like her she had few or no provisions no shelter against the coming winter unless she had somehow found or made onewell this wasnt the time to worry about their errant changechild not with another standing on ksheyna lands within ksheyna bordersand by the blood on its hands and the circle about its feet one who was up to no good elspeth had done enough hunting in her time not to be sickened by the blood of a butchered deer what made her ill were the fact that it was a dyheli that had been slain and the signs that the butchery had taken place before it was dead not after bloodmagic wasnt that what darkwind and quenten both mentioned but wouldnt talk about well here it wasa bloodmageand now that she knew what to look for she sensed the power that the mage had drawn into himself as a result of his work it wasnt power she could have used under any circumstances in fact it made her a little nauseous to brush against it just long enough to figure out what it was but it was power and she had a notion that the death of a thinking reasoning creature like a dyheli would have given this mage four times the strength that a deer would have perhaps more depending on how long it had suffered easy power easily obtained from a source you can find anywhere and if youre sadistic by nature a source that gives pleasure when exploited no wonder ancar is attracted to it if nyara was feline in nature this creature was serpentine as he moved about disposing of his victim he glided rather than walked and many of his motions had a bonelessness to them that made her shiver in an atavistic reaction to the evocation of snake odd the hertasi dont do that to me and they arent half as human i wonder why this thing does what exposed skin she sawmostly hands and a glimpse of cheekgleamed in the late afternoon light with a kind of matte reflectivity that hinted at hard shiny scales he dressed for deep cold rather than the autumnal chill of the season heavy leather boots thick hose a furlined tunic and cloak and a heavy velvet shirt beneath the tunic the colors were curious a strange dappled golden brown shading into deep orangecolors that blended surprisingly well into the foliage whatever else he was this changechild was canny if he lay unmoving in the heart of a thicket no one would ever see him the changechild looked up at the first rustle of leaves and froze in a combatready crouch darkwind dropped out of the branches like a great hawk coming to land his knees flexed and his hands in front of him wary and ready to launch into an attack or defense as the need arose the creature faced her fully now and she saw that beneath the hood of his cloak his face was curiously flat with a thin lipless mouth and unblinking eyes as round as marbles he straightened but did not relax his wary pose neither did darkwind you trespass the hawkbrother said clearly and slowly in the most common of the tradetongues used hereabouts you trespass upon the lands of the tayledras ksheyna and you pollute those lands with blood needlessly spilled that thin mouth stretched in what might have passed for a smile in any other creature he straightened with arrogant selfassurance not needlessly he said and who or what are you to tell me what i may or may not do tayledras ksheyna darkwind replied flatly these are our lands we do not permit this you will depart taking your filth with you the mouth stretched a little more and the creatures hands flexed a little what run from a single foe i think not he made no gesture but the circle he had drawn about his feet in blood flamed with sullen powerand horribly the disemboweled dyheli on the ground beside him heaved itself to its feet it stood swaying a little a gaping hole where its belly should have been its eyes red with that same sullen power and a dull glow about its hooves and horns you are only one the changechild said softly one single hawkbrother is hardly a threat this weak creature was not enough i think you will do to serve me elspeth did not need darkwinds signal to step from concealment with gwena at her side she took up her position near enough to the hawkbrother that they could not easily be separated but distant enough that they would not interfere with each other we are tayledras ksheyna darkwind said firmly but with no hint of anger and you will leave now this time hydona was not around to keep her from using the strongest source of power she could sense and there was a threeline node not more than a furlong from where they stood she tapped into it quickly to her othersight it glowed with healthy green fire and touching it was a pleasant jolt as if she took a deep draught of cold spring water on a hot day she established her link and channeled power to herself and her shields before the stranger had a chance to respond to darkwinds challenge she kept the level of her outermost shield the same so as not to warn him at minimal strength the kind of mageshield a beginner would build but like a paper screen hiding a stone barrier beneath the disguising energies of the first shield was a second and it was linked to the nodepower it was just as well that she did because the changechilds reply was to attack he was no falconsbane but he was no apprentice either he chose his target cleverly launching his initial onslaught against elspeth rather than darkwind perhaps he was deceived by the rudimentary outer shield or perhaps he was under the impression that a female would be less prepared and less aggressive than a male if that was the case he judged wrongly she saw his attack as he launched it a flight of whitehot energydaggers that he flung at her with both hands she anticipated the direction of his attack by his eyesand was ready in time to reflect them straight back at him holding up mirrorshielded hands that doubled the flamebright weapons back on themselves and sent them back on their original path that must have been something of a shock to him for he did not even deflect them properly much less reabsorb them they impacted on his shields splintering silently into a thousand shardsparks and he flinched away before he had a chance to recover from that shock darkwind had launched an attack of his own but not one he likely would have expected he attacked the mages shields with a needlelance of force not the mage himself boring through the protections at their weakest point where some of the energy daggers had impacted the bluewhite lance split the air between them and darkwind held it straight on target despite the changechilds best efforts to shake it off elspeth readied a second attack arrows of lightning but did not launch it holding it in reserve the changechild sent his unliving creature to attack them the shambling bloody thing charged with a speed quite out of keeping with the condition it was in it was halfway to them before elspeth realized that it was an attack but gwena intercepted it like a trained warhorse as if she had dealt with such things all her life she sidestepped the wicked horns neatly and twisted sideways to launch a cruel doublehooved kick with her hind legs as the thing passed that sundered its hips with a meaty thunk and a wet crack the dead thing staggered and went down again and tried to heave itself erect but it could not struggle upright again for its hip and one of its hind legs were broken and would no longer bear its weight at that same instant darkwind penetrated the changechilds shields and elspeth launched the lightningarrows she had been readying targeting them at the hole darkwind had bored and was even now spreading open the first one missed slightly impacting just to one side of the hole splintering as had the mages own energydaggers the second did not miss nor did darkwinds fireball that followed in the arrows wake within the enemys shields and contained by them a storm of utterly silent fireworks erupted the changechild stood frozen for a moment a dark silhouette against a background of coruscating energiesthen he collapsed to the ground as his shields collapsed around him and like the dyheli that had been his victim did not move again they patrolled the border until nightfall and the arrival of summersky the scout that was to relieve them but there wasnt so much as a leaf out of place as they headed homeward toward the vale elspeth found herself very glad that she was riding although hydona had warned her that a mageduel would take far more out of her than she would ever believe she hadnt really understood what the gryphon meant now thoughnow she knew hydona was not only right she had understated the case mostly all that she wanted right now was a soak in one of the hot springs a meal and her bed but besides being weary she was very confused a poor combination all things considered she was dissatisfied with her first foray on ksheynas border certainly there were questions that had not been answered adequately and as she followed in darkwinds wake watching him stride tirelessly along with one hand on treyvans shoulder and folded wing and vree perched on a padded perch on his shoulder she tried to reconcile her mixed emotions it didnt help matters any that from this angle she had such a good view of his tight muscularhydona trilled to herself apparently amused by a private joke the female gryphon walked beside her as her mate strode beside darkwind all of them following a dry streambed back to the vale hydonas head was easily level with elspeths which was a little unsettling since it underscored how very large the gryphon was it was easy to forget that when one often saw them lounging about like overgrown house cats and what arrre you thinking hydona asked as if she were following elspeths thoughts im not sure she said frowning trying to put her emotional reactions into words this isnt the first time ive been in combatit isnt even the first time ive been in magical combat i think we did all right you did hydona confirmed verrry well essspecially forr a beginerrr but asss you pointed out you have had combat experrrience and i expected nothing lesss than competence she cocked her head at elspeth how do you feel you will manage againssst that enemy of yourrrsss she thought for a moment weighing what she could do now with what she knew ancar could produce well providing ancar hasnt acquired an army of mages i should be able to do something about him if i can keep progressing at this rate i mean it isnt easy but so far i havent lost any body parts provided i dont reach an upper limit to my powers in the near future and ancar hasnt learned to tap nodes i know he should be a masterclass mage by now at the very least one should neverrr trrusst an enemy to be placssid what about yourrr perrrforrrmance hydona asked shrewdly how would you rrrate yourssself darkwind and i worked together as a team quite well i think at least we did once he got around to doing something there it was that was what she had been trying to pinpoint as the root of her discontent but that was the problem he gave that damned thing a warning even after we knew it had worked bloodmagic she couldnt keep indignation from creeping into her voice and didnt try kero would have cut the interloper down where he stood filled him full of so many arrows that he would have looked like a hedgehog the oddssss werrre two to one hydona responded thrree to one if we count gwena dont you think that the crrreaturrre dessserrved a fairr warrrning with oddsss like that elspeth shook her head stubbornly no she said flatly and her voice shook a little with intensity i dont we knew he was a bloodmage theres no point in giving something like that a chance to get away or hurt you i sure as havens dont intend to give ancar a shred of warning in fact if i get the chance ill ambush him as always the mere thought of ancar and what he had done made her blood boil the tortures he had inflicted on taliathe rape of his own countrythe hundreds thousands of lives he had thrown awaybut most of all the careless glee he had taken in it allno when she thought of ancar all she could think of was the chance of getting him in her power and shredding him she hated him she hated everything hed ever done and she wanted him dead safely dead so that he couldnt hurt anyone any more ever in fact if there was a way to destroy his very soul shed do it so that there wouldnt even be a chance hed be reborn and start over again as some mages could you arrre angrrry hydona observed this enemy of yourrrsss angersss you im always angry when i think about ancar she replied fiercely i cant help it the mans another falconsbane just as evil and as corrupt and i want him dead as much as any tayledras could ever have wanted falconsbane dead she raised her chin defiantly more than that i want ancars liver on a plate so i can feed it to something vile i not only want to kill him i want to hurt him so that he knows some of what his victims felt i hate him im afraid of him and if there were any way to put him through what he has put others through id take it hydona shook her head with open admonition you arrre too angrrry she said it isss not underrr contrrol thisss angerrr hate will not serrve you herrrre and ssssuch hate sssuch angerrr will weaken you you musst learrrn to contrrrol them orr they will contrrol you thisss i know elspeth grimaced but kept her lips clamped tight on what she wanted to say this wasnt the first time shed heard this particular lecture the first time it had come from darkwind and it just made her angrier how could she not hate the bastard after everything hed done to her friends and her land how could she not hate him after seeing what he had done to his own people how could she not feel enraged at everything he had done and how in havens could an emotion that strong possibly be a weakness it was a contradiction in terms but there was absolutely no point in getting into an argument over it so she elected to keep her thoughts to herself and her tongue on a very short leash until they reached the sanctuary of the vale hydona said nothing more the gryphons left them once they were well within the safe area that was kept under close watch by the mages and full of alarms that would be tripped by strangers by the time they arrived at the shielded entrance to the vale it was already dark and her temper had cooled considerably not that she had changed her mind about anything shed said but she wasnt quite so ready to bite off someones head over it one thing had calmed her down a bit she discovered that gwena felt the same as she didat least about ancar the companion was of two minds about darkwind warning the changechild admitting that there were good reasons for either decision whether to warn or notbut on the subject of ancar of hardorn gwena was in full accord with her chosen the man is a mad dog she told elspeth flatly you dont give a mad dog a chance to bite you and you dont try and cure it you get rid of it before it destroys something you love that backing of her own thoughts on the matter made her feel a bit more secure about her own judgment and that gwena shared her anger eased her own somewhat that helped her temper to cool a lot faster she was quite ready to see the vale long before they actually reached it she discovered somewhat to her surprise that it was no real effort to keep her magesight invokedand since magesight gave her an enhanced owllike view of her surroundings she left it in force it occurred to her as she noted how every living creature and some things that were not alive each bore a faint outline of energy that this must be what companions used for nightsight after all in order to tap into and manipulate magepower you had to be able to see it and since this kind of sight worked equally well by day or night why not use it to give you a nighttime advantage yet another companion power she could explain away which gave her a perverse feeling of satisfaction once they approached the shields surrounding the vale she had to drop the sight the energies there were so powerful they threatened to blind her well thats one reason not to count on it for nightsight and if powerful energies can blind youwell thats something to be wary of hmm and something to keep in mind as a weapon the faint tingle of her skin as they passed the entrance to the vale as if lightning were about to strike her told her that they had crossed the shields and protections standing patient guard over the only way in and out but even if she had not felt that little tingle she would have known they were inside ksheyna vale for in the space of half a heartbeat they went from deep autumn to high summer suddenly her clothing was much too warm gwena stopped as darkwind went on ahead pushing through the foliage draped over the path and vanishing into the shadowy gloom elspeth dismounted unfastened her cloak and draped it over the saddle even then she was a little too warm she rolled up the sleeves of her shirt and opened the collar to the balmy night air heavy with the scent of nightblooming flowers she could not even put a name to this place was the closest thing on earth that she had ever seen to the havens of scripture and sermon too bad i cant bring a little bit of this back with me she thought wistfully fresh fruit and flowers in the dead of winter hot springs and cool pools to bathe intrysting nooks and i can think of plenty of people whod enjoy those nearinvisible servants balmy breezes no wonder vanyel visited ktreva whenever he was exhausted darkwind had said more than once that this vale wasnt even a real showplace of what the hawkbrothers could do ksheyna hed wistfully related was the smallest of the clans even when they were at full strength and the vale was neglected and run down half tended at the very best with no watersculptures no windharpsmore than half the ekeles untenanted and falling to ruinsno one making vinetapestries or flowerfalls no concerts except on the rarest of occasions no artists except ravenwing and the hertasi still elspeth found it beautiful beyond her wildest dreams she could only wonder what the rest of the vales must be like and could the heralds create something like this if only in miniature butshould they she brushed aside a rainbowthreaded dangling vine and wondered about that this vale was a very seductive hedonistic place and many people already thought that the heralds were a bit too randy as it was it was also a place that could encourage sloth she found it very easy to justify sleeping a little later lingering in the hot spring or sitting and watching a waterfall and thinking about nothing at all her footsteps made no sound on the soft sand of the pathway sand that cradled her feet luxuriously everything about this vale hinted at luxurya luxury that few outside the vales enjoyed in fact not even the tayledras cousins the shinain got to enjoy this sort of life for that matter could the heralds really justify making themselves a private paradise when there were so many other things that needed doing a pair of longtailed birds sang sweetly nearby scarcely an arms length from gwena reminding her by their presence that outside the vale the songbirds had long since gone south even if heralds could justify building a place like this there was no way that they could justify lounging about in it the way the tayledras did frolicking in flowerbedecked bowers and lounging in hot pools didnt get circuits ridden too much living like this and shed find herself wasting time designing feathermasks and festivalgarb instead of getting her work done a feeling of moral superiority crept into her thoughts and she let it she led gwena up the path to her loaned ekele and the tiny sculpted hot pool beneath it and felt a bit smug the stone path wound across another just ahead of her and the murmur of voices to her right warned her that several folk were going to cross ahead of her she pausedand her sense of moral superiority vanished as soon as the hawkbrothers came in view elspeth called the first of the group as he caught sight of her we should like the use of your pool the hertasi are cleaning several of the others and yours is the nearest that is prepared may we the magelight that danced over his head revealed the little group of five pitilessly the one in the lead a mage named autumnwing was the best off physicallyand he was worn right down to the bone overextended to say the least his eyes were sunken his skin pale and he trembled with weariness behind him were two of darkwinds scouts both bruised and bloody and supporting them were two more mages who looked in no better shape than autumnwing even as she watched one was redressing a wound that gleamed dark and wet while her partner held the arm steady what in havens happened to you she exclaimed before she could stop herself autumnwing shrugged i have been with the rest on the heartstone it fluxed again today be glad you were not within the vale or we would have conscripted you with or without training but i am not so badthese four met with a pack of changewolves that had cornered one of ksheynas dyheli herds and if it had not been for them there might have been a score of changewolves hounding the vale itself tonight as elspeths eyes widened he added they are very valiant had i been in their place i fear i would have fled the armwounded woman grunted and said fortyarrow fight then she shrugged pplease elspeth stammered feel free to use the spring i was going to find some food shall i bring you back some or send a hertasi with it either replied one of the scouts wearily i could happily eat one of our fallen enemies at this moment raw and without salt ill take care of it if youll pull off the tack gwena told her i can probably find a hertasi before you can in answer elspeth bent to loose the saddlegirth and saddle and blanket slid to the ground as she unbuckled the hackamore and hauled it over gwenas ears the companion vanished into the undergrowth shes gone to recruit you some food elspeth told the others as she bent to retrieve the fallen saddle our thanks autumnwing told her gravely she waited for them to make their way past her then gave them a head start before following in their wake hot pools and life in an eternal summer dont compensate for that she thought balancing the saddle on her shoulder and given the goddess edicts i suppose that even in vales where the heartstone is whole the mages arent sitting around discussing watersculpture so much for moral superiority the vales must seem like paradise itself when theyre out in the pelagir wildsbut one that wouldnt be there to return to if they werent out in those wilds to defend it is valdemar any different to a herald willfully faulty memory caught up with reality this wasnt the first time shed seen hawkbrothers in such poor condition the mages halfhealed starblade among them worked themselves to a thread every day shielding the vale from attack and trying to do something about their heartstone she had her own experience today to show her the hazards of being a scout on the border of the ksheyna territory where every league held new and deadly horrors for that matter shed been an inadvertent witness to the worstsave only deaththat could befall a hawkbrother shed seen what had happened to dawnfire and shed been asked to feed power to kethra one day when the mage that usually augmented the healershaman was too exhausted to continue kethra put starblade through purest agony that day explaining only that this was a necessary part of healing what had been done to him elspeth still felt uncomfortable with the memory although she repeated to herself again and again that it was for the better she still felt like a torturers apprentice for it were pampered we heralds she realized stopping long enough to shift the weight of the saddle to her other shoulder and shake some of the aches out of the arm that had balanced it we have everything we need taken care of for us we live in prepared quarters we have servants picking up after us the hawkbrothers have vales we have our rooms at the collegium they have hertasi we have human servants they have their food and clothing made for them so do we neither of us have physical pleasures that are adequate compensation for what we do she reached the foot of the tree that held her ekele muted voices and faint splashing told her that the pool was occupied she hung her saddle and hackamore over the railing at the bottom of the stair and took herself up the staircase darkwind had pointed out something about the vales that anyone with sufficient magic power could create one they were really just very large hothouses with a magebarrier serving in place of glass nothing terribly exotic about a hothouse she pulled aside the door to her ekele and looked down over the edge of the staircase for a moment kerowyns grueling lessons in strategy and tactics caused her to realize something else as well the ekeles were not simply exotic love nests they were based directly on the quite defensible treetop homes of the tervardi how defensible they were could be demonstrated by the ekeles built outside the vale once the ladder to the ground had been pulled up there was virtually no way to reach them they were warded against fire even by setspells and a transparent resin painted around the tree trunks well past two manheights even the ekele here could be made quite defensible simply by destroying the ropeandtruss suspended staircases making them an excellent place to retreat if the vale defenses were ever breached gwena must have found her hertasi right away for there was a tray of food waiting for her and the herb tea in the pot was still hot and steeping she helped herself to bread and meat and collapsed onto her pillowstrewn pallet my people build walls the tayledras put themselves up in the trees differences in philosophy really more like the heralds than like the ordinary folk of valdemar they think in terms of evasion the way we do rather than the standandfight of the guard she finished as much of her meal as she wanted at the moment and stripped off her filthy bloodspeckled clothing dyheli blood of course and not of herself or darkwind but it was still going to be a major task to get it out she could bleach it with magic of course and she probably would but that was a waste of magepower maybe shed just shift over to scout clothing it was more practical for all this woods running anyway she wrapped a huge towel around herself and descended the staircase heading for the spring occupied or no she was going to use it after all she deserved a good soak as much as her visitors did shed just spent her day doing the same things they had done she had earned a little luxury they all had chapter nine kethra and rris vree stayed calm on darkwinds shoulder after they passed the protections at the entrance to the vale even though until recently the bondbird had not wanted to enter the vale itself the rogue energies of the heartstone had disturbed vree badly and the bondbirds of every other scout as well but the additional shielding on the stone seemed to be having some beneficial effectu are you all right he asked vree just to be sure we can turn around and leave if you want i can hold the scouts meeting at the ekele just as well as here the mages will just have to climb a rope ladder instead of a staircase and theyll all have to squeeze into my rooms i think it would bear their weight vree ducked his head a little and yawned fine happy he replied sleepily then anxiously food soon soon he assured the bird quite soon as soon as we get to the meeting the other scouts would have hungry birds as well the hertast would have provided a selection of whole game birds and small mammals for the raptors along with some kind of meal for the birds bondmates for the first time in a very long time this would be a meeting of daywatch scouts and scoutmages stormcloud would hold a similar meeting for those on nightwatch yesterday darkwind had asked them to gather because there was something important to be addressed he hadnt specified what that was he had been the scouts representative to the ksheyna council during the most divisive period in their historythe period when starblade as directed by mornelithe falconsbane was creating rifts between mages and nonmages to weaken the clan and make it easier for falconsbane to destroy them darkwind had been willing to serve then knowing that no one else had the edge he did having his own father as chief of the council it was a bitter truth that his advantage then was not in currying favor but knowing the others weaknesses he had sometimes been able to manipulate his father equally painful to recall was the fact that starblade had done the same to him but now that he was devoting more time to magecraft he had less time to spend elsewhere the scouts were his friends and charges and with his attentions divided so they could conceivably suffer for it it was time for a change now the question was whether or not he could get the others to agree with him in general the kind of person who became a successful scout was not the kind who enjoyed being in a position of authority or who relished dealing with those who were the best place for the gathering was the central clearing that had been used for the celebration but that was closer to the heartstone than darkwind liked shielding or no shielding so he had asked them all to gather in the smaller clearing beneath the tallest tree in the vale the one that the scouts had used for dancing when he arrived he found a near replication of the celebration except that there was no music or dancing the clothing was more subdued and the conversation level was considerably quieter birds stood on portable perches the exposed roots of trees or in the branches most of them with talons firmly in their dinner the rest eyeing the mound of fur and feathers with a view to selecting something choice brighter magelights than those conjured for the celebration hung up in the branches illuminating everything below with a clear yellow light sunlike but for its intensity tayledras sprawled all over the clearing eating talking or both darkwind did a quick mental tally and came up a few names short as vree yearned toward the heap of dinner making little plaintive chirping noises in the back of his throat hungry he urged his bondmate as darkwind tried not to laugh at the ridiculous sounds he made the uninitiated were often very surprised at the calls of raptorial birds most of them other than the defiant screams of battle and challenge were very unimpressive chirps clucks and squeals one species the harshawk even croaked sounding very like a duck with a throat condition and owls hissed not the kinds of things one expected to hear from the fierce hunters of the sky but silly sounds notwithstanding vrees hunger was very real and quite intense and the bondbird had more than earned his dinner darkwind took him on the gauntlet and tossed him into the air to give him a little height vree gave two great beats of his wings reaching the lowest of the branches then dove straight down at the pile shouldering aside lesser and lessfamished birds to get at a fat choice duck one of the harshawks quacked indignantly as the tasty morsel was snatched right from under his talons and two of the owls hissed angrily at being shouldered aside but vree ignored them all the gyre heaved himself and his prize up into the air and lumbered off to a nearby branch where he mantled both wings over it and tore into it with his sharp fiercely hooked beak here shadowstar shoved sliced meat and bread at darkwind and snatched back her fingers laughing when he grabbed for it as if he were a hungry forestgyre himself heyla sharpset are we in yarak something like he admitted its been a long day with a mageduel at the end of it he took a healthy bite of the food and bolted it suddenly realizing just how hungry he was where are summerstar and lightwing andah it took him a moment to remember the names of the mages that had been assigned to help the two scouts shadowstar beat him to it songlight and winddance gone to get injuries tended again they ran into changewolves nothing serious a tentative mindtouch from an unfamiliar source reassured him songlight here we are mostly soaking bruises darkwind i will stay in mindtouch and relay to the others if you like please he replied taking a seat where he could see the others this shouldnt take long he took out his dagger and rapped the hilt of it on the side of the tree it rang hollowly and got him instant attention and instant silence i hope that most of you have guessed why i asked for these meetings he began shadowstar stood up interrupting him we pretty much figured it out she said dryly as the others nodded we were talking it all over before you got here and were all agreed that while we dont want to lose you as our leader you deserve a rest and you arent going to get one at the rate youre going nods all around confirmed her words and darkwind felt an irrational surge of reliefboth that the scouts still wanted him as leader and that they were willing to let him go have any of you got a candidate in mind he asked surprisingly it was one of the mages who answered him winterlight the young man said promptly he did it before you had the position and now that we arent at each others throats he says he would be willing to take it again darkwind turned to his old friend one of the oldest scouts in the clan raising an eyebrow inquisitively winterlight coughed and halfsmiled i know the job he answered confirming the mages words and since its no longer the trial that it was darkwind grinned openly then as far as i am concerned the position is yours my friendif the rest agree that is he was going to open the meeting up to discussions but the others forestalled him with their unanimous assent even the bondbirds seemed pleased with the choice it was a good one although he was not a mage winterlight seldom dyed his hair and wore it long as a mage did so he looked like a mage and he was a contemporary of starblade and iceshadow which made him doubly acceptable to the elders of the council as long as the nightwatch agrees then its yours he told winterlight happily and if they come up with a different candidate youll have to deal with that yourself if they come up with a different candidate well split the duties winterlight replied immediately ive had my fill of dissension darkwind shrugged thats fine with me he responded winterlight smiled it wasnt just a rest that the youngsters decided you need he said in a confidential whisper i overheard one of them saying that youve been living like a sworn celibate and you needed to take that pretty outlander off to a bower and the rest of winterlights whispered suggestion made darkwind flush so hard he was afraid he was glowing the rest of the scouts howled with laughter winterlight just smiled enigmatically and asked if darkwind needed to borrow any feathers darkwind deliberately turned his attention first to vree to make sure the gyre was all right then to his food both to cover his confusion when he looked beside him again winterlight was gonebut the shinain shaman kethra had taken his place oh my i wonder what i owe this pleasure to he brushed invisible crumbs from his tunic selfconsciously kethra was another source of confusion entirely for him and not just because she was his fathers lover although that was a part of it is father well he asked her quickly she nodded her bright green eyes as cool and unreadable as a falcons and smoothed her long black hair in back of her ears she wore a birdfetish necklace that sparkled in the magelight and a braided length of cord adorned with feathers hung from her left temple he is relatively well she told him as the assembled scouts collected their birds as if at an unspoken signal and drifted nottoocasually off back to their respective ekeles there wasnt any peoplefood left and the few carcasses that remained were taken by those who lived outside the vale kethra however was not leaving there are some things i need to discuss with you before i proceed to the next steps with him they concern you and your relationship to him what about it he asked more brusquely than he intended suddenly it seemed as if everyone in ksheyna was interested in his private life am i to be allowed no thoughts to myself he glanced around the clearing hoping for a distraction but all of the scouts who had thronged the area had evaporated like snow in the summer sun as if there was some kind of conspiracy between them and the shinain she only pursed her lips and shook her head at him allowing him no evasions i need to know what you think of him nowand what you think of me she fixed him with an unflinching gaze you know i am starblades lover he flushed painfully embarrassed yes he said shortly and iceshadow told me whywhy it was necessary what did he tell you she asked humor me he averted his eyes for a moment but she recaptured them because so many of the things that were done to father and the magics that were cast to control him were linked with sex it has required sexually oriented healing to undo them that meant fathers healer should be a lover as well kethra nodded and leaned back her slender hands clasped around one knee that is quite true she said quietly and in case you had wondered i knew that was the case when i came here at kraheeras request but had you also deciphered that i am your fathers love as well as his lover and he has become mine as well darkwind tried to look away in confusion and found that he could not iit had occurred to me he admitted i am not blind and your attitude toward one another shows she set her jaw with the perpetual halfsmile that shaman always seemed to have and what do you think of that she asked bluntly a question he had not expected what do you think of me when you picture me in that role gods of my fathers she would ask that i am confused he said as honestly as he could i do not know what to think i admire you for yourself shaman you are a very strong talented and clever woman you force my father to be strong again as well i think that he must need this or you would not do it i see you encourage him to go to his limits you permit him to do for himself what he can yet you do not let him fall when you can steady him and you match your talents with his when he cannot do something alone you are describing a partner kethra said calmly an equal someone who is likely to go on being one for the foreseeable future he nodded reluctantly aware that his uneasiness was making him sweat and this makes you ill at ease she stated it as an observation rather than a question uncomfortable in my presence whether or not i am with your father he sighed yes lady it is not just because you are a shaman though there is something to that kethra chuckled shaman make you nervous darkwind took a deep breath and chose his words carefully shaman as a rule can make one uncomfortable by seeing more than one would like that is not the whole of it though i do not know what to say to you or how to treat you you are the first of my fathers lovers who has been a full partner since my mothers death and when i am looking objectively at my memories it seems to me that you have more patience and compassion than my mother had and yet and yet what of your loyalty to your true mother now that i have come to replace her surely i seem an interloper i suffer by comparison with your memory of her it is easy to regard someone who is dead as without peer he told her candidly i have lost enough friends and loved ones to be aware of that he cocked his head to one side and nibbled his lower lip this was possibly one of the oddest conversations he had ever taken part in say this i know that i can call you friend i think if you will give me time i can even come to call you more than that will this serve her smile widened and she reached out a hand to clasp his warmly it will serve she told him friend alone would have served i am pleased you think of me that well i was not sure darkwind you are adept at hiding your true feelingsyou have had need to i know that is not unique to tayledras shinain or any other people trust me we shaman need to hide our feelings ourselves sometimes to struggle through pain he shrugged we all have needed to hide true feelings here to one extent or another events have made it necessary she nodded well at least you and i have looked beneath the masks and not run from what we have found he smiled impressed by her steadfast sense of humor now the unpleasant news your father is still far from recovered it will not take weeks or even months to cure him it will be a matter of years he took a deep breath and ran his hand through his hair he felt his shoulders slumping and remembered that it made a poor impression of strength but he knew kethra would see through any attempts to hide his emotions either by words or body language he closed his eyes i had thought so but i had not liked to believe it father has always been sostrong he has always recovered quickly from things are you quite certain of this a deep somewhat strained male voice spoke from behind them you must believe it my son said starblade darkwind jerked his head up and turned to face him starblade wore a thin loosecut restinggown that songwind darkwind had designed for him a decade ago the adept walked slowly into the clearing and now that he knew the truth darkwind saw the traces of severe damage done to him physically as well as mentally starblade found a space beside kethra and joined her you must i am but a shadow of what i was in fact he chuckled as if he found the idea humorous i have considered changing my usename to star shadow except that we already have a shadowstar and that would be confusing for everyone darkwind clenched his hands it wasnt easy hearing starblade confess to weakness it was harder hearing him admit to such profound weakness that hed thought of altering his usename that implied a lasting condition as when songwind had become darkwind and sometimes an irreparable condition starblade sat carefully down beside the shaman and took her hand in his his left handthe one that darkwind had pierced with his dagger as part of his fathers freeing from mornelithe falconsbane it showed a glossy whitened scar a halfthumblength long now that the bandages had been removed i hope that you and i have reconciled our differences my son he said as darkwind tried not to squirm because i must tell you that i do not trust my decisionmaking ability any more than i can rely on my faded powers darkwind started to blurt out a protest his father stopped him oh not for the small decisions the everyday matters but for the decisions that affect us all deeplyand the ones i made in the pasti do not feel that i can continue without another view to temper mine in our healings i see my actions laid on bare earth without order as i am rebuilt kethra helps me to understand the motivations behind those actions and reject those that falconsbane engineered it is a slow process darkwind i do not know which of the decisions i have made were done out of pride out of good judgment or out of the direction of our enemies i need you my son i need your vision and i need your newly regained powers more so ksheyna needs them now darkwind was numb at the moment all he could do was to nod but thisthis was frightening inconceivable even at his worst when starblade had been trying to thwart him at every turn he had been in control he had been powerful he had been someone who at least could be relied upon to know what he was doing a bastion of strength full of certainty this was like hearing that the rock beneath the vale was sand and that the next storm could wash it away kethra and starblade both were waiting for some kind of response so he got himself under some semblance of control and gave them one what is it you want me to do he asked i want your opinions your thoughts starblade told him his lined and weary face showing every day of his age i need them the most pressing concern is the heartstone what do you think we should do about it you know enough to make some educated guesses about it we cannot stabilize it not without help i do not think that we can drain it either when we try it fluxes unpredictably and after you have given me your opinion i want your help in doing whatever it is that we must to end this troublei want you to take my place as the key of the adepts circle he shook his head at that violently father i cant i havent even begun to relearn all ive forgotten and the strength of your will and youth will counter that lack of practice kethra said interrupting him the key need not be the most experienced adept but he must be the strongest and you are that starblade coughed then settled himself fixing darkwind with a sincere look i will explain it to you in this light then your mother and i raised you to be a strong and responsible person scout or mage now the strength that i taught you has been taken from me you are at least in part the vessel of my old personality i would appreciate relearning what i was from you and learning your strength given a choice he would have told them it was impossible turned and fled from the vale back to his ekele but he had no choice and all three of them knew that he bowed to their will if that is truly what you want he said unhappily if it is then i shall thank you starblade said simply as kethra stood up he rose to his feet to place one hand on his sons shoulder thisconfession has cost me a great deal but i think it has gained me more i have given over wanting you to be a copy of me and i wish that wintermoon and i had not drifted so far apart that i cannot say those same words to him and be believed perhaps in time he will not be lost to me i do not wish you to be anything but yourself darkwind whatever comes of this it will have happened because you went to the limit of your abilities and not the sum of my expectations in all that happens i shall try to be your friend as well as your father with those words which surprised him more than anything else that had happened tonight starblade turned and walked slowly back into the shadows with kethra at his side vree swooped down off his perch and backwinged to a new one beside his bondmate he swiveled his head turning it upside down to stare at darkwind from a new angle as only a raptor would do hard to manage with his crop bulging as if the bird had swallowed a childs ball and possibly the silliest pose any bird could take sleepy he announced sleep now darkwind held out his gauntlet automatically and vree swiveled his head back and hopped onto his bondmates wrist i think so he replied absently all the while wondering if after all this he still could get to sleep he flailed up out of slumber arms windmilling wildly with sparkling afterimages of confused dreamscenes still in his mind and the impression of someone shaking him someone was shaking him what he gasped who the hammockbed beneath him felt strange the proportions of the room all wrong light flared and he blinked dazzled the shaker was sathen the hertasi who usually tended starblades ekele for him the little lizard was holding a lit lantern in one claw with the other on darkwinds shoulder and the proportions of the room were wrong because he was not in his own ekele he was in starblades in the guest quarters vree dozed on oblivious on a blockperch set into the wall one foot pulled up under his breastfeathers and his head hunched down so far there was nothing visible in the soft puff of white and offwhite but a bit of beak i need to find father a new bondbird came the inconsequential thought as sathen waited patiently for him to gather his wits and say something sensible what he obliged finally whats wrong trouble the little hertasi whispered troublecall it is from snowstar needing mage needing mages he corrected more than one marvelous well im probably the least weary what for he asked it couldnt be for combat by the time he reached snowstars patrol area any combat would have been long since resolved he reached for his clothing and pulled on his breeches well at least this means that someone else will have to take our patrol in the morning and i dont have to be the one to decide who it is basilisk sathen said his nostrils closing to slits as he said it the lizardfolk did not like basilisksnot that anyone did but basilisks seemed to prefer hertasi territories over any others darkwind groaned and pulled his tunic over his head thinking as quickly as his sleepfogged mind would permit go leave a message for winterlight thatahwingsister elspeth and i went out to deal with the basilisk and hell have to get someone else on daywatch to cover for us then go wake up the outlander and tell her ill be coming for her in a moment fortunately elspeths ekele was not that far from starblades she wasnt going to like being awakened out of a sound sleepbut then who did she took the oath he told himself a little smugly as he pulled on his boots he splashed water from the basin sathen had left onto his face to wake himself up she might as well find out what it means besides being shaken awake in the middle of the night might also shake up that attitude problem of hers and once she saw a basilisk for herself he had a shrewd notion that she might start paying better attention to him when he told her something particularly about the dangers that lurked out in the uncleansed lands and how you couldnt always deal with them combatively this would be a good exercise in patience for her as well now that he thought about it he realized he couldnt have planned this encounter more effectively other than staging it by daylight instead of darkness for a basilisk could not be moved by magic powerit grounded attacks out on itself sent the power out into the earth and ignored the attackers and it could not be moved by force it could only be dealt with by persuasion and a great deal of patience as elspeth would likely discover the hard way he took the gracefully curved stairs down to the ground jumping them two at a time suppressing the urge to whistle this promised to be very very entertaining it was not just any basilisk it was a basilisk with a belly full of eggs snowstar held his torch steady no doubt trusting in the cold to keep the creature torpid it blinked at them from the hollow it had carved for itself in the rocky bank of the stream but remained where it was torchlight flickering over the things head and parts of its body did nothing to conceal how hideous the poor creature was havens that thing is ugly elspeth said in a fascinated whisper basilisks came in many colorsall the colors of mud from the dull redbrown of plainsmud to the dull brownblack of forestloam mud and every muddy variation in between this one was the muddy graygreen of clay with the face of a toad no neck to speak of the body of an enormous lizard a dull ashgray frill running down the head and the length of the spine and tail a mouth full of poisonous halfrotted teeth and a slack jaw that continuously leaked greenish drool it was definitely not going to appeal to anything outside of its own kind and when you added to that the sanitary habits of a maggot and breath that would make an enraged bull keel over a hundred paces away you did not have anything that could be considered a good neighbor and that was when it was torpid as soon as the sun arose and warmed the things sluggish blood it would go looking for food it wasnt fussy anything would do living or dead so long as it was meat but as soon as the blood warmed up the brain would warm up tooand when that happened nothing nearby would be safe not that the basilisk was clever it wasntit wasnt fast either or a crafty hunter it didnt have to be it simply had to feel hunger and look around for food and everything within lineofsight would freeze held in place by the peculiar mental compulsion it emitted then it could simply stroll up to its chosen dinner and eat it as snowstar explained this to elspeth darkwind created a heatless magelight and sent it into the basilisks shelter so he could get a better idea of how big it was elspeth shuddered in revulsion as the light revealed just how phenomenally hideous the creature was are we going to kill it now she asked darkwind had the feeling that she wanted to get this over with quickly well he didnt blame her being downwind of a basilisk was a lot like being downwind of a charnel pit snowstar answered for him gods of our fathers no he exclaimed if you think it stinks now you dont want to be within two days ride of a dead one thats assuming we could kill it it has three hearts that warty skin is tougher than twenty layers of boiled hide and it can live for a long time with what wed consider a fatal wound it can live without two legs both eyes and half its face altogether assuming you could get near enough to it to take out an eye personally id rather not try elspeth shook her head not in disbelief but in amazement what about magic magic doesnt work on them darkwind told her as he reckoned up the length of the beast and judged it to be about the size of three horses not counting the tail it just passes around them and goes straight into the ground we should have shields like that an amazing animal you sound like you admire it elspeth replied in surprise he shrugged and walked around a little to see if the basilisk noticed him or if it had gone completely torpid in a way i do he said noting with satisfaction that the creatures eyes tracked on him it is said that they were created by one of the great mages not as a weapon but as a way of disposing of the carcasses of those creatures that were weapons that even dead were too dangerous to touch and too deadly to leave about nothing else will eat a dead colddrake for instance his brief survey complete he returned to elspeths side they werent supposed to be able to breed but neither were a lot of other creatures most of their eggs are infertile but there are one or two that are viable now and again he turned to snowstar the scout wiped the back of his hand across his watering eyes and stood a little straighter snowstar was one of the youngest of the scouts darkwind was grateful that he had known enough to send for help and not attempt to move the basilisk himself it could be done without magic but the odds of success especially in the uncertain weather of fall or spring were not good have you found any place for us to put her he asked yes but its not as secure as id like the scout replied wiping his eyes again the wind had turned and the fumes werepotent darkwinds eyes had started to burn a few moments ago and snowstar had been here for some time small wonder he had watering eyes ive got a rockbottomed gully along this stream the sides are too steep to climb and theres always lots of things falling into it to die the only problem is that the mouth of the valley is open to the stream and i couldnt see a way to close it off isnt there a swamp somewhere off that way darkwind asked waving vaguely in the direction where he thought he sensed water can you get the thing that far snowstar asked incredulously if you can that would be perfect theres plenty for it to eat no hertasi like it because its full of sulfur springs and the sulfurs enough to make sure any eggs it lays wont hatch if we can get it moving we can get it that far darkwind told him the problem is going to be getting it moving without getting it worked up enough to think about being angry or frightened if its either itll start trying to fascinate everything within line of sight right snowstar spread his hands ill leave that up to you get it moving and ill guide you to the nearest finger of the swamp and make sure nothing interferes with you on the way that will do darkwind studied the hideous beast trying to determine whether it was better to lure it out of its rudimentary den or force it out force it out he decided at last he didnt think that the beast was going to take any kind of bait at the moment heres what were going to do he said turning to elspeth who still watched the basilisk with a kind of repulsed fascination its comfortable and it feels secure in that den you and i are going to have to make it feel uncomfortable and insecure and make it come out once its out it will try to go back in again well have to prevent that then well have to herd it in the direction we want it to go elspeth licked her lips and nodded slowly we use magic i presume that or mindmagic or a combination of the two he told her he yawned as he finished the sentence and hoped he wasnt going to be too fuddled from lack of sleep to carry this off elspeth looked as if she felt about the same got any ideas about what might drive it out she leaned back against a tree trunk and frowned at the beast well what would drive you or me out of bed noise interesting idea thats one nobody i know of has tried he thought for a moment if it were warmer we could lure her out with an illusion of food but she isnt hungry in the semihibernation shes in right now heat and cold in her caveno too hot and shell just wake up more and we dont want that too cold and shell go torpid how about rocks in her bed elspeth hazarded sharp pointy ones maybe combine it with noise good good i like that plan it should irritate her without making her angry and if we make her uncomfortable she wont want to go back in there he scratched his head now which do you want rocks or noise rocks she said surprising him ive got an idea since he already had a notion about the noises that might irritate the basilisk that suited him very well he had been afraid that elspeth wouldnt think herself capable of manifesting goodsized stones but evidently she already had a solution in mind do it then he said shortly and concentrated all his attention on a just behind the basilisks body the one thing he didnt want to do was frighten herjust make her leave her lair if he frightened her she might be aroused enough to set all her abilities working and that would do them no good at all fine thing if i met my end as a latenight snack for a foulbreathed incredibly stupid monster he already knew how some pure highpitched sounds irritated wolves and birds he reasoned the same might well be true of this beast it just had to be loud enough and annoying enough dissonance he thought suddenly that might work even better two pure tones out of tune with each other hed done this before as a kind of game when he was just learning very fine control hed gotten good enough that he had been able to produce recognizable voices out of the air producing pure tones wasnt all that hard it just took a lot of energy he started near the top of the humanaudible scale figuring to go up if he had to it took him a moment to recall the trick of it but when he got it snowstar jumped as a nerveshattering squeal rang out from the basilisks lair the young scout clapped both hands over his ears his expression pained darkwind wished he had that luxury he had to listen to his creation in order to control it when he glanced out of the corner of his eye at elspeth he saw she had blocked both her ears with her fingers and her brow was creased with concentration his sounds didnt seem to be having any effect although already he noticed the basilisk shifting her weight as if she found her position uncomfortable he raised the notes another half step and waited to see the effect another increment followed that until he had gone up a full octave and still he was not getting the reaction he wanted although the monster turned occasionally to snap at the empty air as if trying to rid her lair of its noisy visitor finally he took the sounds up past the range where even he could hear it and he had one of the longest ranges in the clan elspeth had taken her fingers out of her ears two steps earlier and snowstar had taken his hands down before that with an expression of deep gratitude this was the range that animals other than man could hear he wasnt about to give up this plan until hed passed the sounds that bats used and from the look on elspeths face she wasnt going to give in until she had produced rocks the size of small ponies neither of them had to go that far although whether it was darkwinds dissonant howls or elspeths stones that finally tipped the balance he couldnt tell the basilisk had been snapping and shifting uncomfortably for some time when he changed the tone again and the basilisk came pouring out of her lair burbling with anger and frustration she stood there for a moment wavering between the discomfort of the lair and the exposure of the outdoors if she dove back in again they might never get her out before darkwind could say anything elspeth solved the problem for him he sensed her grabbing the underlying web of earthenergies at the mouth of the halfdug lair and yanking the lair collapsed in on itself leaving the basilisk nowhere to go the monster rumbled deep in her chest and turned heading downstream and away from them into the darkness that will do for a few furlongs but then were going to have to turn her out of this stream when it forks snowstar said as the basilisk plodded out of the range of his torch and darkwinds magelight dont worry i think we can deal with it he said breaking into a trot along the graveled streamside sending his magelight winging on ahead until it illuminated the unlovely rump of the basilisk she was moving at a pretty fair pace hed had no idea they could move that fast in factwas he going to be able to keep up with her elspeth supplied his answer as she and the companion trotted up alongside and she offered him a hand up gwena can carry two for a while she said he took her at her word and got himself up behind her are you going to use that sound of yours to drive that thing she asked once he was settled and gwena was bounding after the tail of the monster yes he saidshortly as it was difficult to speak when bouncing along on the rump of a trotting mount thatwastheidea i have another idea elspeth said by mindspeech its a reptile which means it can probably sense heat very well lets create a ball of warmth about her size and lure her along with it keep it a couple of lengths ahead of her until shes where we want her then dissipate it what do you think he switched to mindspeech as well that is an excellent idea this is going to be great news when we get back to the vale he told her and smiled at the glow of wellearned selfcongratulation that met his words youve helped uncover something entirely new and very useful to us the other forms of driving these monsters have all been much riskier you are going to make your clansibs quite happy with this news for that matter she was making him quite happy the basilisk responded to guidancebynoise and the heat lure beautifully they were going to be returning to the vale much sooner than he had thought much sooner and flushed with success not a bad combination not a bad combination at all everyone wanted to hear about the basilisk drive this was the first time that a basilisk had been moved with fewer than a dozen people and with no injuries small wonder that the vale had been astir when they returned and that the mages had all wanted to hear the story in detail it seemed that if he and elspeth hadnt used unorthodox tactics because there had only been two of them they would never have budged the thing and if snowstar hadnt been so inexperienced in the ways of basilisks hed never have called for just a pair of mages you werent lucky iceshadow finally said snowstar was relatively lucky because he got you but you twoyou were quite clever or am i being overly optimistic darkwind laughed tiredly and drank another full beaker of cold waterthe aftereffect of all that basilisk stench was incredible dehydration he and elspeth together had drained a small lake it seemed and they were still thirsty no we were bright enough that if we hadnt been able to budge the old girl with methods that wouldnt enrage her we would have called for help he assured the adept i pledge you that i dont trust anything that can entrance you to the point that you let yourself be swallowed whole when the others finally left them in peace darkwind realized that he was much too keyed up to sleep at least not without a long soak in hot water to relax him he stood up abruptly catching elspeth by surprise she jumped when he moved and looked up at him with round eyes i need a bath and a soak he said and the pool under your ekele is the nearest twolayered one i know of would it disturb you if i used it would it disturb you if i joined you she asked at first he thought she was making some kind of an overture but a moment of reflection told him that she couldnt possibly be doing anything of the sort she was just as tired as he waseven if she wasnt bruised from riding for furlongs on the sharp and protruding hipbones of her companion even if the two of them had been ready to tear one anothers clothes off in a fit of unbridled lust neither of them would have had the energy to do so no she was just being polite but at least she wasnt as shy as she had been and she was still an attractive woman there might be some hope after all it surely wont disturb me he told her and offered her a polite hand to help her rise in fact i doubt very much if it would disturb me to share a pool with he stopped himself before he said with that basilisk realizing at the last moment that the comment could be construed as saying that he did not find her attractive which was not the case at all half the clan he concluded all i want is to get this stink off and soak my muscles until i can sleep good plan she said and smiled ill make you a bargain if you find some of that fruit drink ill get soap robes and towels from my treehouse ill take that he said instantly elspeth disappeared into the greenery while he sought one of the storage areas and dug out a tiny keg of a peculiar mineralrich drink elspeth had gotten very fond of normally he didnt care much for the stuff but when he was as parched and exhausted as he was now he downed it with the same enthusiasm as she did keg under one arm and a pair of turned wooden mugs in the other hand he retraced his path and followed in elspeths wake when he arrived at the pool he found that she had been as good at keeping her word as he there was strongly herbscented soap beside the lower of the two heated pools and towels and robes hanging nearby on a couple of branches with one small magelight over each pool providing just enough light to see by elspeth was already in the upper soaking pool he left the keg and mugs beside it as she waved at him indolently from the steam then he stripped and plunged straight into the lower pool it took three full soapings before the last of the stench was gone and he felt clean again by then he was more than ready for a mug and a long soothing soak i think i took all my skin off elspeth complained languidly from her end of the pool as he slipped across the barrier between the pools and into the hotter water of the second i scrubbed and scrubbed every time i thought i was clean i could still smell that thing worse than skunk or polecat he agreed she seemed very relaxed for the first time since he had met her did you see how much iceshadow liked that idea of yours moving the basilisk with noise but it was your idea to use puretones in dissonance she said immediately i had just thought of using volume or maybe make it sound like the cave was falling in he allowed himself to feel pleased about that part of it well i guess that im going to have to admit that you are right about trying new things even in magic just because they arent the way weve always done something that doesnt mean new ideas arent going to work change comes to the vales quite a concept she laughed heartily i thought id never hear you say that but i have to make a confession to you though i have been pushing you just because you were being such amudturtle about things not wanting to try anything new butwell now i know that theres good reasons why some things arent done in the vales and in this one in particular hydonas been explaining things to me her voice trailed off and he thought she was finished until she spoke up again you know hydona reminds me a great deal of talia that old friend of hers the one thats some kind of aide to her mother and not the one thats the weapons teacher in what way he asked she waved steam away from her face she made me give her a promise back when i was a childthat i would never simply dismiss anything she told me just because i didnt want to hear it or that i was angry at her or anything else that i would always go away and think about it for a day then if i couldnt agree with any of it i had the right to be angry but if i could see that she was right in at least some of what shed said i would have to come back to her and wed talk about it as calmly as we could well if that isnt an opening chance to talk about her attitude i know we dont know one another as well as you and talia do he said tentatively but could you grant me that same promise as a wingsib oh dear she said her voice full of ironic chagrin been a bitch have i he wanted to laugh and decided against it still he smiled not exactly a bitch but your attitude hasnt been helping me teach you that was one reason why when the gryphons volunteered to help i agreed attitude she asked her voice was carefully controlled to the point of being expressionless not a good sign attitude he repeated getting ready for an outburst youre very selfimportant elspeth very aware of your own importance and making sure everyone else is aware of it too take what you just said about being a bitch you laughed about it deep down you thought it was funny you think you are so important it doesnt matter if youre offending those around you you just make some perfunctory apology smile and laugh and thats that but nothing has really changed she was quite silent over there in the steam but he wondered if hed just felt the temperature of the water rise by a bit that silence was not a good sign either the truth is elspeth right now youre an enormously talented liability she wasnt going to like that one bit i never heard of your land outside of something vague from the old histories you could be a bondslave from valdemar and we would be treating you the same as we are now your title doesnt matter your country doesnt matter and your people dont matter not to us little waves lapped against him as she shifted but she remained silent what does matter is that you did help us for that we made you a wingsib because we made you a wingsister you became entitled to training not because of a crown and not because of a title not even because you asked us because you are part of the clan and whats more the only ones willing to train you were myself and the gryphons everyone else has more important matters to attend to that wasnt precisely the truth but it was close enough that it might shake her up a bit so no doubt about it she was angry i dont matter is that it no thats not it you matter your title doesnt he hoped she could see the difference so you might as well stop walking around as if there was a crown on your head kings dont mean much out here anyone can call himself a king having the power to enforce authority thats something else again until you have that youd best pay a little closer attention to the way you treat those around you because we are not impressed oh really he sensed an angry retort building but then she said nothing nothing at all he tensed waiting for an outburst that never came he wondered what she was thinking finally she yawned and stretched water dribbling from her arms im tired she said yawning again too tired to think or react sensibly ill sleep on what you just said please do and carefully elspeth more could depend on it than amiable learning conditions he looked down and sighed i do like you and would prefer not to spend my time with you deciphering what you really mean under the royal posturing she rose surprising him and hoisted herself out of the pool wrapping a towel around her wet hair then bundling one of the thick heavy robes around herself she turned and looked down at him youve said quite a bit she told him quietly and im not sure what to think except that im certain you werent being malicious so good night darkwind if theres anything to say ill say it tomorrow she gathered her dignity about her like the robe and walked off into the darkness leaving him alone chapter ten the heartstone mm twice darkwind tried to wake up twice he turned over to climb out of bed twice he closed his eyes again and fell right back to sleep and since no one came to fetch him and there was hardly ever any noise around starblades ekele he slept until well past midmorning unaware of how long hed been dreaming when he finally awakened and stayed awake he lay quietly for a moment feeling confused and a bit disoriented the light shouldnt have been coming in at that anglethen it finally occurred to him why it was doing so i havent overslept like this in i cant think how long feeling very much as if hed done something overly selfindulgent he snatched his newlycleaned clothing from a shelf and hastily donned it there was no one in the ekele except vree who was still dozing he vaulted the stairs to the ground and hurried down to elspeths ekele only to find her gone he was both embarrassed and annoyed annoyed that she had left without him embarrassed because shed needed to she had at least left a note it looked like gibberish until he realized that she had apparently spelled things the way they sounded to her takt tu starblaad n winrlit sins we r not owt taa sed tu werk on bordr majik wit grifons we r al waading fer u wen u waak up it took him a moment to puzzle out that she had checked with starblade and winterlight about what she and he should do since they werent on patrol he surmised that they had both asked her to work on border protections under the gryphons tutelage all three of them were expecting darkwind whenever he got there she hadnt even told him where they were working they could be anywhere once again as with everything elspeth did he had mixed feelings pleased that she had taken it upon herself to find something useful to do miffed that she hadnt consulted him he snatched a quick meal and wondered if he should try to find winterlight presumably the scout leader would know where they were then it occurred to him that he hadnt bothered to ask the most obvious person vree the forestgyre was still back at starblades ekele undoubtedly recovering from the way hed stuffed himself yesterday he sent out a mental call and was rewarded within a few moments by a flash of white through the high branches he held out his arm and vree winged in diving down to the ground and pulling up with spread wings in a headhigh stall he dropped delicately down onto darkwinds wrist u a ic ciratch mes the gyre chirped at him and inclined his e r sages he asked th the mental emphasis of im from horse vree replied horsewi importancecould only mean the compamon vrees intelligence was limited he had to get messages in pieces who is the message from horse about female and big ones vree leaned into the scratch his eyes halfclosed in pleasure what is the message he had long ago given up being impatient with this slow method of finding things out it was simply the way vree and every other bondbird worked at magicplace vree replied well he wouldnt have to ask vree to track them down good thing too since vree was still drowsy from a long night of digestion hed be so fat darkwind wouldnt be able to find his keelbone if he was fed that way all the time interesting though that the companion could talk to darkwinds bird he wasnt surprised but it wasnt something that gwena had shown she could door wanted to dobefore this and he wasnt going to have to leave the vale which was a bit of a relief his backside was still a little sore and stiff from the ride yesterday do you need to leave the vale he asked vree after all the poor bird had been in here for more than a day the gyre turned his head upside down as he considered the question and his bondmate no vree decided head not itch that was how he had described the way that rogue powers of the heartstone had affected him that his head had itched it had taken darkwind a while before he had figured out that the bird meant inside his head not outside go back to starblades then darkwind told him or hunt if you wantjust dont go too far from the vale im going to the magicplace and i dont want you in there your head would really itch yes vree agreed and halfspread his wings waiting for darkwind to launch him the scout gave him a toss and the gyre gained height rapidly disappearing into the branches above no need to guess what the magicplace was the practice ground it was entirely possible to direct the border defenses from in there although it would require great patience and careful shielding to keep the heartstone from affecting whatever the three of them did in there maybe that was the idea itll certainly test the integrity of my shielding and if i can shield against the stone and work at the same timei just might be ready to help handle the stone myself the gods only know that therell be no peace for ksheyna until i do well if they were waiting for him they were probably wondering if hed fallen down a well or something hed better go prove he was still alive he had heard a mutter of conversation before he crossed the passthrough in the barrier that divided the rest of the vale from the practice ground the sudden silence that descended as he appeared told him that he had been the topic of discussion between elspeth and the gryphons he suppressed a surge of irritation at being talked about sorry i slept so late he said trying not to let his irritation show what are we doing conssstructing wardoff ssspellsss hydona said mildly as if she hadnt snapped her beak shut in midsyllable the moment he came into view elssspeth had one of the hertasssi look in on you but you were sssleeping ssso deeply we decsssided you mussst need the ressst his irritation faded a little at least they had checked on him before doing anything on their own this particular task was not something he would have expected for the four of them wardoffs were simple things but they had to be constructed and set carefully another task of patience intended to discourage rather than hurt wardoffs were the first line of defense on the border the more intelligent the creature that encountered one the more likely it was to be affected by it a basilisk for instance would not be deterred by one but a changewolf probably would unless it happened to be very hungry humans certainly would be especially wanderers peddlers and the uepeople who had crossed into tayledras lands by accident treyvan roused his goldenedged crest and refolded his wings with the characteristic rasp of feathers sliding across feathers you and i arrre not to make wardoffsss ssstarblade hasss a tasssk forrr usss to move leylinessss he said we work while elsspeth watchesss we are to diverrrt them to the node beneath the lairrr sssevering them from the heartssstone darkwind frowned that came under the heading of tedious and necessary as well but anything to do with the heartstone had its own share of danger involved certainly this was not beneath his abilities it was along the lines of doing his share to work with the imbalanced stone do you have any idea why were doing this he asked thessse are minorrr linesss treyvan told him ssstarrblade wantsss all the minorrr linesss rrremoved to sssee if they can be and to sssee if thisss weakensss the ssstone hmm it could well be that once the minors are removed the majors could be split into minors and diverted in the same manner to other nodes perhaps other heartstones if there were any near treyvan gave him one of those enigmatic purelygryphonish expressions of his the one that always looked to darkwind like i know something you would dearly like to know he spoke slowly it isss not imposssible darkwind nodded watching elspeth with his othersight taking note of how she built the wardoff layer by layer with the deft and delicate touch of a jeweler showing no signs of impatience and no signs of attitude either and that irritated him all over again why couldnt she just have been reasonable in the first place because no one put things to her in a way she understood he reminded himself shes as much an alien here as the gryphons no matter how comfortable she looks or how well she seems to fit in and she did look as if she fit in wearing the clothing hed had made for her instead of those glaring white uniforms or the barbarian getup shed had in her packs she didnt quite look tayledras not with that hairbut until she spoke no one would know she was not one of the tayledras allies get your mind on the task darkwind and off the female hasnt anyone tried this linediverting with the stone before he couldnt believe that they hadnt it seemed like the logical sort of thing to do yesss the gryphon said switching his tail restlessly but it did not worrk and not asss we will be worrrking parrrtially the sstone ressissted having the linesss taken and parrrtially it rrreclaimed them within a day we will give the linesss a new anchorrr fixing them in place rrrather than letting them find theirrr own anchorrr beforrre they werrre allowed to drrrift andthe sstone rrreclaimed them elspeth put the final lock on the wardoff and sent it away to settle into its place on the border in his minds eye it drifted away like a gossamer scarf blown by a purposeful windor a drift of fog with a mind of its own im done she announced dusting off her hands your turn she took a seat nearby her face alight with interest i thought these lines were like rivers or something i didnt know you could change where they went generally only the little ones darkwind told her as he stretched at least the major lines take all the mages of a clan to reroute thats something we do when we start a vale we find a node or make one then relocate all the nearest big lines to it so that we can drain the wild magic of an area into the heartstone it isss much like crrreating a riverrrrbed before therrre isss a rrriver hydona said when the waterrr comess it will follow the courssse laid forrr it ssso isss the wild magic to the grreaterrr linesss the grrreaterrr linesss have theirrr bankssss widened the unsssettled magicsss join theirrr flow i can see how that would make sense and when you leave you drain the magic from the stonealong a newmade set of riverbeds i assume elspeth said with a measure of surety in her voice that or a series of reservoirs are made temporarily then what she asked darkwind then we sever the lines and let them drift back into natural patterns and physically remove the stone he told her as he concentrated more of his attention on the complex of shields and probes he would need to handle his task shields against the heartstone some set to deflect energy away some to resist sensory probes to know what it was doing heartstones were not precisely aware they certainly werent thinking creatures yet they were alive in a sense and normally tractable but this one was no longer normal but didnt you redirect the greater leylines in the first place to get rid of wild magic she asked puzzled or am i missing something at least this time she didnt phrase it in a way that made me sound like i didnt know what i was talking about we did this juggling of preparations and explanations was going to get him into trouble if he wasnt very careful which again was probably treyvans intention in a job like this trouble had the potential of being very serious indeed the gryphons were merciless in their testing we do and by the time we leave its gone changed into a stable form the magic were draining isnt in its natural state set the shield justsogot to be able to sense through it without getting blinded if the stone surges it doesnt belong here and certainly not in a random state once we finish the only thing left is the natural magic flow ah so you take down the stone and leave and everything goes back to the way it was before the mage wars both he and hydona had already explained the natural flow of magic energy to her how it was created by living things how it collected in leylines and reservoirs in the same way that water collected in streams and lakes probably not exactly but at least a human can live here without fear that his children will have claws or two heads and there wont be any other changecreatures there either unless they manage to get past our lands somehow ill need a secondary shield to slap between the end of the severed line and the stone and when we leave we take the innocent or harmless magecreated creatures with us so they dont have t fear the fullhumans who inevitably arrive her face changed subtly at that as if it was something that hadnt occurred to her until that moment he would have liked to know what she was thinking well time enough for that later i would like you behind as many shields as you can put up he told her i do not know what is likely to happen there has been so much work with the stone that it may have changed the way it is likely to react can you watch through my eyes or treyvans she nodded and extended a tentative hand to him waiting for him to take it well thats promising she didnt just fling a link at me without asking he took her up making certain that everything including surface thoughts was wellshielded against casual probes he didnt think she would intrude but there were always accidents some of his personal thoughts were less than flattering to her most he would rather not share with anyone treyvan indicated his readiness to act with a nod and a hand of his own he settled into partnership with the gryphon with the same ease that one half of an acrobatic team has with the other but treyvan waited for him to initiate the action the gryphons intention was clear he meant to observe the act as a backup in case of trouble but to otherwise let darkwind take the lead the heartstone glowered before them sullen red pulsing irregularly with odd cracklings of random energy discharge flowing over and through it the lines were anchored firmly in its base concentrated amidst the major lines like roots from a crystalline tree of lightning their rainbowpatterned raw power transformed by the stone itself was he ready he would have to find out sooner or later might as well get it over with all right old friend he mindsent lets make this one clean and quick clean it was quick it was not the stone resisted their attempts to sever the lines as treyvan predicted he was not prepared for the uncanny way in which it reacted when he severed the first of them though he formed his own power into a thin sharpedged blade sliding it into the join of stone and line intending to excise the line as if cleaning a rabbit hide to his surprise though it felt precisely like trying to cut the leg from an old tough and overcooked gamebird he encountered a flexible resistance that was at once yielding and entangling from trying to cut his way through the join he changed his tactic changed to burning his way through it resisted that as well so he changed to a mental image of wielding bitter cold at the join to make it brittle then breaking it away that worked but it was a good thing he had secondary shields ready to protect the raw ends because the moment he got the line loose and held in one of his hands he sensed movement from the stone he passed the line to treyvan protected the end with an expanding shield just in time the stone itself created tiny tentacles of seeking power probing after the lines it had lost thin waving strands of sullen red energy groped toward him lengthening as they searched the hair on the back of his neck rose as they came to him then ignored him and sought after the line for one frightening moment he thought they were coming after him that the stone knew he had taken the line and wanted retribution they reminded him of the filaments of energy cast out in the creation of a gate the filaments that sought for and found the terminus at the other end and drew the two together they found the lineand slid along the surface of the shield protecting the severed end before they could seek further perhaps touch past the sides of the shield treyvan hauled the he shivered watching the red fingers weaving and groping after the i i ii of his training tbetales he had ever heard there had been nothing like this heartstone les were neither as powerful nor as persistent there was something very wrong about th s n a into the seething chaos of the stone of reach but he certainly re the stone might have more sur the ctv t toaew exactly what he had done and that hisother chbi and treyvan put their strength into lands r n cl ent the pathway it would take in the severed lint a at deal ae pulling one end of a very heavy very long ropea rope that was perhaps as thick as his waist the line resisted being moved from its accustomed course just by pure inertia by the time he got the severed end within easy distance of the new node he felt as if he had run a long uphill race treyvans mind was focused on his and hydonas home he manipulated the node beneath the lair that was appropriate since he was the most familiar with it he created a kind of sticky or roughsurfaced place on it at least that was the analogy darkwind used for himself whatever he did it made the raw end of the line seek it as soon as darkwind removed the shield they joined jumping together as a thread will jump to a silkrubbed amber bead or a bit of iron to a magnet then he ran magical pressure along the line to straighten and broaden it slightly so it would seat in place easier darkwind studied the join for a moment and mentally shook his head i dont want to take any chances this time he said to treyvan feeling elspeth in the back of his mind watching with interest i didnt like what the stone did back there and i dont want it to recapture these lines lets armor and shield the joining a good plan treyvan agreed it was probably not necessary they were probably doing far more work than they needed to but darkwind could not get those seeking tentacles of power out of his mindand the more i weaken the stone the less chance it has of turning the tables on us when we finally drain it or whatever we do when we finally take it down he was aware that he was thinking of the stone as if it was a living sentient creature a discomforting fact of magic also was that often thinking about something made it happen especially with skilled adepts magery was not a matter of spell components and rituals at adept level it involved a high measure of subconscious skill and influencing of the physical world he had no doubt that there were others among the hawkbrothers who thought of the stone as having a minda halfmad malicious one to be sure personifying a problem was also not unheard of among people of all ages and races much less mages it might by now have a kind of mind that might even be the root cause of its behavior back there if it did the last thing he wanted to do was underestimate it so he and treyvan spent some time in ensuring that the stone would not be able to get that particular leyline back and the next and the next four lines later and he was quite ready to call an end to the exercise so he surmised was treyvan when he disengaged his attention from othersight and glanced over at the gryphon poor treyvans crest drooped and his neckruff had a decidedly wilted look about it thats enough he said we know this will hold and even weakened my father could do this alone in fact if i can do this any pair of the adepts should be able to i think ill advise that they work in pairs though i dont think anyone should ever turn an unguarded back on that stone from now on treyvan acknowledged his decision with a weary nod and broke the link as darkwind brought all of his attention and concentration back to his physical body the gryphon slumped over his foreclaws and sighed that sstone isss mossst ssstubborn darrkwind the gryphon complained his crestfeathers slowly rising i have neverrr ssseen anything like it lets get out of here darkwind urged im too tired to really trust my shields i agrreee hydona rumbled and turned to lead the way across the passthrough on the other side of the barrier treyvan resumed his interrupted observation i have neverrr ssseen anything like the way the ssstone behaved he repeated his voice troubled and his crest rising and falling a little with his agitation you mean the way it tried to reach after the line once we severed it darkwind asked by the way he added in an aside to elspeth treyvan is right in that what you saw wasnt normal behavior for a heartstone its not supposed to reach out after things like that on its own the gryphon shuddered it acted asss if it werre alive and thinking it issss jussst a node nodesss arrre not sssupposssed to be alive yes and no darkwind replied although this is sheer speculation on my part i must remind you but i have seen another kind of magicimbued object act like that when you build a gate the energy integrated into the portal does the same thing yesss but not on itsss own treyvan corrected you make it do sssso initially perhaps darkwind argued but eventually a mage can work parts of the spell without consciously thinking on it after a while the process proceeds without direction a flash of white in the branches up above should have warned him but he was too tired to think of more than one thing at a time and his mind was already occupied with the problem of the heartstone so it wasnt until vree had made threefourths of his dive at treyvans crest that he realized what was about to happen and by then it was too late no this time treyvan was tired irritablevree reached out claws to snatch and encountered something he had not expected treyvan had suffered the bondbirds behavior enough vree found himself flying straight for treyvans enormous beak easily large enough to engulf the bird darkwind reached out his hand in a useless gesture he didnt even have time to think it was all happening too fast vree frantically tried to pull up out of the dive too late crack the sound of treyvans beak snapping shut echoed across the vale like nothing that had ever been heard there before like the sound of an enormous branch snapping in two perhaps or the jaws of a huge steel trap closing or the hands of a giant slapping together clouds of songbirds took wing in alarm vree screamed in pain and dove for the safety of darkwinds wrist treyvan spat out the single tailfeather hed bitten off with an air of aggrieved triumph darkwind heaved a sigh of relief treyvan was a carnivore as much a raptor as vree was something he never forgot vree was lucky incredibly luckybecause treyvan hadnt missed hed snapped off exactly what he intended to the gryphons reflexes were as swift and sure as the fastest goshawk and if treyvan had chosen it would have been vrees neck that was broken not a tailfeather i warned you darkwind said as elspeth hovered between sympathy for the badlyfrightened bird and the laughter she was obviously trying to repress i warned you and you wouldnt listen treyvan fixed the trembling terrified bondbird with a single glaring eye you arrre jussst forrrtunate that i wasss not hungerrred he hissed and darkwind heard him echoing his words in simple thoughtimages the bondbird would have no difficulty understanding you may not farrrre so well a sssecond time vree cowered against darkwinds chest making tiny sounds of acute distress and pain now youre going to be minus that feather until you molt unless i can imp it back in hurts vree wailed scared i know it hurts you should be glad he didnt pull it out or bite your tail off darkwind caressed the gyre until he stopped trembling as elspeth bent to pick up the feather and offered it to him he took the gesture at face value and not for the one implied by hawkbrother custom tell treyvan youre sorry he told vree sternly holding the bondbird out to the gryphons face within easy reach of that enormous beak maybe this will impress him enough that he wont try the game again he sighed i certainly hope so the gyre looked up into the huge amber eyes as darkwind held him up to the gryphons face ssssorry the bird stutteredno mean feat mentally ssssorry he certainly sounded sincere promise you wont do it again darkwind ordered vree shook and slicked down all his feathers with unhappiness not snatch again he agreed not ever never never never never darkwind transferred the bird from his wrist to the padded shoulder of his jerkin where vree huddled against his hair actually pushing himself into the hair so that it partially covered him hiding darkwind examined the feather carefully hoping that it hadnt been too badly damaged vree depended on his tail for steering the loss of one feather might not seem like a great deal but it would make a difference in his maneuverability you did a good job he remarked to treyvan whose crest was rising slowly again its a nice clean cut only cracked the shaft a little i wont need to use one of last years set i should be able to imp this one back in with no problems the gryphon chuckled it isss in parrt vreesss doing if he had not turrned i ssshould not have been able to catch the tail featherssss if he did not turrrn i wasss going to catch him and hold him then let him go hed have been frightened to death well i think youve finally made an impression on him darkwind repliednot chuckling though he wanted to for fear of hurting the birds feelings he finally sees you as a bigger hungrier meaner version of a bondbird and not something like a glorified firebird to tell you the truth i think hes just fascinated by beautiful feathers like your crest and the firebirds tails he snatches their feathers all the time treyvans crest rose completely with mock indignation i ssshould hope we arrre not glorrrified firrrebirds he snorted i am a vain birrrd and i appreciate that he findsss my cressst ssso attrrractive but we arrre not anything like firrrrebirrdssss what are you though elspeth asked suddenly i mean you dont really look like anything i know ofother than vaguely like hawkeagles and falcons oh well we arrre not anything you know hydona replied vaguely not hawk not falcon it isss not asss if sssomeone took bitsss and piecesss of birrrd and cat and patched usss togetherrr afterrr all yes but there are supposed to be gryphons north and west of valdemar elspeth persisted but there arent any in any of the inhabited lands i knowso where do you two come from wessst hydona shrugged you would not know the place even the hawkbrotherrsss had not hearrrd of it elspeth wasnt giving up that easily well is that where your kind comes from is that why there arent any gryphons in valdemar treyvan gave her a droll look out of the corner of his eye if you arrrre asssking if we arrre a kind of changechild orrrr pelagirrr monssterrrr he replied i can tell you that we arrre not and thanksss be to sssskandrrranon forrr that we werrrre crreated by one of the grreat magessss the mage of ssssilence whom we knew asss urrrtho that wasss a long time ago beforrre the mage warrrs he crrrreated the hertasssi asss well and othersss that wasss hisss grrreat powerrr and joy to crrreate new crrreaturessss ssso they sssay before elspeth could leap in with another question hydona yawned hugely and looked up at the sky it isss late she said abruptly and i am hungerrred even if trrreyvan isss not not hungerrred enough forrr falcon treyvan chuckled but a nicsse clawful of geesssse noworrr a young deerr hydona parted her beak in a gryphonic smile i think we will leave you now darrrkwind until tomorrow then he said smoothing vrees feathers with one hand sleep well and pass my affections on to lytha and jerven mine too elspeth piped up to darkwinds surprise tomorrrrow treyvan agreed the two gryphons moved off down a side path that would take them to the entrance of the vale they couldnt possibly take off from within it for the interlacing branches of the great trees would make it too difficult for them to fly without damage to themselves or the trees elspeth looked after them for a moment then made a little shrug and turned back to darkwind from her expression there was a lot going on behind her eyes is there something bothering you he asked thinking she might have questions about the lesson just past but her observations had nothing to do with magic they are certainly very good at avoiding questions they dont care to answer she pointed out dryly this isnt the first time ive tried to pin them down about where they come from and what they are and their answers have always been pretty evasive you can trust them he felt moved to protest oh i have no doubt of that after all need trusted them and shes about the most suspicious thing in the universe but they seem to have as many secrets as a companion this with a glance at gwena who shook her head and mane and snorted i had the feeling that they hadnt told the tayledras much more than theyve told me he nodded slowly she was absolutely right about that anyway he hadnt quite realized how little he knew about them really the fact that they had been his friends for so long had obscured the fact that what he knew about them was only what they had chosen to reveal there had been any number of surprises from them lately the fact that they were fluent in the ancient kaledain tongue for instance and just how much of a mage treyvan really was that they spoke of urtho as if they knew the lost history of the mage wars in much greater detail than any tayledras did as if that history hadnt been lost to their people whoever and wherever those people were interesting very interesting but it was so frustrating they didnt even work at being mysterious the way elspeths friend skif did they just were it gave him enough food for thought that he remained silent all the way back to elspeths ekele and from the expression on her face she found plenty of room for speculation there herself chapter eleven skif packed the new supplies he had gotten from the hertasi carefully cymry needed to be able to move with the same agility she had without packs once they got back on the trail lumpy and unbalanced packs would not make either of them very happy you look like a hawkbrother elspeth observed from the rock beside him like everything in the vale it had been made to look natural while being placed in the perfect position to be used as a seat and had been carefully sculpted to serve that very purpose she sat crosslegged with a patch of sun just touching her hair there were already a few white threads in it he wondered how long it would be before she was completely silver wintermoon had confided that elspeth was handling more of the powerful energies of nodemagic in her first few months than most tayledras adepts touched in a year or more and she spent a great deal of time in the unshielded presence of the heartstone while wintermoon was quite certain that none of this would harm her he did warn skif that her training and the discipline needed to handle such powers might cause some changes in his friend and not just physical ones indeed there were some changes since he had left the vale elspeth seemed a little calmer and considerably more in control of her temper she no longer reminded him of kero or her mother she was only purely elspeth his very dear friendbut no more he could not imagine anyone having a romantic attachment to this cool contemplative person it would be like having a fixation on a statue he glanced up at her and smiled so do you he said it suits you she really did look like a hawkbrother she was growing her hair longer and although it wasnt yet the stark white of a mage or the mottled camouflage colors of a scout she had somehow learned the tayledras tricks of braiding it so that it stayed out of the way without looking severe and the tunic and trews she woreflowing silk in deep burgundy cut so that the tunic fastened up the side with little antlertipswell it suited her much better than anything shed ever worn at home what happened to your whites he asked she laughed they disappeared and i have the feeling i wont see them again until were ready to leave i have the feeling that the hertasi disapprove of uniforms on principle whenever i ask about them the hertasi give me this look and say theyre being cleaned its been weeks now and theyre still being cleaned mine are probably with yours skif said wintermoon wouldnt let me bring them he said they werent even suited to winter work he made me get scouts gear she chuckled a little im beginning to agree with kerowyn about whites she told him at least about the way theyre made you get tired of them they cant have changed in hundreds of yearsyou know we really could stand to have a style choice at least he shrugged probably nobody ever thought much about it he lifted the pack experimentally it was about as heavy as he wanted cymry to carry and after all it wasnt as if they were cut off from ksheyna and more provisions thats going to do it i think elspeth measured the pack with her eyes whats thattwo weeks rations at the most about well be back in by then he fastened both packs to cymrys saddle and turned back to elspeth im sorry i didnt have any news for you she shrugged ill tell you the truth big brotheri really dont think its all that important for me to get need back even assuming shed be willing to return to me which i doubt i think it is important for you to find nyara for both your sakes he flushed but didnt reply to that directly another change she was either much improved at reading body language or she had picked up an uncanny ability to intuit things i dont know how much youre aware of the weather in here but were just about on to winter out there he said we wont be able to cover as much ground once it starts snowing she didnt seem concerned take as much time as you need our orders havent changed no one needs us back home and i need training as complete as i can get gwena says that things havent deteriorated with ancar and hardorn any more than they had the last time we got word it might simply be the weather theyre already into winter up there and no one sane or insane attacks in winter he nodded with luck youll be ready by spring he had other unspoken thoughts and with more luck your darkwind will be willing to come along when we leave he smiled but only to himself elspeth wasnt the only one good at reading body language elspeth shifted her position a little well weve also got the possibility of some new allies according to gwena theres some indication that talia dirk and alberich are getting somewhere in negotiating with the karsites thewhat he felt his eyebrows flying up into his hairline with astonishment last thing he had heard people were simply grateful that the karsites were too embroiled with ancar and their own internal politics to harass the border they shared with valdemar when did all this start early fallabout when we reached here she said sorry i forgot that i didnt hear about it until after you left she looked up and frowned a little let me see if i can tell you this all straight ive been getting it in bits and pieces alberich got some tentative contacts with someone supposedly official in the karsite army through a really roundabout path it was supposed to be someone he knew and tentatively trusted from karse he could hardly believe it how did anything get out of karse convolutedly of course gwena said the pathway involved traders and the renegade faction of the sunlord that keeps allegiance with valdemar she raised an eyebrow not the most secure line of communication and the message was pretty vague sort ofwe might be willing to talk to you people if you happened to show up at this place and time he wasnt sure he trusted it at all but it was the first positive gesture weve had from those people in hundreds of years so he didnt want to dismiss it out of handbut it could have been a trap counting on the idea that he might be homesick he wouldnt and hed be right skif agreed she snickered surely anybody whod think that doesnt know alberich anyway that was about a month ago he and eldan and kero checked the stories out and they seemed to be genuine two weeks ago they were actually approached officially then a week ago mother arranged for talia and dirk to go down to the border the holderkin lands and meet an envoy from the karsite government which means the sunpriests he tried the thought out in his mind any idea what started all this elspeth started to chuckle he gave her a quizzical glance if gwena is relaying what rolan told her correctlyits as convoluted as the karsites are the infighting settled this falland the priestking suddenly seems to be a queen now the envoys are half women and talia had picked up a kind of grim were all women together kind of feeling from them though whether thats their feeling about her or the priestqueens feeling about selenay i dont know interesting skif said absently in either case the chances of coming to an agreement were much better thats only the first factor ancar has been harassing them much more than he has us probably because they dont have that antimagic defense we do that it seems was bad enough but now hes stealing the sunpriests pet demons and that was absolutely the last straw she grinned like a horse trader whos just sold an illtempered plainspony as a shinain stud that must have doubly stuck in their throatsnot only to have to come to us the unholy usersofmagic but to hav to admit that they were using magic themselves ah if i know talia she was very careful about not rubbing their noses in the fact he shook his head and chuckled thats something i would have had a hard time doing you and me both she admitted anyway thats where things stand at home with luck we can at least get them to promise not to harry our borders until ancar is dealt with once and for all skif rubbed the back of his neck and stared off into the distance north and east id like to be there he said more than half to himself i really would peace with our old enemy havens wouldnt that be something ill believe it when it happens she replied for now its enough to know we arent the only ones that ancars been hurting that at least opens up the possibility of uniting against a common enemy he shook off his reverie amazing but i have my own job to take care of standing here and biting my nails over something happening hundreds of leagues away is not going to accomplish much of anything i have patrol with darkwind she told him were taking an evening shift with one of the scouts that flies an owl hes got some beasties hanging about at night that he wants a mage to have a look at gryphons too he asked with interest he liked treyvan and hydona a great deal and his sole regret in going out with wintermoon was that he was unable to learn more about them no theyre going to stay with the little ones we monopolize enough of their time as it is she started to chuckle whats so funny skif wanted to know oh just their kyreefriend rris the kyree are usually so dignified torrl is anyway but rris is likelike a big puppy all bounce and friendliness but whats funniest is that hes just full of stories about my famous cousin warrl that sounded familiar somehow warrl thatthat cant be the same kyree that was keros teachers bondmate is it she nodded vigorously the same and hearing the same stories kero used to tell us told from the kyree point of view is an absolute stitch he sighed another thing he was missing well he couldnt be here and out there at the same time and on the whole he was doing better and more productive work out there there had been an encounter with another pack of wyrsathis time on their terms and he and wintermoon had destroyed them thered been more of those gandels that theyd had to lure into a pittrapand some smaller but still nasty encounters all of which meant hazards no ksheyna scout would have to face something that winterlight the new scoutleader had been quick to point out to the council permission to return to the search had been readily given though several of wintermoons friends told him he was crazy staying out in the winterbound forest when he could be warm and comfortable in the vale in his offduty hours anyway skif still wasnt quite certain of wintermoons motivation but the scout had told him repeatedly that even if he had been running patrols he would have continued to live in his ekele outside the vale that to him winter camping was no great hardship if that was the way he felt skif would take his words at face value wed better get going then he said wintermoon should have gotten the coldweather gear together by now already he wanted to be back on the huntdarkwind and gwena are probably waiting for me id better go get my scout gear on she bounced to her feet and planted a kiss on his cheek see you in about two weeks right he patted her on the head as if she were a very small child she mocksnarled at him dont get into too much trouble all right hah me with a wave she was gone the first snow of the season was going to be a substantial one does winter always start soenthusiastically skif asked his guide as they arranged things in the shelter they had rigged beneath the overhanging limbs of a huge pine it was a very small shelter compared to the waystations the heralds used but it was big enough for two if no one moved much skif couldnt begin to guess what it was made of some kind of waterproof silk perhaps wintermoon had taken it from a pouch scarcely bigger than a rolledup shirt light for now came from a tiny lantern holding a single candle suspended from the roof not much and not very bright wintermoon shrugged sometimes yes sometimes no he replied often it depends upon what the magyes have done great fluxes in the energyflow of magic can change the weather significantly usually to make it worse now he tells me skif said to the roof of the tent havens if id known that id have kept everyone out of that todo with falconsbane oh that was not significant the hawkbrother replied carelessly not enough to make any real difference building a gate nowone has to make certain that the weather is going to hold clear for several days if one has a choice or any storm will worsen if they manage to drain the heartstonethat would be significant very much so that is why we try always to work the greater magics in stable times of the year for a nonmage you certainly know a lot skif observed wintermoon only laughed one must if one is tayledras as one must know horses even if one is a musician or weaver if one is also shinain magic is so much a part of what we do that we all of us are affected by it if only in the bleaching of hair and eyes he completed rigging his own sleeping place and eyed skifs pad of pine boughs dubiously are you certain that you wish to sleep upon that it looks very cold and stiff and i brought a second hammock im used to it skif replied im not used to being suspended like a bat well it is warmer so wintermoon looked out of the flap of the tent and resecured it this will be a heavy storm i think we will be here until well past midmorning at the least nothing is like to be moving this night not even a colddrake comforting at least nothing can wrap us up in our tent and carry us away the two owls corwith and ktathi had perches in one corner of the shelter packs took up the remaining space including beneath wintermoons hammock making the area very crowded cymry and the dyheli had a leanto rigged against the side of the shelter and were huddled together under blankets are you all right he asked his companion if youre too cold well find some other way no worse than if id been up north she told him better in fact the snow may be heavy but it isnt that cold really and the dyheli are warm and good company well if she wasnt going to complain he wasnt going to worry hawkbrother winter gear was a lot better than his own lighter for one thing instead of relying on layers of wool fur and leather for their bedrolls and heavyweather coats they had something light and fluffy sandwiched between layers of what he knew to be waterproof spider silk because the hertasi had told him so no cloaks for them either cloaks were all very well if you were spending most of your time on horseback but not if you were trying to make your way through a pathless forest cloaks caught on every outstretched twig the slickfinished coats did not would we were mages wintermoon observed wistfully we could make lights heati have a brazier but it needs a smoke hole and that lets in as much cold as the brazier supplies heat in any kind of wind skif shook his head i dont know about that according to elspeth an adept doesnt need to make heat he can ignore the cold oh that is possible but there is a price in weariness wintermoon told him keeping warm requires some kind of power whether it be the power of the fire or the power of magic if she has not learned that yet she will ah he felt a bit better i thought that sounded a bit too much likewellmagic tayledras magic is no more than work with tools other than hands wintermoon laughed or so i keep telling my magefriends my brother said that i think of all the mages i know he is the most sensible for he never relies on his power when his hands will do it occurred to skif that given that philosophy darkwind was probably the best teacher elspeth could have she tended to fall prey to enthusiasm about anything new and look to it as the solution for every problem darkwind should keep her from falling prey to that fault are you changing our tactics now that weve had heavy snow he asked actually it will be easier wintermoon slid into his hammock with a sigh bundled up to the neck as he was he looked like a humanheaded cocoon the trees are leafless snow covers the ground nyara will be hard put to hide the signs of her passing of her living the owls will most probably find her we thoughwe will be facing more of the hunters and performing our secondary task for the clan the season of stupid young is over the season of dying old not yet on us this is the season of hunger for the hunters this is when we truly prove our worth to ksheyna skif climbed into his own bedroll and shivered as he waited for it to warm around his body the hot springs and summerlike atmosphere of the vale seemed a world away the clan means a lot to you doesnt it even though though my father rejected me the clan saw to it i was not left parentless wintermoon said firmly it is more than simple loyalty ksheyna is my family in every way that matters can you understand that who had no real family i sometimes wonder maybe if i hadnt been chosen skif listened to the soft ticking of snow falling on the fabric of the shelter listened to the creaking of boughs in the forest beyond i do have a family you know more fathers and mothers brothers and sisters than i can count the heralds gave me that and they are my family in every way that counts sothe heralds are a kind of clan wintermoon asked curiously a clan that is not related by blood but bypurpose i guess we are it was an intriguing thought one that had its own logic interesting i want my own family though eventually well i told you all about that where wintermoon wanted to know have you a place that has won your heart his first thought was that farmhouse so long ago that was something he had to think about back at haven i suppose though it could be anywhere come to that theres a lot of peace here more than there is at home now that he thought about it if there was any one place hed seen in all of his travels that he felt called to him it was here the vale seems serene tranquil i dont really understand why you dont spend more time there appearances can be deceiving wintermoon replied dryly if you were at all sensitive to the currents of magic you would find it less than peaceful even if the stone were intact and every vale is under a constant state of siege when it isnt it is time to move on to a new one but youhow could you bear to leave the city i should think you would miss the people and all the doings there must be much to keep you busy there not that much he considered the question its just as easy to be lonely in a city as out in the wilderness easier really its harder to get to know someone when you meet in a crowded place people can freely ignore you in the city they can assume they dont have any responsibility for you when there are fewer people i think they begin assuming some kind of responsibility simply because you naturally do the same perhaps but let me show you how a vale appears to me before you assume that it is a kind of wonderland there was silence for a moment take the vale itself there is the constant undercurrent of magic even in a vale with an intact heartstone because magic is how the place is maintained it is as if there were always bees droning somewhere nearby or something humming in a note so low it is felt more than heard then there are ever there underfoot wintermoon sighed they mean well but they are so social they are nearly hiveminded they cannot understand that one might wish to be without company id noticed that skif chuckled if im not asleep there always seemed to be a hertasi around wanting to know if i needed anything and if you are asleep they are there still it can get tiresome wintermoon said with resignation they also do not see that some of us can live without certain luxuries for instancedid they steal your clothing skif blinked with surprise whyyes they do not approve of it wintermoon told him i am certain of that it is too plain too severe you will not see it again until you are ready to leave and even then i fear they will have made alterations to it skif choked on a laugh oh no doubt this is amusing but what if one prefers simpler clothing what if one prefers to make ones own food what if one would rather his quarters were left undisturbed then there is the matter of my clansfolk what about them skif asked several matters the one which concerns both of us is the attitude that those with little magic are less important wintermoons voice conveyed faint bitterness it matters not that someone must do the hunting must keep the borders secure must meet with the shinain and arrange for those few things we cannot make there are a hundred things each day that must be done that need no magic yet those of us whose magic is only in the realm of thought and not of power are at least in this clan often discounted that might only be because of starblade skif pointed out it could change indeed it may and i hope it will but if it does notyou wingsib will soon or late find yourself accounted of less worth than your friend elspeth the bedroll warmed and skif relaxed into it that wouldnt be anything new he replied drowsily back home after all shes the queens daughter and im nobody important ah the tiny candle dimmed and died leaving them in the darkness on the other side of the tent wall one of the dyheli snored gently a purring sound like a sleepy cat they also do not much care for changecreatures you mean nyara skif forced himself to think of her dispassionately well well worry about that when we find her no point in getting worked up over something that hasnt happened yet they have other prejudices wintermoon warned outsiders in general tend to be met with arrows and killingbolts and that is not the ksheyna way only that holds for all clans only your acceptance by the shinain and the presence of your companions kept you from gaining a similar welcome skif yawned im sorry wintermoon but im drifting off i wish i could concentrate on what youre saying but i cant the tayledras sighed i suppose it is just as well he admitted i am losing track of my thoughts skif gave up trying to fight off sleep we can take this up in the morning maybe he muttered after a while and he never heard wintermoons answer there was too much light coming in the tower window nyara unwrapped herself from her furs and winced as cold air struck her she wrapped a single wolfskin about her shoulders and moved cautiously to the narrow slit in the eastern wall she looked out of her tower window on a world transformed and panicked snow the forest is covered in snow it was at least kneedeep deeper in some places the wall below her glittered with patches of icepredictably wherever there were hand and footholds what am i going to do she wasnt ready for this she still hadnt worked out a way of getting up and down her wall in snow and ice she wasnt nearly good enough a hunter yet all the game must have gone into hiding or worse into hibernation it will see me coming long before im in range and i cant run or leap as fast itll be like trying to run in soft sand but so cold her mind ran around in little circles like a frightened mouseand it was that image that enabled her to get hold of herself stop that she told herself sternly she forced herself to sit and think as need had taught her to use all that energy that was going into panic for coming up with answers the first and most immediate problem was how she was going to get down out of the tower to hunt in the first place and she had already come up with one possibility she just hadnt done anything about it yet well now she was going to have to we have plenty of rope and no one is going to cross all that snow without leaving tracks a baby rabbit could see so theres no harm in using a rope to get up and down with no one will get in here to use it without my knowing i can just secure one end of the rope up here and climb down that way that isnt perfect but then what is and as for game well whatever hampered her would also hamper the game in fact as cold as it was she could even think about creating a hoard for emergencies if she hung the carcasses just inside the tower theyd stay frozen if she put them high enough theyd be out of reach of what scavengers were brave enough to venture inside with her scent all over everything she could even take deer now and not worry about spoilage and since she hadnt bothered the deer yet they did not yet regard her as a predator snow would be at least as hard on them as it was on her i can pull the carcasses easier through the snow too i wont have to try to cut them up to carry them backwith a plan in mind at least for getting into and out of her shelter and the possibility of new game to augment the old she looked down on the forest with curiosity rather than fear she had never seen snow before not like this falconsbane had copied the tayledras whether he admitted it or not keeping the grounds of his stronghold free of ice and snow and warmed to summer heat he had hated winter hated snow and ice and spent most of the wintry days locked up inside his domain whiling away the hours in magery or pleasure the only time she had ever seen snow was when she had ventured to the gates and had looked out on a thin slice of winter woods and trampled roadway from the tiny and heavilybarred windows she was not permitted on the tower tops lest she attempt to climb down and escape and the windows in wintertime were kept shuttered and locked against the season she had always dreaded the coming of winter for during the winter months her father often became bored it was difficult for his creatures to move through the snow even more difficult for them to slip into the hawkbrothers lands unseen and of course falconsbane would not venture outside unless it was an absolute emergency so his own activities were greatly curtailed humans tended to keep to their dwellings in winter and the intelligent creatures to band together so the opportunities for acquiring victims were also reduced he dared not be too spendthrift with the lives of his servants for there were only so many of them and fewer opportunities to get more they were trapped within the walls too and if he pushed them too far they might become desperate enough to revolt even he knew that so falconsbanes entertainments had to be of his own devising when he grew bored he often designed changes he wished to make in his own appearance and worked them out on her an activity that often as not ranged from mildly to horribly painful and when that palled there were other amusements in which she became his plaything the old games she now hated but had then both loathed and desired no until now winter had not been her favorite season spring and fall had been bestspring because her father was out of the stronghold as often as possible eager to escape the toofamiliar walls and fall because he was seizing his last opportunities to get away before winter fell but this year the coming of winter had not induced the fear that it had in the past odd i wonder why then she realized that all the signs of winter that she had learned to fear were things falconsbane had created the increasing number of magelights to compensate for the shortening days the rising temperature in the stronghold and the shuttering of the windows against the gray sky any mage might do those thingsthere were other signs in falconsbanes stronghold that marked the season of fear forcedgrowth of strange plants brought in to flower in odd corners creating tiny often dangerous magelit gardens many of those plants were poisonous some had envenomed thorns or deadly perfumes it was one of her fathers pleasures to see who would be foolish enough to be entrapped by them more slaves in the quarters reserved for those falconsbane intended to use up slaves usually young and attractive but not terribly bright her father tended to save the intelligent warping their minds to suit his purposes keeping them for two or even three years before pique or a fit of temper brought their twisted lives to a close strained expressions on the faces of those who hoped to survive the winter and feared they might not sometimes usually in the darkest hours of the winter her fathers temper exceeded even his formidable controlthough most of the victims were those former favorite slaves there had been none of that this year the shortening of the days had not signaled anything to her and she had simply reacted to the long nights by sleeping more there had been no blazing of lights in every corner to wake old memories merely the flickering of her own friendly fire there was no tropic heat to awaken painful unease only the need to move everything closer to the firepit and to build up a good supply of wood this place that she lived in could be called squalid compared to the lush extravagancies of an adepts lair but it was hers she had made it so with pride the first place she could truly call her own unfettered by her fathers will the wood and rope and furs were placed by her desires alone with the advice and help of need who had become a trusted friend taken as a sum of goods it was insignificant taken in its context it was delightful the view from her window surprised her with unexpected beauty the ugliest tangles of brush and tumbled rock had been softened by the thick blanket of snow it was astonishing it took her breath away she simply admired it for many long moments before turning her thoughts back to the reality that it represented it could also be deadly to one who had no real experience in dealing with it u a tn overwhelm her ss jiva for a moment a feeling oi neipiessne ith panic again quelled it no point in getting upseti have need she can always any problems that come up if we have to she can deal with et aga hours hours when she had as a good sht and howling it w month her then she would have been cw to move t hawkbroti qi tely she fell asleep doing so de j oiie had drained herself that badly venture outsit were greatly cv d afternoon the sheer unthinking r sword panic was gone although the fear remained somehow she managed that day and the next and the next she found game building a blind beside the pond where the ducks and geese came to feed and covering it with snow she caught a goose that very night and not content with that hung it in her improvised larder to freeze and scoured the forest for rabbits she didnt catch any of those but she discovered a way to fish in the icecovered ponds using a bit of metal found in the tower scuffed until shiny as bait she hauled wood up to her shelter and kept it reasonably warm and dry made plans for a blind up in one of the trees above a deertrail so that she could lie in ambush for one somehow she kept panic from overwhelming her at the thought that the sword was no longer protecting her from detection for if something had happened to need she would have to protect herself she had no choice not if she wanted to live sooner or later something would come seeking her she spent hours crouched beside the fire bringing up everything need had ever told her about shielding about her own magic then she spent more hours constructing layer after layer of shields tapping into the sluggish power of the sleeping forest and into her own energies but to tap into her own power she needed a great deal of rest and foodwhich brought her right back to the problem of provisions she decided that she must start hunting deer that there was no choice that it was the only way to buy her the necessary days of rest and recovery when she built up her shielding the rest of the timethe hours of darkness before sleep finally cameshe spent bent over the sword begging pleading with it to come back to life prodding and prying at it to try and discover what had gone wrong something must have there was no reason for the blade to simply fall silent like that not without warning and all with no result the blade was a sword now no more no less a weapon that she could not even use properly for without needs skill guiding her she was as clumsy as a child in wielding it finally after trying so hard on the evening of the third day that she worked herself into a reactionheadache she gave up falling into an exhausted sleep a sleep so deep that not even her despair penetrated it dreamless sleep so far as she knew when she woke again quite late on the morning of the fourth day the clouds had vanished overnight and sun blazed down through the windows of her tower with cold clear beams when she looked out of her window she had to pull back with her eyes watering it was too bright out there too bright to see the sun reflected from every surface and although there were shadows under the trees they were not dark enough to give her eyes any rest now she knew what her fathers men had meant when they spoke of snow blindness there was no way she was going to be able to see out there without getting a headache unless she found some way to shade her eyes shading her eyes probably wouldnt do that much good there would still be all the light reflecting up from the snow wait though she could change her eyes after all of needs lessons she had a little control over her body she might be able to make her eyes a little less sensitive temporarily perhaps darken them to let less light throughits about time you started looking inside yourself for answers came the raspy familiar mindvoice she whirled turning away from the light peering through shadows that were nearblack in contrast with the intense sunlight youre back she cried staring at the vague shape of the sword leaning against the firepit where she had left it the night before i never left need said smugly i just decided to let you see you could manage completely on your own for a while anger flared she took a deep breath and fought it down anger served no purpose unless it was channeled anger only weakened her and could be used as a weapon against her she reminded herself that need never did anything without a good reason anger faded enough so that she was in control not the emotion she tried not to think of the fear the first hours of desperationof all the endless hours when she had been certain that she would not live through this season that would only make her angry again why she asked bluntly why did you do that to me i didnt do anything to warrant being punished did i the sword didnt answer directly look around you what do you see the game stocked away the firewood all the defenses you constructed she didnt have to look she knew what was there get to the point she snapped why did you leave me alone like that why did you leave me defenseless did i do any of that any of the things youve accomplished in the last few days did i hunt the game catch the fish rig that hidden ladder to the top there was a certain quality in needs words that overrode nyaras anger completely no nyara admitted slowly she had done quite a bit now that she thought about it without any help at all did i rig all these shields the sword persisted did i figure out the way to make them cascade so that the only one under power is the first one unless something contacts it no nyara replied this time with a bit of pride i did that given that her magic was pathetically weak compared to needs or even the least of the mages that her father controlled she really hadnt done too badly if i really was destroyed tomorrow would you be able to get away to hide to keep yourself alive the sword waited patiently for an answer and the answer nyara had for her was a very different one than the one she would have had a few days ago i think so she said nodding to herself yes i think so was that the point it was four days ago if i had asked that question you would have said you couldnt do without me now you know that you can needs mindvoice conveyed a hint of pride nyara smiled a little despite the remains of her anger need chuckled at her smile it wouldnt be easy for you to do without me and any number of creatures could take you in a heartbeat but i would give you even odds of being able to hide and stay hidden if you chose that route over fighting you were coming to depend on me too much and i am not invincible dear i can be hurt or even destroyed your father could have done it if hed known how any of the tayledras adepts could you needed to know you could survive if i was not here nyara considered that for a moment and let her anger cool another of needs ongoing lessonsanger used to make her incoherent now once it was under control it made her think with a little more focus that could be a problem too being too focused meant that you could miss something but it was better than being paralyzed and unable to think at all what about what youve been doing to fix what father did to me she asked i cant do that and it isnt finished it may never be finished need told her frankly it could take a healing adeptwhich i am notyears to change all the things that were done to you but you are doing some of that for yourself if you didnt recognize the problems and want the changes if you werent consciously helping me there wouldnt be any changes i cant work against resistance my dear oh nyara couldnt think of anything else to say theres something else i want you to consider a breath of chill breeze came in the window nyara shivered and moved away from it returning to the warmth of her furs she wrapped up in them cuddling down into their warmth and let her eyes readjust to the darkness of her tower room what she asked expecting something more along the same themeperhaps something about using her own magic more effectively what do you want asked the voice in her mind the question took her completely by surprise whwhat do you mean by that she stammered its a question no one has ever asked you beforeand one that you were never in a position to decide anyway need said patiently but you are out here in the wilderness no one knows where you are yet you are in a position to decide exactly what is going to happen to your life because theres no one here to affect you to do things you dont expect and havent planned for so what do you want assume all the power in the worldbecause my dear you have many powerful people who consider you a friend worthy of helping and they might just do that if you came to them and asked it of them the swords voice warmed you are quite worthy of being helped child though i dont want you to come to depend on it what did she want to be left alone was the first thing that sprang to her mindto be left alone there were no complications out here nothing to get in the way of simply living no emotional painthat is when need wasnt deserting her this was the first time in her life that she had been in a position of control over her own actions and reactions there was something very attractive about that butno it was lonely out here she was often too busy to think about the isolation but in the dark of the night sometimes she felt lonely enough that she had to fight back tears at first she had been too busy to think about it and then need had been enough company but now she wished there was someone else to talk to now and again someone who wasnt a teacher who was just a friend or maybe a little more than a friend the frequent urges of her body had not gone away they had simply become less compulsory and more under her own control but if she didnt want to be left alone that meant rejoining some portion of the outside world north meant other birdkin clans and she had been warned they were far less tolerant of changechildren south was dhorisha there were only two real directions for her east to the real outside world or west back to the ksheyna vale there were problems with both directions should she leave the area entirely and try to find someplace in the east where she could go but then what could she do she would have to find some way to support herself she had to eatthere was little or no huntingin lands that were farmed she would have to have clothing and a place to live and in civilized lands one couldnt wear roughtanned furs or live in a cave even assuming there were caves about to live in i could go to the lands where the outsiders came from when i am there i can track and hunt she said aloud i could hire out as a hunter or a guide or maybe as some kind of protector need indicated tentative agreement true but what are the drawbacks of running off like that into places you know nothing about and where you have no friends remember out there no one has ever seen anything quite like you they might not treat you well they might greet you with fear or hatred and you would be one against many if it came to hostility there was another optionone in which her alien appearance might be of some use i could hire out as a bedpartner there she didnt like the idea but it was a viable one it was one thing she was welltrained in skif had certainly been pleased again need indicated tentative agreement but with reservations you could do that and you would probably do very well but is that what you want i thought that was the point of this discussion she sighed no it isnt what i want it would be a choice but not a good one i supposeif i had to it would be better than starving but i dont have to go east do i if she didnt go eastthen she went west back to ksheyna back to where the outland strangers wereno point in avoiding it the one person in the whole world that she thought of with longing was that stranger the young man called skifwho was with ksheyna and the only hawkbrothers in the world who might look upon her with a certain amount of kindness were the ksheyna she had helped them after allfought against her fathers controls she was the reason they had known that one of their own was falconsbanes slave in a sense they did owe her a debtin more than a sense so did skif she had saved his life at the risk of her own and they had shared so much in such a relatively short period of time enough that the intensity of her feelings had frightened her that was more than half the reason why she had run away from him she did not want him near her while her fathers directives still ruled her so closely not while she wanted him so very badlyi rather thought so need said following her thoughts with a feeling of wry humor i rather thought that your skif would be in the equation somewhere is there anything wrong with that she asked defensively a little apprehensive that need would not approve after all when she had been a woman she had been celibate and now that she was a sword did she still understand feelings no child there is absolutely nothing wrong with that i think your emotions are quite healthy i think its just as well that you feel this way especially since hes out here looking for you she held quite still rigid with surprise what nyara had never experienced such mixed emotions in her life all of them painfully intense elation and fear joy and dismay she hugged her furs to herself and trembled i rather imagined youd react this way the sword all but sighed but there was an undercurrent of satisfied humor i suppose i have seen true love often enough to recognize it when it smacks me between the quillions from at least a dozen of my bearers and latelyfirst that sorceress who went into repopulating the plains all by herself then that kerowyn child and now you i am beginning to feel like a matchmaker perhaps i should give up my current calling and set up as a marriage broker very well nyara fought all of her emotions down enough to get some kind of answer out very well what she asked we know what you want so now we get you ready for it that young man needs and wants a partner youngsternot a little girl not just a bedmate not someone he has to drag about like an anchor and rescue at regular intervals so wed better start building you in that direction if the sword finished with a hint of dry sarcasm that suits you she sat up straighter a partner someone who could stand alone but chose to stay with another someone who just might come rescue him once in a while yes she said quietly calmly with her chin up that suits me very well chapter twelve trevalen trevalen closed his eyes and narrowed his consciousness pulling his concentration within himself until he was aware of nothing but himself a moment only he paused finding his balance and center and from deep withinhe stepped out onto the moonpaths into the spirit realms by virtue of their close bond with the stareyed any shinain could walk the moonpaths provided that it was at night under the full moon and he sought the place with unselfish intent and enough concentration any swordsworn could walk the moonpaths on any night and call and be answered by the leshya kalenedral the spiritwarriors sworn to the martial aspect of the goddess a shaman could walk the moonpaths into the spirit world at any time he chose and call and be answered by any spirit that lingered there if the spirit he sought was willingthat knowledge brought no comfort only doubt and trepidation and that is the question indeed is dawnfire willing dawnfire of taleedras but called by the shinain aspect of the goddess to serve in a form a shinain would recognizethe emblem of one of the four first clans he had called and spoken with her on several occasions now but each time he called it was with questioning and fear deep in his heart fear that this time she would not answer questioning his own motives kraheera had ordered him to remain at ksheyna vale to learn the stareyeds motive and purpose in creating a shinain avatar out of one of the hawkbrothers never had she created an avatar before much less one from a child of the sundered kin the magicusers if kraheera had speculations he kept them to himself trevalen had no guesses at all he had learned nothing of her motivation in all the time he had dwelt here he had however learned far too much of his own heart a heart that ached with loss and yearned for one that he could not touch ironic that he should discover the love of his life and his soulmate only after she wastechnically at leastdead but was that not like the goddess to create such ironies for her shaman keep to the journey traveler the moonpaths are peril enough without your wandering off them he walked the moonpaths dreamhunting in the spirit world keeping safely on the trails meant for the living and sending his call out into the golden mist beyond where lingering spirits lived golden mist for he hunted by daylight at night the mist would be silver this was not wearisome for a shaman though one who was not so trained returned to his body weary and drained if he dared to venture here and as a shaman he knew that time meant very little in this realm so he walked onward with patience waiting for the sign that would tell him that dawnfire was comingor not one moment he was alone then she was there before him in her hawkform hovering above the pathway on sunbright wings a great vorcelhawk glowing with a fierce inner light so full of energy that the mist about her crackled but this time instead of coming to rest upon the path as she always had before she spoke one word into his mind follow then she was gone diving out of the spirit realm with speed he could not matchbut leaving behind a glowing trail that he followed back back back to his body to the material world he sank into himself feeling crept back to arms and legs he put on the shell of himself as a comfortable garment he took a deep breath then opened his eyes to find the hawk that was dawnfire poised before him she watched him before he could blink his eyes twice the hawk shimmered a trembling like a heat haze passing over her intensifying the glow of her inner fire soon she glowed like a tiny sun as she had when she first transformed he looked away for a moment his eyes watering with the brightness when he looked back the hawk no longer perched there in its place was the transparent and radiant form of the woman he had never seen her this way in the real world only in the spirit realm a woman made of glowing liquid glasshe took a deep breath of surprise as she examined her hands and a smile crossed her lips he rose from his crosslegged pose and approached her not certain that he should but unable to keep at a distance i was not certain that i could do this though my teachers assured me it is no great accomplishment for me now she said a little shyly i was never a mage i am not really certain how i accomplish the half of what i do this was true speech and not the stumbling mindtomind talk he had gotten from her aforetimes he willed his hands to still their trembling and nodded i think i can understand how you feel he replied we are not mages either we shinain that we leave to her she dropped her eyes from his hungry gaze i wantedi wished to be with you in as real a way as i could she said slowly then she looked up and there was no mistaking the expression she wore even though her face was little more than air and power it showed a hunger and a desperation as great as his own i am not dead im justdifferent and i wanted to be like i was for a while he had never wanted anything more in his life than to take her hand he reached for her shaking a little stretching one hand across more than a gulf of physical distanceand she reached toward him their hands metone of solid flesh one of ephemeral energy he felt a gentle pressure warmthand it was enough almost so they could touch for just a moment letting touch and eyes say what words could not he withdrew first she brought her own hand back and set her face in a mask of calm although longing still stood nakedly in her eyes he did not know what to say to her i am not only here with you for my own sake she said after a moment of strained silence i am heremy teachers tell me that i must speak with you telling you what i have learned because i can see things anew being what i am now things they did not know and could not see maybe that is why i became what i amnot quite in the spirit world and not quite in the material world he nodded and set his own feelings aside this was the first time she had said anything like this the first time that she had given any hint of what kraheera wanted to know not that he had not asked her questions for he had until now she had shown great distress when he had asked her those questions about her current state so he had stopped asking them he feared she might stop coming to him he was afraid he might have frightened her with all his queries apparently not but then she was a brave woman and i do not think that she has ever run from what frightened her when you started asking me questionsi didnt want to think about them but i had to anyway she told him slowly like this there is no sleep no dreams to run to once i started thinking i started asking questions myself she stared off somewhere above his head for a moment and he held his breath as much to try and still the pain in his heart as in anticipation of what she might say next she could say she had to go leave him forever for the goddess willed it so this was far from easy for him he had dreamed of this woman for years ever since becoming a man since he had been initiated as a shaman the dreams had more power he had known in the way of the shaman even then that this woman was his soulpartner and yet he had never seen her when kraheera had asked him to stay and learn of her he had thought no more of it than any task the elder shaman had set him until she had first come to him on the moonpaths this dawnfire this transformed taleedras until he had seen her face and not the hawkmask of the avatar now he knew who and what she was and after the initial joy of discovery the knowledge was a burden and an agony to his soul for she was untouchableout of reachnot truly dead but assuredly not alive in the conventional sense there was no way in which she could become the partner his dreams had painted her as how could his dreams the dreams of a shaman which were supposed to be accurate to within a hair have been so very wrong there are threats and changes on the winds she said finally bringing his attention back to something besides his own pain terrible changes some of themor they have the potential to bring terror if they are not met and mastered one is a lost man of your own people whom we have faced once already no shinain no tayledras no outlander has the answer to these changes only pieces of the answers he groped after the answers that her words implied are you saying that the time for isolation to end is at hand that in itself was a frightening thought and a change few shinain would care for in part she did not breathe so she could not sigh but he had the impression that she did it is easy for me to see but hard to describe all peoples face a grave threat from the same source but three stand to lose the most the shinain for what we guard he completed that was a truism and always had been she nodded emphatically yes the tayledras also for what we knowand the outlanders of valdemar for what they are and somehow those threats are as woven together as the lives of the outlanders and the sundered kin have become in these last few days she shook her head in frustration i cannot show you and i do not have the words that i need that is the closest that i can come but trevalen understood what she said only crystalized things he had halffelt for some time now this is no accident no coincidence that things have fallen out as they have he said firmly it is less even than you guess she responded immediately and that confirmed another halfformed guessthat it had been the careful hands of the gods that had worked to bring them all here together himand the outlanders this path that we are all on was begun farther back than even our enemies know i can see it stretching back to the time of the mage wars there were cataclysms then that are only now echoing back to us a cold hand of fear gripped his throat at that driving out other thoughts what do you mean he asked carefully she searched visibly for words her gaze unfocused as though she were watching something that she tried to describe for him like a sighted woman describing the stars to a blind man neither urtho nor his enemy were truly aware of what they unleashed upon the world it is as if what they did has created a real echo except that this echo rather than being fainter than the original catastrophe has lost none of its strength as it moved across time and the face of the world and nowit returns it sweeps across our world back to its origin but what has this to do with us trevalen cried those were mages of awesome powerwhat has this to do with us and what we can do surely we cannot counter their magics it is all we can do to hold them away from those who would use them she shook her head dumbly at a complete loss for an answer i can only tell you what i see she replied slowly unhappily you asked me of the past and present and this is what i see the future is closed to me he was at as much of a loss as she and slowly lowered himself to a stone within arms reach of her translucent form they sat together for a long and painful moment as he tried to think of words to give her something with a bit of meaning to it this i think must be what kraheera sensed when he charged me with remaining here he said finally he is my senior in much perhaps he can give us an answer perhaps kethra can or one of your own people i shall speak with kethra and my teachers i shall relay this to the kalenedral when you do this speak of the need to speak to one another hawkbrothers shinain and outlanders all she said interrupting him that much i do see there has been overmuch of sundering of the keeping of secrets it is time for some of this to end secrets he looked up at her and he knew that longing and pain were plain upon his face plain enough that any child would see and know them and the cause i must go she said abruptly she did not stand up so much as gather her energies about her and rise her form began to fluctuate and waver and he held back frustration that she was so near and yet untouchable except for a moment or two despite all that she had told him his heart cried out for herhis own pain eclipsing the importance of her words she turned toward him held out her hand i she said falteringly he had not expected to hear her speak again and the sound of her voice made him start in surprise she was in a kind of intermediate form womanly with her human face but a suggestion of great wings again the power in her made her difficult to look at as she wore the glory of the noon sun on her like a garment but he would not look away though his eyes streamed tears i have seen your true heart and i see your pain trevalen she said ii share it beloved then she was gone leaving him with a heart torn in pieces and a mind and soul gone numb darkwind waited for his brother at the edge of the vale packs in his hand and shivered as he looked out on the snow he was not hardened to this weather not as he would have been at this time last winter then he had sheltered outside the protection of the vale and most time not spent in sleeping had been spent in the snow he had not gone back to his old ekele except to gather his things and bring them back to the vale with the help of several friends he had been one of the first to do so but now that the vale no longer troubled the bondbirds most of the scouts had followed his example and returned to the shelter and safety of the rocky walls and enclosing shields probably even wintermoon would join them when his search was over darkwinds brother was stubborn but not foolish shelter and safety the vales held indeedand comfort which was something only someone who had never been without comfort scorned this was going to be a hard winter it had begun that way and all signs pointed to the weather worsening before spring the vale was warm with hertasi to take care of everyday tasks difficult to resist such comforts when the winter winds howled around ones windows and drafts seeped in at every seam especially when the ekeles of those within the vale needed no protections from the cold when hot springs waited to soak away aches and bruises when windows could stand open to the breezewell they could if one lived on a lower level at any rate the ekeles near the tops of the trees tended to find themselves whipped by wilder winds than those near the ground he smiled through his shivers at recalling when nightsky had left her windows ajarand came back after a lesson to find belongings strewn about the room she had learned quickly that it was as well to leave the windows closed few lived in those upper levels in ksheyna with the population so reduced there was little competition for dwellings nearer the vale floor one or two still preferred heights but never scouts after returning from a long day on patrol the very last thing anyone cared to do was to climb a ladder for several stories just to get home to rest darkwind was no different in that respect from any of the rest of the scouts once the general consensus was reached that a move back to the vale would be a good thing for all he had stayed with his father for a brief while in part to help kethra at night then moved into an ekele in the lowest branches his tree stood near the waterfall end of the vale so that both the cool water of the waterfall pools and a nearby hot spring were available he ran his patrols with elspeth and her companion as he had since the coming of autumn but now he returned with gratitude to the warmth and the comfort of the vale and he pitied wintermoon for his selfchosen exile to the winterbound forest on the other hand we cant seem to track down nyara from within the vale ive tried looking for her but sheor that swordhave shielded themselves too well to spot i am glad it isnt me out there ktathi had flown in just before he and elspeth went out on patrol carrying a message a written one since it was fairly complicated wintermoon and skif had given a good portion of food to a tervardi temporarily disabled by an encounter with changelions rather than lose any great amount of time wintermoon was leaving skif with the birdman and coming in to fetch replacements and enough food over to keep the tervardi fed while he healed so would darkwind be so good as to put together thusandso and meet him and his dyheli friends at the mouth of the vale at sunset darkwind not only would he was glad to it often seemed to him that there was never a great deal he could do for wintermoon he and his brother had very little in common and wintermoons position as elder often led to him being the one to lend aid to the younger brother wintermoon seldom asked favors of anyone he was as much a bachelor falcon as darkwind if not more so with that in mind darkwind went out of his way to root through some of the old storehouses and uncover the last few coldlights magecloaks and a fireless stove left from the days when mages in ksheyna could lend their powers to making aids to the scouts it had been a very long time since scouts of ksheyna made overnight patrolsand a very long time since any of them had been willing to use magemade things for fear that the creatures of the uncleansed lands might sense them he thought that skif and wintermoon might well be willing to chance that since they were between ksheyna and the cleansed outland the cloaks kept the wearer warm and dry there were five enough for both humans and the companion and dyheli to sleep beneath the stove should be good for several weeks of use or so his testing had confirmedand should heat the tiny tent his brother and the outlander shared quite cozily when he asked for permission to take the things iceshadow had queried with a lifted eyebrow whether they needed itor were keeping warm some other way he had answered the same way that the notion was wildly unlikely he still was not certain about outlander prejudices in that regard but he knew his brother well enough to be certain that young skif was not likely to become wintermoons bedmate unless they encountered some wild magic on the borders that wrought a complete change of sex in either of them the last gray light of afternoon faded and died away creeping from the forest by imperceptible degrees and deepening the shadows beneath the trees he shivered in a breath of cold air that crept across the veil and hoped that wintermoon would arrive soon it had been a very long day and he was bone weary he and elspeth had tracked and driven off a pair of changelionsperhaps even the same ones that injured that tervardi in factand it had not been an easy task in kneedeep snow even elspeths companion had been of little help not with the snow so deep and soft the cats with their snowshoelike paws had a definite advantage in weather like this it had been snow with ice beneath they had slipped and slid so often that he reckoned they were both black and blue in a fair number of places he wanted to get back to his ekele to the hot pool beneath it he thought briefly about seeking one of the other scouts for company then dismissed the idea there were several women of ksheyna who were friends willing and attractive but none of them were elspeth stupid dont be an idiot dont complicate matters shes your friend sometimes your student be wise enough to leave it at that you arent living a romancetale you have work enough and more to do stillshe was a competent partner now as well he felt more confident in his magic and so did she as a team they were efficient and effective working with the gryphons had been a stroke of genius a white shape flickered through the branches ahead ghosting just under the branches in silence a breath of snowfog with a twin coming in right behind it vree cried a greeting not the challenge scream but the whistling call no outsider ever heard a long deep hooo hoohooo answered him and one of the two owls swooped up across the veil and onto a branch just above darkwinds head the second followed his brother and as he flew up to land above darkwind made out the distant figure of someone riding through the barren bushes and charcoalgray tree trunks of the unprotected forest the dyheli waded through the soft snow easily his thin legs having no trouble with drifts a man would be caught in his sharp cleft hooves cutting footholds in the ice beneath astride him was wintermoon behind the first dyheli came the second unladen his breath puffing frostily out of his nostrils wintermoon waved as soon as he saw darkwind grinning broadly since he was not normally given to such things as broad grins darkwind was a bit surprised being with that outlander has done him some good then loosened him up it occurred to him that wintermoon might have found himself a real friendrarer still a close friendin the outlander herald could it be mutual perhaps they had learned that they had a lot in common skif had struck him as rather a loner himself a close friend was something so far as darkwind knew his brother had never had before about time too wintermoon and the dyheli crossed the veil and the scout slid from the dyhelis back to land beside his brother darkwind he said obviously pleased thank you for doing this yourself and thank you for fetching the supplies for me at all whats all this wintermoon briefly embraced his brother and indicated this with a toe to one of the extra bundles i did not ask you for nearly so much and it doesnt look like provisions i know briefly darkwind told his brother what he had put together for the little expedition wintermoon frowned at that i dont know i hesitate to use anything magic made out there ive shielded it as best i can darkwind pointed out we have been using magic without attracting trouble for many weeks now and if i were the one doing the scouting i would weight the warmth and light very heavily in any decisions i made winter is only just upon us and already it has the vale locked around with ice and snow it will be worse out there it already is worse wintermoon eyed the bundle dubiously but then heaved it onto his mounts back you were the first of us to object to using magic on the border if you say it is probably worth the risk i will believe you i have very little to return you for your gift i am afraid no sign of nyara darkwind asked expecting a negative very little sign and old wintermoon replied as he helped his brother tie the bundles securely to the dyheli backs but there are things that tell me she passed the way we are going i have some hope that we will find her though i have not told this to skif for i do not wish to raise his hopes with nothing more substantial than old sign it is a difficult secret to keep though that is probably wise darkwind said carefully balancing the first dyhelis load his brother looked up at him from the other side of the stags back he is a man who has had many disappointments the scout said suddenly i would not add to them if i can avoid it he is wingsib more than that he does not deserve it we seldom deserve disappointment darkwind observed dryly but i do agree with you he fastened the last of the bundles to the second dyheli and straightened from tightening the cinch if you are worried about losing time and need someone to meet you with supplies send ktathi again he said its no trouble and perhaps i can find you something else useful rummaging around in the old stores you might indeed and thank you wintermoon peered out into the growing darkness beyond the veil i had best get on the trail it will take some time getting back with all these supplies darkwind nodded and wintermoon mounted the second stag so that the work of bearing him could be shared between the two with a wave of farewell wintermoon urged his mount and its brother out of the vale and into the night vanishing into the darkness beneath the trees followed by two silver shadows ghosting out and above darkwind turned his own face back toward the vale figuring to find some dinner soak himself in hot water and go to bed a headache was coming on and he assumed it was from fatigue it had been a very long day bed even one with no one in it but himself had never seemed so welcome so when he passed his fathers ekele and saw the council of elders even old rainlance huddled in conference with most of the mages of ksheyna including elspeth he was tempted to retrace his steps before anyone saw him such a gathering could only mean trouble surely he had done enough for one day surely he deserved a rest but damn this looks important i can do without food and sleep a little longer ive done it before the magelights above them were few and dim and if he had gone another way they would never have known he was there now that the shadows of night had descended elspeth was the first to spot him but as soon as the rest realized she was looking at someone and not staring off into the darkness they glanced his way their glances sharpened as soon as their eyes fell on him and with a resigned sigh he joined them i guess i was right it is important the very first thing he noticed once he joined their circle was that they were all barring the few scouts among them drained and demoralized they slumped in postures of exhaustion faces pale and lined with pain white hair lying lank against their shoulders all there was only one thing that would affect them all the heartstone he said flatly iceshadow nodded and licked dry lips the heartstone the elder replied in agreement he passed his hand over his eyes for a moment precisely we have failed in our attempt to stabilize it and there will be no more such attempts the spell not only did not drain the stone one of the others whispered wearily it enabled the stone to drain us we will be days perhaps even a week in recovering so thats why iceshadow said there would be no more tries if it could do that once it will do so again thank the gods that the mages worked within shields or we would likely all be in the same condition ksheyna will not be defenseless thanks to good planning iceshadow sighed the mages that are also scouts were not involved in the spellcasting nor you and wingsister elspeth but it is only thanks to that caution that we still have magical defenders there was one face missing from the group one who should have been there my father he asked sharply iceshadow winced a side effect we had not reckoned on he replied averting his eyes from darkwinds starblades life is bound to the stone in some way that we do not understand and did not sense until too late when our spell backlashed it struck him as well darkwind tensed what happened to him iceshadow said nothing rainlance spoke softly it nearly killed him despite the shaman kethra throwing herself into the link to protect him he lives and he will recover someone else said hastily as he felt blood drain from his face but he and the healer are weak and in shock the shaman trevalen is tending them they are in the best hands in the vale if i have regained him only to lose him is this a council meeting then he asked keeping back all the bitter things he wanted to say they were of no use anyway how could anyone have known the deep plans that had been laid against them all the things that had been done to starblade they severed his links to mornelithe falconsbane but there had been no reason to look for any others even gone falconsbanes influence lies heavily upon us even gone he left behind his poison in our veins a meeting of the council and of all the mages iceshadow replied we have determined that we have tried every means to neutralize the heartstone at our disposal and all have failed there is no other way we must look outside to other clans for help the faces in the dim light showed how they felt about it that it was an admission of dependence of guilt of failure darkwind had urged them all for years to seek help from outside and swallow that pride bitter and sweet victory at last was his but it had nearly cost the life of his father caught between two conflicting sets of emotions he could only stare at the leader of the council you must send the call iceshadow said finally you the wingsister and the gryphons elspeth has already agreed as have treyvan and hydona you are the only ones that we can turn to now you and elspeth you remember the way of constructing a seekingspell strong enough to reach who and what we need he nodded numbly still caught in a web of surprise and dismay you look ready to drop elspeth said firmly into the silence youre tiredim tiredwe arent going to get anything done tonight she stood up and nodded to iceshadow with respect elder we have had a long day and we need to rest well see what we can do tomorrow it has waited until now it can certainly wait another night iceshadow agreed wearily and there is no sense in exhausting you two as well tomorrow then tomorrow she agreed and signaled darkwind to follow her down the path i had the hertasi bring food and that mineral drink to the pool near your treehouse she said as soon as they were out of sight and sound of the circle of exhausted mages i thought you would probably need both and a good soak you were right he rubbed his temple as a headache began to throb behind his eyes when did all this happen just at sunset she told him that was when they had timed the drainage to begin and that was when the spell backlashed i didnt feel it and neither did anyone else outside of the working area except starblade i first knew something was wrong when two of them staggered out the passthrough looking for help and i happened to be nearby some of them had to be carried out gods he shook his head so there are only four of us to work this seekingspell five corrected a voice in his head he had not noticed gwenas presence until that moment she moved so quietly behind them that she might have been just another shadow five he repeated but lady i did not know you were magegifted elspeths glare could have peeled bark from the trees neither did i she said flatly her voice so devoid of expression that the lack alone was a sign of her anger she stopped so did he and the companion before gwena could jerk her head away elspeth had her by the bottom of the hackamore look she said tightly you know how important strategy is that and tactics especially here and now gwena tried to look away elspeth wouldnt let her yes she agreed faintly you have been withholding information elspeth continued her voice still dangerously flat and calm information that iwe need to have to plan intelligently what would you do to someone who had deliberately withheld information that vital gwena shook her head slightly as much as elspeths hold on her hackamore would permit i have had enough elspeth punctuated each word with a little shake of the halter if you havent worked that into your great plan youd better start thinking about it no more holding back do you understand gwena rolled her eyes and started to pull away elspeth wouldnt let her and gwena was obviously not going to exert her considerable strength in something that might harm her herald but from the look of shock in her bright blue eyes she had not expected this reaction from elspeth i said do you understand me elspeth pulled her head down and stared directly into her eyes darkwind stood with his arms crossed jaw set in a stern expression he was trying his best to give the impression he supported elspeths actions completely in fact he did yes gwena managed are you going to stop holding back information gwena pawed the ground unhappily but clearly elspeth was not going to let her go until she got an answer she liked yes she said meekly obviously unable to see any other way out of the confrontation good elspeth let go of the halter she straightened put her hands on her hips and gave gwena a look that darkwind could not read remember you just gave your word darkwind did not think that gwena was going to forget chapter thirteen a gray sky gave no clue as to the time but darkwind thought it was not long after dawn he had spent a restless night haunted by the exhausted faces of the ksheyna mages he had not been expecting anyone so early and the first words out of darkwinds mouth when elspeth appeared at his ekele were we cannot do it here he had been thinking hard about what they were to do all during his meal the long soak before bed in the midst of which he had fallen asleep until a hertasi woke him and into the night before sleep ook him and he had decided on certain provisions as he dressed what they were to do was no problem thanks to elspeth and treyvan he was accustomed now to improvising on existing spells this would be a variation on the seekingspell but wherethat was different it could not be done within the confines of the vale even outside the shielded practice ground he knew that with deep certainty that had only hardened during sleep every instinct revolted when he even considered the idea something was happening to the heartstone or possibly within it he had no notion of what was going on but now he did not want to do anything that affected it while within its reach it was not just that the stone had drained ksheyna mages it was the way it had happened it had waited or seemed to until they were certain of success and off their guard perhaps that had been accident but what if it was not he did not know it didnt seem likely but less likely things had been happening with dismaying regularity these were strange times indeed he realized as soon as he said the words that elspeth would have no idea what had been going through his mind since the meeting he felt like a fool as soon as he closed his mouth shes going to think ive gone crazy that im babbling but instead of confusion elspeth met the statement with a nod of understanding absolutely she replied as if she had been talking to him about the problems all along too much interference from shields and setspells plus the heartstones proximity itself ive been thinking about that since last night that heartstone of yours is acting altogether too clever for my comfort i dont want to do something it might not like when im anywhere around it it might decide that since im an outlander itll do more than just drain me it is not a thinking being he protested but without conviction maybe not but it acts like it is she glanced back over her shoulder in the direction of the stone maybe its all coincidence or maybe its something that falconsbane set up a long time ago but when it acts like it can think im going to assume that it is thinking and act accordingly she grinned crookedly as my shinaintrained teacher would sayjust because you feel certain an enemy is lurking behind every bush it doesnt follow that you are wrong shinain proverbs from an outlander god help me but he couldnt help but smile ruefully in reply the trouble with proverbs is that theyre truisms he agreed you make me think that you are reading my thoughts though it was a halfserious accusation although he made it with a smile it was no secret that these heralds had mindmagicbut did they use it without warning she laughed not a chance i dont eavesdrop i promise no herald would it was just a case of parallel worries so where are we going to go to work no herald would perhaps the companion might but i suspect she knows that he wasnt worried about her companion reading his thoughts it was not likely that there was anything he would think that a guardian spirit had not seen before have you eaten yet he asked instead when she shook her head he went back into his ekele and rummaged about in his belongings and what the hertasi had left him he brought out two coats draped over his arm and fruit and bread handing her a share of the food she took it with a nod of thanks i thought he said after she had settled beside him on the steps that we might work from the ruins the gryphons lair she tipped her head to one side there is a node underneath it and were likely to need one but what aboutwellattracting things when we do the magic we wont have the shields of the vale and thats a problem he admitted biting into a ripe pomera i dont know how to get around that she considered that for a moment then shrugged well deal with it i suppose she replied gwena cant think of any way around it either but shes in agreement with both of us on not working near the heartstone she finished the last of her bread and stood up dusting her hands off so what exactly are we doing he licked juice from his fingers and followed her example handed her a coat then led the way down the stairs to the path below well we cant do a wide open mindcall he began obviously she said dryly since we dont want every nasty thing in the area to know that ksheyna is in trouble i wouldnt imagine wed want to do a focused mindcall either something still might pick it up even though we meant it only for tayledras there might even be something watching for a mindcall like that for all we know and whats the point in wasting all the energy needed for a focused mindcall to all the clans when there may not be more than one or two adepts that can help us he concluded no what id thought that we should do is to send a specific messagespell that is a complicated message that can be carried by a single bird he smiled to himself she wouldnt believe what kind of bird would carry the incorporeal message but it was the most logical to whom she asked in surprise as gwena joined them following a polite ten paces behind i thought she stopped in confusion i dont know who to send it to but i know what he explained brushing aside a branch that overhung the path somewhere in the clans is a healing adept of a high enough level that he either knows or can figure out what we need to do now i know that no one here can so i send out a message to the nearest clan aimed at any adept thats of our ability or higher in this case the nearest clan is ktreva and im pretty sure they have someone better equipped to deal with this than we are they offered their help a while back and father refused it and if no one there can help us after all she asked darkly he shrugged then i ask them to pass on the word to the others they dont have a flawed heartstone in their midst they can send out to any clan council to tell you the truth our biggest problem with getting the stone taken care of has been isolation solve that and we can solve the rest the vale was unusually silent with all the mages abed and recovering their steps were the only sounds besides the faint stirring of leaves in the breeze and the bird songs that always circulated through the vale she was quiet all the way to the entrance and the veil that guarded it beyond the protections another winter snowstorm dropped fat flakes through the bare branches of the trees they shared a look of resignation wrapped themselves in their coats and crossed the invisible barrier between summer and winter the first sound outside was of their boots splashing into the puddles of water made by snow melted from the ambient heat of the vales entrance there was no wind and snow buried their feet to the calf with every step they took flakes drifted down slowly through air that felt humid on darkwinds face and not as cold as he had expected above the gray branches a white sky stretched featurelessly from horizon to horizon darkwind got the oddest impression as if the snowflakes were bits of the sky chipped off and slowly falling beneath the branches the gray columns of the tree trunks loomed through the curtaining snow and more snow carpeted the forest floor and mounded in the twigs of every bush there were no evergreens in this part of the woods so there was nothing to break the landscape of gray and white snow creaked under their feet and the cold crept into his boots their feet would be half frozen by the time they reached the ruins darkwind didnt mind the lack of color after the riot of colors and verdant greens within the vale the subdued grays and graybrowns were restful refreshing he wished though that he had time and the proper surroundings to enjoy them this is a good day for bundling up beside a fire watching the snow and not thinking of anything in particular this is the kind of day when i used to curl up in a blanket in a window and read elspeth said quietly barely breaking the silence when id just sit listen to the fire watch the snow pile up on the window ledge and think about how nice it was to be warm and inside he chuckled and she glanced at him gwena moved around them to walk in front breaking the trail for them i was just thinking the same thing he explained if we only had the time i used to do much the same ah she nodded id forgotten you used to live outside that glorified greenhouse i like it the vale i meanbut sometimes i miss weather when im in there its hard to tell what time of day it is much less what season well i imagine wintermoon and skif would be willing to trade places with us right now he replied thoughtfully this is good weather to be insidebut not for camping snow this damp is heavy when it collects on a tent oh if youre wondering i sent vree on ahead with a message about what we want to do i expect treyvan and hydona will be waiting for us i was wondering she glanced at him again but this time she halfsmiled as she tucked her hair more securely inside the hood of her coat not that i expected them to object but it is considered good manners to let people know that you are planning on setting off fireworks from the roof of their houseand you plan to have their help in doing it he laughed this was a very pleasant change from the elspeth of several weeks ago reasonable communicative and showing a good sense of humor yes it is he agreed my message to them was that if they objected to the idea to let me know immediately that was when i first woke since vree didnt come back i assume they dont mind either that or he forgot his promise and made a snatch at a crestfeather again she said with mock solemnity in that case youll have to find yourself another bondbird elspeth enjoyed the walk for with gwena breaking the trail for them the trip to the lair was something like a pleasant mornings hike they had to keep a watch for unexpected trouble of course but nothing more threatening appeared than a crow scolding them for being in his part of the forest this is the most relaxed ive been since i got here she thought perhaps it was because the waiting was finally over shed had the feeling all along that the mages of ksheyna would never be able to solve the problem by themselves darkwind felt the same she knew but he never discussed it he was relieved toobut too conscientious to feel pleased with the failure of his clans mages even though it proved that he was right he wasnt a shallow man the ruins were cloaked in snow which gave some portions an air of utter desolation and others an uncanny resemblance to complete buildings passage of the gryphons in and around their territory kept the pathways they used relatively free of snow it was easier to move here but with the last of the trees out of sight the place felt like a desert vree was on his best behavior it seemed for when they approached the gryphons lair they found him up on the rafters of the nest pulling bits from a freshkilled quail with great gusto he didnt have time to do more than call a greeting to darkwind though the gryphlets tumbled out of the nest and overran all three of them knocking darkwind off his feet and rolling him in the snow wrestling with him as if they were kittens and he was a kind of superior cattoy elspeth laughed until her sides hurt every time he started to get up one of the youngsters knocked him over again he was matted with snow he looked like an animated snowman and was laughing so hard she wondered how he caught his breath gwena watched the melee wistfully obviously wishing she could join in elspeth decided that darkwind could use a rescue she waded in and started pulling tails which turned the gryphlets on her within a heartbeat she found herself going rumpovertail into a snowdrift with a squealing jerven on top of her flailing with his short stubby wings and kicking up clouds of the soft snow in all directions that was when gwena joined the fun making short charges and shouldering the youngsters aside so that she tumbled them into the snow the way they had knocked darkwind and elspeth over the gryphlets loved that gwena was big enough to hold her own with them and provided they kept their foreclaws fisted they didnt have to hold back with her in a roughandtumble in a few moments their parents appeared and rather than calling a halt to the game they joined it now the odds were clearly against the gryphlets and first darkwind then elspeth switched sides coming to the youngsters defense while gwena sided with the parents in moments snow flew everywhere it looked like a blizzard from the ground up the best strategy seemed to be seizing the tail of an adult hampering movement while the young one batted away at the front end with blows of their wings and with their claws held tightly into a fist to avoid injury that wouldnt work for long however just as elspeth was getting winded hydona turned the tables on them the gryphon whirled dragging elspeth along with her and bringing her into the range of the huge wings suddenly she went tumbling buffeted into another snowbank by a carefully controlled sweep of a wing landing right beside jerven who had gotten the same treatment before either of them could scramble to their feet hydona was upon them pinning each of them down with a foreclaw trrruce the gryphon asked her head cocked to one side her beak slightly open as she panted steam rose in puffs from her halfopen beak elspeth sensed the controlled power in the claw pinning her carefully into the drift and marveled at it even as she signaled her defeat laughingly hydona let both of them up extending the claw again to help elspeth to her feet thanks she said looking for gwena and finding that darkwind and lytha had taken gwena hostage holding her against treyvans continued good behavior the companions blue eyes sparkled like sapphires and her ears were up and tail flaggedin short they only thought they had her elspeth kept her mouth shut waiting for gwena to make her move treyvan feinted and darkwind turned just a little too far to block him for one moment he took his eyes off the companion that was when gwena grabbed his collar in her teeth and whipping her head around on her long graceful neck jerked him off his feet and flung him sideways into lytha darkwind whuffed with surprise lytha squealed they both went down in a tangle of legs and wings elspeth giggled uncontrollably then took a huge double handful of snow packed it tight and lobbed it at gwena it impacted against gwenas rump and she whirled to glare at her chosen indignantly darkwind howled with laughter and the gryphlets joined in i was afraid you were going to break the game up elspeth told the female gryphon as darkwind and his partner surrendered to her mate hydona shook her head to rid it of snow no she replied the little onesss werrre resstlessss now they will sssettle and let usss worrk in peace elspeth stretched and began beating the snow out of her cloak feeling vertebrae pop as her muscles loosened i feel like ive worked off a bit of nerves too she began when another creature popped its head out of the gryphons lair ears pricked forward and eyes wide with interest is the battle over the kyree asked or is this a temporary truce i think weve been defeated too soundly to make another attempt darkwind said cheerfully despite gwenas indignation am i right my shieldbrother he asked turning to lytha the gryphlet nodded vigorously and sneezed a clump of melting snow from her cere and crown wet she complained got sssnow in my featherssss if you fight in sssnow you mussst expect sssome in your feathersss hydona told her with a twinkle my famous cousin warrl used to say you cannot have a battle without getting your fur in a mess the kyree scratched meditatively at one ear he used to say you know how fierce the fighting was by how long after it takes to clean up if you two want to come inside i can start a magefire for you to lie beside and tell you a story the kyrees head vanished into the lair again jerven beat lytha inside by less than half a length i take it that was rris elspeth said trying not to laugh yesss sighed hydona she looked at treyvan and the two of them said in chorus that wasss rrisss letmetellyouofmyfamoussscousssinwarrl of hyrrrull pack the childrrren love him treyvan added i think i can bearrr with hisss famousss cousssin sstorriess sssince he doesss not repeat them only the proverbsss and advice hydona shrugged it isss no worssse than living with a ssshinain surely but what could be darkwind agreed and squinted at the sky we have all of the afternoon and some of the morning left do you want to start now i thought it might be wisssse treyvan replied the lair isss not dirrrectly above the node when i found the place that wasss i built it into a ssshelter asss well would you follow darkwind waved him ahead he and hydona took up the lead with the two humans following gwena between them elspeth laid a hand on her shoulder did you enjoy yourself she asked you looked like you were having a wonderful time very much gwena replied her breath steaming from her nostrils her eyes still bright and merry that was fun id nearly forgotten how much fun it is to be a child or to be with a child no matter how serious things are they can always play a good thing too elspeth chuckled patting her on the neck they can remind us grownups that theres a time to forget how serious things are i miss the twins so do i gwena sighed gustily i miss a lot of things elspeth realized gwena must feel rather alone she at least had other humans around however alien they were with skif out on the hunt for nyara gwena didnt even have cymry to talk to gwena must have guessed the direction her thoughts were taking oh dont feel too sorry for me she said poking elspeth in the shoulder with her nose i can do that well enough on my own elspeth made a face at her relieved im sure you can she teased and i wouldnt even have to encourage you too true gwenas ears pricked forward and she brought her head up i do believe we have arrived before them loomed another rough buildingshape much like the lair but cruder where the lair was clearly a dwelling this was no more than a simple shelter the most basic of walls and a roof but it was fully large enough for the gryphons and their guests with room to spare it was clear that treyvan and his mate had constructed this place before the first snow fell elspeth wondered why they had built it had they always intended to work magic here in their ruins or had they some other purpose in mind they entered to find that treyvan had already started a magefire inside the glowing ball gave them both heat and light the interior of the crude building was appreciably warmer than the outside although an occasional draft whipped by at ankle height elspeth decided to leave her coat on it wasnt that warm inside what exactly arrre we doing treyvan asked settling down on his haunches i know of one kind of messssagessspell but i do not know that it isss like the one you ussse ours requires a carrier darkwind explained carefully he looked around and found a block of stone to sit on we generally use a bird of some kind there are a lot of advantages to that the spell itself weighs nothing and it cant be detected unless a mage is quite close to the bird the bird doesnt need to remember anything so it doesnt have to be a bondbird the spell is in two parts one is the message and the other will identify the target that part will tell the bird when it has found either the specific person that the message is for or in our case the kind of person the spell is for interesssting hydona nodded better than oursss lesss inclined to be detected what bird arrre you usssing this one he pointed to the hood of his coat a tiny head peeked out from beneath his hair very tiny mostly bright black eyes and a long sharp beak elspeth blinked and looked again a hummingbird she said incredulously where did that come from the vale darkwind grinned he was in my cloak hood until just before the children ran at us he went up to shelter with vree while we played vree knows better than to molest a hummingbird since we use them for messagespells all the time he ducked back inside my hood when i told him it was safe and that was how i brought him here but a hummingbird she frowned it was not the choice she would have made the tiny birds were pretty enough and certainly they did very well in the artificial world of the vale but it seemed to be a poor choice for carrying a message for what might well be hundreds of leagues isnt he going to freeze to death in this weather whats he going to eat and how is he going to defend himself darkwind held his hand up to his hood the bird flew out and hovered for a moment before settling on his finger it was no larger than the first joint of his thumb as long as he keeps moving hell be fine he wont have any trouble with the cold he wont have to stop to eat because i will have given him a tiny store of mageenergy that will carry him as far as ktreva and look at him elspeth kept her reservations to herself and took the time to examine the tiny bird closely it was not one of the little flying jewels she was used to seeing the bird was black with only a hint of dull purple at his throat this little fellow doesnt need to defend himself because very few creatures or birds will be able to see him darkwind continued the fact that you didnt see him fly out of my hood or back in is proof of that his speed is his defense that and his size hes so small that even if something sees him it isnt likely to catch him and if something is foolish enough to try to catch him it is going to discover that its nearly impossible to try and catch a hummingbird in full flight hnun treyvan bent his head to examine the bird at short range it looked right back at him completely without fear despite the fact that the gryphon could have inhaled the tiny creature and never noticed he had done so ssso you will create a pocket of mageenerrgy to feed the birrd that ssshould make no morrre ssstirr than the ssspell itssself exactly darkwind looked very pleased these little fellows move so quickly that even if someone detected a spell by the time they got to the place where theyd first detected it the bird would be a hundred furlongs gone from the maps ive seen its an awful long way to ktreva elspeth said doubtfully wild hummingbirds migrate so far to the south in the winter that we dont even know where they go darkwind replied hes right gwena put in one of keros men the black fellowi listened to him tell stories once to some of the trainees he said that hummingbirds spent the winter in his land and we have no notion of how far north he came well if hummingbirds really traveled that far he can do it dont worry darkwind replied firmly these little ones have carried messages like this one before even in winter and once he gets to ktreva and finds our adept someone will see to it that he gets the best honeynectar and will find a territory for him in their vale once again she was struck by the care the tayledras had for the creatures that they shared their lives witheven a tiny hummingbird that was in no way the kind of partner that their bondbirds were darkwind shook his head the little fellow is ready and eager to go lets get to this so that he doesnt have to wait elspeth couldnt imagine how he would know that but she agreed this was likely to take a fair amount of time indeed hydona said nodding rrrisss cannot keep the little onesss quiet forever elspeth was very glad gwena had come along and even happier that the companion wasnt as tired as she was the walk back to the vale which had been so pleasant on the way out was a daunting prospect now neither of you are heavy gwena said as the three of them followed the gryphons out into the snow the vale is not that far i can carry both of you or you can lean against me if you like the sun was faintly visible through the thick clouds there was perhaps a candlemark until sunset what do you think elspeth asked the hawkbrother walk or ride i can get you there by sunset gwena said coaxingly ride darkwind replied decisively if you have no objection none at all in fact this might prove to be an intriguing opportunity darkwind was possibly the single most attractive man she had ever met and not just because he was so exotic and once she had figured out that he wasnt being obtuse in his lessons just to aggravate her she found him even more attractive admittedly most of the tayledras were attractive either physically mentally or both but darkwind drew her as no one else had she wanted to know more about himand she wanted him to know more about her it was one thing to be attracted to some one it was another thing entirely to act on that attraction especially if it proved to be only onesided horrible thought but possible and her pride would not permit her to go panting after him like a puppy skifs example of slavish infatuation was enough to decide her on that she would never put herself in the position to be humiliated the way he had been she mounted first darkwind less experienced used a handy chunk of fallen rock to mount up behind her i promise ill be gentle gwena teased reminding them both of the uncomfortable jog darkwind had taken perched behind elspeth over gwenas hipbones as they hurried to the aid of another scout nothing more than a fast smooth walk thank you darkwind said fervently the gryphons had already made their weary farewells as custodians of this node they had used the most strength in linking into it and feeding the power to darkwind gwena and elspeth the hummingbird was on his way shooting into the sky like a slung stone there was nothing holding them here snow continued to fall but the light was fading and the ruins had a haunted look to them that made elspeths skin crawl gwena responded to her uneasiness by heading out by the most direct route one that would skirt the hertasi swamp but would not go in that was no place to be in weather like this what happens to the hertasi in the winter she asked suddenly the ones that live out in the marsh i mean they dont precisely hibernate but they do not leave their caves much darkwind said into her left ear while gwena waded through the soft snow at a fairly brisk pace his hands felt good on her hips they seal themselves into their caves sleep much and eat little stay close to fires what time they spend awake they use in making small things carvings mostly everything they own is carved or ornamented at least a little i gathered they had a fondness for that sort of thing elspeth replied you know they dont approve of my uniforms too plain i suppose precisely he chuckled that is one reason why they enjoy working with us they have a number of traditional designs they use but we are quicker at creating new ones than they are or perhaps it is simply that we are more uninhibited that is part of the trade they have with us when one of them wants a new design for something he goes to one of us craftsmen and we create it for him that and protection and shelter and we earn their service us craftsmen she said puzzled i didnt know you were a craftsman i do clothing design or i did i am no great artist like ravenwing he replied and she had the impression that he was a little uncomfortable perhaps embarrassed odd as it may seem when they are at leisure the hertasi of the vale enjoy having elaborate clothing to wear she considered teasing him and decided against it she recalled the festival clothing that he and starblade had worn clothing that seemed to have been created by the same hand now she knew it probably had been his hand had that been a kind of silent signal of reconciliation what other signals was she missing you know she said slowly back at home theres an entire set of codes in the flowers people wear that they give to one another its even more elaborate at court people have carried on entire conversations wordlessly with the flowers they have worn during the course of a day really he seemed amused and relieved that she had turned the topic to something else here there is only one meaning to a gift of a flower and what is that she asked the same as a gift of a featherthat one wishes intimacy she blinked now understanding a number of exchanges she had seen but hadnt understood if the feather is from any bird the relationship is casual he continued if it is from ones bondbird however the meaning is that it is to be one of deeper intentions a sudden image flashed from memory of the shaman kethra a string of feathers braided into her hair when she had never seen the shinain wear feathers before is that why kethra she exclaimed then stopped blushing at her own rudeness but darkwind didnt seem to think it was rude yes he said simply those were feathers from the birds he bonded to before that ravena gray owl and a falcon called a perlin when our birds molt we save the feathers those we do not need to use for repair when a bird breaks a feather we keep for special purposes and for gifts he needs another bird she said thinking out loud you know watching you and the others with your birdsit isnt like a herald with a companion but its an important relationship he needs a bird and i dont think either he or kethra realize how much or the good it would do him to have one silence then as gwena continued to push her way through the snow beneath the barren gray branches of the forest as the light slowly leached from the sky and the shapes of trees far away lost their definition blurring into charcoal shadows she wondered if she had broken some unspoken taboo among the hawkbrothers or if perhaps she had sounded arrogant as if she thought that she knew it all odd he said finally that is precisely what i have been thinking father lost his last bird to falconsbane and may hesitate to ask someone to help him find another kethra knows nothing of the bond of tayledras and bird how important it is to us all of us have a bird of one sort or another elspeth the mages often bond to a small owl or to one of the corbies but all of us have birds and all of enhanced breeding it seems to me that the birds you have are more likewellhousecats they have that kind of independence of thought but willingness to be somewhat dependent she shook her head at a loss to explain what she meant theyre not like dogswell mostly they arent but they sure as fire are not like the falcons and raptors i know the best you can get from them is tolerance unless you can mindspeak with animals you are very observant that is very true they have that capacity for real affection that most of the true raptors lack they are social and they are intelligent enough to work together instead of preying on one another because of that capacity the bond between us is as much of friendship as dependence the only trouble is this is not breeding season and all the adult birds within the vale are already bonded perhaps the waning light had made her other senses sharper perhaps it was just that she had become accustomed to listening for nuances in the way darkwind spoke within the vale she repeated are there birds of vale lineage outside the vale many all those that are not claimed by someone as an eyas are left free to follow their own will he was silent for a moment but without the bond their wild instincts come to the fore and aside from size it is difficult to tell them from their wild cousins we could trap a passage bird perhaps but that would be a poor way to begin a relationship that is based in trust i see your point and she did a wildbred bird never connected the trap with the human that took him from it in fact a wildbred bird often woke to his surroundings when securely mewed and the falconer began the careful process of manning him but a bird as intelligent as one of bondbird stock would make the immediate connection between trap and trapper and he would not be pleased however good their intentions have you asked vree what he thinks we should do actually no she could tell by the tone of his voice that she had surprised him probably by saying something one of his people wouldnt have thought o but she was used to asking gwenas advice and while she wouldnt have considered posing a complicated question to the bondbird this was something he could realistically handle the gyre dropped down ahead of them out of the trees circled about beneath the branches and chirped at darkwind before regaining the height he preferred with a few strong wingbeats darkwind laughed aloud you pleased him wingsib he said he was very flattered by being asked his opinion and in his own very direct way he has the perfect answer he says that we must wait for one of the birds of the proper lineage to be injured it is winter firstyear birds are injured all the time trying for difficult kills in the normal way of things they will heal upon their own sometimes other birds of tayledras breeding even their parents will feed them while they heal and in the way of things if they do not heal properly and there is none to feed them they die but if the other birds of the vale know we are looking for an injured bird they will watch for one such and we may play rescuer giving us a grateful bird instead of an angry one she smiled it was the best kind of solution i take it that hes going to speak to the other birds once again you guess correctly darkwinds voice was as warm as the gathering night was chill elspeth if it will not offend you i would like to say that you are a much easier person to be around now she flushed well darkwind some of what you didnt like was something i have to do when i am around my own people they expect me to lead they expect me to act in certain ways that attitude you accused me of having is a big part of that im sorry it had become a habit that i wasnt conscious of i think some of it was associated with a kind of reflex if the person i was with wasnt wearing a white uniform then i acted a certain way without even considering what i was doing would he understand would he even try i am royalty darkwind no matter that my land matters less to you than one of vrees broken feathers i still am royal i am expected to act in a certain way and i cant escape that ive been bred and raised to it ah she hoped that what she read into the tone of that single syllable was dawning understanding she sighed theres something else she said through painful shyness im rather the plainplumaged bird of my family everyone else is so handsome its likelike living among hawkbrothers so the only reason i can think of for a young man to be attracted to me is because of my rank and there have been those i try to keep them at a distance i can understand that he said after a moment in which the sound of gwenas breathing and the muffled sounds of her hooves in the snow filled the twilight forest and defined the borders of their little private universe but elspeth those young men who were blinded by your rank were fools or else they failed to see the quiet beauty inside the showy or she sensed rather than saw the grin behind her or perhaps they were dazzled by the stark white attire she groaned dont tell me youre in on the conspiracy to steal my whites only a little she waited for him to continue i will admit to advising lursten on a choice of substitute wardrobe she chuckled and they passed the rest of the journey in silence as the twilight darkened to true night and the air chilled further before it became too dark for him to see to fly vree came winging in to land on darkwinds wrist he held the bird between them keeping him warmed with the combined heat of their bodies something no raptor of elspeths acquaintance would have tolerated much less enjoyed true to her promise gwena brought them to within sight of the vale just as the last of the dull light of sunset faded from the western sky darkwind slid from her back as soon as they passed the entrance to the vale vree balancing carefully on his wrist i am for sleep he said with a smile do not take this amiss wingsib but take it as a compliment please i have wished to offer you a feather since the days of our first acquaintance for i find you a very attractive woman more so when you smile rather than frowning on me so formidably she blinked at him in shock then tentatively smiled in return thank you she said simply blushing ahdarkwind if i wasnt so tiredoh that sounds like such a transparent excuse but but it is sadly true elspeth even if you were not weary i feel that i am like to fall asleep even as i walk to my ekele shall we take it as true and not an excuse something warmed deep inside her i think thats reasonable and i think you should both go to bed to sleep gwena chided gently all right little mother darkwind said amused we shall tomorrow we will be dealing with all the creatures our magics attracted at any rate we will need a good rest she couldnt be disappointed she thought not after all that but no that would not do it was not enough she dismounted and went to him wrapping her arms around his waist with an inner flush she looked up into his clear eyes darkwind held vree a little further from his body inviting her in closer she smiled not knowing how well it could be seen and felt gwena send a quiet touch of approval elspeth raised a hand to darkwinds face caressed the hair at his temple he licked his lips as vree spread his wings and bent his neck down just a little enough for one loving kiss framed by the rich light and warmth of the vale behind them chapter fourteen starblade and hyllarr darkwind woke to a cool pebblescaled hand shaking him awake he raised his head from his pillow and blinked to clear his eyes it was still dark darkwind said the hertasi at his elbow there is a disturbance he recognized the mindvoice as that of suras one of the three hertasi who had attached themselves to darkwind when he moved back into the vale the lizardfolk did that it was one of their many peculiarities they simply decided who they wanted to serve and proceeded to do just that one day darkwind was living in the clutter created by moving and putting together his own meals doing his own laundry and cleaning up after himself and vree then with no warning at all he arrived home to find everything straightened folded and put away and a meal waiting there were advantages and disadvantages to being back in the vale hed felt a pang of displeasure at his loss of autonomy however with hertasi serving him it was much easier for people to find him when he was needed that too could be a disadvantage especially when he was trying to sleep off the last time hed been needed suras patted his arm again disturbance darkwind you are needed please what kind of trouble is it this time he askedor rather mumbled into his pillowhoping it was something he could get someone else to take care of magical suras said curtly his tone told darkwind everything he needed to know he was not getting out of this one a magical disturbance between here and the ruins no doubt about this he gwena and elspeth were responsible for dealing with it ill be right there suras lit a lantern and vanished darkwind clenched his eyes closed opened them reluctantly and dragged himself out of bed vree roused and blinked sleepily then yawned widely awake again rather sleep darkwind yawned in response you and i both beloved ill go on ahead and call on you if youre needed fair enough you go i sleep fair deal vree settled and tucked his beak under feathers again while darkwind felt around for the clothing suras would have laid out before waking him i cant say i wasnt expecting this he thought glumly but i wish it had waited until after sunrise to start maybe we should have just stayed with the gryphons he had known that when they worked a spell requiring that much power and concentration things would be attracted there were too many powerhungry creatures in the pelagirs for any educated mage to think that magical workings of any scale could go unnoticed odd how much had gone into so simple and tiny a package as that hummingbird messenger though well tiny yes simple no there had been all manner of enhancements on that little bird for speed for endurance plus the pocket of energy it would use to feed then all the spells needed to hold the message to deliver it to recognize the right kind of person to unlock itwe did what we could to shield everything we could spare from the spells themselves without harming the little thing itself he told himself we did everything we knew how to do but i suppose the bleedoff was noticed there hasnt been anything really troublesome around since the basilisk if luck is with us these things will be small something we can run off rather than killing he dressed carefully knowing that he would probably be spending the whole day out in the cold wrapping his joints and neck in brushed cotton and insulation it was still dark by the time he descended the steps to the vale floor and he had no idea how long it would be until dawn it was going to be a very long day indeed another messenger dyheli came galloping closer just as they ran the younger of the lodella pair off with its fuzzy tail tucked down between its legs all its dorsal spines flat and its hairless head ducked low the elder had already flagged its surrender with its retreating back but the younger one had less sense and more bravado theyd actually had to pound it a bit with hammerspells before it gave up darkwind waved to his partners who came up beside him just as the stag neared now what elspeth asked as she propped herself against her companions neck then shifted toward the saddle to avoid being caught in gwenas steaming breath elspeth hadnt spent a lot of time in the saddle the companion had been far more effective helping as a third herder when they met with creatures that were willing to be shepherded away it wasnt just her size she also seemed to be able to project a presence that played a factor in discouraging hostilities from the lessintelligent creatures these disturbances had actually included a fair percentage of browsers creatures that meant no real harm but could not be allowed close to habitations but the restthe rest of the beasts facing them would have been only too happy to work some harm but the beasts faced the three of them plus the two gryphons and falconsbane was no longer there to support his creatures with magic the gryphons had tackled the first real problem the halfdozen gandels that tried to force their way into the ruins but without falconsbanes will driving them they were inclined to fold at the first show of resistance a few feints of hydonas claws and a stooping dive by treyvan convinced them elsewhere would be far safer that set the tone for the day to frighten the creatures away rather than actually closing to fight with them illusions proved as effective as real threats after the gandels they had sent a pack of changewolves running with the illusion of a bigger stronger pack downwind facing them to claim the territory illusions were exhausting though they took more magical energy from the caster than actually fighting but certainly left the user less winded and less likely to strike at shadows after a full day of active casting though illusions could deaden even the most ardent of mages on the other hand one generally doesnt get wounded casting illusions or bitten gored horned or worse as vree would say fair deal it actually had a certain entertainment value as he and elspeth got into an impromptu contest over which of the two of them could create the most imaginative counter to the problem at hand hed conceded defeat when elspeth began dropping huge illusionary clay pots on the dumber creatures heads or sending blizzards of wildflowers in their faces theyd both found themselves laughing after that so far they had been incredibly lucky the illusions hadnt failed yet to drive away their targets though once or twice theyd needed to reinforce the illusion with a bit of magical force the dyheli stopped and pawed at the snow a signal for attention was their luck about to run out you are called to the ruins the dyheli said before darkwind could ask him why he had been sent the gryphons say there is a message waiting for you there three of the vale mages are following me to take your place darkwind slumped against a tree in relief he had completely forgotten that the mages of ksheyna would recover from their draining eventually he had been so used to depending on himself and no one else used to the idea that there was no one to relieve him it had literally never occurred to him that someone would be along to take their places so what is it elspeth asked who are we going to have to rescue this time no one he said mentally thanking the messenger at the same time believe it or not no one weve had a reply to our call for help it came to the ruins since that was where the hummingbird started from keyed to us of course so no one else can break into it would that be the kind of personally keyed message we would have sent if wed been able gwena asked her tiredness fading as her interest was caught but it hasnt been more than a dayi had no idea that little bird could fly that fast or far i hoped he would find a good carrying wind somewhere up above the clouds darkwind told her that and the enhancement spells we put on him would have made all the difference once ktreva got the message of course it wouldnt take them very long to replythey knew where to send it and who to send it to it takes a little longer than straight mindspeech but not much then the bird probably reached them just as we tackled the wolves elspeth replied thoughtfully it hardly seems possible but i suppose that if a falcon can be carried off for hundreds of leagues by a high wind theres no reason why a hummingbird couldnt have that happen to him too she straightened and looked around were going to have to walk she told darkwind gwena is in no shape to carry us she bent down and scooped up a little snow and rubbed gwenas forehead with it when gwena didnt protest that she was fine thank you darkwind figured that elspeth was right while the companion hadnt been working any direct magic she had been acting as an energy source for both of them plus giving the more timid creatures a good scare when she charged them she must be as exhausted as they were thats all right he said it isnt that far he oriented himself recognizing a clump of mingled evergreen and goldenoak stand of willows and a rock formation weve been working in circles actually were hardly more than a dozen furlongs from the edge of the ruins then what are we waiting for elspeth asked for me to get my second wind he told her i havent your youthful resilience she chuckled he closed his eyes for a moment drew up reserves of energy then pushed away from the tree he had been leaning on lets go see what the news is the visible component of the message was a tiny incandescent spark that danced in the air above the exact center of the crude building in the ruins it brightened as soon as they entered the building and the moment they were both in place with darkwind to the east of the node and elspeth beside him the spark flared suddenly then itunfolded was the only word darkwind could think of it stretched down in a line that just touched the ground then the line opened up on either side until it formed a softedged mirror that hung in the air between them for a moment darkwind saw only his own reflection then the mirror dimmed and darkened to blue starlight and the face of another tayledras this one a contemporary of his father at a guess looked solemnly out at him it was hard to remember that this was only a message that he could not actually speak to the one in the mirror any more than he could hold a conversation with a piece of parchment the illusion was so complete that it took an effort of will to keep from greeting the stranger ktreva has heard the need of ksheyna came the mindvoice of the stranger while we are grieved by your situation we are relieved that you came at last to us we feared for you but saw no way to help you without acting like tyrants or wellmeaning but intrusive siblings darkwind nodded that made sense no clan interfered in the affairs of another without some kind of truly catastrophic emergency involved we have the help you need the other continued a healing adept strong and wellversed in his craft and who is one of the most creative mages this clan has ever held the other smiled briefly such praise may seem excessive but as the shinain saying goes it is no boast when it is fact i will build him a gate to a place i know within your territory one that i hope will be far enough away that it will not disturb your stone from the gate terminus i believe it will be about a half days ride to your vale under good conditions and certainly no more than a full day expect him within that time once you feel the perturbations of the gate if firesong cannot help you no one of ktreva can be of good cheer brothers with that the entire construction sparkled and winked out darkwind stared across the room at elspeth unable to believe their good fortune you look like a stunned bird she observed i feel like a stunned bird he admitted its incredible i have to tell you she said shaking off her daze i was standing here waiting for the ax to fall i never thought thered be anyone in the first clan we sought help from powerful enoughand willingto handle this mess especially not after what it did to our mages nor did i he admitted i thought that surely even if there was a healing adept within ktreva that we would have to convince him to come here and then we would have to convince his clan to permit him to put himself at risk they must have been convinced already that we needed their help and were just waiting for us to ask for it elspeth crossed the room to stand closer to him was i missing something or did he imply that he was here after the stone shattered and that his clan was worried about yours darkwind winced but felt comfortable enough with her now not to bother covering it you are correct he saidor impliedexactly that memories though dimmed with time still had the power to hurt him heart and mind in agony as well as bodythe dim shapes of strangers in his sickroom shock holding him silent in the face of their gentle questioning then the voice of his father harshly telling them to leave the boy aloneright after the stone shattered i was told that ktreva sent mages to discover what had happened and to volunteer their help he told her i wasstill in shock hurt and i do not recall most of it but they went away without doing much except to help treat some of the worst wounded i suppose that father must have sent them away as soon as he could evidently if he tried to cover things up he didnt manage as well as he thought he had she replied dryly not if they were still concerned after all this time or he managed to let them see enough that there were still doubts kept from completely covering things up despite falconsbanes control that seemed the more likely given what else starblade had done like protecting his son by driving him awayelspeth shook her head i wonder sometimes if you realize just how strong your father is when you think what that kind of attempt must have cost him i cant imagine doing half that much it took some kind of cleverness too to get around falconsbanes compulsions starblades a strong man it is a brittle strength he replied sadly and like a bit of metal that has been bent too often he is apt to break if he is stressed again he shook his head ah this is gloomy thinking and poorly suited to our good news who knows it may speed fathers recovery it might at that it seemed to him when she stood up that she moved with a bit more energy certainly he felt that way a great burden had been taken from his shoulders ksheyna would have the help it needed the long nightmare would soon be over he refused to think beyond that there would be time enough for plans later let the stone be dealt with first and worry about what followed that when the time came he stopped at the gryphons lair long enough to give them the good news then they trudged back to the vale through the snow though it was nowhere near the job it was yesterday they had been this way so often they were making a trail between the ruins and the vale a few months ago he would have worried about that but not now there wasnt any real reason to worry about leaving signs of where they had been he sighed with relieved contentment and relaxed a bit more feeling muscles unknot all over his back shortly this would all be true tayledras land again and things like the changewolves would not get past the borders up help his head snapped up to a call only he heard vree he froze where he stood and linked with the gyre fearing the worst dawnfire and her redshouldered all over again elspeth and gwena stared at him for a halfheartbeat then went into defensive postures he prepared to break the link with vree if he had to to save himselfbut caught no pain no feeling of imminent danger vree felt him link and welcomed him in his mind seething with agitation but not pain he had given a distress call but the bondbird himself was uninjured here help looklooklook the bird mindcalled again and this time gave darkwind a look through his eyes a disorienting look for vree circled and twisted wildly but darkwind was used to looking through his bird eyes he recognized the spot immediately on the edge of the swamp but he did not recognize the man that was the source of vrees anger and distress a man laying out what could only be a hertasi trap the view dipped and swung as vree circled his silent rage burning in darkwinds mind making the tayledras clench his fists and longed with the bird to screech out a battlecry then with another turn darkwind saw what must have triggered that rage the man had three packmules with him and on the third was a raptor a big one bound on its back and hooded from the little he could see it looked to be a crested hawkeagle from the size of it it could only be of bondbird breeding he had no idea that he was running until he saw elspeth pounding beside him already astride her companion and offering him a hand up he seized it and scrambled behind her then they were off plunging through the thick snow this was not like the last wild ride hed made for gwena could not run or trot in the heavy snow her progress was a series of lunges or leaps it was harder for him to keep his balance on her back but easier on his bones their quarry knew they were coming for they made no effort to hide the noise of their passage but their quarry did not know two very pertinent facts he was nearer the hertasi village than he knew and while they were sluggish in the cold they were by no means impotent anger alone was enough to keep their blood warm in the snow and give them the same agility they had in the high heat of summer they too could dress for the cold and preserve some body heat when action outside was needed and although the encroachinf maiye had t a tk i al a l had caucht from call t at i i l on r e is as unuer no sucn nanalcap nor was darkwind while he was nowhere near as adept at mindspeaking with other creatures as his brother wintermoon he was still one of the best in the clan the soundless cry went out for assistance while vree was calling his fellow bondbirds darkwind was rousing the hertasi village starting with old nera the attack was conceived and coordinated in a matter of moments the three forces converged on their target at nearly the same instant if the magefor mage he was he had a lightningflare ready for them the moment they plunged over the top of the hill and began the sliding descent toward himhad only had to face darkwind and elspeth he might have won they were tired and he was fresh if he had only faced the hertasi with their simple fishing spears he would have won and he had already proven he was capable of felling bondbirds from the sky but since only darkwinds party was making any noise he had no idea that the others were on the way until it was too late to do anything about them darkwind flung a shield up before them to deflect the first bolt the second went awry as vree dove his claws ripping through the cloth of the mans hood narrowly missing the scalp behind vree came another forestgyre in the same stooping dive then a gyrkin then a trio of perlins all of them slashing at head and face with their long sharp talons they struck to hurt not to bind the perlins in fact struck closefisted as if they were trying to knock a duck out of the sky the mage screamed in pain as the talons scored deep gashes in his scalp staggered under the blows of the perlins any of which would have been hard enough to stun him had they hit the temple he tried to protect himself with his arms apparently like most pelagirwilds mages there were severe gaps in his education he seemed unable to summon any physical shields the birds retreated to the protection of the skies gaining altitude as one the mage stood one hand on his bleeding scalp from behind him a thicket of spears boiled up out of the halffrozen swamp darkwind struck then gesturing behind elspeths back with two clenching fists gray and green stripes of a binding spell tangled the mages hands and his magic for a moment that moment was all that was needed the hertasi did the rest they swarmed about the mage casting their fishing spears and pulling on the lines he tried to run then slipped and floundered in the heavy snow he scrambled to his feet again and fell for the last time the hertasi overran him and he writhed to avoid the wicked points of the spears in moments he looked like nothing so much as a hedgehog in heartbeats he was dead gwena skidded to a halt in the snow beside the mans string of pack animals a trio of tired mules who gazed at them with absolute indifference darkwind slid down off her back and hurried to the last one the one bearing the bird like just another bundle of forest gleanings this much the man had known he had bound the talons into fists tied them together bound the wings to the body so that it would not injure itself then hooded the bird so that it could not see and would not struggle the hood was strung to the bound feet by a cord to prevent further movement and from the cord dangled a carved bead as darkwinds hands touched the bundle he feltsomething it was akin to the draining effect of the heartstone and was centered in that bead and spread throughout the bindings he drew back and examined the bird with magesightand swore small wonder he had not heard the thoughts of this bird it was bound by magic as well as by bands of fabric a binding that linked its lifeforce to the spell that held it and that could only have been for one purpose elspeth bit her lower lip and peered at the bindings on the captured hawkeagle her face looked as it did when she was hearing news she didnt like he was going to use this bird as some kind of sacrifice wasnt he elspeth said her own voice tight with anger she put a hand toward the hawkeagle thats not all darkwind this bird is in pain he hurt it when he caught it she had been quicker than he though she could not sense the birds thoughts she had felt its pain he was glad he hadnt touched the poor thing he could only have hurt it worse unknowingly first things first destroy the magebindings so that the birds mind could roam free and it could hear his mindspeech until then it would struggle against him thinking he was an enemy hurting itself further the man had been a master but no adept darkwind snapped the shackles of magic with a single savage pull but left the physical bindings in place with a carefullyplaced dagger cut he removed the carved bead beneath the bindings the bird was in a state near to shock but not actually suffering from that ailment darkwind could still touch its mind talk to it sensibly and know he would be heard he stretched out his thoughtscarefully gently with a sure but light touch friend he said soothingly the hawkeagle tossed up its head as far as it could and struggled fruitlessly against the bindings not it screamed friend darkwind repeated firmly showing it a mental picture of its former captor lying in the stained snow the enemy is dead the bird struggled a moment more then stopped its head came up again but this time slowly as fear ebbed and the birds courage returned it considered his words for a moment and the image he had sent considered the sound of his mindvoice see it demanded imperiously im going to unhood him darkwind warned the hertasi backed off but both elspeth and her companion stayed i dont know what he might do hes bondbird stock and right now hes sensible but he may go wild once he can see again elspeth reached forward with gloved hands you need four hands to undo those wrappings ill take my chances dont say i didnt warn you no matter how intelligent bondbirds were raptors and likely to do unexpected things when injured and in pain even one like vree brought up from an eyas and bonded before he was hardpenned and this bird had never bonded to anyone still she was right and the sooner they got the bird untied the more likely it was to listen the bird had been hooded with an oversize falcons hood a little too small uncomfortable certainly and it would have been impossible for the bird to eat or cast through the hood but darkwind doubted that this man had made any plans to feed his catch through the hood or otherwise he got the end of one of the ties in his teeth and the other in his free hand and pulled continuing the motion with his hand to slip the hood off the magnificent hawkeagles head it blinked for a moment as the feathers of its crest rose to their full aggressive height the pupils of its golden eyes dilating to pinpoints as it got used to the light then it swiveled its head and saw for itself what darkwind had shown it it opened its beak in a hiss of anger and satisfaction then turned those intelligent golden eyes back to darkwind out it demanded flexing bound wings once in a way that left no room for doubt about what it meant out it seemed calm enough if still in pain let me get your feet free first he replied then you can stand while i get the rest of this mess off of you once again the bird gave careful consideration to what he had said weighing his reply against what it wanted darkwind marveled at the birds intelligence even vree seldom thought about what darkwind told him good the hawkeagle said shortly and stopped any effort to free itself it held itself completely still and while elspeth held the huge creature darkwind picked delicately at the mess of rags and string muffling the hawkeagles talons and tying them into fisted balls finally he got them free and elspeth placed the bird on the saddlepack its talons closed convulsively on the leather and it flexed its claws once or twice to assure itself of its balance the hawkeagle stood on the saddlepack and looked darkwind straight in the eyes good it said out now it waited while they picked the wrappings from its bound wings talons digging deeply into the leather covering of the pack those talons were as long as darkwinds fingers and the cruel hooked bill would have had no trouble biting through the spine of a deer darkwind wondered at the temerity of the dead man who had caught the bird mage though he was vree could kill a man with enough precisionand had done so in the past this bird was nearly double vrees size and not only could kill a man he could do it as easily as vree killed a rabbit if the hawkeagle hadnt been of bondbird stockand hadnt mindspoken with such clarity and relative calm given the situationdarkwind would never have dared to unhood him it would have been suicide the bird could have seriously hurt him even bound with a swift stroke of that terrible hooked beak when the last binding had been cut the magnificent hawkeagle spread wide brownbanded wings to the fullestand winced dropping the left one immediately the wing continued to droop a little after he had folded the right and tucked it up over his back he looked at darkwind demandingly hurts he said chest hurts wing hurts hurt when fell darkwind ran careful hands over the birds breast and quickly found the problem a cracked wishbone there was only one cure for that injury resting quietly while the bone set and mended it would take weeks to heal properly for bone healing did not work well on birds and the great hawkeagle might never fly with the same ease and freedom again winter would bring special problems cold would make the old injury ache and the stiffness in the wing would make it harder to catch swift prey a tragedyif he continued to live wild no special problemif he lived in the vale but a bondbird when not bonded as a fledgling or even an eyas was traditionally given a choice freedom or the bond darkwind explained it to the hawkeagle in simple terms if he would come and live in the vale his life would be thus he would bond to starblade who was himself wounded and in need of healingit was not his imagination the birds interest dulled by the pain he was in sharpened at that show he demanded darkwind obeyed showing him mental images of starblade as he was nowand one of starblade and his cherished perlin karry yes the bird said thoughtfully yees he dropped his head for a moment and it seemed to darkwind that he was thinking then his head came up again and he stared directly into darkwinds eyes i gowe go to that one he ordered to warm place to wounded one we belong him me need him me and although darkwind dutifully offered him his continued freedom after healing the bird refused to consider it we go he insisted and darkwind gave in gladly to him but with no little wonder he had never had a bondbird speak so clearly to himnor had he ever seen one exhibit genuine abstract thought before there was no doubt in his mind that the bird was quite certain starblade needed him and there was no doubt that the bird had responded to that need he had heard that the crested hawkeagles were different that waythat they had a greater capacity for bonds of affection than any other breed they often hunted in family groups and shared kills in the wild something most other raptors never did but no one in ksheyna had one of their kind so he had only hearsay to go on until now that is and he wondered since no one in ksheyna had ever flown the crested hawkeagles where had this one come from i was following that a little elspeth said as she dumped the packs from the mules leaving them for the hertasi to paw over so he does want to come with us so it would seem darkwind replied a bit amazed by how readily the bird had fallen in with their idea could it be a trap of some kind stupid vree said contemptuously from his perch in the tree above hyllarr goes to vale gets good food warm place safe place hunts only when he wants gets good friend hyllarr wants good friend mindfriend hyllarr flies he gets winter snow summer storms has to hunt get hurt again dies alone darkwind laughed and so did elspeth though she looked a little surprised that she could hear the gyres voice put that way it makes all the sense in the world doesnt it she said with a bright sparkle in her eyes here she offered her leatherclad arm ill take him for a moment while you get up on one of those mules then ill pass him back when youre mounted hyllarr looked at her arm for a moment then directly into her faceand with a delicate care that in no way hid the fact that his talons could pierce through her arm if he chose he stepped onto her forearm and balanced there while darkwind hoisted himself onto a mules back elspeth blanched and inhaled abruptly when hyllarr dug in while balancing himself no point in doing anything with the others he would leave them to wander or follow as they chose if they followed his mount to the vale someone there could always put them to good use if they didnt they would surviveor notas their fate and wits decreed elspeth held the hawkeaglehyllarr she reminded herselfsteadily despite the fact that it was a heavy weight there on her wrist but once he got himself settled and before he could reach out his own wrist to take the bird back hyllarr halfspread his wings and hopped from elspeths arm to darkwinds shoulder he tensed expecting the talons to close through his leather coat and into the flesh beneath but hyllarr shifted a little getting his balance and then closed his feet slowly carefully hurt he asked darkwind increasing the pressure a little more nonothere as the claws just pricked his skin he warned the bird and hyllarr eased off just that trifle needed to pull the talons back through the leather good the bird replied with satisfaction no hurt good go to warm place now that was an order if darkwind had ever heard one he turned to elspeth to see her own eyes alight with laughter and a little wonder i heard him that time she exclaimed i thinkmaybeive got the knack of talking to the bondbirds now theyre kind ofpitched higher than human mindvoices yes exactly he replied as pleased by her accomplishment as she was thats excellent well then you heard weve gotten our marching orders she eyed the long sharp talonsthe fierce beakand grinned you know given where hes perched right now i wouldnt argue with those orders if i were you i dont intend to he assured her and kicked the mule into a reluctant walk toward the vale elspeth and gwena following when darkwind turned the mule over to the hertasi he got them to find a stout branch that he could brace across his shoulder and hold with one hand that gave hyllarr a much more secure perch and one that eased darkwinds aching shoulder quite a bit he was going to be very glad when he delivered the bird to his father after that starblade could figure a way to carry him it would no longer be darkwinds problem the hawkeagle reveled in the heat of the vale rousing his feathers with a careful shake and raising his crest fully darkwind had decided on a tentative approach to his father on the slow ride to the vale now it only remained to convince the bird to cooperate he got hyllarrs attention with a little mental touch the kind he used with vree hyllarr replied definite feelings of relaxation and satisfaction coming along with the reply starblade is hurt he said hoping he could convey the complex idea in a way the bird would understand hurt hyllarr agreed and waited that was encouraging starblade is proud he continued showing the bird an image of hyllarr himself hurt but refusing all aid trying to fly and unable to proud the bird said agreeing again then stupid like first year try too much exactly darkwind said astonished that the bird understood so much he was to have an even bigger surprise for suddenly hyllarr drooped on his shoulder dropping the injured wing even further hurts the bird moaned making little chirps of distress oh huuuurts need starblade need starblade make better then the bird straightened again a distinct gleam of humor in the eye nearest darkwind good he asked good for proud starblade darkwind wanted to laugh both at the birds astonishing ability to act and at elspeths expression im as surprised as you are he grinned then returned his attention to the bird very good he replied exactly right the bird roused again with satisfaction hyllarr plays hurtwingeyas starblade feels good hyllarr gets many good eatings tender eatings tasty prey make hyllarr better all good you he said shaking an admonitory finger at the bird are going to wind up too fat to fly hyllarr bobbed his head to follow darkwinds fingertip then blinked in mock drowsiness darkwind felt his amusement he turned his head to look at elspeth who was fairly bursting with laughter dont you dare give this away he warned i dont know how hyllarr managed to grasp it but father really does need him this is going to make all the difference in his recovery if we dont ruin everything she nodded darkwind smiled his thanks to her as soon as they were within sight of starblades ekele he gave a silent cue to the hawkeagle who immediately went into full droop complete with weak pathetic chirps weak they might have been but starblade heard them readily enough he appeared at the door of the ekele leaning against it heavily with kethra supporting him from behind his face full of concern darkwind he said peering down at them in the gloom of late afternoon what is wrong with his eyes widened that is not vree darkwind gave his father a brief version of the rescue hyllarr needs quiet and someone to care for him father hes in a lot of pain i dont have the time to coax him to eat or keep an eye on that injuryand kethras a healer i thought she might be able to help him a little hyllarr chose just that moment to raise his head and look directly into the elder hawkbrothers eyes hurts he said plaintively oh huuuuurts darkwind suspected that he himself might have worn that stunned expression a time or two the first time vree spoke directly into his mind perhaps but it was more than he had expected to see it on starblades face it was only there for a moment then it was replaced by concern and something else a fierce protectivenessand the unmistakable look of the bondmate for his bird bring him up starblade ordered turning to go back inside darkwind struggled up the stairs as best he could with the weight of the bird on his shoulders overbalancing him he managed to make it to the door of the ekele without mishap but he had a feeling that the next time hyllarr went from ground to door it would be under his own power starblade was not going to be up to carrying hyllarr any time in the near future one of the hertasi squeezed by him as he moved inside and kethra met him at the door itself he tensed himself for her disapproval for starblade was moving about the room putting things aside readying a corner of the place for the invalid but her eyes were twinkling as she asked will he let me touch him yes i think so darkwind replied and as kethra placed a gentle hand on the hawkeagles breastfeathers she leaned in to whisper in darkwinds ear you just gave him the best medicine he could have had she said softly something to think about beside himself something stronger and prouder than he was that is hurt as badly and needs as much help thank you he flushed and was glad that it wasnt visible in the darkness of the room he has a cracked keel and wishbone kechara kethra said to starblade who had taken spare cushions from beneath the sand pan all tayledras kept under their birds perches and in the case of starblades ekele for guests bondbirds he must be in tremendous pain it will take a great deal of care for him to fly again hell have it never fear starblade said with some of his old strength you brought him to the right place son his eyes met darkwinds and once again darkwind flushed but this time with pleasure starblade actually smiled with no signs of pain age or fatigue darkwinds heart leapt that was his father before he could say anything the hertasi returned with two of his fellows two of them bore bags of sand for the tray the third had an enormous blockperch as tall as the lizard and very nearly as heavy the perch went into the tray and the other two hertasi poured their bags of clean sand all around it filling it and covering the base of the perch for added stability kethra stood aside and watched it all a calculating but caring expression on her face curling a length of hair between her fingers darkwind took hyllarr over to his new perch the bird made a great show of stepping painfully onto it but once there settled in with a sigh a sigh that darkwind echoed as the weight left him he put a hand to his shoulder and massaged it as he headed toward the exit kethra nodded to him with approval starblade took his place beside the perch the look of rapt attention on his fathers face was all darkwind could have hoped for and the look of bliss in the birds eyes as starblade gently stroked under his breastfeathers was very nearly its match chapter fifteen darkwind and elsdeth ifteen his partner and her companion had waited below while he presented starblade with his new partner well elspeth asked as soon as he got within whispering distance her face full of pentup inquiry it worked beautifully darkwind told her he permitted himself a moment of selfcongratulation and a brief embrace then gestured for her to follow so that there would be no chance of starblade overhearing them hes alreadyup out of bed and fussing around hyllarrits a definite match i dont think either of them have any idea how well they mesh but ive seen a hundred bondings and this is one of the best is hyllarr going to heal up all right she asked dubiously he shrugged as long as he isnt in pain it doesnt really matter how completely he heals even if the bird never flies again it wont make any real difference to father starblade isnt a scout he doesnt need a particularly mobile bondbird hyllarr will be able to get by quite well with the kind of short flights a permanently injured bird can manage elspeth considered that gwena nodded i see injuries that would doom a free bird wouldnt matter to one that is never likely to leave the vale it is rew of pain that matters not mobility he chuckled his agreement in fact i remember one of the mages from my childhood who had a brokenwinged crow that couldnt fly at all and walked all over the vale if it came to it hyllarr could do the same and be just as pampered gwena snorted delicately that makes an amusing picture starblade with the bird following him afoot or more likely carried by a hertasi well hyllarr isnt going to get fat if he finds himself walking i doubt that anyone as frail as your father is right now could carry that great hulk i couldnt carry him for long darkwind admitted i have no idea how scouts bonded to hawkeagles manage i thought my shoulders were going to collapse the important thing is starblade elspeth pointed out and it sounds like having hyllarr around is going to make the difference for him darkwind nodded and then the insistent demands of his stomach reminded him that they were both long overdue for a meal both no all surely gwena was just as ravenous unless she and elspeth too were suffering from something that often happened with young mages where the body was so unused to carrying the energies of magic that basic needs like hunger and thirst were ignored until the mage collapsed just as the impetus of fear or anger made the body override hunger and thirst so did the use of magicat least until the mage learned to compensate and the body grew used to the energies and no longer confused them if you two arent hungry you should be he told them elspeth i warned you about that happening but i dont think i told gwena it never occurred to me that she might be susceptible gwena paused her eyes soft and thoughtful for a moment i should be starving hmm i think i shall find a hertasi and have a good grain ration if youll excuse me with a bow of her head she trotted up the trail leaving them alone a wise lady he observed lets drop by iceshadows ekele long enough to give him the good news from ktreva and then take this conversation to somewhere theres food for us elspeth grinned i think im used to magic enough now because my stomach is wrapping around my backbone and complaining bitterly lets go iceshadow was overjoyed at the good news from ktreva and almost as pleased with the news about starblade they left him full of plans to inform the rest of the mages and with unspoken agreement reversed their course back to the mouth of the vale there were kitchens on the way but somehow that somewhere wound up being darkwinds ekele where his hertasi had left a warm meal waiting the hertasi information network was amazing word must have gotten around the moment theyd crossed into the vale before them were crisp finger vegetables and small broiled gamehens bread and cheese fruit and hot chava with beaten cream for two for desert darkwind dearly loved chava a hot sweet drink with a rich taste like nothing else in the world sometimes the hertasi could be coaxed into making a kind of thick cookie with chava and the two together were enough to put any sweet lover into spasms of ecstasy and while he had a moment of suspicion over the fact that the hertasi had left food and drink for two he had to admit that they had done so before and given his past perhaps the preparation was not unwarranted until elspeth had entered his life he had certainly eaten and slept in company more often than not this was a lovers meal though and they knew very well that he had not had any lovers since they had begun serving him was this an expression of hope on their part or something else well the chava could be used as bait to tempt elspeth into his bed that was certain he knew any number of folk who would do astonishing things foreven withthe reward of chava it was elspeths first encounter with chava and darkwind took great glee in her expression of bliss the moment she tasted it once again another devotee was created they took their mugs over to the pile of cushions in the corner that served as seating and lounging area you look just like hyllarr when starblade started scratching him he told her chuckling all halfclosed eyes and about to fall over with pleasure no doubt she replied easing back against the cushions with the mug cradled carefully in her hand so as not to spill a single drop complete with raptorial beak predators eyes and unruly crest she spoke lightly but darkwind sensed hurt beneath the words that was the same hurt he had sensed when she spoke of being afraid that most men were interested only in her rank not in her why do you say that he asked she snorted and shook her head darkwind i thought we were going to be honest with each other ive mentioned this before i know i have can you honestly say that i am not as plain as a board he studied her carefully before he answered the spare sculptured face the expressive eyes the athletic figure none of which were set off to advantage by unadorned white plainedged clothingor for that matter the drab scout gear she wore now the thick dark hairwhich he had never see styled into anything other than an untamed tumble or pulled back into a tail i think he replied after a moment that you have been doing yourself a disservice in the way you dress with your white uniform washing out your color and no ornaments you look very functional certainly quite competent and efficient but severe what i said plain as a board she sipped her chava hiding her face in her cup i like the colored things the hertasi have been leaving out for me but they dont make much difference that i can see no he corrected not plain as a board improperly adorned scout gear is still too severe to display you properly you should try magerobes mages need not consider impediments such as strolls through bramble tangles many tayledras costumes were suited to either sex elspeth with her lean figure would not distort the lines of some of his own clothing there were a number of costumes he had designed and made long ago that he had never worn or worn only once or twice when songwind became darkwind and the mage became the scout those outfits had been put away in storage as inappropriate to the scouts life they were memories that could be hidden and truthfully he had not wanted to see them again they belonged to someone else another life another time their cheerful colors had been illsuited to his grief and his anger he had not in fact even worn them now that he was a mage again and in the vale though he had brought them out of storage with the vague notion that he might want them they were here now in this new ekele in chests in one of the upper rooms he studied her for a moment considering which of those halfremembered robes would suit her best the mbyfirebird first he decided the amber silk the peacockblue the sapphire and the emerald perhaps the tawny shirt and fawn breechesno too light they will wash her out hmm i should go and see what is there i cant recall the half of them wait here he said and before she could answer ran up the ladderlike stair to the storage room at the top of the ekele maybe the tawny with a black highnecked undergarment for contrast he returned with his arms full of clothing robes and halfrobes shirts and flowing breeches in the shinain style vests and wrapshirts all in jewelbright colors made of soft silks and supple leathers and scented with the cedar of the chests light clothing all of it made for the gentle warmth of the vale there were other magerobes heavier made to be worn outside the vale but none of those were as extravagant as these outfits tayledras mages did not advertise their powers in outrageous costumes when outside the confines of their homes unless meeting someone they knew or knew would be impressed here he said shaking out the rubycolored silk halfrobe and matching shinain breeches cut as full as a skirt and bound at the ankles with ribbon ties the halfrobe had huge winglike sleeves with scalloped edges and an asymmetric hem try this one on while i find some hair ornaments she stared at him at the clothing and back again as if he had gone quite mad but he grinned at her indulge me this is my art if you will and it has been long since i was able to spare a moment for it go on go onif youre modest theres a screen over there you can stand behind to dress he turned to his collection of feathers and beads crystals and silver chains all hung like the works of art they were on the walls by the hertasi of course when hed lived outside the vale hed had no time to sort through the things and hang them up properly they winked and gleamed in the light from his lamps and candles as he considered them some of them he had made but most had been created by other tayledras most of them sadly were either dead or with the exiles but the delicate works of their hands remained to remind him that not every hour need be spent in war and defense after a moment he heard elspeth rise and take the clothing behind the screen heard cloth sliding against cloth and flesh as she undressed then the softer hissing sounds of silk against that same flesh he closed his eyes for a moment reflecting on how good it felt to be doing this againafter all that had happened that there was still a skill he could use without thought of what it meant tactically a moment later she slipped from behind the screen and he heard her bare footfalls against the boards of the ekele floor i hope i have this stuff on right she said dubiously as he selected three strands of hair ornaments from among those on the wall he turned his hands full of beaded firebird feathers and smiled with pleasure at the sight of her she made a sour face and twisted awkwardly i look that silly do i on the contrary you look wonderful she pursed her lips then smiled reluctantly he admired her for a moment as he had thought the variegated rich rubies and wines of the halfrobe heightened her otherwise dull coloring with her face tanned by the wind and sun and her dark brown hair without the help of color reflected up from her clothing it was no surprise that she thought herself plain but now she glowed and her hair picked up auburn highlights from the rubyred silks and with her hair braided and ornamented instead of being simply pulled back from her faceshe is going to look magnificent when her hair turns white he thought admiringly but nowno this severe style is not going to work colors a bit too strong it looks wrong now before she could move or even protest he had his hands buried in her hair braiding the beaded cords of feathers into one side then he created a browband with another cord pulling some of the rest of her hair with it across her forehead to join the braid on the other side it didnt take long her hair was ridiculously short by magestandards and even many of the scouts wore theirs far longer than hers but when released from that severe tail it had a soft gentle wave that went well with the braids and beaded feathers there he said turning her to face the mirror that had been left covered as was customary with an embroidered cloth he whisked the cloth away revealing her new image to her eyes i defy you to call yourself plain now her mouth formed into a silent oh of surprise as she stared at the exotic stranger in the mirror she flushed then paled then flushed again and her whole posture relaxed and softened i would give a great deal to see you appear in your court dressed this way he said a little smugly he was rather proud of the way she looked in his handiwork better than he had imagined in fact i think that you would set entirely new fashions she moved carefully holding out her arms to see the fall of the sleeves twirling to watch the material slip about her legs and hips her eyes sparkling with unexpected pleasure i had no idea the last time i wore anything like this it was for talias wedding i was a cute little girl but well cuteness wears off i never thought i could look like this she shook her head her eyes still riveted to the mirror i thought that the clothing the hertasi had been leaving for me was nice but compared to this scouts clothing it was really he said with a shrug quite as practical as your herald uniforms mages tend to prefer more fanciful garb and certainly more comfortable these are for delight showing off dancing display as our birds do for the sheer joy of doing so or for before she could respond to that he had picked out a full robe in monochrome intensities of vivid blue come he said coaxingly let us try another i wish to see you in all of these me what about you what about me he repeated puzzled what have i to do with this youre a mage arent you and arent these your costumes she folded her arms stubbornly across her chest id like to see what you look like in these things try as he would he could not dissuade her before she would consent she insisted that if she was going to prance about in bright feathers he would have to do the same so nothing would have it but that he must don a set of dancing gear before she would change her costume for another the evening hours passed the two of them playing among the costumes like a pair of children at dressup laughing and admiring together some time later he had draped her in a swath of ambergold that brought sunlike highlights to her hair and a tayledrassheen to her skin any of the vivid colors suited her but she glowed in the warm colors he had decided this particular robe though he did not tell her so was a lounging robea dalliance robe in fact a lovers robe meant for display to one person not to many he had made it for himself but had not liked the color once he had tried it onone of the few times he had misjudged color for himself but on her you must keep that he whispered as she turned and twisted plainly taking sensuous pleasure in the soft slip of the silk against her skin no indeed you must he insisted as she turned to protest it was never suited to me but i think i must have somehow designed it with you in mind the words had been meant to come out teasingly but somehow they turned in his mouth and hung in the air between them with more meaning in them than he had intended he reached delicately to a glass box and opened it and before he knew what he was doing he reached toward her his hand holding a single brightly beaded feather not one of vreesthough at this moment he would have offered her that if he had thought she might take it but he dared not he hardly believed that he dared this she knew what that meant nowand as she stared at it and at him with her expression gone quiet and unreadable he feared that he had just undone all that had been built between them but her hand reached for hisand gently took the feather and carefully as if it or she might break she braided it into her hair then took a deep breath her eyes wide and dark waiting they both stepped forward at the same moment he reached up with both hands and cupped her face between them as carefully as he would grasp a downy dayold falcon her skin was as soft as the washed silk she wore and very warm beneath his hands as if she was flushed or feverish it occurred to him then that she mightno mustbe shy of him and of what was to come with a last weary exercise of his magic he dimmed the magelights the comparison and the contrast was inevitable this was no dawnfire elspeth for all her courage elsewhere all her eagerness was trembling and halffrightened with him it came to him in a rush how far away from her home she wasall the trials she had faced and now thisit was up to him to take the lead she was unsure of herself and not certain what he wanted of her but there was desire there so he would go as gently with her as he would with caring for a frightened wild bird she was not likely a virgin but it did not necessarily follow that she was experienced in lovemaking he could by accident frighten her with a technique she had never experienced with all sincerity he hoped there would be ample times in the future to explore he kissed her once then dropped his hands catching hers and led her back to the bower of cushions on the floor he slowly drew her down beside him and there they stayed while he caressed her letting the silk slide over her body beneath his hands he touched her gently shoulders back breasts necklet the silk carry the movement of his hands she shivered again but now it was not from halfformed fear but from anticipation her lips parted in a gentle moan of pleasure and she lay her head back with a visible expression of delight after a moment she returned his caresses hesitantly at first then with more boldness her hands wandered as freely as his and he kept careful control over himself lest he move too quickly with her but it had been a very long time since his last lover a very long time controlling himself was as difficult as any magic he had ever attempted now they drew closer and her lips met his if he had any thoughts until that moment that she might regret having accepted his feather they were dismissed by the eagerness with which she returned his kiss he allowed his mind to brush hers for a moment as his mouth opened for her he garnered two important things from that brief contact she was by no means as experienced a lover as he but she was as perfectly willing to be his pupil in this as in the other subjects he had taught her she had confidence in his skill abed so take things slowly the greater her desire the calmer at first the more fully she felt their bodies the better the experience he slid his hands under the silk of the robe and continued his slow sensual caresses continued until any thought of fear was a longforgotten triviality then he joined his mind to hers very lightly and showed her wordlessly what would pleasure him as he noted what pleasured her she was soft silk in his hands and warm honey in his mouth feathercaress and nectar her scent was of sandalwood cinnamon and herbs his was of musk and rich chava her skin tasted saltysweet and where their bodies touched liquid fire poured between them when their minds were so entwined that there was no telling where one ended and the other began only then did he join his body into hers a pair of hawks spiraling slowly up a thermal talons entwined they rose together and soared into the sunelspeth lay in silk and warmth and thought of absolutely nothing content to savor the warm glow that bathed every pore content to listen to darkwind breathing beside her content for the moment to forget everything she was and simply be darkwind lay quietly beside her his breathing slow and even she listened to him thinking that sleep could not be far off for her either but hoping to hold it away a little longer and savor the moment i trust i achieved your expectations she started he laid a calming hand on her shoulder and she laughed breathlessly willing her heart to calm i thought you were asleep she said i mean you sounded like you were that would be unforgivably crude darkwind replied with just a hint of laughter in his voice at least it would be by our customs she thought of the fewto be honest threelovers she had taken to her bed not counting the almostlover whose tryst talia had interrupted so long ago skif had never been one of themwhich might have accounted for the way he had overreacted when they were alone on the road together they were all friends she and her lovers but never more than that and they had trysted with the understanding that it would remain that way heralds all of them of course talia had been right about that only a herald could be trusted to be completely discreet about making love with the heir two of them had always fallen asleep immediately afterward and she had slipped out of their rooms to return to her own oh they were always tired she thought in their defense and no sooner were they rested than they were haring off again out on circuit they couldnt help it and it would have been an awful scandal for me to act openly as their lover neave never fell asleep but then he never ever fell asleep with anyone else in his bed he couldnt not after what hed been through he was healing but sometimes she wondered if he would ever really be healed perhaps not and her times with him had been as much comfort for him as lovemaking oh he was skilled hed had no choice but to learn skill poor child how anyone could make a child into an object like that to use a child an unconsenting terrified childshe deliberately turned her thoughts away from the past i think i could learn to like your customs she said keeping her tone light it seems a bit more civilized than to simply roll over and forget ones partner when the moment is gone well but it is no jest not really he replied with a fingerbrush along her cheek wait a moment he gently disentangled himself from her and with a whisper of cloth faded into the darkness her ears strained to hear what he was doing but she could not make anything out except some vague sounds of moving about he returned in a moment and took his place beside her again felt for her hand and pressed a cool cup into it she sipped and found that it was delightfully cold and sweet water before she knew it she had drained the cup and feeling for a secure place to put it set it down on a table beside her with a sigh sometimes i suspect the hertasi of prescience he said after a moment a meal for two waiting chava for two to inflame the senses with cool water waiting with two cups to quench the thirst she chuckled maybe is that one of your customs pampering your partner oh the custom is simpler than that he replied setting his cup down somewhere with a faint tick it is that one does not simply fall asleep without expressing ones delight in ones partner his voice was warm with approval and she found herself blushing that is a most civilized custom she replied after a moment and she groped for something to say that would not make her blush even harder consider it expressed would you care to accept my feather in the future wingsib he persisted she couldnt help it she flushed so hotly that she feared she must be glowing in the dark iwould very much like it she stammered ah now i embarrass you forgive me he said quickly we are a forward people we tayledras the shinain claim that like kestrels we have no shame but i hope you will not take it amiss that i am very glad to hear your reply nono not at all oh she must sound like a schoolchild in the throes of infatuation thank you bright lady that gentle hand touched her cheek again and this time he did not withdraw are you rested he asked his finger tracing a line down her cheek then further down along the line of her throat ithink so she stammered again what was he about well thenthere is another custom he chuckled which is why the shinain compare us to kestrels in more than being shameless then to her astonishment he pressed gently against her and began all over again at first she was too surprised to respond but her astonishment did not outlive the realization that he was quite serious and quite intent and quite quite splendid this time she brought the water with help from a tiny magelight to find where the hertasi had left the pitcher he accepted it with a sleepy smile and a kiss in the palm of her hand she took her place beside him quite certain that even if she had wanted to her legs would not have carried her as far as her own ekele and she didnt want to leave not really her bed was cold and lonely and darkwind was warm and quite ready to cradle her in his arms who would she outrage anyway not gwena not the hertasi not any of the hawkbrothers who partnered whomever they pleased even skif could not take her to task there were no court gossips here no word of this would get back to scandalize whatever potential bridegrooms there might be not that there seemed to be any in the offing nothing would persuade her to wed ancar and it was not likely that karse had any royal sons to wed to satisfy an alliance her mother had satisfied any need for bonds with rethwellan who would she wed some furcovered hulk from the north they didnt even have any govermnent they were a series of warring tribes perhaps she could choose a partner to suit herselfand now darkwind whispered custom satisfiedi feari must sleep a yawn punctuated the sentence and she found herself echoing it custom satisfied she yawned again i agree then good night he whispered zhaihelleva sleep had her by the shoulders and was dragging her down into darkness but had she heard what she thought she heard had he whispered with the sigh of one drifting into slumber zhaihelleva ashke wind to thy wingsbeloved the hertasi brought her clothing and laid it beside breakfast for two without so much as a single eyeblink to show that they considered her spending the night anything out of the ordinary gwena appeared shortly afterward to tell them that they had been relieved of the duty of chasing away what had been attracted by their profligate use of power and even her companion had nothing to say on her choice of sleeping places and partners iceshadow approved of your choice of nonweaponry she told them illusions make a lessvisible use of power he has some other mages out there doing what you didwith backups of course in case the beasties dont frighten away right now he wants you to meet with him and the elders and anyone else that is freehes holding a clanwide general meeting i assume he wants us to tell them all exactly what the message said darkwind replied after a moment of thought as he braided his hair away from his face probably he didnt tell me she tossed her head with feigned indignation but elspeth could tell that she didnt mean it i told him that it was my opinion that you two needed a day of rest anyway he seemed inclined to agree his exact words were as much rest as the clan can afford them at any rate darkwind chuckled meaning that we are still on call ah well it is better than being out in the snow they ate slowly elspeth being very aware of darkwinds eyes lingering on her and being unable to resist taking a few long lingering glances herself he certainly provided a pleasant place to rest the eyes he no longer seemed so exoticalthough he did look a bit odd with white showing at the roots of his hair she couldnt help but think of certain blonde ladies whose hair often showed the opposite coloration at its roots it no longer seemed strange to have the bondbird sitting beside them taking bits of raw meat from darkwinds fingers for that matter it no longer seemed revolting to eat her breakfast and watch the bird bolting his tidbitsshe remembered then that she had been able to hear the bird yesterday was that still true well why not test it vree she called tentatively pitching her mindvoice up high trying to reach the same place she had heard him the bird looked up startled and immediately turned his head upside down to look at her he sent yes shes speaking to you silly bird darkwind said lightly with an approving glance at her that warmed her all the way down to her toes its considered polite to answer yees vree replied cautiously righting his head again how is hyllarr she asked figuring that was an innocent enough question and one the bird should be able to answer easily enough hungry healing happy vree roused all his feathers evidently tickled by his own alliteration very good is good bonding lhank you she told him and he bobbed his head at her before turning his attention back to darkwinds tidbits why can i talk to him now when i couldnt before she asked hoping he knew the answer i thinkmostly because you know now that he mindspeaks so you began listening unconsciously for where he was speaking darkwind hazarded the gryphons speak high but in the ranges you were listening in alreadybut listening to them made you ready to listen even higher i think i dont think that you are developing a new gift good she replied a little relieved one at a time is enough he laughed and fed vree the last bit of meat shall we go he asked standing up and offering her his hand the meeting was relatively uneventful until starblade put in an appearance he leaned heavily on kethra and a walkingstick and sat down immediately but it was already obvious that despite his physical weakness there was new life in his eyes and new hope in his spirit he listened to both of them recount what they remembered of the message and waited for the buzz of conversation to die down before clearing his throat to speak he got immediate silence before any of you speculate he said carefully yesktreva did send mages to see if we needed help immediately after the stone shattered and i did turn them away with protests that we were fully capable of dealing with the situation ourselves you all know why i did that i am sorry but this may have been all to the good in some ways when they offered help the healing adept of which they speak had only just come into his power now he is at full strength had he tried to deal with the stone as it was it might have killed him and the rest of us as well certainly it would have damaged him and our great enemy would have had a way into the power of a healing adept as a result and that would have been even more of a catastrophe murmurs around the circle showed that most of the clan agreed with him elspeth didnt even want to think about mornelithe falconsbane having that much power the little that she had seen of him had convinced her that he had been far too powerful as it was now starblade continued i believe that with the help of darkwind wingsib elspeth honored gwena and our gryphon allies all will be well but i am only one i think that every voice should be heard in this it is the fate of our entire clan that we are discussing elspeth followed as much as she could but the hawkbrothers were more than a bit agitated and as a result spoke a little faster than she preferred she gathered that they were on the whole inclined to agree with starblade but they had been deceived before and were determined to do what they could to see that it did not happen again as the meeting went on starblade wilted visiblyyet seemed stubbornly determined to remain and prove that he was no longer acting against the good of the clan finally elspeth couldnt stand it any more she stood up all eyes focused on her and the babble of speech cut off abruptly leaving her standing in silence i havent endured what you have she said slowly and i havent been a mage for very long ive certainly never seen a healing adept so i have no idea what they can or cant do but we took a lot of time preparing that message we told ktreva everything we knew in as much detail as we could surely since they were already worried about us this adept they are sending has had time to prepare for trouble surely he comes not only armed but armored she sat down again wondering if shed managed to insult all of them or if shed made some sense evidently the latter since she saw iceshadow smiling slowly and there was very little muttering and much nodding of heads has everyone said what is needed iceshadow asked once the last of the muttering died down he looked about but no one seemed inclined to jump to his or her feet very well then i the bottom dropped out of elspeths stomach and although she hadnt moved it felt as if she had suddenly plummeted about five feet what in she looked wildly about was it an attack had something gone wrong with the stone but no one else seemed alarmed and she calmed her pounding heart iceshadow actually grinned at the expression on her face whatever it was it probably looks like someone hit me in the back of the head with a board that i think makes the rest of the arguments moot iceshadow said so if no one has any objection i will declare the meeting closed under cover of the rest standing up and moving off in twos and threes or more elspeth leaned over to darkwind and asked and just what was that was that an earthquake ive heard of them but not an earthquake no although i am told that the feeling is very similar save that the earth itself does not move darkwind replied no that was the establishing and closing of a longranging gate that you just felt very abruptprobably to keep from disrupting the stone too much normally the flux is much more gradual and less noticeable you mean he took her hand and squeezed it his smile inviting her to share in his triumph yes at last there is very little that is likely to stop him and there is no more chance for argument our help is on the way we have won chapter sixteen firesong darkwind took nothing about elspeth for granted but when she returned with him to his ekele he thought it reasonable to assume that she was not displeased with him in the clear light of day he had not been certain she was so selfpossessed she rarely revealed what was in her mind as important as her mind he was not certain what the reaction of her companion would be to their assignation despite the fact that gwena had left them alone together but there were inevitable awkward moments to come the early moments of a new liaison were always full of such things when neither knows quite what to say or do and neither is familiar enough with the other to read body and voice trying not to appear too distant yet not wanting to seem possessive making the dance moves of courtship and trying not to stumble through themall of this was universal he paused at the foot of the stairs and cleared his throat at the same time that she said darkwind they looked at each other and laughed selfconsciously i was about to suggest that we take advantage of our temporary freedom to soak away some bruises he said offering a neutral occupation which had the potential to become something else entirely in this at least he had more experience than she he had skydanced through a fair number of courtships the hertasi are skilled at massage if you like they use carved wooden rollers instead of claws and thick oils she stretched in a way that suggested that she might well be suffering from sore muscles stiffly and with a little wince of pain rather than coyly or provocatively i would like that she replied then she smiled wryly now the pertinent questionwere you thinking of soaking in the same pool as me or going off on your own i would enjoy your company but i wont be upset if youd like to have some time to yourself her smile became a grin astera knows youve seen quite enough of me and my oversharp tongue i wouldnt blame you if youd like a respite actually i was hoping youd join me but in the pool near your tree he said relieved at her words and even more so at the touch of selfdeprecating humor yours is the warmest pool in the vale i will ask my hertasi to bring oils once i find them they havent established a summoning method yet shall i meet you there she suggested gracefully youve got things to doand im still something of an appendage to the clan it didnt take him too long to find the two lizardfolk it took him even less time to make his way to the pool he now thought of as elspeths but by the time he got there she was already chindeep in hot water her hair piled up on the top of her head and her eyes halfclosed in pleasure we must have slipped and fallen in the snow a hundred times i have bruises in places i didnt even guess at i have got to find some way to reproduce these pools once i get back home she said as he shed clothing and joined her a hot bath is no substitute for this the two lizardfolk busied themselves in setting up cushions and towels beside the pool once they were ready he and elspeth could go to their skillful hands with their muscles warm and pliant much easier to take the knots out of muscles that were relaxed and warmed than those that were stiff and tense have you no hot springs in your homeland he asked lazily slipping into the hot water with a sigh of pleasure i would find that very strange you would find a lot of things about my land very strange she said at least as strange as skif and i find the vale and speaking of skiff he felt a chill in spite of the heat of the water was she about to reveal that she and skif were betrothed or something of the sort while he had no claims on her nor had any right to think of such thingsthe idea disturbed him in a way that he did not want to examine too closely but she was continuing and there was nothing in her tone to give him any kind of clue to her feelings about the other herald speaking of skifdarkwind what should i do about nyara ifwhen he finds her should i worry should i even try to do anything i do not know he said carefully choosing his words in the hopes that they would not turn to stones and bruise his already shaken pride first i must ask you thiswhat is skif to you to me she opened her eyes and looked him full in the face and he was relieved to see that there was nothing hiding there no hitherto undisclosed passions no pain only simple concern my very good friend my bloodbrother mywingsib if you will for the heralds are the closest thing to a tayledras clan that my people know he has no other kin but the heralds and im one of the closest friends he has among them im worried about him darkwind there was something she hadnt told him yet why should you worry he asked he seems perfectly capable to me she sighed and chewed her lower lip ive known him a long time and the skif you know isnt the skif i first made my brother i havent talked to anyone about this but something happened to him a couple of years ago something to do with the war with hardorn and it changed him he hasnt been the same since but he never said anything to me about it and i dont feel that i should press him on the subject i mean he values his privacy he considered her words for a moment hoping that the relief he felt on learning that skif was no more than a brother to her did not show too clearly but changes in a personalityoh he was all too familiar with that though this was not likely to be the kind of sinister change that had overcome starblade no more like the change of shock that had made songwind become darkwind i think that if it was something he felt comfortable about revealing to you he would have done so he said carefully that may have been because he considered you to be too sheltered to reveal it because he was ashamed of it or even because you are female and he is male do i take it that this experiencewhatever it wasdamaged him in some way not physically but he was never ascarefree afterward she replied thoughtfully yes i would say that it damaged him probably all three reasons have something to do with why he has never told me about it in that case he might well reveal it to wintermoon darkwind mused aloud that would be a good thing my brother is a remarkable man and has his own burdens he might be pleased to reveal that would be a good thing as well she gave him a glance filled with hope and speculation do you think so hes been soi dont know before he was always eager for the next adventure now it seems as if adventure has soured for him and all hes looking for is peace and i think that nyara just might be able to ease some of what is hurting him if she doesnt hurt him further a good point i do not think that she would do so apurpose he said raising a dripping hand from the water to rub his temple she has been both cause and receiver of too much harm to wish to work further such i think nyara oh there was a potential to become the lash of a whip if not carefully dealt with but there is pain waiting for him with that one be she ever so wellintentioned elspeth nodded youre thinking what im thinking if heno when he finds her if she is not in love with him hes going to be hurt would it were only as simple as that you know that if she does love him and ran to save him before for that reason he is destined for even greater hurt darkwind raised himself a little higher in the water rested his arms on the ledge around the pool and propped his head on one hand you must know that elspeth think on it suppose she loves him truly suppose she accepts his love my people would have trouble in accepting a changechild as the lover of one of their kin but yours to them will she not seem a monster she groaned and rubbed her eyes i wish i could tell you no but i cant gods darkwind the shinain are looked at askance when a rare one comes to valdemar the hawkbrothers are legends only theyd try to put her in a menagerie she shook her head no matter what we did how we tried to disguise her i doubt it would hold for long soon or late any disguise is unmade any illusion is broken he agreed nor is that the only problem with nyara she is utterly totally foreign her ways could never be yours gods of my fathers her ways are utterly alien to my people among yours she would be like unto a plainscat given a collar and called a pet elspeth groaned and thatthat aura of sexuality she hasthat isnt going to win her any converts i can tell you that havens she even made me annoyed sometimes and there was nothing for me to be irritated with her over except that every male eye must ever be on her he said ruefully be he ever so faithful to his lover he still must react to her like a male beast in season even iwell i entertained fantasies and i knew well the danger she implied you say that skif seems to seek only peace well he will not find it with that one on his arm every male with no manners will be trying to have her for himself every female will react as youor more strongly and she cant help herself elspeths mouth quirked in a half smile at his confession but she quickly sobered darkwind what should i do should you do anything he countered can you do anything is there even any advice that you could give him that he would heed she shook her head sadly probably not i guess theres only one thing i can doto be ready for whatever decision he and she make that is all that a friend can do elspeth he agreed and i think perhaps that is all that a friend should do but you know there is another course that he might take that you do not seem to have considered what would you and your people think if he should choose to stay herewith her if he she stared at him now as if the very idea were so alien that she couldnt quite grasp it but hes a herald he is also a humanand a man and he is very much in love darkwind had a fleeting feeling of disorientation as if he were not talking only about the herald skif would your people make him choose between his love and his land would this cause his companion to abandon him i dont know she said helplessly the subject has never come up interesting he leaned back into the water again perhaps you and gwena should discuss this at length i have the feeling that it may be important so do i she replied slowly so do i the adept from ktreva did not appear by nightfall at which point darkwind felt that he had most probably taken the wise course of finding a secure place to rest for the night when he and elspeth sought out iceshadow just after dusk the elder said words to that same effect i do not think our clansbrother is likely to arrive on our doorstep until the morning iceshadow predicted as the three of them strolled back to the elders ekele were i he i would find a tervardi and share his shelter for the night i have sensed nothing amiss and i think if he were in trouble we would certainly know it darkwind nodded very few tayledras traveled by night by choice even fewer did so in unknown and possibly dangerous territory he knows that our borders are shrunken and that the land within them is not certain the heavy snows of the past few days have probably slowed him down i doubt the one who replied took the difficulties of winter riding into account when he sent the message and told you the adept would arrive in half a day even on dyheli i would not undertake to go anywhere in this snow in half a day they reached iceshadows home at that moment the elder stretched and paused with one hand on the railing i would not worry were i you i am not concerned we will see this marvel when he arrives and not before and the matter of one or two days more is not going to make a great deal of difference to our situation true when they agreed he chuckled and bid them a pleasant evening a certain twinkle in his eyes as he looked from elspeth to darkwind and back not that darkwind minded the delay once the healing adept arrived he and elspeth would start on a round of magicuse that would leave them quite exhausted at days end he knew that from experience sadly heavy magicuse tended to leave one too weary for dalliance they would have one more night together at leastor so he hoped this time since they were so near she had invited him to her ekele for supper while the hertasi turned them both into limp yarn dolls at the time he had thought he saw faras the one working on her back smile a little when she made the invitation he said nothing though then or now she knew that the lizardfolk used mindspeech as easily as humans used their voices though what she might not know was the way the little folk like to play at matchmakingthey took a second soak in the pool then slipped into a pair of thick robes that the hertasi had left there for them leaving the pool when dusk was only a memory and full darkness shrouded the vale darkwind was not certain how elspeth felt but he had not been so relaxed or content for a very long time he followed her up to her ekele pretty well certain of what he would find there he was not disappointed the robe of amber silk clean again was waiting for herand his favorite of deep blue lay beside it across the cushions and on the table there waited another intimate supper for two this one was a bit different though he recognized it though she would not have this was a lovers supper a trysting meal sensual delights things to tease the palate and the four senses light foods the kind found at festivals arranged in single bitesized pieces food made to be eaten with the fingersor fed to another oddly modest she caught up the robe and carried it into the next room to change into it although she had not seemed so shy at the pool he would have enjoyed seeing the soft silk slip over her young supple body well that would come in time as she lost her shyness with him if they had the timehe pushed the thought from his mind he would enjoy what they had and not seek to shape their future he slipped into his own robe as she returned the amber silk caressing her and enveloping her like a cloud of golden smoke she made a circuit of the room lighting scented candles to perfume the air he watched her with pleasure and wondered a little at her grace had she always moved like that or had he only now begun to notice he waited until she had made herself comfortable before moving toward her she patted a place beside her and he settled next to her his most urgent appetite was not for food but he contented himself with nibbling on a slice of quince as she hesitantly took a piece of cheese what do you think hell be like she asked abruptly proving that whatever his thoughts were hers were elsewhere the question took him by surprise and he had to drag his thoughts away from contemplating her and apply them to something a bit more abstract the healing adept you mean he hazarded that was the only he the question seemed apt for the one from ktreva she nodded and he made a half shrug he hadnt thought about it he was far more interested in the adepts skills than in anything else it usually takes a healing adept years to come into his full power so i suppose that he is probably about the age of my father he said after a moment probably very serious very deliberate although he frowned trying to recall the messages exact words they did say that he was a kind of experimenter that is an interesting point he might be more like kraheera than my father what that funny kind of trickster she nibbled at a piece of fruit but powerful oh that at the least he agreed he would have to be to be willing to ride alone across uncertain land i think that he will definitely have that kind of air about him that iceshadow has when he is truly certain of himself except that he will have it all the time you have that air sometimes she said suddenly no now that startled him i do yes she licked juice from her fingers and gave him a sidelong glance you did last night sometimes i think you dont give yourself enough credit he shook his head i think you are being flattering but im not really hungry she interrupted him are you he laughed now knowing where the pathway was leading not for this sort of food he said bondbirds carried the message in midmorning that the ktreva adept was less than a league away those of the clan that were not otherwise engaged in clan duties gathered at the entrance of the vale to await his arrival although the snow was kneedeep beyond the veil it would not have been a proper welcome to greet him within elspeth and darkwind were among them and she thought privately that this mysterious mage could not have contrived a more perfect backdrop for his first appearance the clouds of the past few days had cleared away by dawn and the sun shone down out of a flawless blue sky filling the snowbedecked woods outside the entrance of the vale with pure white light there wasnt even a breath of wind and the woods were completely silent except for a few calls of birds off in the distance as they waited in the snow straining their ears for the sound of hoofbeats elspeth fretted a little beneath the suspense of the moment even gwena seemed tense with anticipation finally the sound they had been waiting for echoed beneath the trees the muffled thud of hooves pounding through snow from the cadence elspeth knew that he had urged his mount into a gallop not that dyheli had any objection to galloping but he could not possibly have kept up that pace all the way here only a companion had the stamina to gallop for hours at a time either hes impatient for the end of the trip or he wants to make an impressive entrance she thought with amusement and then the object of their anticipation came pounding in sprays of snow flying all about him and a magnificent snowwhite firebird skimmed just beneath the branches precisely over his head its tail streaming behind it as the adepts long hair streamed behind him the firebird was the biggest one she had ever seenand never had she ever heard of anyone using one for a bondbird it threw off the little falsesparks of golden light as it flew glittering a creature of myth or tales from the murmurs of surprise she surmised that no one among the hawkbrothers had ever seen a firebird bondbird before either it was at least as large as darkwinds forestgyre it seemed to be larger because of the length of its magnificent tail the head with its huge iceblue eyes was just as large as any bondbirds head which meant it could be as intelligent as the rest but the firebirds were seed and fruit eaters not carnivores or hunters well why not hes a mage he doesnt need a combative bird to help him the way the scouts do the adept pulled up before the entrance to the vale in a shower of snow and a flurry of hooves like some kind of young god of winter or an icestorm personified even his mount gave elspeth pause for a moment until she saw the curving horns over the two iceblue eyes for he rode a dyheli bleached to snowy white just as the bondbirds were he posed for a moment and she realized that he was doing it deliberately not that she blamed him she smiled but kept it to herself oh what a vain creature he is and how he basks in the admiration hes getting rightfully they had expected a venerable wise man another iceshadow with more presence perhaps what they had gotten was something else entirely he swept his arm out and the firebird drifted down to rest on his snowwhite leather gauntlet alighting as silently as one of its own feathers would fall only then was it clear that the firebird was fully as large as any of the greater hawks and approached the size of the hawkeagle its tail trailed down gracefully to within a hands breadth of the snow and it too posed as if perfectly well aware of its unearthly beauty he was dressed all in white white furs and leathers long white hair with white feathers in a braid to one side white coat draped over the rump of his white dyheli three sets of iceblue eyes looked over the assembled clansfolk dispassionately the eyes of the dyheli and the firebird held only curiosity but the eyes of the adept held more than a touch of a selfconfidence that was surely forgivableboth for his adept status and indeed he could never have achieved that complete bleaching of hair and eyes and bird if he had not been controlling nodemagic since he could toddle and for his absolute physical perfection never in all her life had elspeth seen anyone so beautiful that was the only word for him he was beautiful in a way that transcended sexuality and yet was bound up with it so some arrogance and selfassurance could certainly be forgiven even if he was no older than darkwind gwena was staring at him intently much more intently than elspeth expected whats wrong she asked the companion quietly is there anything wrong nothing wrong exactly she said slowly no thats not true theres nothing wrong at all but it almost seems like ive seen him before though i cant imagine how i ever could have but there certainly is something familiar about him of course there is my dear a deep masculine mindvoice interrupted and the ktreva adept winked at the companion slowly and unmistakably elspeth was left floundering in surpriseand as for gwena clearly if the companionys jaw could have dropped in shock it would have gwena stepped backwards greetings clansibs the adept called to them all as calmly as if he had not just utterly flabbergasted gwena i am firesong ktreva and i trust i have not made you wait for too long for my arrival with that he dismounted sliding from the back of the dyheli so smoothly that the firebird was not in the least disturbed there was a pack on his backalso of white leatherwhich had been hidden until he dismounted the dyheli paced beside him as he walked forward to the veil and the tayledras waiting to greet him one hand still on the dyhelis shoulder a halfsmile on his handsome face iceshadow and the other elders greeted him first as was only proper but when he had done clasping arms with them he turned immediately to elspeth and darkwind and here are those whose message summoned me he said tossing his head to send his braid over his shoulder his lips curved in an enigmatic smile i see one clansiband two outlanders a fascinating combination this is wingsister elspeth ksheyna kvaldemar and her companion gwena kvaldemar darkwind said carefully a little too carefully elspeth thought i am darkwind kvaldemar hmm firesong repeated his smile increasing by just a hair and a companion zhaihelleva wingsibs the tale of your coming here must be a fascinating one indeed elspeth is a herald of valdemar if you have heard of such things darkwinds voice was carefully neutral there is another herald out on the borders of ksheyna who was also made wingsib one skif ksheyna kvaldemarbut it is pressing business that keeps him there and at any rate he is no mage which you bright falcon most certainly are firesongs handclasp was warm and firm as he took elspeths hand in greeting and as it happens i have heard of heralds before it is something of a ktreva legend the visits of heralds but then ktreva has always been consideredhmmunconventional he glanced aside at iceshadow who coughed politely but here i am keeping you out in the snow and cold when we could be in the welcoming warmth of the vale he exclaimed turning swiftly in a graceful swirl of snowy hair feathers and clothing come clansibs let us continue these greetings in comfort darkwind struggled against annoyance this firesongthis young firesongdisplayed a bodylanguage that flaunted his arrogance and a confidence that implied a competence fully as great as the arrogance well the firebird resting on his shoulder said something of his competence it had been generations since one of the tayledras had thought to breed up a new species of bondbirdand to do so from firebird stock was doubly amazing firebirds were shy highly territorial easily startlednone of those being traits that augured well for their potential as bondbirds yet here he was this firesong bearing a snowwhite firebird that sat his shoulder as calmly as ever a forestgyre sat a scouts small wonder that his clan described him as an experimenter he could be older than he looked it often took an adept up to sixty years to show any signs of aging but darkwind doubted that the arrogance that firesong flaunted was that of youth not age darkwind reckoned that he might even be a year or two younger than he was just as annoying was elspeths obvious fascination with the newcomer he is as beautiful as a god a traitorous whisper said in the back of his mind how could she not be attracted to him how could anyone he took small comfort in the fact that firesong chose an ekele near the opposite end of the vale from elspeths right beside starblades in fact a little higher in the same tree but no sooner had the adept tossed his white pack carelessly up into the open door sent his white firebird to a perch and shed his heavy outer garments than he turned and looked down at darkwind with that annoying halfsmile on his face i should like to see your father starblade if i may he said without preamble if you will excuse me and with that he ran lightly down the stairs and tapped upon the doorpost of starblades ekele as if he were expected perhaps he was for kethra beckoned him inside leaving darkwind outside she did not beckon him in although she clearly saw him standing there he felt like a fool and only felt like less of one because there was no one there to witness his exclusion from what was obviously a private conference he gritted his teeth and went off to find something marginally useful to do before he did something decidedly the opposite ho darkwind the unfamiliar voice hailing him could only be firesongs darkwind stopped put a pleasant expression on his face with an effort of will and turned to face the young adept firesong had changed his costume from the winter whites he had ridden in wearing to something more appropriate to the warmth of the vale a halfrobe and trousers of fine silkand if darkwind had not seen it he would not have believed that it was possible to create a costume that was more flamboyant than that of his arrival firebird gold white and flameblue were the colors and they matched the blue of his eyes the silver of his hair and the gold of his skin to perfection someonehertasi probablyhad taken great pains with his hair darkwind felt positively plain beside him darkwind firesong said cheerfully as he strode up beside him i have had speech of starblade and kethra of the elders and also of the shinain shaman trevalen what they have told me has confirmed the impression your message gave to me we can do nothing about the heartstone for a brace of days i must study it at close hand well at least he has that much sense i trust i dont need to warn you to be careful about it darkwind said firesong nodded for once seeming entirely serious there is no doubt in my mind that the stone is treacherous he stated it has behaved in a way that no such stone in the history of either of our clans has ever done before i shall take no chances with it that much gave darkwind a feeling of relief however arrogant this young man was he was at least no fool there is something else however firesong continued something i think you have probably anticipated there are only two among the humans of the vale who are of a power and an ability to aid me in dealing with this stone yourself and the outland wingsister but you are not yet tested and confirmed as adepts darkwind grimaced and began walking back toward his ekele the direction in which he had been going when firesong hailed him that is true although we have adepts among us there were none who felt strong enough to do so i have seen that and i think it was wise of them to work within their strength firesong replied keeping pace with him easily but that must end now i shall complete your training and elspeths and confirm you for i shall need you at full ability to aid me he stared ahead down the trail as darkwind glanced at him out of the corner of his eye i shall be accomplishing something with your father as well but it is nothing you need to concern yourself over no of course not hes only my father why should i worry about what you are going to do with him but darkwind kept his thoughts and his comments to himself simply nodding shortly when do you want to see us then and do you want to work with us singly or together oh together firesong replied carelessly as if it did not matter to him since i shall need you to work as partners that is best i think and tomorrow but not too early he yawned and smiled slyly i am weary and the hertasi have pledged me a massage it was a cold and fatiguing journey i believe i shall go and rest from it and with that he turned abruptly off on a sidepath one that would take him back to his own ekele and starblades of course he already has hertasi darkwind thought with irritation they flock to beauty and power and he has both in astonishing measure he probably had a half dozen begging to serve him within moments of his arrival if he walked by the swamp village they would follow him in hordes for all that they consider that they are independent nera would probably lead them he turned his steps toward elspeths dwelling to give her the news of their new tutor and how was she reacting to this arrogant youngster he wondered this powerful breathtaking youngsterand he was surprised by the stab of jealousy he felt at the memory of the open admiration he had caught in her eyes chapter seventeen mornelithe falconsbane nyara woke to the thunder of great wings above her tower and the sound of something heavy landing on her roof she slipped out of bed hastily snatching up the cloak she had made from the skin of a winterkilled bear before she had a chance to panic or even to shake herself out of the confusion of interrupted sleep need spoke in her mind its the gryphons tell them hello for me need said casually as she stood blinking and trying to shake her dreams off the gryphons she wrapped the cloak around her narrow shoulders and slipped up the steep stone stairs to the rooftop the gryphons butwhy have they come here brrright grrreectingsss little one treyvan called as she poked her head cautiously over the edge of the stair opening how goesss the lessssoning he looked as cheerfuland as friendlyas she had ever seen him his wings shining in the sunlight his head and crest up as if she had never betrayed his little ones his trust as if she had never fled his lair with a stolen sword as if nothing had ever happened between them but friendship she tried not to show her surprise and ventured the rest of the way onto the rooftop well i think she said shyly bobbing a greeting to hydona who had landed behind her mate or at least need says that i do well she says to tell you hello how did you find me ssstand and let me look at you hydona demanded turning her head from one side to the other like a huge bird surveying something that intrigued it nyara obeyed instantly good hydona pronounced the taint isss gone and you arrre looking lesssferrral we knew wherrre you werrre becaussse need told usss of courssse of course she said faintly sssomeone had to know treyvan admonished with a flick of his tail what if you encounterrred sssomething you could not deal with what if crrreaturresss of yourrr fatherrr found you need judged usss able to defend you and otherrrwissse likely to leave you in peace morrre ssso than the hawkbrrotherrrsss hydona said but that isss why we arrre herrre becaussse of ssskif and winterrrmoon she inadvertently brought her hand to her throat are they near she had not thought she would have to deal with skif so soonverry treyvan said shortly the trrrail isss hot you will not brrreak passst winterrrmoon without him ssstriking yourrr esscape trrrail the owlsss will find thisss place tonight or tomorrrrow night hydona nipped at her mate and we mussst leave if we arrre not to brring dissscovery on herrr soonerrrr she hesitated a moment nyarrra we have all forrrgiven you you did yourrrr bessst we wisssh you verrry well and ssskif would make a fine mate but i think you know that alrrready with that she launched herself from the tower like a seaeagle in a dive that ended with a great snap as she opened her wings and turned the dive into a climb treyvan only nodded then turned and did the same within moments they were far out of sight nyara stared after themcomforted and yet tormented she descended the stairs to her living quarters slowly still not certain what to do should she wait for him to find her should she hide somewhere so that he found only her empty lair should she hide here and pretend that she was not here go find him girl need replied you heard hydona now you have a second opinion a little stronger than mine reallybut then hydona has a mate of her own she tends to favor matings but nyara began but nothing dont let the opinion of someone who never had a man get in your way need actually chuckled look girl i never ever put my bearers between a boulder and a rock making them choose between me and a man just because i have always chosen to defend women that doesnt mean i despise men demons take itthat would be as blind as the opposite i am not about to go copy the behavior of some womanhating man now go on out there and deal with your feelings meet them instead of waiting for them to trap you i still dont know nyara said feeling as helpless as a kitten in a flood you dont need to know get it over with one way or another if you dontgirl dont you know thats something your father will use against you make it into a strength and not a weakness it worked before remember yes she remembered remembered attacking her father with tooth and claw for striking at skif recalled the surprise on his face before he struck her the beast just does not understand the strength of true feelings and he never will it makes you unpredictable to him use that nyara sighed and moved to her window looking out over the peaceful countryside that up until this morning had been only hersfull of lightand now seeing the shadows they had been there all along but she had chosen not to see them i suppose i should be grateful that he has been sulking and licking his wounds for so long and has not come looking for me youre waking up girl the gryphons were my hedge against skif or mornelithe finding you well skif showed up before the beast did i suppose we should be grateful for that too skifs a good one as young men go so she settled her cloak firmly about her shoulders if he is hunting with wintermoon and the owls he hunts by night true enough he will be sleeping now she said thinking out loud i should be able to approach without cymry rousing him and be there when he wakes yes i think that now is the time to go and meet him good girl she turned to face the sword so she said feeling a kind of ironic amusement after all since i am sure that you knowor can find outwhere is he mornelithe falconsbane reclined on a soft couch in his darkened study and brooded on revenge like some halfmad wounded beast he had not left the room since his return sore in body and spirit depleted but refusing to show any weakness weakness could be fatal to someone in his position a show of weakness would give underlings ideas he had learned that decades ago his own people hardly dared approach him they ordered slaves to bring him food and drink silently leaving it beside the door the slaves obeyed out of immediate fear of the lash fear of pain even overcoming their fear of falconsbane praying that he would not notice them for sometimes the slave in question would find those glowing golden eyes upon him shining out of the darkness of the studycorner where he lay and when that happened more slaves were summoned later to take the remains away the remains were not pretty usually there were pieces missing no one looked into the study to find them he had used his own blood to open the great gate in the ruins had wrenched that gate from its set destination to a portal of his choosing he had done so out of desperation not knowing if the thing would work not knowing if he had the strength left to make it work not knowing if it would take him where he willed or somewhere unknown he chose to risk it anyway preferring to die fighting rather than be taken by the cursed horselovers and the birdfools in the end he stumbled from the mouth of a cave at the very edge of his own realm fell to the ground and lay in a stupor for over a day only the strength he had cultivated the stamina he had spelled into himself had saved him a lesser being would have died there a lesser adept would have been stranded in the nothingness between gates trapped unless and until some accident spewed him forthperhaps dead perhaps mad certainly tortured and drained but he was not a lesser adept and it would take more than a day of exposure to kill him he woke finally ravenous and in pain from wounds within and without his magechannels had been scorched by the unrestricted torrent of energies he had used the first thing he had needed was food he had caught and killed a treehare with his bare hands eaten it skin and bones and all he had chosen his exit point well once he had strength to move he turned his attention to his next need shelter that was not a problem for wherever he had established a possible gateanchor he had always built a shelter nearby that was a habit so ingrained he never even thought about it centuries old but this time it had saved his life he had staggered to the hunting shelter a small building of two rooms but wellstocked with food wood and healing herbs he spent over a mooncycle in recovering from the worst effects of wounds and spells his own slaves and servants had not known whether he lived or not until he had limped home only their fear of him had kept them at their posts only sure knowledge of his retribution when he recovered completely kept them there once he returned fortunately obedience was a habit with them he was at a reasonable fraction of his strength once fear and habit weakened and someone thought they might try for freedom since he had neither the strength nor the time for finesse he simply killed the offenders fear of what he was now continued to keep them here he reinforced that fear periodically by killing one of the slaves reminding them what he had done what he could do reminding them all that their lives rested in his hands it was a diversion anyway there was an ache inside him that no herb and no rest could toucha hunger for retribution that was what drove him to killing the slaves the deaths themselves did nothing to ease the pentup rage that smoldered in his soul there were only three things that would slake his thirst for blood nyara he flexed his claws into the leather of his couch and considered what he would do to her once he found her she would die of course but not for a very long time first he would ease his lust in her repeatedly he might share her it depended on his own strength and how deeply he wished to wound her spirit then he would flay her mind with the whip of his power until she was nothing more than a quivering weeping heap of nothingnessuntil the person that had dared to defy him was utterly destroyed then only then would he carefully delicately flay the physical skin from her bodyleaving her still alive then he would see that what was left was placed in a cage and hung over his towers for the carrion crows to pick at an example for those who considered treachery his magic would see to it that she lived for a very long time perhaps he would make a rug of that skin or wear it ksheyna that was the second cause for his anger and hate only the destruction of the entire clan would do he had held back his power until now enjoying the challenge but now he would take them one by one first the scouts then the mages then last of all starblade and his sons plucking them from the heart of the vale and bringing them to grovel at his feet before they died the others he would kill however he could but those threethose three he would deliver to the same fate as his treacherous daughter then when the vale was empty of all but the hangerson he would suck the power from the heartstone and blast it back again turning the vale into an inferno of melting stone and boiling water then the lastand greatestcause for rage the gryphons oh the gryphons creatures that he had thought long gone returning to these lands after all these many centuries returning to live here once again returning to the home of skandranonthe gryphons my hated ancient adversaries something very special for them he brooded in the hot darkness of his study and never quite knew the moment when his brooding slipped over the edge into dreaming he watched himself through other eyes and knew that he was andesha shena jorethan shinain of the clan of the bear an offshoot of wolfclan a young almostman in his early teens he stood on the edge of all that he had known and shivered he was not yet a warrior this youngling of the plains onlyhe was shinain no more he could no longer hold place in the clans for he had the power of magic and yet he had not joined the shamans the goddess had declared that no one but her shamans could work magics within the bowl of the plains for the task of the shinain was to keep magic from their homeland he had felt no calling for such a lifetask and no liking for it either for such a one one with the gift of magery yet unwilling to go to her hands there was only one choice exile to the kincousins the taleedras the hawkbrothers they had magic they were permittednay encouragedby the goddess to use it they would freely adopt any of their magicbearing kindred into their ranks so it was said to teach the use of such a gift so he had come to the edge of hawkbrother lands yet he had come without the knowledge of the rest of his kin nor the guidance of the shaman for no one else in his clan knew of this secret power he had feared to disclose it for he was not a strongwilled young man and he knew only too well what such a disclosure would bring to his lot and now as he stood in the silent forest he wondered should he have confided in vorkela the shaman should he have confessed his fatal gift before the rest of the clan should he not have claimed his rights and been given guidance to the nearest of the taleedras yet even as he wondered he knew that he could not have born the weight of vorkelas insistence that he take up the shamans staff and drum no one in all of the clan would have been willing to let him go to the kincousins without great outcry and argument there would have been those who said that his gift was unclean and the result of his fathers liaison with the outlands woman at katashinain even as he was the result of that liaison there would have been those who would have said he should take vows of celibacy that this gift not be passed to others of the clan there would not have been a single one of his kin willing to let him pass out of their hands without long argument and contention and hehe would have folded beneath the weight of their words he would have taken up a place at the shamans side and there he would have been utterly miserable he trembled at the thought of all the years of sacrifice the place as shamans apprentice would cost him he was revolted at the idea of being forced to serve at vorkelas side and bear the brunt of the shamans humor better that he had done what he had done to creep away in the dead of night and seek out a new life among the kincousins he had taken only what was his by right he had violated no laws because of this he had no guide he had never been outside the plains as he stood at the top of the path that led from the bottom of the great bowl of the plains to the top of the rim he wondered at the forest before him huge trees more trees than he had ever seen in his life towered before him and marched endlessly to the horizon only there was no horizon only trees trees endlessly trees trees were a rarity on the plains and never grew to the height of these he could not see their tops only their interweaving branches trees that bent over him as if watching trees that murmured on all sides of him as if whispering trees that had a secret life of their own with a bravery born of desperation he shouldered his packfor he had left his horse at the base of the path to find her way back to the clanand marched into the cool shadow of the endless trees always he had heard how jealously the hawkbrothers guarded their lands surely he would be found and challenged before long before midday he was lost by nightfall he was lost cold and terribly afraid he had heard all too many tales of the strange beasts that lived beneath these treesthe beasts that the taleedras fought and penned strange magecreated creatures that no arrow could harm beasts with the cunning minds of men he knew none of the sounds of the forest around him he could not tell if they were the voices of harmless things or terrible predators or even demonspawn if only he had a firebut he had left his firemaking tools behind for they did not belong to him only but to all of his family he was so coldand all men knew that true beasts feared fire if he had a fire it would shine through the darkness of this forest like a beacon drawing the taleedras to him if only he had a firebut waithad he not heard that a mage could call fire even so untutored a one such as himself he knew where the currents of power ran he felt them beneath his very feet he had felt them even stronger and wilder on the plains why could he not use them to bring a spark to waiting tinder no sooner thought than he hurried about in the gathering gloom scraping a dirt hollow in the moss gathering twigs dried pineneedles bits of dry bark laying larger branches close to hand when he had his tinder going he would soon have his fire built as high as he needed he closed his eyes reached for the power and thought of the springing flamesand got what he had not expected yes he came with a roar filling the boys body thundering out of his hiding place into the body of the blood of his blood his coming triggered by the moment of firecalling as it had always been once again he took and lived from the time when maar mage of dark flames had fought and conquered urtho and had learned of a way to preserve himself down through the agesusing the power of the death of his body to hide himself in a tiny pocket of the nothingness between the gates he preserved his own person sealed himself there with spell upon carefullywrought spell and when one with a trace of the blood of great maar in his veins learned to make fire he came and overwhelmed the boys fledgling personality with his own so he lived again and when the time came for the death of that body he moved again into hiding hiding to live again so it had gone down through the centuries taking new bodies and taking on other names krawiven renthom geslaken leareth zendak and now a new rebirth a new body a new name as the young spirit struggled beneath his talons with fear and hopelessness as the spirit grew quiet then disappeared altogether he baptized himself in the blood and flesh of a new incarnation mornelithe i am mornelithe and i live again the sound of his laughter rang beneath the branches of the pines and shocked the forest into sudden stillness then he gathered his powers about himself and vanished into the night to build his empire anew mornelithe woke with a sudden start he had not thought of that moment in decades why now and why had he first felt the longvanished spirit of the horseloving halfbreed whose body he had taken never mind he told himself impatiently it matters not at all or if it matters it was to remind myself that i have lived more lives than this and i am surely wiser for all of that living and stronger wiser by far than the birdfools it is the gryphons that should concern me the gryphons ksheyna nyara he stretched and sat up on his couch discontent weighted his shoulders like a tooheavy garment in the days that he was maar he would merely have had to stretch out his hand to have them allbut the power that was so rich and free in his day as maar was a poor thing now shattered and scattered dust in the storm like his power his empire was a small thing he was constrained to harbor allies he would never have suffered in the old days for a moment he felt a kind of shame that he should be reduced to this meager existence yet what had worked in the longago days could work now if only on a smaller scale the gryphons the gryphons why is it that they do not fade but prosper in his minds eye the male gryphon took on the blackdyed elegance of skandranon and his lip lifted in a snarl there was no mistaking the beasts lineage and that should not have been the gryphons of urthos pride should not have survived him nor should those toofaithful servants the beastbreeding kaledain they should have perished they should all have perished in the cataclysm that destroyed his kingdom and urthos there should have been nothing left but a pair of smoking holes every trace of urthos handiwork and urthos allies should have been erased for all time yet here they were the kaledain urthos faithful servants still prancing about in the guise of the birdfools and the horselovers sundered yet still prospering half of them guarding what remained of the old magics half of them removing the scars and taint of the destruction both halves working beneath the eye of that wretched goddess who took so deep an interest in their doings and the gryphonsthriving clearly established in the west and moving eastward how how did this happen he flung himself off of his couch and began to pace the room like a restless caged lion he had been brooding here for too long he needed to act he needed to stir his blood to exact some token of vengeance before his followers lost their fear and began to desert him he needed a show of strength that would convince them that he was still as allpowerful as ever and he needed the sweet taste of revenge to completely heal him nyara she was the weakest the most vulnerableand the most personal target yet she was inexplicably out of his reach he had sought for her ever since he returned to his stronghold and yet it had been in vain he searched as far as his strength was able to take him there was no trace of her or rathersomething was hiding her he would have known if she had perished for the power he had invested in her would have come rushing back to him there was someone or some power hiding her ksheyna perhaps a possible if surprising thought he had thought the birdfools of ksheyna too bound up by long custom to change could the birdlovers have lost their hatred of changechildren enough to shelter her was it possible after the way she had fought at cursed darkwinds sideafter the way that she had defended the gryphonsyes it was possible in fact now that he gave it consideration it was likely the gryphonsthe target he longed to strike no the time was not right to exact his revenge upon them besides they too lay under the shelter of ksheyna he might ambush them but he had no major mages at his disposal now the last of them had vanished during a hunt for spellcomponents he would have to go in person to deal the blow that was too risky there was too much he did not know about them that leftksheyna the most logical choice if he was to impress his followers with his stillvital power he would have to do something to hurt the clan and hurt it badly but it would have to be something swift and decisive and something they had not guarded themselves against if he struck at the clan his followers would see that he was strong again and fear to desert him in striking at the clan he might persuade the birdfools to give up the shelter of all those not of their blood if he were clever enough he could make it look as if the blow had come through them ksheyna would never shelter them then that would put not only nyara within his reach but the outlanders and the gryphons the gryphons yes then he would gather in his dearest daughterand her winged friends and the outlanders as well the strange ones the girl nowshe had all the potential for an adept when he saw her last she had but the most rudimentary of tutelage it was unlikely anyone in ksheyna could be persuaded to give her lessons and the halftaught were the most vulnerable he would need a plaything when nyara was dead yes he would slay the outland man but keep the outland woman she might do well to carry his seed for the next generation since nyara had proved barren and turned traitor in the bargain he might even make the transfer without waiting for the death of his body yes that was a good plan an excellent plan it would be good to have a young strong body again full of vigor and energy that left only one question to be answered if i am to hurt ksheyna where must i strike his lips twisted in a feral smile where else but at the weakest bird in the flock the brokenwinged brokensouled starblade he will no longer be mewed up away from my power they surely think me dead they must be getting very careless at this point an attack on starblade in and of itself would not hurt the clan as a whole but if he used starblades link to the heartstone and completed the work that he had begun thereyes if i shatter the heartstoneit might not destroy everything in the vale but it will surely destroy most of what is important and at least half of the mages will die in the backlash of power it went against the grain to loose all that power but if i cannot control it then i shall destroy with it if he were truly fortunatealthough his revenge would be a little lessthe gryphons would be destroyed with the rest or better far better the gryphons would be hurt when the stone shattered completely leaving them weak and vulnerable yes that would be the best of all he flung himself back down upon his couch chewed the last painspiced flesh from a former servants thighbone and began to plan firesong deemed most of the vale too near the heartstone to work in and although darkwind agreed with him this tiny clearing at the far end was a damned awkward spot to get to it had been made as a trystingspot but had gotten overgrown to reach it they had to wind their way through tangles of vines and bushes only to discover when they got there that most of the clearing itself had been eaten up by encroaching vegetation so clear it firesong said casually and sat down on a stone to await the completion of their task darkwind seethed with resentment that he held closely permitting none of it to slip he had thought that elspeth tested his temper he had never thought that one of his own people would bring it so close to the snapping point except perhaps his father the adept did not even watch them he called in his snowwhite firebird and fed it flowers and bits of fruit while they worked clearing the vegetation by hand since using magic would have been fairly stupid for so simple a task good enough firesong said at last when the earth of the clearing had been laid bare and all the seats were free of vines and overhanging bushes now we return to basics darkwind you will tap into the leyline beneath us back to basics for what or doesnt he trust our training stop firesong said with calm selfassurance as darkwind obeyed him he grounded himself carefully centered his personal power and prepared himself to grasp for the power of the leylines what are you doing i i am grounding myself darkwind told him not adding as any fool could see for it was obvious that firesong had some deeper intention in mind sunlight trickled through the leaves above them making patches of brilliance in the adepts hair this morning firesong wore blue the same blue as his eyes he looked good enough to have his will of any female in the vale and no few of the males why the healing adept asked flicking his hair over his shoulder with one hand why are you grounding yourself and your shields becausebecause that is the way that i was taught that he groped after longforgotten lessons if i am not grounded when i reach for the leeline power it will fling me away by the force of its current his resentment continued to seethe at being forced to dredge up those longago lessons what difference did it make it was something you did all well and good firesong replied with that same maddening calm and a smile that said volumes but what if you release your ground after you have the power what then and why must you always sink your ground into the earth below you why not elsewhere darkwind only gaped at him unable to answer questions that ran counter to everything he had ever been taught i will show you the young adept centered and grounded faster than darkwind could blink seized upon the leyline beneath them as if he owned the deed to it he made the energies his own feeding them into his shields with an ease that called up raw envy in darkwinds heart then cast loose the ground now strike me full force darkwind trust me the shields stayed where they were contrary to everything darkwind supposed would happen darkwind struckwith more force than he had consciously intended all of his pentup frustration going into the blow all of his fury and bruised pride combined to make the blow one that would have done harm if it had properly connected it should have completely shattered firesongs shields the outer one at least but instead of meeting the blow the shields no longer anchored by the ground slid aside darkwind watched in complete shock as his angry blast did no more than to bow the shields slightly the energy of his strike was neither absorbed nor reflected it was deflected routed around the outside skittering away in bright eddies of flame nothing touched the mage inside this is dangerous cousin firesong warned smugly cradled within his untouched shields a clever mage will see at once that without the ground protecting the essential flow of magic energy from the line to myself that tie is vulnerable a clever mage could also force the shields toward me then instead of striking a blow could lance through them at the nearest thinnest weakest point but until he does that i sit untouched allowing all his force to spend itself uselessly i need not even fear the contamination of his magic for it never touches me or my shields to darkwinds great chagrin elspeth nodded her face aglow with admiration a clever mage could also create a whirlwind of edged magebolts around you she pointed out those things can shred a shield in next to no time and although they cant touch you physically that would leave you open to attack ah but that whirlwind would have no effect wingsib he said turning a dazzling smile upon her that caused a shaft of jealousy to stab his cousin darkwind chewed his lip and looked away at the tangle of vines behind one of the empty seats a whirlwind that would erode a grounded shield would only cause this one to spin with it it would find purchase but spin freely sincei am not connected to the shield it would have no effect on me i see she prodded the shield with a bit of power experimentally and darkwind saw for himself how the shield simply bent away from it interesting so if the enemy doesnt know that this is possible you can let him wear himself out against you firesong imploded the shield and collapsed it down around himself aye and a bit of acting and hed continue to do so as i looked worried nowthis is the trickier task grounding in something other than the earth his face sobered for a moment take heed cousin this is something only a powerful adept can attempt and never with impunity i think that you can do this but it is very dangerous once again firesong centered grounded and shielded all within the blink of an eye to darkwind he looked perfectly normal insofar as a mage of his power could ever look normal but then he took a closer look where is your ground he asked perplexed youd like to know wouldnt you the young mage taunted find it you already know it is not sunk into the earth at my feet look elsewhere have i somehow grounded into the air perhaps i have only created an illusion of being grounded elspeth only shook her head baffled darkwind was not prepared to give up so easily he studied firesong carefully ignoring the mages mocking smile finally he acted on a hunch and moved his magesight out of the real world and onto the planes of power there he saw itand a cold sweat broke out all over him at the adepts audacity he stared at firesong and could not believe that the mage simply stood there calm and unmoved as if he did this sort of thing every day maybe he did if so he was the bravest man that darkwind had ever seen or the most foolhardy or even both at the same time you grounded itin the place between gates he managed to get out after a moment i cant believe you did that you could call a deadly storm that wayor find yourself drained to the dregs firesong shrugged and dismissed the shield ground and all i told you no mage does that with impunity i would not attempt it while someone else held a gate near me or during a thunderstorm but that place makes an energysink that is second to none if you wish to drain an enemy ground yourself in the place tie your shields to the ground as always and let him pour all of his power out upon you it will drain into the place and be swallowed up exhausting him and costing you no more than an ordinary shield he held out a long graceful hand to darkwind touch it he ordered darkwind did so the hand was as cold as ice therein lies the danger there the place is an energysink it will steal your energies as well and there is no way to keep it from doing so you had best hope that you can outlast your enemy if you ground there work him into an irrational fury before trying it he turned to elspeth who was again visibly impressed take nothing for granted wingsib no matter what you have been told most anything in magery can be done despite the laws that you have been taught the question is only whether the result is worth it it galled him to see the admiration on her face oh firesong had undoubtedly earned the right to arrogance his clansfolk had not exaggerated when they said that they considered him a powerful experimenter he was without a doubt a genius as well but none of that meant that darkwind had to like it at the end of the day when he was exhausted and firesong was still as outwardly cool and poised as he had been that morning darkwind was ready to call a halt to the entire thing but firesong didnt give him that opportunity youll do he said with cool approval at least you arent hopeless ill have a different course of action for you two tomorrow and with that he simply turned on his heel and left he and his bird together melting into the greenery chapter eighteen trevalen and dawnfire darkwind and elspeth walked together to her ekele they were going to hers because it was nearer darkwind was so drained that he didnt think he could go any further without a rest and something to drink he was glad that it was still midafternoon if it had been dark enough hed had to conjure a magelight hed have fallen over he felt that tired so what do you think of firesong elspeth asked as they crested the gentle curving path between six massive flowering bushes the flicking tail of a hertasi ducked under a trellis distracting him for just a moment he cast her a suspicious glance gauging the import of her question but her expression like her voice remained carefully neutral well hes certainly brilliant he admitted grudgingly and unconventional but i dont think ive ever met anyone so arrogant in all my life hes earned the right to be elspeth replied to his increased annoyance i mean there are a lot of people who think weaponsmaster alberich is arrogantor kero and theyre right but theres a point where youre so good that youve earned a certain amount ofhmmattitude he didnt reply he couldnt not and maintain his own calm in a certain sense elspeth was completely correct in fact if he mentioned firesongs arrogance to iceshadow or his father he would probably be told that it wasnt arrogance at all it was simply selfassurance and a pardonable pride firesong was the best mage darkwind had ever seen in his life perhaps the best living mage that there was not just a healing adept but an innovator a brilliant creative genius not fearlessat the levels at which firesong was working being fearless could get him killed quite quicklybut so knowledgeable that he was able to judge risks to within a hair he was worlds away better than darkwind was now and what was more he was better than darkwind or anyone known to the vales would ever be and that did not come as a comfortable revelation darkwind was not used to seeing himself as secondbest it stung his pride even as firesongs attitude made him angry and then on top of it all for the cocky mage to be so cursed handsome elspeth openly admired him that was just as difficult to take how short a step was it more physical it was only then when he caught himself seething with completely unwarranted jealousy that he realized the trend his thoughts were taking all right stop right there think whatever you like but be careful about anything you say right now it would be the easiest thing in the world to say something that would completely alienate herto make accusations that you have no right to make elspeth wouldnt react well to that and never mind that it galled that firesongs power and beauty were enough to make anyone inclined to throw themselves at his feet if elspeth chose to join the crowd darkwind had no say in the matter you dont own her she consented to share pleasure with you that gives you no rights remember that she can continue to share your bed and firesongs and you have no right to demand that she cleave only to you she can throw you over for firesong if she wants that is up to her youre thinking very hard elspeth said glancing at him im thinking thati am likely to be very irrational about firesong that was all the warning he could bear to give her but hopefully it would be enough he is right when it comes to magic anyway ive never seen anyone as skilled or as powerful as he is except maybe falconsbane from admiration to something else more personal hes going to try something different with the stone no one even guessed could be done she said we knew he was going to be doing something like that but i honestly didnt think he was going to include us in it she gave him a lopsided smile i guess we must be good for something after all darkwind suddenly saw a way to get some of his own pride back especially if the adept planned on training the two of them together firesong wasnt the only one who could be innovative gwena joined them a moment later and darkwind swallowed down some of the things he wanted to ask elspeth is she attracted to him just how attracted is she is she thinking of asking him to continue her teaching and if hes teaching her magic does that mean she goes to ktreva after the stone is dealt with he shouldnt care and he couldnt help himself he had no holds on her she shared his bed sometimes he shared hers she was not truly of the vales she was an outlander all the arguments against skif and nyaras success together held true for the two of them too tayledras simply didnt leave their vales how could he continue the work he had sworn to do if he left the vale he was a hawkbrother a pelagirs healer of ruined lands he could never leave the vale the pelagirsit was impossible she was the heir to a throne vital to the safety and govermnent of her land she couldnt stay here that was impossible she would go and he would stay no matter what happened here he began building himself a kind of emotional bulwark to save what was left of his pride and heart he would have to watch his tongue and not drive her awayshe would be leaving soon enough he would deal with that when it came he would fight back the tears that he knew somehow would come when his wingsib elspeth left there was little enough in his life now no need to act like his namesakedarkwind an approaching stormcloud it made no sense to ruin what there was least of all by voicing his own foolishness elspeth he said with cheerfulness that didnt sound too forced once we recover from being run like rabbits did you have any plans for this afternoon starblade eased himself down onto the couch beside the huge blockperch hyllarr had taken for his own and scratched beneath the hawk eagles breastfeathers hyllarr all but purred pulling one foot up in complete contentment in this alone hyllarr was like karry but in no other way starblade was grateful for that there were no poses no lifts of the head nothing to haunt him hyllarr was hyllarr and unique uniquely intelligent uniquely calm uniquely charming he had succeeded in charming kethra who had been immune to the blandishments even of darkwinds flirtofabird vree hyllarr had her securely enchanted kethra settled beside him with an amused glance at the bird i have no idea how youre going to carry him around once hes well ashke she said hed be a burden even for someone like wintermoon i cant even begin to think how youre going to have him with you i shall worry about that when the time comes he told her serenely he already had some notions on the subject perhaps a staff across the shoulders is your kinsman coming he should be here at any moment she began when footsteps on the staircase heralded their visitor and as starblade had expected it was trevalen who appeared at the doorwaya trevalen who to starblades pained but keen eyes was a young man in serious emotional turmoil starblade had been seeing the signs of trouble in trevalens face for some time now but it had never been as obvious as it was now so he had been right to ask the shaman here there was something going on and the clan needed to know what it was sit please shaman he said mildly trevalen obeyed but with a glance at starblade that told the hawkbrother that this shaman was quite well aware starblade had not asked him here to exchange pleasantries good in these times it was no longer possible to hide behind a veil of politeness some of the others of the clan had relaxed thinking that now that the adept was here all their troubles would be over they had not stopped to consider the fact that firesong was here to solve only one of the clans problems when he had dealt with the stone he would be gone then there would remain the rest of the puzzlebox how to safely reunite the clan what to do about dawnfire what to do about this territory how to deal with falconsbanes daughter who was a dangerand in dangeras long as there was any chance her father was still alive how to discover falconsbanes fate what to do about him if he still livedthere was a time he began when i could afford to hint to be indirect i no longer have the strength for such diplomacy trevalen your wingsibs of the clan know why kethra is here why kraheera asked us to allow her to stay she was already a wingsister and there was obviously a great need for her help kethras left hand found his right and she squeezed it but said nothing starblade smiled at her and took strength and heart from her support kraheera asked us to grant the same status to you and the same hospitality but with no explanations i had not pressed you for such an explanation but i think the time has come for one trevalen looked very uncomfortable and glanced at kethra you need not look to me for aid clanbrother she replied to his unspoken question i am in agreement with starblade trevalen sighed it is because of dawnfire he said awkwardly starblade nodded i had already surmised that he said dryly i should like to hear what the reasons are trevalen was clearly uncomfortable more so than starblade thought the situation warranted kraheera wished me to seek her outif i could find a way to bring her to meand speak with her as much as i might it seemed to him quite clear that she has become some kind of avatar of the stareyed but it is not an avatar we recognize but it also does not seem to be anything your people had seen before either he wanted me to discover what the meaning of this was if i could this is a new thing an entirely new thing we have had no direction upon it kraheera does not know what to think he paused and rubbed the side of his nose averting his eyes from starblades unflinching gaze new things simply do not occur often in the plains ashke kethra put in the stareyed has been a lady more inclined to foster the way things are rather than bring on changes but starblade was watching trevalen very closely and there was more much more that trevalen had not told them for a moment he was at a loss as to what it could be then the memory of the young shamans face gazing up at a bird that might have been dawnfire suddenly intruded he had not seen that particular expression of desire very often but when he had it always meant the same thing you long for her do you not starblade asked quietly and to his own satisfaction he watched trevalen start and begin to stammer something about emotions and proper detachment enough kethra interrupted her younger colleague starblade is right and i should have recognized this when i saw it you have become fascinatedenamored with dawnfire i think perhaps you may have fallen in love with her ihave trevalen looked from one to the other of them and capitulated all at once yes he replied in a low unhappy voice i have i tried to tell myself that i was simply bedazzled but it is not simple nor it is bedazzlement ido not know what love is but if it means that one is concerned for the other above ones own selfi must be in love with her with that part of her that is still human in spirit and i know not what to do there is no precedent it was one thing to suspect something like that it was quite another to hear confirmation of it from trevalens own mouth starblade looked to his beloved for some kind of an answer and got only a tightlipped shrug she did not know what to make of this either a nasty little tangle they had gotten into a worse thing still to offend deity if indeed they were doing so do i take it that the stareyed has offered you no signs starblade said delicately no hint as to how her feelings run in this matter trevalen shook his head only that she has permitted us to continue to meet either in this world or in the spirit realms and she has granted dawnfire the visions that i told you the ones i do not understand about ancient magic returning and about the need for peoples to unite and change in some way starblade closed his eyes for a moment but no answers came to him so he analyzed the few facts in the matter dawnfire was not dead at least not in the accepted sense but she was no longer anything like a human being mornelithe falconsbane had destroyed her body but left her spirither soulalive and in her bondbird such a tragedy would have meant a slow fading until at last there was nothing of the human left leaving a mentally crippled raptor to live as long as it could but in this there was a powerful being that had shown her interest in the situation by creating some kind of different creature out of dawnfire dawnfire was not like the leshya kalenedral who were entirely of the spiritworld yet could on occasion intervene in the physical realm and not like a mage who could on occasion intervene in the spirit world she seemed to dwell in both worlds at once and yet truly touched neither the shinain face of the goddessher warrior face in factseemed to have created her then abandoned her it was most unwise to secondguess a deity what appeared to have been abandoned may have in fact been left to mature all that i can say is that i warn you to be careful he said at last these are strange waters that you swim in and i know not what lurks beneath the surface whatever it is is fearsome shaman i know trevalen said at last after a long pause i know this the stareyed marked dawnfire for her own but to what purpose she has not revealed she might not approve of myinclinations and intentions starblade could only shrug i am not a shaman he pointed out you are i say onlybe careful and consider first what is best for dawnfire and those you have sworn to serve i shall trevalen stood and moved toward the door i will keep you closely informed from this moment of what i see andof what i feel he bowed turned and descended the stairs quickly but the air of trouble he had brought with him remained kethra held starblades hands wordlessly for a long time afterward darkwind tossed his head and sent his soakingwet hair whipping over his shoulder sweat poured down his forehead and stung his eyes but external vision did not matter internal vision did no matter that he had picked a quarrel with elspeth not half a candlemark before they joined firesong in the glade that he had made into their working place no matter that he had left her without a reply to the hurtful words he had not truly meant but said anyway once across the invisible boundary he and elspeth were two halves of a working whole and there was no quarrel dividing them he frankly had not expected that of her he had been faintly surprised when her power joined to his with no hesitation but he could not be less than she his pride would not permit it but he wondered in a tiny unoccupied section of his mind if he had deliberately quarreled with her in hopes that she would storm off making it impossible for them to practice with firesong driving them firesong lived up to his usename his powersignature crackled with illusory flames and he used music drumbeats to focus it that made it easier rather than harder for darkwind to follow him all of his training as a dancer came to the fore guiding him where he might otherwise have stumbled blindly so darkwind had gone firesong one better now in the circle he danced his magic eyes closed moving in place i am going to be much leaner before this is all over and a better dancer elspeth interestingly enough chose to follow his dancing with a manifestation of power he had heard of but had never seen lightweaving she created patterns of energy that matched his dancing and firesongs drums uniting them in a way that he didnt understand but fit well it seemed that firesong didnt understand it either for the first time elspeth had woven her lightweb he had been drilling them in the creation of a kind of containment vessel that was meant to contract down around something and hold itfiresong had been startled and had lost the beatdarkwind had seen only the pattern and danced itand the web contracted around firesong the adept had managed to extract himself from it before it closed convulsively and vanished with a little pop but it had clearly been a near thing they had afforded him a bit of a thrill ever since then he had guided them through a refinement of this technique honing it down and making a weapon of it sometimes making a real weapon of it darkwind felt something beginning to form before him firesong was about to create an enemy for them to facea very real enemy for all that it was made of mageenergy he changed his steps and felt the light above him weaving into a protection and he sensed firesongs surprise he guessed that firesong had intended elspeth to weave a mageblade or even two for them to fight with but elspeth had her own ideas perhaps the weariness of his dance steps had told her that defense would be better than offense whatever he followed the pattern she sketched and the power wove about them into an hourglassshaped flow a doublelobed shield and the firecreature firesong had conjured hissed about the outside in frustration unable to burn a way through since the walls of energy flowed it could not focus its flames on any one place long enough to do any significant damage the lances of energy dissipated and swirled but did not burn through it sends out extensions of itself as tongues of flame hmm i think i can work with that the next time the creature attacked darkwind changed his steps the protection suddenly became sticky if energy could be sticky an attractant perhaps whatever the name of his defense might be darkwind caught the tongue of the creatures energy and before firesong had a chance to react he spun the fireshape into his shields integrating it and making its power his the drumming stopped darkwind danced on for a moment letting the power return into the flow of the leyline beneath them rather than permitting it to drain away into the air to hang like lightning threatening to strike then he stopped and opened his eyes to gaze somewhat defiantly at their instructor that was not at all a bad solution firesong said calmly not what i had in mind but not at all bad darkwind couldnt have fought that thing off elspeth said flatly with no inflection at all he was already exhausted from everything else youd sent at us today so you improvised a defense and solution in one i like that firesong smiled at elspeth and darkwind fought down a surge of irrational anger the shinain saywhen you do not like the fight change the rules i have often found that to be a useful solution firesong looked no more weary than if he had just taken a fast walk across the vale not a hair was out of place nor a thread of clothing for all of his furious drumming i should have known perfect as always as darkwind had anticipated firesong had beenvery popular among the ksheyna human and non power and beauty are both powerful attractants and firesong had both in abundance he in return accepted the attentions as only his dueand his devotees seemed to find his very insolence appealing including elspeth and as for the hertasiwell his borrowed ekele swarmed with them he would not even have had to dress feed or bathe himself if he had chosen otherwise perhaps he hadnt now darkwind your claws are showing but how could he have gone through this past training session without a hair out of place because hes a greater mage a greater adept than you or anyone in your clan has ever seen thats how hes likely enhanced his endurance for year upon year elspeth and the rest are perfectly right to admire him and there is nothing wrong with him being proud of himself and what he can doi think that you are near to ready firesong said standing up and putting the drum away in the elaborate padded chest he used as a seat you work remarkably well together we can begin planning what we will be doing with your rogue stone tomorrow hmm darkwind nodded but firesong wasnt done yet elspeth headed straight out of the clearing going for the hot spring and a long soak but firesong caught darkwind by the elbow before he had a chance to leave there is trouble between you and the outlander he said making it a statement rather than a question darkwind couldnt meet his eyes nor could he say anything there are also thorns between you and me darkwind faced him resentment smoldering nothing i cannot deal with he saidkeeping himself from snarling firesong gave him a most peculiar look as he retook his position on the padded chest he crossed his legs and intertwined his slender fingers across one knee then he spoke darkwind i have been working magery since i was barely able to walk the adept said slowly my hair was white by the time i was ten i have ever had a fearsome example to live up to for my greatgreatmanytimesgreatgrandfather was one herald vanyel ashkevron out of valdemar even as elspeths was though she knows it not but darkwind was surprised he managed to get that much out stunned as he was how a long tale which i shall make as short as i may the adept held up his hand and his firebird came winging out of the tree cover above a streak of white and gold lightning that alighted haughtily on his wrist this is the tradition as it was handed down from brightstars fosterparents moondance and starwind one of ktreva wished a child and there was no one in the clan she favored moondance and starwind also longed to be parents vanyel was well favored by all within the clan and consented to be father to twins one of whom was my forefatherg brightstar but in valdemar also longing for a child was the kings own and lover of the monarch shavri vanyel obliged her in part so that it would seem that randale was able to father children which he was not that child jisa wedded the next monarch treven a cousin of the king and from that line of descent springs yon outlander firesong chuckled at darkwinds expression i must look like a stunned ox nay cousin we of ktreva are not so wellversed in outlander doings as you think it is simply that brightstar knew of his halfsister and her young suitor and that the ashkevron blood calls to blood we know each other though she does not know how now firesong raised one winglike eyebrow that may be the source of the outlanders fascination with my humble sell darkwind snorted as if you could ever be humble he said sardonically it has happened a time or two but not recently firesong shrugged and transferred his firebird to his shoulder i thought a word to you was appropriate i have much more training than you more thorough and more consistent i have never abandoned my magic considering all you haveexperiencedyou do far better than i had expected take that for what it is worth there is more i would say when the time is appropriate he hung his head for a moment then raised it again and brushed the moonwhite hair from his forehead then he stood an inscrutable expression on his face and left by the trail elspeth had taken whitefeathered firebird on his shoulder i should at least apologize to her if he is not with her darkwind thought finally or even if he is with her though i doubt i could so eventually he too followed the pathway out of the clearing to the end of the vale where elspeths ekele stood he waited for a moment listening at the entrance to the hot spring near her tree there were splashing sounds someone was definitely in there there was no in use marker at the entrancehe hesitated a moment longer then went in for a moment he thought he had made a terrible mistake for elspeth was lying beside the pool wrapped in a lounging robe head was pressed against another crowned with flowing white oh for havens sake dont be more of a young fool than you are already gwena snapped he recognized just before he backed out of the clearing that it wasnt firesong she was lying against it was her companion do youmind if i use the pool he said awkwardly she propped herself up on one elbow and gave him a long penetrating look i mind only if you plan on being as hateful as you were this morning she said levelly i didnt exactly plan on being hateful he replied weakly it just happened hmm was all she said and she laid herself back down again on the cushions if you dont mind im going to leave you two alone gwena said getting gracefully to her feet i suggest whatever in the nine hells is bothering the two of you that you get it dealt with before it shows up in the magic that youngster and i agree on one thing at leastthat youd better not bring your emotional upheavals into the reach of the stone and with that she melted into the undergrowth darkwind stripped hastily and slipped into the water elspeth stayed where she was neither moving nor talking he finally decided to break the silence before he got a headache from it im sorry i didnt mean to be nasty im sure you didnt elspeth replied then she turned on her side and met his eyes something occurred to gwena and she pointed it out to me youre getting a dose of what your brother gets all the time did you realize that what he said cleverly wintermoon certainly elspeth turned over onto her stomach and pillowed her head on her arms think about it you were always the adept the one with all the power the one who had anything he wanted from starblades approval to his pick of lovers in the clan he was a lowly scout no magic and in a position of risk so that even if someone had considered getting close to him they were afraid to because he was as likely to die as return every patrol even when you gave up the magic and no longer were the darling of your fathers eye you still had high rank a place in the council the friendship of the gryphons and dawnfire now youve taken the magic up again and you have it all back and there stands good old reliable wintermoon upstaged again i never thought of it that way he said slowly it never occurred to me i didnt think so ever wondered why he spends so much time outside the valewhy he volunteered to go wandering about the countryside with skif in tow she rubbed her forehead on her sleeve i did gwena says she thinks he does it so that he wont get jealous of you he really loves you just as truly as any brotherbut hellfires darkwind it must be awful to stand around and watch you and see everything you want just fall into your hand like a ripe fruit oh he replied feeling veryodd very taken aback so now youre confronted with firesong and youre feeling the same way wintermoon has since you started showing magegift her bright brown eyes regarded him soberly from beneath a lock of hair cdoesnt feel very good id imagine no it doesnt he admitted butyou oh im used to not being the best elspeth shook her hair back talia was better than me at classes jeri was better than me at swordsmanship mother is much prettier than me keros better at strategy stepfather at diplomacy skif at being sneakythe only thing i was really good at was pottery and i didnt deceive myself into thinking i was the best in the kingdom she spoke airily but darkwind sensed that old hurt under her words elspeth i think the thing that bothers me the most is that firesong has your admiration he said unhappily i am jealous of him he is so much more my master at magici feel like a bare apprentice but it is the fact that you admire him so that angers me and i cannot help myself it truly cost him in pride to admit that and she stared at him a moment longer you know kero told me something once she said youd think being able to speak mindtomiind would put an end to all the misunderstandings between people but it doesnt she was right too he shook his head ruefully i have often found that when there were misunderstandings both parties found reasons not to share their thoughts exactly she widened her eyes and he felt the delicate touch of her mind on his firesong has power firesong is too beautiful to be human firesong is worth admiring but from a distance hes not called firesong for nothinghe breathes in the admiration and everything else around him fire can warm you from a distance but it bums when you get too close to it there was no doubting the truth of the feelings behind the words he ducked under the water for a moment then emerged and hoisted himself up onto the bank beside her then you forgive me for being a beast she grinned i think you could persuade me to trevalen soared the spiritskies in a new form that of a vorcelhawk smaller than dawnfireas was only appropriate for a tierceland with nowhere near her power he still hoped that in this form she would see that he was trying to meet her halfway she had avoided him for days now and he was not certain if the reason was anything to do with him or if it was something outside of both of them surely the goddess knew of his feelings toward dawnfire could she not approve to let him continue to pursue dawnfire it would take the barest blink on her part to slap him to the ground away from her avataryet trevalen sought dawnfire still surely the goddess knew that he was still devout that he searched always mindful of serving her people better no matter how his heart might cry to him of how dawnfire needed him and he needed herhe was still a sworn shaman and owed his loyalty to her and her purposes hold thoughhad he truly just assumed dawnfire needed him he did not know for certain if he read her emotions or his own her eyes were no longer human when he saw her could he believe the desire for companionship he saw in them it was all so complex and he had so few real facts to work with he could only do the one thing a shaman ultimately must trust in who he was and let his longlearned morals determine his actions he had always been brighteyed and adventurous the goddess had not been displeased by it when she took him as her shaman it would be senseless to deny his naturebetter to act on it he had walked the moonpaths to no effectso now he tried a desperation move he left the paths altogether and turned his flight into the starry night between them prudent kraheera had never left the paths in all of his long life as a shaman trevalen had heard of somea very fewwho had and lived to do so again they were not many but their adventures had been in times calmer than these there were new things happening strange and promising and frightening at once and risks were somehow more appropriate the risk of leaving the moonpaths paled before the danger of his courting the goddess own avatar still if dawnfire would not come to him he must needs go to her he felt the lift in his belly as he lifted from the paths on wings made of glittering golden stardust and lit by his own life a shiver as though from a cold wind a knifelike wash through his sunlightfeathered body and the moonpaths dropped away below him foolishness it might bebut glorious it certainly was he soared and wheeled above and under the paths able now to see the patterns upon patterns they coursed into and the colors and layers as far as his spiriteyes could discern but she was nowhere to be found perhaps he was looking in the wrong place entirely well there was nothing keeping him from using this form in the real worldand if she soared the physical skies in her hawkform she would surely see him in this guise he closed the eyes of the hawk then turned withinsought the twist that brought him homeand opened them again as warm sun flooded through him through because as a spirithawk in the real world he was slightly transparent a tiercelvorcel of golden glasswas it not exactly like a lovesick tiercel to court a mate with fancy flying leaving the moonpaths diving from the starry soulsea into the physical worldwas that not the equivalent of skimming a cliff face to attract a lovers eye he couldnt help but laugh at himself over it all still a little giddy from the feel of the soulsea between the paths should he continue with the analogy and hope that dawnfire would be impressed could they be enough alike somehow that she would fly with him so many mysteries but then there were few answers to begin with in his lifes work that was he felt part of its appealin searching for truths hed found few absolute ones and thousands of personal ones hed follow his heart wherever it led perhaps his willingness to risk was only adaptability he felt at home in this vale of summer nestled amidst cruel winter as he did wherever he traveled so many times hed been berated for his brashness by kraheera perhaps his brashness was but unrefined bravery he increased his physical mass steadied in the chilly breeze above his brothers vale they too followed their hearts as certainly as they followed the goddess laws he admired them they fought for a goal that would come many centuries from their own lifetimes as though it would be enjoyed at days end they were not so different from his own people who guarded the plains and the deadly things under it the hawkbrothers actively fought the shinain had the equally difficult tasks of unending vigilance and precise response the kalenedral and the hawkbrother adepts were alike in some respects were they not different but complimentary he had seen history drawn in tapestries in katashinain was it time now for a new tapestry to be woven ah if his thread and dawnfires could be woven together it would be like the satisfying ending to a tale and he would feel rebornhe angled over the vale careful of the sense of wonder that he felt he couldnt let it blind him to his goal the point of taking flight this way was to find dawnfire to speak with her trevalen scanned the skies widened his viewand saw something bright hurtling toward him and the vale it was without physical form a fiery spear of crackling magical energy larger than two men it came roaring toward him rushing unrelenting like a stormdriven grassfire across the plainsand struck him full in the chest a shower of splintered mageenergy burst around him and he screamed out he fell half a furlong stunned recovered held himself in place with unsteady wingbeats the next blow was coming and he warded against it as best he could for one moment he thought that his fears were coming to pass that the stareyed herself had decided to punish him for his audacity but nono he was not even the object of the attack he had been in its boundpath and it had diverted to himand through him he had only been in the way the second strike was approaching differently it struck at him hurt him but lost little of its power continuing to its true target that target was below him in the vale starbladehe saw the adept taking the force of the blow and falling to his knees while his bondbird screamed in anger and frustration saw him recover even as he folded his wings and dove to add his own smalland probably futilestrength he saw kethra fling herself physically over the adept and magically join her power to his then he watched in astonishment as starblade gave up control to kethra letting her spread the force of the attack over both of them it is falconsbane a third blow came and then a fourth the pair sagged beneath the force of the brutal attack their shields eroding kethra cried out face toward the sky fists clenched transmuting the attackenergies into another form a circle of intense cold spread out from her covering everything it touched with a thick layer of frost furniture split and shattered as it was overcome drinking vessels and pitchers burst the very structure of the ekele was warping and cracking as it was engulfed in bitter cold falconsbane hyllarr shrieked in agitation and abandoned his perch falling to the floor and backing against the wall of the ekele as the lethal white circle spread already trevalen knew the victims were in pain from the deadly coldwhich told him that withstanding the effects of the attack must have been worse even than its transmutation even without foresight the next few moments were writ clear for anyone to see help would not come from the rest of the vale in time falconsbane had been merely testing their strength the next blow would rip through their defenses and surely channel through from starblade inside the vale into the valeand pour into the heartstone shattering it and sear the country for leagues the devastation would kill everyone and unleash a score of wild leylines to tear through the landscape i must stop thishe knew he would die it did not matter too many would be hurt here he looked up dawnfire was above him in her hawkform a blazing creature of glory she had more than enough power to shield starblade from the next attack whether he would survive the encounter he could not know but his brethren must be saved and here with him was dawnfireshe had the power he had the knowledge now together he cried and folded his wings to plummet down she fell beside him both of them rushing just ahead of the blast of power that they felt hot on their necksfiresong took up the drum and faced the heartstone his fingers pattering a little anticipatory run on the taut skin darkwind shook out his muscles a chill of nervousness running down his spine this was only to be an exploratory venture a preliminary to see what the three of them could do with the rogue stone haiee it was not so much a call as a mental shriek of pain and darkwind knew immediately whose pain it was father he reached for power blindly but firesong reacted first reaching clenching fists until his knuckles whitened flinging the tightest shield darkwind had ever seen around the heartstone darkwind had no time for anything other than a gasp of outrage it was starblade and kethra who needed protection not the damned stone firesong fell to his knees hands spread wide muscles straining as he built shield after shield around the stone the stone flared and a dozen firered tendrils stabbed out toward starblades ekele to be stopped short by firesongs shields they sought purchase in the inner shields and half of them penetrated firesong built another layer and another sucking in power from all around him the tendrils were all reaching out to starblade darkwinds sight clearly showed him the next huge firebolt coming in through the vales shields streaking down before it were two sunbright vorcelhawks they dove wing to wing turned as one above starblade and kethras ekeleand caught the firebolt together power flared around his father and his lover and then all was still except for the hoarse protests of hyllarr and a subsiding thrum from the heartstone firesong constricted the shields his eyes closed tightly in concentration the tendrils receded darkwind reached his power to elspeth without conscious thought of itand found her doing the same toward him they wove a counterattack lanced it up into the skyand let it sputter off into nothing the enemymornelithe falconsbane he knewhad aborted his remaining attack and dispersed its power into a huge flickering mantle over the vale there was no path for a counterattack to follow mornelithe falconsbane had escaped again chapter nineteen nyara and skif that was falconsbane elspeth gasped climbing to her feet and swaying in her tracks with shock at darkwinds side that was falconsbanei know it was what stopped him i dont know darkwind replied i cant tell elspeth his head rang with the echoes of power and there was no reading anything subtle this close to the stone he stepped across the passthrough on the warded threshold that sealed the stone away from the rest of the vale and sent out a fan of questing energy the trace was clear and clean though quickly fading and it ran back to a center that was not disturbed but oddly empty nomore than emptywhen he realized what he felt he recoiled and snapped up his own shields elspeth crossed the threshold and gwena appeared at her side both breathed hard from sprinting vree who had been sunning in the falls area of the vale shot overhead alert for new danger he abruptly sideslipped and landed in a tree outside the threshold and sent a mental query followed by a wordless message of support when he sensed how distraught his bondmate was darkwind waved to warn vree away then began running toward a particular remote corner of the valea place where he had sensed not only the remains of burnedout power but something more the kind of emptiness only a final strike left behind death someone had died protecting starblade and given that it was a powersignature he didnt recognize he was horribly certain he knew who that someone was hoofbeats gained behind him and gwena and elspeth drew up just ahead of him elspeths hand was open to him and he grasped it and vaulted up onto gwenas back together they rode crouched into the far reaches of the vale gwena sprinted and stooped dodging trees limbs and other obstacles the lush relaxing decorations of the vale were now clinging distractions gwena could only make speed in clearings they were overtaken within moments gwena dove off the trail in time to avoid being trampled by firesongs white dyheli who streaked past them lightningfast and surefooted the stag bore firesong clinging bareback and behind them flew the firebird streaming controlled falsesparks of agitation along the flowing length of its tail by the time darkwind gwena and elspeth reached their goal firesong was lifting the body of trevalen in his arms as if it weighed nothing his face utterly blank and expressionless firesongs complexion had turned ashen the firebird clutched at his shoulder and chittered angrily then fixed its eyes on trevalens lifeless face and went silent firesong looked from darkwind to elspeth and back again but said nothing there was a chill in his eyes that made darkwind reluctant to say anything elspeth stifled a sob behind her clenched fist gwena moved away stepping backward very deliberately firesong stalked carefully between them eyes focused straight ahead he carried his dreadful burden out of the clearing and into the depths of the vale without saying a single word to either of them darkwinds thoughts seethed with anger he killed trevalen he shielded the stone and not my father and trevalen died for it and he knows it the arrogant bastard why why did he shield the damned stone he saw the strike coming before i didhe knew what was going to happen darkwindyour father elspeth said urgently recalling to him the other casualties in this catastrophe gods he said despairingly and headed off at a run again in the opposite direction that firesong had taken the ekele was not that far but it seemed hundreds of leagues away as he hurtled through the foliage taking a narrow shortcut branches whipped at his face leaving places that stung until his eyes watered his lungs ached his legs felt as unsteady as willow twigs but there was no time no timedespite the fact that it seemed an eternity since the attack he and elspeth reached starblades home moments ahead of the rest of the mages of ksheyna hyllarr was shrieking alarm and outrage to the entire vale darkwind pounded up the steps of the ekele and burst into the main room and stepped back shocked by the destruction starblade was sprawled inelegantly across the floor with kethra lying atop him in an attitude of protection he was awake if dazed she was not moving elspeth pushed past him and reached for kethra levering her off the ksheyna adept so that darkwind could get to his father she slipped and steadied after a floorboard shifted under her all the wood in the room was splintered moisture covered every part that was not patched in frost very little was intact within four arms spans of starblade and kethra the floor and walls were warped and cracked this ekele could not possibly be livable again hyllarr quieted as soon as they entered the room though he continued to shift from one foot to the other crooning anxiously and craning his neck to watch what they were doing he came as far as the outer edge of the ice then waited starblade blinked up at his son and tried to rise darkwind decided that it would be better to help him onto the couch than try to prevent him from moving starblades fingers showed signs of frostbite falconsbane starblade murmured bringing a trembling hand up to his eyes that touch againfilthy he shuddered and darkwind got him lying back against a heap of pillows then ran to fetch water and cups from the far side of the ekele one cup he handed to elspeth who had managed to get kethra into a sitting position the other he handed to his father who seized it in shaking hands and drained it as if it contained the water of life itself darkwind daubed his fingers into the pitcher and traced wet fingers across his fathers brow and eyes and blew gently an old mages technique to help focus concentration what happened he asked as starblade closed his eyes and lay back again the lines of pain in his face even more pronounced than ever before i am not certain starblade faltered it was falconsbanehe tried my defenses his face mirrored his confusion and his fear the fear that he had once again betrayed his clan it seems he could not break them darkwind reminded him the beast could not take you father his hold over you is gone foreverdo you see starblade shook his head though not in negation ihe attacked kethra tried to protect us both he propped himself up onto one elbow with obvious effort and looked around shes in shock elspeth said calmly she needs a lot of rest and she needs her energies restored but im sure shes going to be all right by now they had an audience but only iceshadow pushed through to join them he went first to kethra then to starblade and seeing that they were only badly shaken and depleted shook his head it is strange iceshadow said in puzzlement there was no time for any of us to have protected them yet someone did there were hawks starblade whispered two shining hawks with wings of fire they dove from the sun and sheltered us beneath their wings that is what protected us that was trevalen said a new voice flatly firesong stood just inside keeping his face in shadow that was trevalen in spiritform and likely that one of ksheyna who was taken by the shinain goddess he seemed to be waiting for the name and darkwind supplied it carefully controlling his own anger at the adepts failure to shield his father dawnfire he said his own voice as expressionless as firesongs firesong did not even acknowledge that he had spoken dawnfire it was also dawnfire that was shamanic magic it would have been the only thing this falconsbane could not counter for it is spiritborn and he knows not how to use it nor how to negate it firesong bent down for a moment and laid his hand gently on starblades head above his closed eyes starblade did not seem to even notice that he was there so deep was his exhaustion he must have known he could not survive such a blow in spiritform darkwind kept a tight curb on his tongue afraid to say anything lest he lash out with words of challenge but firesong straightened and looked into his eyes and the sheer agony darkwind saw there killed whatever accusations had been forming in his mind firesongs ageless smooth face which bore only confidence scant hours ago now showed creases of tension and grief i could not shield your father and the stone both darkwind firesong said quietly with unshed tears making his voice thick trevalen died because i was a fool i did not think to look for your enemy i did not ward the stone against him i had to make a choice your father or the vale look he said and picked up a stoneware cup spiderwebbed with cracks from the cold look here how this is like the stone all the damage runs from this place tied to starblade and a single blow herechanneled through starbladeyou see he dropped the cup which shattered between his feet indeed darkwind did see that one blow had firesong not intervened would have shattered the heartstone completely releasing all the pentup energies at once it would not have created as large a crater as made the dhorisha plains but it would have dug down to bedrock and killed every living thing within the vale and far outside it i amsorry firesong said and sighed heavily you will never know how sorry i did what i had to as did trevalen and with that he retreated with the rest of ksheyna parting before him it was a fair amount of time later when darkwind left the ekele having put starblade and kethra under the care of iceshadow and the other mages iceshadow was confident that they would both be near recovery by morning elspeth had volunteered to stay with them channeling energies through gwena to renew what they had lost helping the ksheyna healers vree had wanted to stay with elspeth darkwind could think of no way to be of use his own strength was not what it should have been he had cast much of it into that fruitless counterattack on falconsbane and his mind was in a turmoil he did not know what to do or to think he would have been of no use to the healers muddled as he was so he wandered the vale instead coming at last to the curtain of energies that hid the entrance snow was falling again the last daylight dwindled beneath the trees he reached the cleft in the hillside and realized that the odd outcropping of snow there was not snow at all firesong turned slowly saw him and nodded it felt like an invitation darkwind stepped across the veil and into the snow to stand beside him after a moment firesong spoke he goes home now the adept said dully his body does darkwind saw that one of the shadows at the limit of vision was moving was not a shadow at all but a blackclad rider on a ghostgray horse with a large bundle carried across the saddlebow moving away toward that path that led down to the plains and what of the spirit darkwind asked finally i am not a shaman i cannot say darkwind rubbed his arms as the residual heat of the vale wisped away from his body into the silent snowfall i want you to know you did the right thing in protecting the heartstone it would have killed us all firesong stiffened and looked up white crystal flakes settled on his forehead and brows laced his eyelashes and crown of white hair knowing it was the better of two ills changes little his hair rippled like silk in a breeze it makes trevalens death hurt no less darkwind nodded firesong shifted his loose robes and lifted a long bone pipe to his lips thin breathy notes fell softly upon the ear mingled with the silence darkwind knew the tune a shinain lament a second voice joined the flutes though darkwind could not have told what it was until he saw the white firebird perched in the tree branches above the adept its head and neck stretched out its graceful bill open and its throat vibrating the scene etched itself into darkwinds memory after so many years in the company of adepts he knew the outward signs of selfinduced trance after a while he realized that the adept was paying no attention to anything but his music darkwind turned and walked back into the vale leaving firesong and his bondbird pouring out mournful notes into the dark and silence as he walked away he thought he caught sight of something wet glittering on firesongs cheek though the notes never faltered and the face remained utterly remote and as lifeless as a marble statues perhaps it was only a melting snowflake perhaps it wasnt a scream rang out and was cut short falconsbane slashed all claws extended and the hapless slave fell to the stone floor choking on his own blood falconsbane watched him with anger raging unappeased through his veins as the boy gurgled and clutched desperately at his throat blood poured between his fingers and splattered against the cold gray marble as the slave twitched and gasped and finally died his eyes glazing his body twitching then relaxing into the limpness of death not enough falconsbane looked for something else to destroy cast his eyes about the study and found nothing that he could spare or did not need he had already shattered the few breakable ornaments the upholstery of his couch was slashed to ribbons the table beside the couch was overturned and he would not touch the books they held knowledge too precious to waste so he turned back to his final victim and proceeded to reduce the body to its fundamental parts using only his hands when he was done he was still full of burning rage he kicked the door of the study open hoping to find someone lurking in the hall but they knew his temper by now and had cleared out of the corridors likely they were all cowering behind locked doors and praying to whatever debased gods they worshipedbesides himthat he would appease his anger with the slave they had sent him cowards he was surrounded by worthless gutless cowards he growled deep in his chest not as gutless as the slave is now he stormed out into the corridors of his fortress and ran upward toward the rooftops the place stifled him with its heat and luxury he wanted to destroy it all but instead he went seeking the darkness of the night and the quiet of the snow to cool his temper he found a spot where he would not be tempted to destroy anything more because there was nothing to destroythe top of one of the four corner towers it was open to the wind and weather and since the quiet and cold did nothing to cool his anger falconsbane found another outlet for his rage he reached out to the storm about him and whipped it from a simple snowstorm to a blinding howling blizzard taking fierce comfort in the shrieking wind wishing that it was the shrieks of dying hawkbrothers he heard instead thwarted again it could not have happened hed posted sentries to spy upon them they had done nothing out of the ordinary they made no efforts at all to use the twisted power of their stone instead they had sought to drain power from it and it of course had resisted as it had been trained to do their mages were exhausted they had no reserves no great adepts the timing could not have been better and yet he had been thwarted first his attempt to retake his pawn starblade failed all of the channels he had so carefully established into the birdfools heart and mind were gone not blocked but gone completely healed by some strange application of magics with a taste he could not even begin to sort out strongly female and laced with an acid protectiveness that made him flinch away that was bad enough having to abandon his best tool but when he tried to turn his controlling of starblade into an attack on the ksheyna heartstone as planned he could not springboard to the stone infuriating not once but twice blocked at the stone itself by shields he could not penetrate and blocked again at the channel he had tied to starblades lifeforce where had those fools gotten the adept that had shielded the stone there had been no one not even the outland girl with so much as the potential for power like that and what had they used to block his deathstrike on starblade not only did he not recognize it but his mind still reeled beneath the blinding counter it had made to his strike what had intercepted his firebolt it had taken all his power and transformed it into a force he could not even remotely name either of those alone would have been bad enough together they awoke a killing rage in him that demanded an outlet he had stormed out of his workingplace and into his study intending mayhem he discovered there was moremuch more his outriders had been waiting for him they had come in to him all bearing the same story blackclad riders on black horses haunting the edges of his domain riders who did nothing simply appeared watching for a moment as if making certain that they had been seen and vanished again riders who left no mark in the snow whose faces could not be seen behind their veilings of black cloth his mages had come to him with more news of the same ilk hundreds of tiny changes that had occurred while he was dealing that aborted attack to ksheyna along and inside all of his borders there were tiny pinprickupsettings of his magic traps had been sprung but had caught nothing and there was not even a hint of what had sprung them leylines that had been diverted to his purposes had returned to their courses but they went to nothing specific nor any new powerpoles areas that he had fouled to use for breeding his creatures had been cleansed yet there was no pattern to it no plan some lines had been left alone traps sidebyside showed one sprung the other still set areas near to the vale had been left fouled while others farther away had been cleansed he snarled into the howling wind he hated random things he hated fools who worked with no plans in mind and changes that occurred with no warning and most of all he hated despised things that happened for no apparent reason every one of those pinpricks had taken away his order interfered with his careful plansand left chaos behind and all to no purpose he could see he shouted into the night and let the wind carry his anger away let the cold chill his rage until it came within the proper controllable bounds again how long he stood there he was not certain only that after a time he knew that he could descend into his stronghold again and be in no danger of destroying anything necessary he dismissed the stormwinds without his will behind them the winds faded and died away leaving only the snow still falling from the darkened cloudcovered night sky he opened the door into the warmth and light of the staircase and found one of his outriders waiting there for him he snarled and clenched his fists at his side this was more of that news he knew it and he wanted so badly to maim the bearer of it that h shook with the effort to control himself the mans face was white as paper he trembled with such fear that he was incapable of speech he held out an intricately carved black box to his master a box hardly bigger than the palm of his hand falconsbane took it and waited for the man to force the words past his fear to tell his master where this trinket of carved wood had come from but when the man failed utterly to get anything more than an incoherent hiss past his clenched teeth falconsbane ruthlessly seized control of his mind with yet another spell and tore the story from him it only took a moment to absorb mindtomind but what he learned quelled his anger far more effectively than the wind had his hand clutched convulsively on the box as the tale unfolded and he left the man collapsed upon the stairs in a trembling heap ignoring whatever damage he had done to the outriders mind he took the stairs two at a time back to the safety and security of his newlycleaned study there was no sign of where the dead slave had been except a wide wet spot and only there with all his protections about him did he use a tiny spell to open the tiny box from arms length if this was a rational ordered universe it would contain something meant to cripple or kill him he held his shields about him waiting nothing happened the box contained cradled in black padded suede a tiny figurine carved of shiny black onyx the figure of a perfectly formed black horse rearing and no bigger than his thumbnail there was no scent of magic upon itno trace of who or what had made or sent it although he knew what had delivered it if not who it was from one of the black riders he retreated to his newlycovered couch and held the delicate little carving to the light pondering what he had ripped from his servants mind this particular outrider had seen these blackclad riders three times before this but always they had vanished into the forest as soon as they knew they had been seen leaving not even hoofprints behind but this time had been different this time he had seen the rider cleave a tree with a sword blow and leave something atop the stump the rider sheathed the sword and slipped into the shadows like another shadow himself when the outrider had reached the spot he discovered this box and it weighted down one other thing a slip of paper that had burned to ash in his hand as soon as he had read it a slip of paper bearing the name of his master mornelithe falconsbane in the careful curved letters of tradespeech as if there had been any doubt whatsoever who this was meant forhe turned the figurine over and over staring at it there was nothing here to identify it or the box with its stylized geometric carvings as coming from any particular land or culture was it a warning or a gift if a gift what did it mean if a warningwho were these riders who had sent them and what did they want skif and nyara talked idly about the chase this rabbit they were dressing out had been far more trouble than it was worth but nyaras capture of it was as worthy of admiration as any hawks stoop wintermoon was gently cleaning a deep scratch one of the dyheli had suffered several feet from the two of them nyara had reentered their lives by simply coming into camp and waiting to be discovered theyd found her between the two dyheli when they awoke sitting with her knees tucked up to her chest and the sword need at her feet she looked different nowmore human and with sharplydefined muscles she also moved with purpose rather than slinking like a cat she had visibly undergone many changes all of which served to fascinate skif further there was no sign of any trouble but suddenly cymrys head shot up and her eyes went wide and wild with the whites showing all around them her body went from relaxed to tense she stood with all four legs braced and there was no doubt in skifs mind what she sensed danger terrible danger something was happening skif stood and put one hand on her shoulder to steady her as nyaras face went completely blank nyara leapt to her feet and stared off in the same direction as cymry her own eyes mirroring a fear that skif recognized only too well he felt nothing but then if it was magic that alerted them he wouldnt but he recognized what direction they were both staring in the valewhere elspeth was he tried to mindtouch his companion but all of her attention was on the danger she had sensed it was needs mindvoice that growled in the back of his head as he tried to break through cymrys preoccupation leave her alone boy shes talking to gwena theres big trouble back with your birdloving friends he dared a tentative thought in needs direction waiting for an instant rebuff he still had no idea what need thought of him beyond the few things she had condescended to say to him what kind of trouble something involving us the sword hesitated a moment hmm id say so your kittens sire just tried to flatten the whole vale and i thinkyes no doubt theres been a death before skif could panic the sword continued not elspeth not darkwind more i cant tell you theres some shamanic magic mixed in with the rest and damned if i can read it wintermoon stared at all of them with the impatient air of a man ready to strangle someone if he didnt get an explanation soon skif didnt blame him and he broke off communication with the blade to tell the hawkbrother what little need had been able to tell him the name of mornelithe falconsbane got his immediate attention falconsbane but i thought we all thoughtor we didnt think skif replied trying to make his thoughts stop spinning in circles we just assumed not a good idea where magic is concerned or where falconsbane is concerned next time i wont believe hes dead until i burn the body myself and sow the ashes with salt if there is trouble we must return with all speed and it must be with nyara or without her for we cannot delay to argue wintermoon said firmly i had rather it were with but i shall not force her the mention of her name seemed to wake nyara from her trance of course we go nighthunter she replied her eyes still looked a little unfocused but her voice was firm enough and i go with you i know too much about my father to remain outside and watch your people struggle to match him again i shall not hide while he tries to destroy your clan hoping he will miss me as he concentrates on you she shook her head then and hesitated looking fully into skifs eyes if i had a choice i would tell you this when we are alone ashke she said softly but i think that wintermoon must hear this so he can bear witness if need be skif tensed wondering what she was going to say to him things had seemed so promising a few moments ago i care for you outlander she said with quiet intensity more than i had ever realized when i saw your face this morn i would likemany thingsand most of all to share my life with you but you and i can do nothing until i come to terms with my father there is much that i have not told you of himand myself it must be dealt with skif had seen such looks as he saw in her eyes more than once before he became a heraldand after among some of the refugeees from ancars depredations he saw it in the eyes of a woman who spoke of her father and horrors between them he knew he knew of many things that decent people would only think of as horrible nightmares and deny that they truly happened he knew the sordid tales that could be hidden behind those bleak eyes she didnt even have to begin he knew before she started and he blamed her no more for what had been done to her than he would have blamed a tree sundered by lightning she was all the more beautiful for her strength maybe it was just that he was too busy wanting to hold her and tell her that nothing in her past could make him want her any less falconsbane was dismissed from any redemption in his mind to him he rated no more thoughts not even hateas his friend wintermoon had taught him such emotions can cloud purpose maybe that purpose was too important for him to have any room left for anger now that might change if he ever actually saw falconsbane again but that was the way he felt this moment all things could change if he were the same person he was only a few years ago hed have already been sharpening knives plotting revenge on falconsbane now simply eliminating the adept was more important revenge seemed foolish somehow it would not help nyara at all how strange that after a life like his revenge seemed hollow compared to simple justice nyara deserved far more consideration than her father he didnt even think about the swords propensity to eavesdrop until she spoke to him well bless your heart boyim beginning to think theres hope for you yet needs harsh mindvoice rattled in his head as she chuckled you are all right hellfires id even be willing to nominate you as an honorary sister he felt his ears redden as nyara looked at him curiously uhthank you he said simply not wanting to offend the blade by adding i think tell her boy dont go into detail keep it short and simple but tell her she needs to know look nyara he said haltingly wishing he could say half of what he wanted to ii love you i guess youve figured that out but i thought id better say it there nothings going to change that im not the picture of virtueor innocenceive seen more than you might think ive spent time on ancars border ive seen girlswomenwhove had pretty bad things happen to them whove beeni dont know i guess you could say theyve been betrayed by the parents who should have protected them i know what you mean you and i cant do anything about us until we get him out of our lives a little confused boy but i think she got the gist of it ill have a little talk with her and lay things out for her later again that gravelly chuckle ill let her know you werent just making pretty talk youve seen thangs as rough as shes lived through no ever would have figured me for playing matchmaker and at my age nyara only stared at him in dumb surprise clutching the sword to her chest beneath her cloak of fur but then one hand crept off the scabbard and moved down searched for his and found it she gave him the ghost of a smile then either you are lying which need says notyou are a saint which she also says notor you are as great a fool as i she shook her head but her eyes never left his well thenlets be fools together he whispered staring down into her bottomless eyes im willing to work at it if you are commotion at the entrance end of the vale caught darkwinds attention and broke into his brooding darkness had fallen some time ago but he had not bothered to call any lights part of him still wanted to be angry with firesongangry at someonebut the rest of him knew that the adept was punishing himself already anything he said or did would be superfluous and likely cause much harm the disturbance was enough to let him know that a larger party than usual had crossed the veil and since the second shift of scouts had already gone out this was not something expected something unexpected today could only mean trouble he sent a tentative inquiry to vree and the answer he received sent him shooting down the stairs of his ekele like a slung stone he met the tiny parade just past the first hot pool and when h saw who had met wintermoons little troupe as well as who was riding with it he thought that he was dreaming the outlander skif rode his white companion beside him to his right was wintermoon on one of the two dyheli stags that had gone out with them but on the left hand of the herald was the second stag who also bore a rider and that was what caused him to stare and question his sanity nyara sat astride the dyheli as if she had always known how to ride she was clad in a rough bearskin cloak carrying the blade she had taken across her lap walking beside her holding a magelight to show the way and engaged in easy conversation with her was firesong wintermoon held up his hand and they stopped long enough to dismount the dyheli walked off into the side of the vale where the clan kept grazing and water for their kind firesong stepped back to allow skif to aid nyara from her mount but then he fell in beside them still deeply in conversation with both of them still more than a little stunned darkwind took his place beside his brother wintermoon thanked his mount and sent the stag on his way with a pat on the withers cymry walked ahead but darkwind had no doubt that she was following every word of firesongs conversation who in the name of all gods is that wintermoon asked after hearty greetings between the two brothers firesong ktreva healing adept the council let us send for help darkwind replied hes impressed by himself wintermoon completed but id guess that he must be something very special he shook his head brother so much has happened to us since dawn this morning that i do not know where to begin then let me darkwind suggested after the last time you came in elspeth and i were permitted to call for aid firesong is what we received he was more than we expected and yeshe is of such power and ability that this arrogance of his is little more than pardonable pride and almost a game to him wintermoon only snorted perhaps i would like to see him in a situation where his pretty face means nothing and he only frightens with his power take away the things he was born with and i will be prepared to admire his accomplishments but then i am a crude man magic has never much impressed me darkwind came so close to laughing that he choked and gave his brother a quick embrace nevertheless he has been training me and the outlanders he has been training you between attempting to impress the outlander how am i to finish this tale darkwind chided then sobered listen there were ill things happened here today we were to attempt something small upon the stonewhen when falconsbane raised his ugly head and attempted to foul the vale wintermoon interrupted do not fear to alarm me that much we knew nyara felt the taint of her father as did the companion and the sword knew where and that there had been a death she said she did not think it was someone she knew whose death then trevalen the shinain shaman darkwind said sorrow rising in him again wintermoons eyes went wide with surprise hethe beast struck at our father wintermoon firesong shielded the stoneno do not interrupt me this timehad he not none of us would be here to greet you you would have returned to a smoking hole and that i pledge you i could do nothing nor elspeth we were not quick enough butfather obviously liveswas it trevalen that shielded him then wintermoon shook his head amazed surely though he iswasa shaman he could not have protected father against the beast in his wrath darkwind nodded at everything his brother said and was no little amazed at how much wintermoon guessed correctly firesong thinks that he was not alonethat it was he andand dawnfire together who shielded father now it was darkwinds turn to shake his head he does not know what happened to them besides that trevalen is dead i do not know what all this means but there will be a little time to try to find meanings later what is your tale simple compared to yours wintermoon took off his coat and slung it over one shoulder i had struck signs of nyaras presence and narrowed the search i thought that we were within a day perhaps two of finding her but instead i woke to find her seated quite calmly in the midst of our camp oh so he raised an eyebrow at that the sword advised her to seek us out well to seek skif out is closer to the truth it was he that her eyes were upon and it was he she wished to speak to so i woke him there was much sighing and exchanging of speaking looks wintermoon smiled a smile tinged with sadness i would be laughing if there were not so many things now that would make a laugh so greatly out of place it was quite charming a meeting out of a silly ballad darkwind i could almost hear a harp aplaying skif would not thank me for telling you that well i think i can safely say that the two are fairly smitten absence from each other has only made the bond stronger and that if i were a betting man i would bet on them pairing as eagles a true lovebond darkwind considered the two considered what he and elspeth had spoken of i would not bet against you but there are many obstacles in their way not the least of which is her fatherand what he will do to her if he finds her they know that which makes itwella better pairing for my thinking they know what they face and face it together wintermoon gazed at the backs of those in front of him and smiled again a good thing to see some love in the midst of so much pain but i should continue once we had gotten past the sighing and the looking and into the speaking she would i think have spoken of those obstacles but then came the attack upon the vale wintermoon rubbed the back of his neck with one hand we decided to return she determined to go with us saying there was much she could tell us to aid against her father i was not certain then of the wisdom of this for she could be a breach in our defenses not with need beside her darkwind said firmly i have spoken to elspeth of the blade although she is not an adept as we know them she is very powerful and has knowledge we do not wintermoon nodded it did seem to me that nyara was less feral and more human but i only saw her once and i thought i might have misremembered perhaps the sword is even able to change her i knew danger or no that she must come here long enough to be given some kind of protection if you have so powerful an adept here perhaps he can weave shieldings for her that will protect her we cached the packs to make more speed and returned as quickly as we could when you arrived was firesong still at the entrance to the vale darkwind could not resist asking that he was quiet as an icestatue though he came to life quickly enough when he saw us wintermoon raised his eyebrows and that bird of his it lit our way in is he always such a showman darkwind shrugged i cannot see how he could be anything less i think it is part of his nature but tell me what did he make of the changechild i have heard that ktreva is less forgiving of such creatures than we if that is a trait of his clan he does not share it wintermoon said a hint of speculation in his voice he did not even seem particularly startled although if he viewed us from afar with the eyes of his bondbird he would have known what she was long before we rode through the veil and now he speaks with her darkwind ran a hand through his hair it is not what i would have expected of him well hes reserving judgment boy said a harsh mindvoice he isnt terribly happy about having falconsbanes daughter in his lap but he thinks that he has some foolproof ways of telling if shes an enemy plant a snort of laughteras if i would leave any of the bastards hooks in her darkwind belatedly recognized the voice of the sword i think you fully capable warlady he said carefully let me ask you this is she ready to face her father alone hellfires no not in a century theres only so much i can do with the raw material only so much i can do im no great adept just a magesmith the sword sounded surprisinglyhumble darkwind found the changes in need as interesting as the changes in nyara ill promise you this though give that girl proper backing and shell defy her father though she hasnt quite figured it out yet shes not his frightened slave anymore that was good news the first of the day unless you have something planned wintermoon began firesong stopped turned and interrupted him i think the young adept said pitching his voice so that they all heard him clearly it is time to call a council chapter twenty iceshadow it was a strange conference held in a clearing below firesongs borrowed ekele firesongs hertasi scrambled to bring food and drink for the participants some of whom like firesong himself darkwind and elspeth had not eaten for some time food had not seemed particularly important to darkwind but of course to the hertasi it was a source of much disapproval that they had neglected themselves the lizards hovered all over them but paid particular attention to firesong there were predictably twice as many hertasi attending him as anyone else the conference was also a small one iceshadow representing the elders and mages darkwind firesong wintermoon for the scouts nyara the blade need kethra sent her regrets that she could not attend she would not leave starblades bed elspeth had been reluctant to join in it but at firesongs urging she too took her place in the circle skif presented himself at nyaras side and would not be moved and darkwind urged the companions to take places beside their heralds as well the conference was interrupted immediately by yet another visitor reminding them all that there was more at stake than just the vale the kyree bounded into the group and planted himself right next to nyara without even asking for permission darkwind recognized rris immediately by the jaunty tilt of his head and his alert eyes and ears firesong was somewhat taken aback by the kyrees brashness and darkwind was so amused to see his reaction that he insisted that rris be allowed to speak i am sent from treyvan and hydona the kyree said holding his head up and refusing to be intimidated by firesongs measuring glances those are the gryphons young cub he said then with a kindly patronizing tone to his mindvoice turning to give firesong a measuring glance of his own they are the allies of this vale and they wish to know what has happened beyond the obvious that isthe action of mornelithe falconsbane and the death of the shaman darkwind hid his smile behind a cough he himself had taken the time to send a message to the gryphons but rris had obviously been coached and he had a shrewd idea by whom they wish to know what you intend to do rris continued blithely they have taken steps they have fortified their lair which lies near to the node in the ruins they have shielded that node so that no one may use it but themselves and they have found the old buried gate and have shielded it so that falconsbane may not use it to return but they must know what their allies intend as well and they wish the council to know that with the sword need they vouch for the changechild nyara that they feel she is trustworthy for they have been aware of her movements and actions since she left their lair he lay down then obviously very pleased with himself darkwind knew why he had delivered treyvans message word for word with the proper tone and no one had interrupted him darkwind hoped that firesong was reading that pleasure as a taste of rris own selfconceit young cub i thought he was going to lose those eyebrows up into his hair but there was at least one surprise in all of that for him as well the gryphons had known where nyara was and what she was doing and they vouched for her firesong might have lost the initial control of the council but he regained it as soon as he stood up to speak i have been lacking in forethought he said quietly i have not thought that mornelithe falconsbane could still be a danger if he even lived that was an error and one that has cost a precious life perhaps two i do not know if the one called dawnfire also perished with trevalen i think it is time that we deal with both our problems in a coordinated fashion our first problem is the heartstone for until we remove it as a threat falconsbane can use it against us as he nearly did earlier then we must deal with falconsbane himself he looked around the circle and got nods of agreement from everyone to that end let each of us say what he knows both of what happened this day and what in the past may have been involved never mind that it has all been said before there are going to be some of us that have not heard all the tale from all the participants he began with his perception of the attack the various stories took some time to complete but in the end even darkwind was satisfied some of the pieces were beginning to make a whole now that we have built the proper picture i see two different needs that must be addressed at the same time firesong shifted restlessly from foot to foot i know what must be done with the stone and those of you who are to help me should hear of this now so that there is no more mystery but what we are to do about falconsbane i do not know i think that i would be of little aid there for i am not wellversed in combative magics i am not versed in combat to speak of at all but i am not certain that direct combat with magic or not is the proper way to deal with him darkwind must have looked a little surprised at firesongs confession that there was something he did not know for he caught the adepts sardonic glance in his direction so this is my suggestion that we have two councils i shall have elspeth and darkwind the gryphons representative he bowed ironically to rris who only bowed gravely back at him and the companion gwena if iceshadow and wintermoon would care to lead the other i think that nyara may know some ways of countering her father she will certainly know more of his ways and his stronghold than any of the rest of us and surely the sword need knows combat by magic and blade far far better than i thank you youngster came needs dry response broadcast clearly to all i do have a little experience there firesongs eyebrows flew up into his hair again but he did not comment wisely darkwind thought one did not pick quarrels with edged wit or edged weapons when we have all reached some sort of conclusion we will meet again as one this time with the full ksheyna council will that suit you all it suits me very well iceshadow said cautiously wintermoon and skif nodded well then let us withdraw to my ekele and leave this place to the others firesong made some show of finding a place to sit while the others followed iceshadow down one of the paths only when they were completely out of earshot did the young adept sigh and look from darkwind to elspeth and back here is what i intend he said quietly attend sir kyree you must carry this back to the gryphons as soon as i have done for this is dangerous working that i propose and i wantno i needthem to participate rris nodded and pricked his ears forward eagerly firesong took a deep breath i intend to shatter the heartstone at darkwinds instinctive move of protest he shook his head no not as falconsbane sought toand not releasing the energy wildly faceting a precious stone is not the same as striking it with a mallet no i intend to do this under complete control first i wish to prepare the stone as if it were to become a gate call it a protogate i shall work only with the energy tied to the stone but never the stone itself that will anchor all of the energy but not in a physical anchor darkwind nodded slowly this made sense but it was not something he would ever have considered everyone knew that creating a gate anchored energy but no one would have ever considered making a stone into a gate it would entail circling the powers about the stone from without he did not even want to consider what would happen to someone who actually used such a gate ksheyna has prepared a new stone in the new valeyes at darkwinds nod he continued once this stone is shattered the protogate will be drawn to the point of greatest attraction and to the point that is nearest in type to the old stone it will seek we shall push it gently in the proper direction that should be the new stone for both were created by the same mages it will carry the remaining leylines with it we can guide its movement from here thats not going to happen quickly darkwind put in no it will take several adepts in relays to move it and they will be working for several days to do so but this should work firesong looked to rris the shielding will be undertaken in pairs like the shielding when a heartstone is moved but with double the mages the pairs will be malefemale to enforce the balancing i wish the gryphons to be in the west if they would can you tell them that as well as all else you have heard tonight can you remember surely the kyree replied with a lift of his head that signified slightly offended pride i know every kyree historysong every tale the tayledras have shared with my clan and all of the fourhundred and twentythree tales of my famous cousin warrl carrying what i have heard to treyvan and hydona is no great task at all darkwind felt his lips twitching with your permission i shall go to them rris finished at firesongs nod he was off leaping across the circle and into the underbrush presumably on his way back to the ruins gwena chose that moment to absent herself leaving only firesong darkwind and elspeth darkwind was about to take himself off as well when firesong put out a restraining hand there is trouble between us darkwind he said levelly that trouble has not been purged there is trouble between you and the wingsister for you have not truly dealt with it and there is trouble between elspeth and myself for there are some assumptions that she has made that i have not corrected darkwinds stomach knotted with sudden tension he would have liked to make an escape but he did not dare these must be dealt with all before we enter the circle together firesong said but instead of turning first to darkwind he faced elspeth you have not been honest with darkwind he said levelly i she started to protest but the protests died on her lips under his stern gaze you have not told him your true feelings concerning me the adept continued he has sensed it but you have avoided dealing with your own feelings and with him you have not told him the truth isuppose not i am very attracted to darkwind very butyou she shrugged helplessly i cant help it and it isnt just because youre so infernally beautiful firesong she blushed furiously and hung her head ive never wanted anyonephysicallyquite so much darkwind felt his jealousy rising to eat him alive had she been fantasizing that her lover was firesong every time that the two of them had well firesong nodded coolly not in the least perturbedor impressed you are not the first female to attempt to fling herself at me let me tell you that you are a good student elspeth and worthy of the praise that i have given you but you must know this i am not as you think she shook her head obviously not understanding for that matter darkwind couldnt imagine what firesong was getting at i am he said delicately the true descendant of your herald vanyel on both sides of my family it is from his blood that i have my power then before elspeth could register that surprise he continued i inherited more than his power she shook her head clearly she did not understand what he was trying to tell her he arched an eyebrow in darkwinds direction perhaps i should be a little more explicit elspeth while i am sure you are a very attractive woman to some it is darkwinds hair that i would choose to braid feathers into if i could he licked his lips in point of fact i have been wishing that since i first laid eyes upon him had he not put his own feelings toward you out where anyone could see them i should already have done so and firesong actually blushed elspeth had thought she had come to the end of the surprises that living with the hawkbrothers brought but this last series had caught her flatfooted first of coursethat the famous vanyel had left any offspring there was no record of that in any of the chronicles and no hint of it in any of the songs and ballads then came the revelation that firesong was the descendant of that childor children there was no reason to doubt him he had never lied before and why lie about something so stupid something that couldnt be proved or disproved here firesong already had plenty of statusand presumably fameon his own he surely didnt need to boast of a bloodline like some fading failed highborn but the last surprisethat hesdear gods what do they call it here shayachern is that where we get shaych why am i thinking about where a word came from whenwhen he wants darkwind and not mefirst came a rush of profound embarrassment she hadnt been made a fool of shed made a fool of herself quite nicely on her own with no help from firesong making assumptions she had no right to make she just wanted to crawl away and hide somewhere but then she was overcome by a flood of jealousy but not of firesongs attraction to darkwind no she was jealousand afraid of darkwinds possible attraction to firesong she knew the tayledras were a lot more flexible about sexual matters than the people of valdemar even the heralds what if now that firesongs preferences were out in the open darkwind preferred him to her she was so jealous she was literally sick her stomach and shoulders were in knots her throat too tight to speak firesong was watching both of them wearing an unreadable little smile and measuring them from beneath his long white lashes what was he thinking did he know how she felt was he amused once again she was dizzy with embarrassment sick with the emotions warring for control of her she flushed then paled feeling herself growing hot then cold then hot again her ears burned and the back of her neck her hands grew cold and she fought dizziness as she looked up with defiance into firesongs face there was no doubt that the adept had at least some idea of her internal battling firesongs smile increased just a trifle he tossed his head sending his hair whipping back over his shoulders and deliberately tauntingly lifted his chin at her then he grinned insolently and turned away walking off into the darkness leaving his magelights behind him she couldnt look at darkwind she couldnt not look at him she tried to look at him out of the corner of her eye but caught his eyes by accident and was forced either to meet his eyes or look quickly away she chose the former he coughed and she saw to her increased confusionas if it could be increased any furtherthat he was flushed a little himself no more than a little the peculiar illumination of the magelights tended to wash his color out her hands were cold her face still flushed but she no longer felt so sick i feel like a fool he said just before the silence became unendurable i feel like a true and crowned fool well imagine how i feel she said sharply especially when i realized that i didnt care a pin how he felt about me or you but she didnt really want to answer him but if she didnt shed never know what his feelings were in the matter it really made me very unhappy to think youmight she shook her head and finally looked right at him all right she snapped angrily i was jealous if thats what you wanted to know i was jealous because you might be more interested in him than you are in me he simply watched her soberly without so much as twitching a muscle he didnt say a thing and now she was sick with embarrassment again and with humiliation she knew now that firesong had pressed the issue and humbled her by forcing her to reveal things she had kept only to herself that her attraction to firesong had been nothing more than simple infatuation it had only been complicated because she had so admired his competence his intelligence as well as his stunning looks but darkwind was competent and intelligent and her attraction to him was something a great deal deeper deep enough to move her to jealousy deep enough to make her willing to make a fool of herself if it came to that i have been a fool darkwind said quietly even as you perhaps it was as much due to stress as anything else we have been living a lifetime in the past few moons we have both of us changed sometimes profoundly i can only take comfort in one of the shinain sayings no one has lived who has not been a fool at least once and he summoned up a ghost of a smile with luck we have had our entire lifetimes foolery from this oh i hope so she replied fervently but there is one other thing i think that one he nodded after the departed firesong brings trouble with him as easily and purposefully as he brings baggage i think that no matter where he went he would leave unsuspecting folk in some kind of tangle and i do think that at some level he enjoys doing so but he prompted and she flushed again feeling her ears neck and cheeks burning elspeth found herself smiling a little the heat eased from her ears and neck and her stomach calmed no doubt about it she said wryly as her flush faded he would just revel in having the entire vale fussing over him the way the hertasi do i doubt hed be happy if he wasnt the center of attention oh and he would enjoy having us at odds over him as well darkwind replied make no mistake about it he is aptly named i suspect he leaves lovers strewn in his wake like old dead leaves he would take great pleasure in being the centerpiece of a quarrel only to turn about and mend it but he is too much the healing adept to allow that to happen now in a situation this important in a quieter time perhaps well he isnt going to get another chance from me she replied firmly let him go play his games with someone else she shook her head and realized that the muscles of her neck and shoulders were aching with tenseness look after all that i need a soak come with me he smiled and reached for her hand she met him halfway a good notion he replied clasping his warm hand around her cold one moments later they were side by side in the hot pool below her ekele she sighed as the heat and her own deliberate attempt to relax her muscles took effect easing the stiffness and some of the pain it was very dark under the tree and neither of them put up a magelight to illuminate the shadows he was a silent presence in the water beside her not touching her but there nevertheless above them the everpresent breezes of the vale stirred the leaves of the tree somewhere in the distance a bird sang for a moment then fell silent or perhaps it was someone playing a flute darkwind lifted a hand out of the water and the sound of drops falling from it to the pool seemed very loud elspeth emptied her mind and let it drift full of nothing but the sounds around her do you think he meant that darkwind said finally do i think who meant what she asked lazily firesong do you think he meant what he said about darkwind hesitated about me why she asked fiercely because if you plan on taking him up on itshe sought desperately for the most absurd thing she could say ill scratch his big blue eyes out darkwind laughed and she let relief wash over her again no i do not plan on taking him up on it good she replied because in a catfight id win i believe you would he said lazily thats because id cheat she continued i know you would he chuckled then she reached toward him and found his hand catching hers pulling her toward him she decided not to fight and let her body drift to his you would do that for me he asked fight cheat well fight anyway id only cheat if it was firesong because hed already be cheating he put his arm around her and suddenly it was good just to rest her head on his chest and listen to the night he probably would he took one or two deep breaths i do not think that you need to worry about firesong however another breath or shall i show you that so that you truly believe me please she said surprising herself then he surprised her darkwind held elspeths hand facing iceshadow and nightjewel across the circle the stone standing ominously in the middle halfobscuring the other couple to the right treyvan and hydona faced the crazed surface of the stone with no sign of trepidation to the left starblade and kethra stood hand in hand in a peculiar echo of darkwind and elspeths own pose in the middle of their carefully constructed circle was the stone it showed its damage now and not just to the inner eye trails of sullen red light crawled over its surface strange little paths of lightning in miniature every line that could be severed from it had been and had been reattached to the node beneath the gryphons lair that had taken a full day with a working team of the gryphons elspeth and himselfand firesong and need he had been surprised when firesong appeared with the blade in hand he was amazed when the adept actually used needs powers the two couples had held a warding about the circle as the adept and the blade together severed all but two of the remaining leylines and relocated them to the node beneath the lair firesong was not inclined to explain how he could use magics so openly feminine and need held her peace when darkwind questioned the adept elspeth was just as astonished it was nyara herself who had provided the answer with an odd shyness when he asked her he is balanced she had told darkwind he is completely balanced between his masculine and feminine sides so even as he can use mans magic he can also use womans magic magic keyed only to females such as what need holds he had asked she had nodded and since she is willing to do so she can feed her power through his feminine side she would not be able to do that were he not so balanced so although nyara did not have the magestrength to enter the circle and wield the blade effectively in this case need was there anyway and lending her power to the isolating of the stone falconsbane thank the gods remained quiet during that day and during the day that it took for firesongalone completely unaidedto create the protogate from the stones remaining power he would permit no one else within the shielded area it was too dangerous he said and something about his unusual grimness made darkwind believe him completely darkwind and elspeth took a patrol on the edge of the vale encountering nothing more dangerous than a lone wyrsa and returned to linger outside the shielded area waiting for firesong to emerge that was when he finally realized just what it meant to be a mage as powerful as firesong what it meant to be a healing adept in terms of personal cost as the sun set firesong staggered across the invisible passthrough at the boundary and fell into their arms no longer the arrogant selfassured young peacock he was drained shaking drenched with sweat his very hair hung lankand limp with exhaustion he was hardly able to stand much less walk they held him up darkwinds heart in his throat until he told them in a hoarse voice that he was all right justtired he had croaked verytired i havecalled help the white dyheli that had brought him to the vale appeared at that moment as if conjured and darkwind helped the adept up onto the stags back at his direction my hertasi are waiting firesong had whispered from under a curtain of sweatsoaked hair i told them what to expect what i would require thank you for helping me shall i get some other help darkwind had asked uncertainly the curtain of hair had shaken a faint negative they know what to do it is their ancient function i shall be well enough in a day or so darkwind had nodded and stepped back letting the dyheli bear his burden away and firesong had been well enough in a day making a recovery that seemed little short of miraculous to anyone who had seen him the day before it seemed he had recovery skills as remarkable as his other skills darkwind and elspeth had taken another turn as border guardians with both of them expecting trouble from falconsbane at any moment but no trouble came nothing more than some odd glimpses of shadow riders who could have been little more than nerves and an overactive imagination certainly they left no traces on the fresh snow at the end of that day they had returned to find firesong waiting for them fully restored tomorrow he had said it must be tomorrow starblade and ethra are not as strong as i would like but nyara is afraid that with every passing day it becomes more likely that her father will strike again need agrees and i will not underestimate falconsbane again if i can help it i will go to instruct the gryphons this evening and we shall gather on the morrow darkwind still did not know exactly what passed between firesong and the gryphons but it must have been interesting hydona would surely have met his young arrogance with an arrogance of her own and treyvan would have deflated firesong with a few wellchosen comments nevertheless here they were calmly prepared to do what they must and in the center of the circle ready to strike when all was preparedfiresong and need the young adept looked carefully at each one of his chosen pairs meeting the eyes of each of them in turn darkwind brought his chin up and nodded in answer to that unspoken challenge and elspeth showed the ghost of a feral smile what firesong saw must have convinced him that they were ready for he nodded let us begin he said simply with no elaborate speeches there was no need for speeches after all they all knew what they were to do they had drilled together as much as they could if they were not ready now nothing anyone could say would make any difference darkwind already held elspeths physical hand now he held out a mental hand and felt her take it firmly but without clutching he let the power build between them for a moment then he bent his attention though not his eyes to the left where his father and kethra stood elspeth turned hers to the right he sensed kethra building the power between herself and starblade then having secured her ground she bent her attention to him and he held out another hand to her she took it fumbling a bit at first then her grip firmed it was the clasp of a warrior for all that she was a healer but a healer fights for the lives of her patients does she not as much a warrior as a bladesman kethra said lightly then she braced herself to make their bond as strong as possible on the right he sensed treyvan catching elspeths extended hand at that moment the circle trembled for a heartbeat until all the powers within it found their balance points male and female human and gryphon old and young earth air fire and water tayledras valdemaran shinain fartravelerthen the unexpected when the balance came it brought with it a sense of wholeness and astonished joy a lift to his spirits like nothing he had felt since the heartstone shattered he saw his surprise mirrored in kethras eyes felt it in the trembling of elspeths physical hand in his he wanted to shout to laugh to singthis was how magery should be this marvelous feeling of rightness movement at the center of the circle caught his attention and he looked up for a moment at firesong the young adept was smiling his eyes alightand somehow darkwind knew that the wholeness the joy came from him was this how firesong felt every time he worked magic no wonder it was effortless for him no wonder he was willing to exhaust himself drain himself to nothing if this was his reward somewhere in the back of his mind darkwind wondered if he would ever feel this way againknew he never wouldand at the same time knew there would always be a little of this whenever he worked a spell the touch of the healer adept had given that much to him the eight of them bound themselves ever closer with elspeth weaving their power around and about the circle until it was no longer a circle but a shell of energy as precise as a porcelain egg as strong as swordsteel firesong began to tap his foot he could not bring a drum into the circle for he could not use it and need at the same timebut standing just behind starblade and well within the danger area was nyara she caught firesongs rhythm and began to drum with a skill darkwind had not suspected of her darkwind picked up the rhythm within a few beats moving his legs and loosening up the others followed upon it the stamping of his feet was enough like a dance that his own magic gained in strength and where elspeths lightweaving gave their construct form his dancing gave it movement making it dance so that there were no weak places and no places holding still long enough to be weakened by an attack he closed his eyes and gave himself up to the rhythm sensing elspeth holding firm beside him sensing firesong waiting poised above the waiting stone choosing his momentthen he struck need rang as she impacted the heartstone pointfirst but instead of the shriek of agony that darkwind had expected there came a single belllike tone the sound filled the air and filled his soul carried all other sounds away drowning them and he sensed that they must contain it or it would ring through the vale and shatter everything in its path nyara threw herself into the drumming and though he could no longer hear it he felt it he threw all of his power and will into the effort of holdingholdingholding until he thought he must fall he felt himself faltering felt the circle faltering he steeled himself and poured more energy in he sensed a change in the tone it was weakening fading away that gave him his second wind and the strength to keep his place to keep the power contained as it faded so did his strength but always just a little behind the tone so that his ability to keep it contained was just enough to do so finally it was gone faded into an echo then into nothing he opened his eyes swaying on his feet and looked around firesong leaned heavily on the blade which was buried to the hilt in a pile of uneven dullgray shards starblade leaned on kethras shoulder and even as he watched iceshadow and nightjewel sank to the ground together even the gryphons heads were hanging down with weariness but when treyvan finally raised his head with an effort and looked into darkwinds eyes darkwind saw satisfaction and triumph that mirrored his own there brothers came the weary voice from the center of the circle sisters we have succeeded damn if we havent need said and even the sword sounded exhausted damn if we havent firesong stood erect again pulling himself up with an effort and with a single gesture banished the circle of power beyond them that had contained the rogue stone for so long he shared that power among them equally giving them all the strength to stand firmly again not much more than that but at least they were no longer about to drop darkwind did not need to close his eyes to sense the burning lens of power that had been the stone and was now the protogate it hovered between this world and the world of gates and leylines affected by bothyet no longer the malignant nearsentient thing it had been now it was only power and now that the shields were down the gryphons were able to draw safely on the clean power of their own node they lost their weariness legs straightening wings refolding with a snap heads coming up nyara entered the former circle quietly and firesong handed need back to her with a little bow of courtesy before he turned back to the gryphons well he said his voice already stronger as he shared the power they were drawing from the node they had made their own and are you ready for the first stage of the move lead on featherrlessss one treyvan said cocking his head sideways and congratulationssss that wasss well done firesong had that arrogant little smile back but this time darkwind was not going to fault him for it this had been the most brilliant innovative piece of magic he had ever seenand he suspected was ever likely to see thank you firesong replied with no show of humility at all false or otherwise that was the hardest part the rest though it will be tedious will be much easier hmm yesss perrhapsss it isss not wissse to count the eyassess until they arrre fledged hydona roused her feathers with a shake so much like vree that darkwind chuckled despite his weariness ssstill sssoonesst begun isss sssoonessst done let usss deal with thisss prrrotogate of yoursss before it getsss the notion to wanderrr on itsss own as the rest of them gathered themselves up and headed for the council oak where the hertasi had assembled food and drink darkwind sighed with relief and squeezed elspeths hand the worst indeed was over no matter what else happened falconsbane would not be able to destroy the vale and stone together so for now at least they were safe or as safe as they were likely to get with falconsbane still out there still plotting still watching still falconsbane a terrible and implacable foe chapter twentyone the black riders there was a peculiar feeling to the featherless fools vale today falconsbane could not quite put his finger on what it was but he sensed that they had redoubled their shielding on the stone again they had also reduced the number of lines on the stone to a bare two but those were the most powerful of all it would not have been possible to sever either of themno matter how good that adept thought he was he smiled to himself fingering the tiny carved horsewhich was not onyx nor obsidian nor any other stone he knew it could not be chipped nor marred in any way at all no matter what he did to it it should have been fragile he had even ordered one of his artisans to strike it with a stone sledgehammer when nothing he had done had affected it in any way it had chipped the hammer obviously it was anything but fragile a puzzle like those who had sent it one he did not have time for as matters stood he needed to concentrate on his plan for ksheyna a plan that required patience and vigilance but would pay for that patience handsomely the bird lovers could put all the shields they wanted to on that stone of theirs they still wouldnt be able to save it and the moment they dropped the shielding he would be waiting he would not fail a second time let them only drop the shield he had been waiting for days now buried in his study gathering his strength preparing a single lightning strike that would overwhelm starblade burn away his mind and burn through him to the stone it was a new sort of action for himand thus he thought it would be unexpected and unanticipated there would be no testing no struggling of wills just one single quick clean blow spending all of his power in that strike and holding none in reserve a reckless kind of action audacious starblade would flare up like a stick of dry kindling and a moment later his home would follow adept and all it was not the end he would have chosen for starblade or his followers but it would at least be revenge only let them drop the shieldhe watched as patient as a cat at a mousehole as a lion above a salt lick knowing that to reestablish those lines they would have to drop the shieldto use the power of the node in the ruins to try to heal the stone they would have to drop the shield sooner or later it would have to come down there was not enough untainted power within the vale to even begin to heal the stone assuming it could be healed he didnt think that was possible he had hundreds of years of magecraft behind him and he would not have cared to try it he had caught his attention wandering for a moment and had redoubled his vigilance when a trembling of the shields alerted him to changes within the vale light he fell back onto his couch with a cry of pain squeezing his watering eyes shut holding his ears in a futile reaction to the blinding wall of light and sound that assaulted his sight and hearing if he had not been watching the vale and the emanations of the stone within it he might have missed the death of the stone itself if he had been concentrating on something in the material world he would never have noticed what had happened for the only effect was in the nonmaterial plane but since he was and looking right at it with all of his powersfor a moment it blinded his inner eye when it exploded in light and sound a lesser mage would have been struck unconscious and possibly come away with his senses damaged it did send him grayingout for a moment and fighting his way back to consciousness that was all that was possible to hold tightly to reality and claw his way backhe couldnt think couldnt do anything else when he came back to himself the stone was gone he could only sit and blink in dumbfounded shock at first he simply could not believe what had happened it made no sense it was simply not in the tayledras to have done such a thing he thought for a moment that he had been headblinded that his senses had failed him then shock gave way to anger all his plansdestroyed in a single moment how could he have so completely misjudged them they should have tried to save their stone not destroy it this was something those suicidal shinain might have tried but never the tayledras he shook his head growling in bafflement and increasing rage his head pounded with reactionpain his temples throbbed and a sharp hot jabbing at the base of his skull warned him that he was overstressing himself the pain only increased his anger how could they have done something so completely unexpected so entirely out of character more than that how had they accomplished it without destroying the vale as he had intended to do his inner eyes were still dazzled his outer eyes streamed burning tears in reaction but he strained his sight toward the vale anyway hoping for a glimpse of something that might give him a clue as to how this unknown adept had worked the impossible then as the dazzle cleared under the pressure of his will he got more than a clue far more hanging in the betweenworld where gates and leylines were born was a lenticular form of pure shining power it occupied the same notspace that the stone had takenor rather that the power the stone contained had taken for a long stunned moment he simply stared at it wondering where it had come from and what it was it didnt resemble anything that had been in or near the vale before it didnt resemble anything he had ever seen before for that matter and how had it gotten where the powerform of the stone had been how had those two leylines gotten attached to it he had never seen lines running to anything but nodes or stones before he realized at that moment that it was the stoneor rather it was what had taken the place of the stone whatever that adept had done to the stone destroying it had purified the power and allowed him to give it a new shape there were only the two lines leading into it and it was no longer anything he could use or controlor even touch directly it had become something that answered to one hand only an that hand was not his power with monofocused purpose and linked t a particular personality in fact it was very like a gate except that there could not be more than a handful of adepts great enough to create a gate with power tha was not their own he nearly rejected that identification out of hand even the birdfool would not be so foolhardy as to make a gate within a node much les within a stone and why create a gate with so much power in the firs place you couldnt use it anything passing through a gate like tha stood a betterthaneven chance of winding up annihilated but this was not a gate exactly it was something like a gate something that could become a gate with more shaping but it was not in and of itself a gate in fact the more he examined it the less like a gate it became there was no terminus it was entirely selfcontained there was no structure that it was linked to it was linked to the half world a kind of gate doubled back upon itself that in fact was what gave it all the stability it had it was more like one of the little seeking tendrils of power a gate would spin out trying to reach its terminus as he thought that he saw it move a little watched it as it swung slightly to the west and north seeking somethingthen he understood it was seeking something and that was why it had been made along the pattern of a gate it was seeking the empty vessel that should have held it the physical container that had been made by the same hands that had shaped its old vessel the new stone in the new vale unbelievable incredible something he would never have thought of doing had he been in the same position for a moment he could only blink at the astonishing audacity of it all bold recklessnot only brilliant but innovative a worthy foe not another urtho of course but he was no longer maar if he were going to be honest with himselfwhich he tried to avoidhe would have to admit that another urtho would not find him much of a challenge these days or would he they would both find themselves dealing with limited power with magic that followed another set of laws twisted by the end of their own warring pah i am woolgathering no wonder the infant stole a march on me infant noyoung but no infant old in cunning and in skillyouthful only in years i wonder is he as beautiful as the rest of the bird lovers i have seen for another moment he was overcome by a feeling of complete and overpowering lust and not just for the powerbut for the one who had created and conceived this plan what would it be like to have such a one under his control subject to his whims and fancies placing his abilities at mornelithes call what would it be like to be under the control of such a one he shook the thoughts away angrily ridiculous these bird lovers were winning he could not permit that surely there was something he could do to wrench control of the thing out of their hands wait go at it backward what would he do if he had it what would it mean it would attract lines to itself set in a neutral place it would soon be the center of a web of lines as complete and complex as the old stone had owned if i had this powerlocus i would have control of the entire energyweb of this area i could pull all the lines to myself without effort like a spider whose net spins itself it would be like my present network of traps and wards but with such power to taphis thumb caressed the tiny horse as he chewed his lip his mind running in furious thought then the image of the spider in the web came to him again and with it an idea so little mage we are going to try new magics are we he smiled and his smile turned vicious two can play that game there was a time when i anchored a permanent gate upon myself after all that had been far far back in the past before the soclever hawkbrothers had ever stretched their wings over this area when it had been his and he had fought to possess it against what seemed to be an endless supply of upstarts he had been younger then and willing to try things no one thought possible for he had already sired a dozen children on as many mothers human and changechild and he was secure in the continuance of his bloodline and so long as there was someone with direct descent and magegifts alive he was immortal wild chances had been worth the risk no one had ever tried to shift the focus of a permanent gate from a place to a person his advisors said it could not be done that the power would destroy the person and yet in the end the temporary gates were all partially anchored in a person for the energy to create them came from that person he had thought it worth trying permanent gates had their own little webs of leylines and acted much like small nodesthat was before he had learned of the hawkbrains and their heartstones and had learned to lust after real power it had seemed a reasonable thing to try to make himself the center of a web of that kind of power so he had researched the magics then added himself and his own energystores to the permanent gate in his stronghold he had truly been like a spider in a web then for whatever he wished eventually came to him falling into his threads of power there had been a price to paya small one he thought after that he had been unable to travel more than a league from his home for his fragile body was not able to bear the stress of physical separation for long on the other hand he had only to will himself home and the gate pulled him through itself without needing another terminus to step through his innovation had worked and then as now being homebound had been a small price to pay for control of all the mageenergy as far as he could see he studied the situation carefully alert for any pitfalls the most obvious was that the moment he touched the powerlocus his enemies would know what he was doing the adept was guiding it himself with help from some other mages how maddening to be able to see all of this and yet be unable to act on it so he would have to be subtle well there were more ways of controlling the direction of the powerlocus than by steering the thing itself there were two lines on it still and they could be used to bring it closer to him carefully he touched the line nearer himself and pulled slowly gradually changing the direction the powerlocus was taking no one seemed to notice falconsbanes smile turned to a feral grin the hunt was up but the quarry did not yet know that the beast was on its trail like all good hunters he needed to rest from time to time falconsbane had pulled the powerlocus as far out of line as he cared to for the moment he had left his servants to themselves for a long while perhaps too long they needed to be reminded of his power over them there were preparations he needed to make here before he would be ready to make the gate a part of himself and his stronghold and before he undertook any of those preparations or even interfered any more with the powerlocus he needed to rest eat refresh himself he left his study and only then noticed that the air in his manor was thick with the heavy smell of incense and lamp oil of rooms closed up too long and people sweating with fear he shook his head at the dank taint of it in the back of his throat before he got anything to eat or drink he needed a breath of fresher air he turned around and was on his way to the top of his tower when every blockedup and shuttered door and window in his stronghold suddenly flew open with an earshattering crash glass splintered and tinkled to the floor sunlight streamed in the windows and a sudden shocked silence descended for a single heartbeat then with a wild howl a violent wind tore through his fortress it came from everywhere and nowhere tearing curtains from their poles sending papers flying knocking over furniture putting out fires in all the fireplaces scattering ashes to the farthest corners of the rooms it raced down the hallway toward him whipping his hair and clothing into tangles driving dust into his eyes so that he yelped with the unexpected pain then before he could react any further than that it was gone leaving only silence chill and the taste of snow behind that wild wind signaled the beginning of a series of inexplicable incidents they invariably occurred at the least opportune moment and they made no sense followed no pattern they sometimes looked like attacksyet did nothing substantial in the way of harm they sometimes looked as if someone very powerful was courting himyet no one appeared to follow through on the invitation every time he set himself to work on pulling the powerlocus nearer one of those incidents would distract him the single window in his study was open to the sky since that wind had shattered both shutter and glass a bloodred firebirdor something that looked like oneflew into his study window and dropped a black rose at his feet it left the same way it had come and vanished into the sky before he could do anything about it a troop of black riders kept one of his messengers from reaching him herding the man with no weapon but fear running him until his horse foundered then chasing him afoot until he was exhausted then they left him lying in the snow for falconsbanes patrols to find by then it was too late the man barely had a chance to gasp out what had happened to him before he died of heart failure his message unspoken all of the broken glass in the windows of his stronghold was replaced somehow in a single hourbut not by clear glass by bloodred glass shading the entire fortress in sanguine gloom he liked the effect but his servants kept lighting lanterns to try and dispel it a little every root vegetable in the storage cellar sprouted overnight growing long pallid roots and stems the onions even blossomed his cook had hysterics and collapsed thinking mornelithe would blame him two hundred lengths of black velvet appeared in the forecourt cut to capelength all of the wine turned to vinegar and all of the beer burst its kegs leaving the liquor cellar a stinking sodden mess another black rider waylaid the cooks helper sent to requisition new stores and forced him to follow there were wagonloads of wine and beerbarrels of sacks of roots all in the middle of a pristine untouched snowcovered clearing with no footprints or hoofprints anywhere about and no sign of how all those provisions had gotten there all of the weather vanes were replaced overnight with new ones the old weather vanes had featured the former owners arms these featured black iron horses a huge flock of blackbirds and starlings descended on the castle for half a day leaving everything covered with whitewash something invisible got into the stable in broad daylight opened all the stalls and paddock gates and spooked the horses it took three days to find them all when the last horsefalconsbanes own mount on the few occasions he chose to ridewas found it was wearing a magnificent new handtooled black saddle black barding black tack and in the saddlebag was a scrying crystal double the size and clarity of the one he had shattered in a fit of pique he paced the length of his redlit study trying to make some sense of the senseless it was driving him to distraction for even those acts that could be interpreted as attacks could have been part of a courting pattern he had done similar things in the pastsent a gift then done something that said see how powerful i am i can best you in your own home the courting of magetomage was sometimes an odd thing as full of anger as desire as full of hate as lust but if it was courting who was doing it it couldnt be shinain for they avoided all forms of magic it couldnt be tayledras they hated him as much as he hated them who was it then he thought he had eliminated any possible rivals and only rivals would think to court him he stopped stark still as a thought occurred to him there had been a time when he had fostered the illusion that the mage the outlanders were so afraid of had been seeking to ally with him what if he was the one behind all this it would make senseblack riders to send against white onesblack horses instead of the guardian spirits now that he thought about it the idea made more and more sensehe called a servant who appeared promptly but showing less fear than usual he had not blamed any of his servants for the bizarre events that had been occurring lately and that had given them some relief besides he had been getting tired of the smell of fear in his halls why he hadnt even killed a slave in daysi want you to find dhashel toron flecker and quorn he told the servant these are their orders simple ones there is a land to the north and east hardorn its king is one ancar he is a mage he is also the sworn enemy of the two outlanders with the ksheyna and at war with their land of valdemar this much i know i desire to know more much more he blinked slowly and fixed the servant with his gaze do you understand all of that the servant nodded and repeated the orders wordforword falconsbane was pleased he would remember never to kill or maim this one good service deserved reward after all now go and tell them to hurry he said turning back to the couch and his new scrying crystal i am eager to hear what they can learn darkwind rose unsteadily to his feet as iceshadow tapped his shoulder in the signal that meant iceshadow was there to relieve him he staggered out of the former stone clearing and up the path toward the ekele shared by nyara and skif he was tired but this couldnt wait something or someone was diverting the path of the protogate every moment spent in rapport with firesong moving the protogate toward the new vale was a moment spent in constant battle to keep the powerpoint on the right course they couldnt be sure who was doing it of course but for darkwind falconsbane was high on the list it was possible to anchor the protogate temporarily thank the gods or they would all have been worn away to nothing for what they had hoped would take only hours was taking days firesong especially was under stress since the protogate was linked to him personally he had to be the one in charge of directing its path although the hertasi swarmed over him bringing him virtually everything he needed there was one thing they could not give him and that was rest but since they had learned that the protogate could be anchored his helpers only needed to work in fourcandlemark shifts and he himself needed only to work for eight darkwind had been very dubious about the wisdom of leaving the protogate unguarded but they really had no choice firesong would be helped into bed at the end of the day and sleep solidly until it was time to work again so he had held his peace and had hoped that there was no way to interfere with the energypoint without firesong knowing and once the protogate was anchored for the night it actually seemed that either there was something protecting it or falconsbane had not found a way to move it he paused for a moment as that thought triggered a memory protecting ithe shook his head and continued on his way had he seen what he thought hed seen this morning when he and firesong and elspeth took the first shift together had there been two shining brightwinged vorcelhawks flitting away silently through the gray mist of the notworld and had they a moment before been standing guard over the protogate in the end it didnt matterexcept perhaps to firesong if the adept knew that trevalen had survived in some form he would be much comforted although firesong hid most of his deeper feelings beneath a cloak of arrogance and flippancy darkwind was better at reading him now the young shamans death still grieved him then again it could have been a trick of the notworld a place where illusions were as substantial as reality where nothing was to be trusted until you had tested it yourself it could even have been a specter of his own halfformed hopes there was no denying the fact that someone was trying to steal the protogate however and darkwind was going to assume that it was falconsbane until he learned otherwise that meant that some of the nebulous plans the war council had discussed before and after the destruction of the heartstone were going to have to be put into motion darkwind was not certain what falconsbane intended to do with the protogate or where he planned to anchor it for that matter presumably on something like a heartstone somewhere deep in his own stronghold if he did that it would give him access to something that had the potential to become a full permanent gate if he knew how to effect the rest of the spell that is firesong did or at least darkwind suspected he did not too many did except for healing adeptsand not many of those no one had had the secret in ksheyna for as long as darkwind had been alive but even if falconsbane didnt know the trick having the protogate in his control would give him access to a great deal of power nor was that all unless firesong freed himself first access to the protogate meant access to the adept darkwind did not want to see firesongor anyone else for that matterin falconsbanes hands firesong might be able to defeat mornelithe in a headtohead battle he might be able to hold falconsbane off long enough for someone to help to free him darkwind was not prepared to bet on either of those possibilities dealing with falconsbane had taught him this it was much safer to overestimate the beast he could take over firesong the way he took my father and have the power of a healing adept to pervert with thathe could undo anything any vale has accomplished horrible thought if he had a permanent gate he could bypass our shields and send his creatures straight into the mouth of the vale at no cost to himself that was another unpleasant scenario so it was time to consult nyara who alone of all of them was an expert on her father nyara had always liked darkwind now with the pressures of her body and of her father reduced or gone altogether she had discovered it was possible to simply be his friend over the past few days she had found him to be kind courteousand oddly protective determined to keep his people from snubbing her or making her feel uncomfortable that was not to be expected particularly not with the pressures that were on him now she and skif were actually working on sword practice although need had been putting her through exercises this was the first time she had ever had an opponent to practice with she welcomed the physical activity as a release from direct thinking she did not want to consider what she would do when the time came that they both must leave the vale she wanted to go with him but at the same time she was afraid to it was much easier to lose herself in the hypnotic dance of steel and footwork darkwind must have been standing at the edge of the practice circle for some time before she and skif realized he was there she spotted him first and signaled a halt only then did he enter the circle you two look very good he said quietly i hated to interrupt you but i think were going to have to figure out exactly where your ffalconsbane is after all she wiped sweat from her forehead with her sleeve and nodded did you find those maps you were talking about strange not so long ago even thinking of her father brought her to the verge of hysteria nowwell she was afraid only a fool would not fear falconsbane but she could face that fear in my ekele darkwind replied with a nod could you even by vale standards together he and in maps out of their leather cases kap mere interest they ad first encountered as she puzzled her ointing to an otherwise oi e not had much training d apologetically but i fortress to be rolled up the thick sheets aj i te is being pulled so that jo he said and it confirms vol worit cc j k protok qni b in the u i nknew that i comforted aq cloak of arrogai now the young then again it cot illusions were as subst my guess as to who is behind this firesong is trying to secondguess our wouldbe gatethief but i dont think at this point that there could be much doubt about motivation if its falconsbane then there is only one real answer he wants what hes always wanted power the protogate would be irresistible to him nyara agreed then widened her eyes as something occurred to her you knowit is rather odd but he becomes more predictable under stress had you noted that i do not know why but it is true i have seen this over and over again when i was still with him the more he is forced to react to the surprises sprung upon him by others the more likely he is to act as he has always acted and think it is a clever new plan darkwind nodded as if what she had just told him confirmed something he had thought himself what do you think hes planning on doing with the protogate when he captures it oh he will install it in his stronghold she said immediately with no effort at all she could picture him gloating over his newwon prize as he had gloated over so many in the past that is predictable too probably in his study he is jealous of his things of power and often will not put them where other mages may even see them he will want such a thing as near to him as may be that would be a bad place to put a gate darkwind observed a gate works both ways no i suspect he will try to anchor it in a stone or crystal of some kind rather than as a gate she said trying to remember if falconsbane had ever indicated that he knew how to make the greater gates i am not sure i believe he knows how to make a gate but has not the strength i think he would rather create something to use as a powerpole to bring in more lines if he can what use it to create his own kind of heartstone darkwind asked in surprise and was even more surprised when she nodded make a heartstone like a hawkbrother it seems amazing that he should imitate you she told him earnestly but he has seen your success he is not good at creating things he is good at twisting them to his own ends or warping them to suit his fancies but not at creating them he will imitate you therefore and tell himself that he is making something entirely new so whatever he tries is going to have a focus darkwind mused the personal link will have to be taken from firesong of coursebut if he has to have a focus he has to have something physical focus his ideal choice would be something shaped the way the protogate looks in the halfworld and we can attack that what are you thinking of skif asked sounding just a little belligerent and definitely protective darkwind looked up at the tall herald and shook his head you are not going to care for my notions he said no you are not going to like them at all probably not skif agreed on the other hand i dont like the idea of falconsbane with all that power nor do i darkwind turned back to nyara before i broach any ideas theres something i really need to know both from you and from your friend in the sheath he nodded at need do you think you can hold out against your fathers control now i mean in a facetoface confrontation can you hold against his will good question boy my vote is yesbut she wont unless she believes she can nyara looked deeply and carefully into his eyes i think so she replied after a long moment of thought i know that i can for some time if we are not near one another i think that i can if we are not in physical contact if he had me in his hands she shrugged trying to hide her fear but darkwind saw it and sympathized with it anyway i would have no chance with him if i were in his hands but the old means by which he controlled me no longer work he tried upon me what he perfected upon your father because none of this was perfected there were places where need and i could break what he had done to me he would have to work magicperhaps even cast actual spellsto get new controls on me and just at the moment he might not realize that part of the way he reacts in a typical fashion when he feels himself under pressure darkwind asked she nodded especially if he were distracted or busy she told him the more distractions he has the more likely he is to revert to what has worked in the past absolutely need agreed half the reason i was able to help her so much was because i was watching kethra heal your father his problems are a superior copy of hers weve thrown falconsbane offbalance by destroying the heartstone and hes reacting predictably by trying to steal the power it harbored there are a dozen other things he could do with it or about it but instead hes doing exactly what i would have predicted for him i could prolong the moment that he thinks he still has me controlled by feigning it nyara offered trembling a little inside from fear need might be able to help with that nyara watched darkwind turn all that over in his mindand she wondered one plan with a fair likelihood of success had already occurred to her she wondered if he was thinking the same thing that she was she had been thinking about something like this for some timefearing the idea yet knowing it had logic to it and knowing that if she were asked she would follow through with it skif was most definitely not going to like it chapter twentytwo falconsbane stepped back and surveyed his work nodding with satisfaction he had done very well given the short notice hed had and it had been at minimal cost to himself there were after all two ways to create powerpoles the first way was to produce the power from yourself much in the same way that a gate was created that was not the ideal way to proceed so far as he was concerned the other way was to induce it from the body of anotheras skilled and powerful a mage as one could subdue the drawing out of the power would kill the mage in question of course there was no way to avoid that a pity but there it was then given the plan he had created one needed to fix the pole in placethat required another mage fixing the pole absolutely required the life of that mage this time by sacrifice although falconsbane had managed to crush the mans heart with no outward signs and no blood spilt it would have been a pity to stain the new carpets and lastly in accordance with the plan he had needed the full power of a human life and the full power of a mage to establish a web of energy linking the powerpole he had created with every possible point in his territory naturally that had required a third mage it was possible to do all of that from his own resources but that would have required exhausting himself completely that wasnt acceptable at this point doing it through others was far less efficient it took three mages to create what he could have accomplished alone the problem with the second method was of course that the mages in question would not survive the operation which was why the bodies of three of falconsbanes former servants were littering the floor of his study if he had more time he probably would have done it the hard way through himself it was difficult finding even ordinary servants mages were doubly hard to acquire he had thought long and hard on the best way to go about claiming the powerlocus he had not been aided by all the distractions taking place in and around his lands the black riders were everywhere and although they seldom did anything they rattled his guards and made even his fortress servants nervous strange birds had been seen in the forest around his stronghold and now the woods were reputedly haunted as well by amorphous ghostlike shapes and faint dancing lights he had decided at last to set up a powerpole as exactly like the waiting stone as possible and anchor that within an enormous crystalcluster he had brought from one of his storage rooms and set up in his study when he drew the powerlocus in near enough it would snap into the powerpole as it had been intended to do at the birdfools new heartstone devising the plan had taken much delving into his oldest memories and he had been a little disturbed at how much he had forgotten too many times for comfort hed been forced to return to his library and search through his oldest books in the end hed taken scraps of memory scraps of old knowledge and a great deal of guessing the difference between what he intended to do and what the tayledras would have done was that when it snapped into the waiting vessel here he would be standing between and would be linked to the crystal when the powerlocus and the powerpole merged into one he would be part of them as well it was as inventive in its way as anything that tayledras adept had tried he was quite certain of that he was thoroughly pleased with his own cleverness oh it was dangerous surely the mages who had been sacrificed to give the plan life had advised against it even before they knew they were going to be sucked dry of life and power to fuel it youll be incinerated by that much power atus had protested if you arent incinerated youll go mad no one can be part of a heartstone renthan had told him preadeth had only shaken his head wordlessly and cast significant looks at the others they thought he was insane even to try itand at that moment when he caught them exchanging glances and possibly thoughts he had known who his sacrificial calves were going to be they had doubtless been considering revoltor at least escape escape would mean they might even consider going to the tayledras with what they knew it was just as well he had another use for them it would have been a pity to kill them outright and waste all that potential using his subordinates to supply the power instead of himself was the last element he had needed to make the plan reasonable as well as possible it meant that at the end of the working he was still standing and still capable of acting instead of unconscious and needing days of rest even at that he was exhausted when he was done he sank down on his couch and considered calling in a fourth man and draining him as well but discarded the idea it would cause enough trouble that he had killed three of his underlings there were those who might read it as a desperation measure it was on the whole a bad idea to kill anyone other than a slave or one of the lower servants it made everyone else unhappyand inclined to think about defection unhappy servants were inefficient servants they should know the taste of the whipbut also know that it was only there in extreme circumstances and that they could bring that whip onto their own backs by their own actions he lay back on the soft black velvet of the couch and considered his next few moves firstfind a reason for the deaths of his underlings that would disturb the others the least the mages in particular were a touchy lot they tended to think of themselves as allies rather than underlings they were given to occasional minor revolt it would not do to give them a reason for one of those revoltsnot now when he could illafford the energy to subdue them should he claim they had died aiding him in some great work that was a little too close to the truth and the next time he called for help in magicworking he might trigger one of those mass defections he did not as a rule lose even one of his assistants much less three of them the mages werent stupid they might well guess that aiding in a great work meant becoming a sacrifice to it the deep red light flooding in from the window was very soothing to his eyes and eased the pain at his temples pain caused by nothing more than overstressing himself both temples throbbed there was a place at the base of his skull that felt as if someone was pressing a dull dagger into it and sharp stabbing pains over each eye whenever he moved his head too quickly hard to think when one was in painbut he must think of a way to explain those bodies he wished he could simply burn them to ash and pretend that he did not know where they had gone but that might only make the others think their colleagues had run off and if those three had done so there might be a good reason for the others to follow their example complications complications everything he did was so complicated not like the old days when he didnt have to justify himself to anyone when he only had to issue orders and know he would be obeyed the cowards if they hadnt been quite so quick to think of conspiring against him he might not haveah that was the answer he would have the bodies dragged from his study and hung from the exterior walls in cages as traitors were that would be enough the rest of his underlings should assume that the three had attempted to overcome him and had fallen in the attempt a good explanation for why he was so weary he would not even have to say anything himself just look angry no one would dare ask him the rumors would fly but there was no reason for anyone to guess the truth he rang for a servant and feigning greater strength than he had contorted his face into a mask of suppressed rage and ordered the bodies taken away and displayed in the cages then he called for stimulants food and drink as he always did after a battle sometimes habits were useful things when he demanded rare meat red wine and kephira with a bodyslave to be waiting in his bed the servants all assumed that a fight had aroused his blood and his lust the servant left and came back with several more falconsbane ignored them as they carried the bodies away lying back on his couch and staring at the shadowshrouded ceiling he often did that after a battle of magic too when the servant returned at last with the food and drink he had been sent for he told the man in a flat expressionless voice to set it down and take himself out he did his best to look angry and not tired the illusion was what mattered right now if i were not so pressed i would manipulate their minds to reinforce the tale that is spreading he thought slowly mustering the strength to reach for a cup of drugged wine perhaps i should do so anyway but at that moment there came a hesitant tap at the door he started and cursed his own jangled nerves then growled yes what is it if its nonsense ill kill him if its a defection ill set the wyrsa on the fool who ran and see if he can outrun and outlast a pack of forty sire came the timid voice of the servant muffled by the door i beg your pardon for disturbing you but im following your orders you said to let you know immediately if one of those riders he sat up abruptly exhaustion and pain completely forgotten the riders open the damned door you fool what about the riders the servant edged the door open nervously he peered inside then slid into the room with one eye on his escape route there was a small box in his hand a small box carved of shining black wood falconsbanes eyes went to it as if drawn there he stood up and strode over to the man and stood towering over him his hands twitching at his sides sire one of the riders came right up to the gate just as they weretaking out the man gulped his face pasty white and falconsbane repressed the urge to strangle him he simply tried to ease some of the anger out of his face so that the servant would be able to continue go on he said more gently than he wanted to he cursed his own weakness if he had been stronger he could have seized the mans mind and pulled what he wanted right out of it the rider came up and tossed this to the guard captain sire the servant continued after visibly trying to calm himself thenhe was just gone the guard captain brought this straight to me like you ordered by just gone do you mean that he rode away falconsbane asked carefully why didnt they call me or was there no time can those riders move that fast why isnt someone chasing them no sire i mean he was gone like smoke there and then not there the servant seemed convinced and there was no real reason for him to lie the guard captain said so said he was gone like hed been conjured and dispersed falconsbane pondered the box in his hand this was the first real evidence that the riders were the manifestations of magic was his unknown enemyor friendshowing his hand a little more they could not have gone through a gate he would have sensed that therefore they could only have been temporary conjurations given life and form only so long as the mage needed them or creatures from another plane minor demons perhaps those he might not be able to sense unless he was actually looking for them of the gifts that had been sent to him only one was magicaland it was useless he cast an eye at the lenticular scrying crystal as the servant waited nervously for his response and snorted a little scrying crystal indeed it was an excellent crystal the clarity was exceptional the lenticular form ideal for scrying the size quite perfect for a detailed image to form the problem was no matter how he bent his will upon it it would show only one thing the view of some remote mountain peak and halfway up the side of the mountain a strange and twisted castle that he did not recognize a snowstorm swirled about the castle when the crystal was moved he dismissed the servant and reached for the wine drinking it down in one gulp before he returned to his couch and contemplated the box like the other it was beautifully carved and about the same size there was no sign of magic anywhere about it like the other this one held something nestled in a nest of black velvet padding was a ring not just any ring eitherit held no stone and was not metal although it was an intricately carved or molded band like a wedding ring exactly like a wedding ring it was carved with the symbols of harvest wheatears and grapesexcept that this ring was made of a shining cool black substance he tried experimentally to break it but it was probably of the same stuff as the horse in this part of the world widows sometimes laid aside their wedding bands to wear a black band like this made of jet signifying mourning was he being warned but he had no spouse to mourn and the very last thing he would weep over was the death of his traitorous daughter his predilection for black was apparently well known to these ridersor whoever sent them there had been the rose the velvet the horse and now the ring and this would certainly gain his attention far quicker than a simple peasants gold or silver wedding band so was this an invitation to a weddingan alliance or a funeral i dont like this darkwind told firesong unhappily i only told you my plan because i hoped youd have another way of handling this something that wouldnt put anyone into danger like this even if it is my plan i dont like it he had intercepted firesong as soon as the adept had anchored the protogate for the night they had walked back to firesongs ekele together while darkwind laid bare his thoughts on falconsbane and what might be done about him to his dismay firesong had agreed completely nor do i care for your plan firesong replied wearily sagging back against the cushions of his couch i dislike sending nyara into peril of this sort she is a frail prop for all our hopesand yet there is a certain symmetry in it in sending her to avenge her own hurts upon her father darkwind snorted symmetry was not what i had in mind he said he would have gone farther than that but at that same moment nyara and skif arrived summoned by one of firesongs everpresent hertasi skif was unarmed as far as darkwind could see but nyara as always had need the sword at her side was so much a part of her that he couldnt imagine her without it he took a moment to examine her with the dispassionate eyes of a stranger and was a little surprised hed thought of nyara as small and slender maybe even spidery well perhaps she was compared to himself and to skif but she certainly carried her sword with authorityand from what hed seen she knew how to use it well and what skill she did not possess the sword could grant to her if elspeth was to be believed sit firesong said before the other two could say anything please we have somewhat we need to ask you he waved to one of the hovering hertasi who converged upon the two outlanders with food and drink they took seats nyara a little apprehensively skif reluctantly darkwind didnt blame them hed had the feeling that nyara knew what hed had in mind all along from the nebulous ideas that had formed when he asked her to locate falconsbanes stronghold to the crystallized plan that had sent him looking for firesong skif probably didnt know what was in darkwinds mind but if it required involving nyara he was going to be immediately suspicious ill come straight to the point darkwind said before we take this to a larger forum we need to know something from you he waited until they had settled a little then turned to the changechild nyara this afternoon i asked you to help me find your fathers stronghold on the map you thought you located approximately where it is correct she nodded slowly accepting a cup of tea from one of the hertasi it was very hard to read her face long ago she had probably learned how to control her expressions minutely and that was a habit that was hard to break he hated to ask this of her he hated to put her back where she might need that kind of control well this is a different question but related could you trace your way back to itand if you found it get into it skif yelped and started to rise she shook her head at him and placed one hand on his knee to calm him it didnt calm him a bit but he subsided looking sharply at both firesong and darkwind hmm interesting i thought he was unarmed but the way his right hand is tensinghe has a knife hidden somewhere near it if he had a choice he probably wouldnt be looking daggers at us hed be throwing them yes to both questions she replied steadily my problem with finding fathers hold upon your map was that i could not see the things i know as landmarks i have a perfect memory for trails it seems i never had occasion to use it before i escaped my father but it is very difficult for me to become lost i can easily find the stronghold she licked her lips showing the tips of her canine teeth then took a drink before continuing i can find itand having found it i know many of the odd ways into it he does not guard all of them for many are hidden some i was taught but some i found on my own yes but will he not know of them as well firesong asked gently i would not send you into a trap dear child candidly that would not serve either of us her lips curved in a faint smile i do not think there will be a trap since i am only interested in fleeing from himhe thinksi suspect that the last thing he would look for me to do is return the ways that i would take inside will be those that only i know or those that i think he will not bother to trap i can hide her some if thats your next question need said i can hold a reflective illusion on her the kind that makes her look like part of the landscape to magesight more importantly while im doing that i can hide myself as well watch at that instant need ceased to exist from the point of view of darkwinds magesight she was nothing more sinister to ordinary sight than an ordinary broadsword and to magesight she and nyara did not exist and skif sat alone on the couch then nyara was back all in an instant and the sword with her good very good firesong said leaning forward a bit his voice warm with approval well then you must know that we have a plan but theone in greatest danger will be you nyara that is a great burden to be placed upon you and no one will fault you if you say no she shook her head but not darkwind sensed in denial i have been partially to blame for much harm that has come to you she said i feel that i owe some recompense its not like shes going to do this alone need added dryly ive handled what falconsbane can throw before hmph maybe if he throws the right stuff at us this time i can transmute it and take off a little more of what he did to her i will not count upon that nyara told her blade and darkwind thought he detected a tone of friendly chiding in her voice i will not even think of it it serves little purpose after all if you can i shall be grateful but do not put yourself into jeopardy by an attempt need couldnt shrug but darkwind got the impression she had at any rate as nyara and skif can tell you i took on this form because there are times when one person can do what an army couldnt im no expert on falconsbane but i dont think the odds are any worse now than they were back when i froze myself into this blade darkwind looked at skif who growled but shrugged shes her own woman he replied unhappily if i tried to make her change her mind i wouldnt be doing either of us any good she wants to go through with thisill do what i can to help darkwind raised an eyebrow skeptically skif grimaced i dont like it he admitted im scared to death for her and if i could take her place i would i wont pretend otherwise but lets just say i learned how stupid it is to try and stop someone from doing something they have to do its even more stupid if you care about them darkwind read the look skif gave both of them however if nyara came to any harm at all skif would personally collect the damages due more than good firesong applauded well then if nyara is agreed i think it is time that we took the idea to the rest we will discover if anyone can knock holes in this planor make it safer in any way the gathering in the council oak clearing held only part of the usual gathering both gryphons nyara skif firesong wintermoon the companions elspethand darkwind himself no other mages this would not be a plan that required more mages than they had right here starblade and kethra were back to recovering iceshadow and nightjewel were conserving their strength and they added no more fighters than skif and wintermoon either as need had said there were times when oneor a handfulcould do what an army could not firesong had lost a great deal of his jauntiness in the past few days and he had put aside his elaborate costumes in favor of simple flowing clothing like any other mage wore he could hardly hide the flamboyant bondbird that perched on his shoulder but other than that and his incredible beauty there was nothing that set him apart from the other mages in ksheyna here is the situation as it stands firesong began using a handful of stones and a bit of string he began laying out something that looked rather like a very simple spiderweb if i had been looking for this earlier i might have seen it being builtbut it has the feeling of something assembled with haste and we may be able to take advantage of that what is it darkwind was baffled i assume falconsbane has something to do with this whatever it is firesong flushed the first time darkwind had ever seen him truly embarrassed pardon i forgot that none of you have been working with me upon this the enemy wants to capture the protogate to that end he has constructed this web of powerpoints and interconnecting lines about his stronghold if you look in the direction of his stronghold with farsight and magesight you will see it treyvan examined the model and growled thisss isss a new thing isss it not firesong shook his head only new to falconsbane i have seen this sort of construction before and it isnt half as effective as those who use it think it has a vulnerability a severe one if the connections were weakened all about the edge so that they might snap beneath a good shock he likely would not note the weakening and if they snapped the power would backlash against him in some profound ways what kind of ways wintermoon wanted to know something grievous i hope firesong smiled faintly if he was not prepared with a way to ground it or to escape he would likely be cast into the void between the gatesas if he entered a gate and both the gate and the terminus were then destroyed that is because of the way he has set up the tensions among his powerpoles and his center great concentrations of power warp the worldspace as gates do darkwind shuddered he had once had a glimpse of that void he would prefer not to see it again thats not a fate i would wish on anyone he said not even falconsbane elspeth asked i can think of one or two others i would like to see contemplating their deeds for all eternity firesong continued as if they had not interrupted him any shock to him would snap these threads of power once they were weakenedthat would be the best way in fact a shock at the center will have more effect than one at an edge but the weakeningthat would have to be done quickly so that he did not have a chance to notice what was being done he looked up into the gryphons faces expectantly treyvan blinked slowly his eyes distant you rrrequirrre ssswiftly trraveling magesss he said and at the sssame time you rrrequirrre sssomeone to infiltrrrate the beassstsss home firesong nodded and waited the ssswift onesss mussst be usss i think treyvan continued and the otherrrnyarrra if you are willing yes darkwind said awkwardly i hate to ask you but if falconsbane gains control of the protogate hell have an enormous amount of power it would be the kind of power that normally goes to establish and maintain an entire vale protections heartstones valesculpting and all he could dessstrroy usss all with a thought hydona replied flatly he mussst not have that powerrr bring the little ones here darkwind urged with the heartstone gone theres no longer a danger to them in staying here hydona nodded but darkwind sensed that she had something else on her mind she looked to her mate after a moment of wordless exchange treyvan sighed we wisssh sssomething in return he said what firesong asked if it is in our power it isss we requirrre a pricssse we want ksheyna to not dissolve the vale when you leave to give it to ussss veil shieldsss and all treyvan tucked his wings closer in to his body we had planned to take it oncssse you left but but if you leave it asss it isss it will be betterrr forrr ourrr new klahesssheymessserin hydona interrupted we might asss well brrring it into clearrr sky asshkeyana darkwind blinked trying to identify the two words they had just used they sounded like tayledras but werent they werent shinain either kaledain exclaimed firesong as he brought his head up eyes wide with startlement treyvan sighed as hydona nodded firmly now that darkwind knew the tongue he could translate the words the second was simply an endearment beloved but the firstit was complicated the strictest translation would have been family or clan except that it implied a family made of those who not only were not related by bloodbut who might not even be of the same species once again firesong beat him to identification pledgedclan he exclaimed again youreyou cant be clan kleshya wintermoon quite fell off his seat the lost ones the lost clan he exclaimed his eyes going so wide with surprise darkwind was afraid he was going to sprain something the spirit clan i thoughtbutthey were nothing but legend treyvans beak gaped in a gryphonic smile but we arrre legend arrre we not orrr we werrre to you elspeth skif and nyara were looking completely bewildered as well they might as firesong stared and wintermoon picked himself back up darkwind essayed a hasty explanation at the time of the mage wars a group of kaledain from several clans a group of outclansmen and some of the nonhumans all formed a kind ofofbrotherhood i suppose they called themselves kena lessshyanay in the tongue hydona supplied it meansss clan bound by ssspirit ssssomething like yourrr heraldsss but

tervardi and dyheli and a fair number of the kaledain shamans and healers firesong said to the three outlanders leaning forward so that they could hear him then he turned to the gryphons watching them intently but during the evacuation of the stronghold you disappeared treyvan shook his massive head no herrre isss what happened we did not ussse the gatesss the lessser magesss crrreated to evacuate

nodded then back to darkwind with yourrr perrrmisssion i shall ussse the lessser gate in the rrruinsss and the powerrr of the node to meet their gate and brrring them herrre in time to help but for that help we wisssh the vale intact i cant promise darkwind began helplessly firesong interrupted him is there any reason why ksheyna cant give them the vale he asked any reason at all the only reason darkwind could think of was because weve never done it before and that did not seem particularly adequate nor did he feel that this would be a true breach of tayledras territoriality after all these peoplebeingswere tayledras sort of not that i can think of he admitted he licked his lips thoughtfully all we know of the spirit clan is out of legendand by knowing you two he told the gryphons leaving a vale intactthat halves what little power we still possess and it leaves you with a stronghold what will we be leaving it to a clan like any otherrr hydona replied carefully a clan with perrrhapsss only one thing you do not have and that isss the trrrained kessstracherrm crraft but you have bondbirrrdsss that we do not we have ourrr lazy folk ourrr ssstupid folk ourrr occasssional

will alwaysss be thossse the humanssss at leassst are clansssfolk we will take any oathssss you rrrrequirrre and willingly to have the vale i say that this is aid we dare not reject wintermoon said firmly surprising his brother whatever the cost ridding us of falconsbane is worth it darkwind i think that anything you your brother and i together supported the elders would agree to firesong told him but lets take the advice of the black gryphonthat it is easier to beg pardon than gain permissionand go with treyvan to bring his people through tonight darkwind wavered for a moment doubtfully he would be helping to bring an army into the ragged remains of his own people would he destroy them or would he save them he looked into treyvans softedged raptor eyes and saw there the friend the surrogate parent the everpresent gentle guide the one who had put up with having his feathers pulled by a rambunctious small boyand his crest snatched by a wayward bondbird he smiled and nodded firmly lets do it chapter twentythree silverfox and the returned tribe the vale was full of sunlight and gryphons elspeth had never seen anything like it and the sight took her breath away everywhere she looked there was a gryphonbathing in a pool lying along a massive branch or the roof of an ekele sunbathing on the cliffs around the vale gryphons with colors and markings like peregrines or forestgyres cooperihawks or goshawks gryphons in solid colors of gray gold rustyred gryphons with accipitor builds and gryphons as slim as the lightest of falcons the only markings they all had in common were patently artificial the final arms length or so of their first six primaries on each wing were white for four handspans then red for another four handspans to the tips every time a gryphon moved a wing the flash of red and white caught the eye like a flash of bright light and they had arrived hungry fortunately treyvan and hydona had explained to all their fellow flyers just what the bondbirds were and that they were not to be eaten otherwise there might have been true havoc by now and a number of damaged hawkbrothers and gryphons the poor little hertasi had worked themselves to exhaustion finding enough to feed all of them and probably enjoyed every moment of their work hydona had promised that after this they would hunt their own food she thought she had never seen anything to match this not even when the full complement of heralds and companions turned out for her mothers wedding she would much rather look at the gryphons disporting themselves than at the chaos of arguing clansmen she would much rather be doing something about falconsbane or the heartstone than either she shifted impatiently and tried to concentrate on the meeting below her the council oak clearing was full and overflowing with every tayledras who could walk and all of the newcomersplus skif and nyara up at the front but she could scarcely see them past the press of bodies the people who came with the gryphons had been less of a shock than the gryphons themselves so much like both the tayledras and the shinain that she couldnt tell any differences except in speech and a certain uniformity of dress they had arrived through the gate bringing with them curious landboats like shallowdraft barges but with pointed prows and places for rudders these barges were roofed over and equipped with shutters fitted up inside for sleeping and storage luggage boxes and bales of goods were piled upon the roofs and lashed down and they floated above the ground at about kneeheight elspeth had thought her eyes were going to pop out of her head when those came through the veil she was secretly relieved to find that the tayledras were equally astonished by the floating barges it made her feel less like a country cousin forsaking his place with the elders iceshadow had latched onto one of the magepilots of the peculiar constructions and both of them were whispering to each other even now ignoring the arguments she had the feeling that they were planning to spend those waking moments not devoted to moving the protogate to explanations of how the barges were enchanted and worked and how heartstones were created and functioned the full clan immediately went into session on demand of a minority of tayledras who were outraged over this violation of their territory wintermoon turned out surprisingly enough to be the steadiest voice of reason reminding the contenders over and over that these outlanders were tayledrasor rather the hawkbrothers were kaledain and that the coming of those of their own blood could hardly be counted as invasion elspeth wished that she could have left him to this thankless task but she was a member of the clan and she had to be there like every other member of the clan there are several other things my time could be spent more profitably on wintermoon could probably wear them down into consent within a day or two with sheer persistence with or without her help i wish theyd simply give up and let the rest of us deal with them later after things have been settled dear gods this is like having an argument over precedence on the eve of a battle she had been here since sunrise perched on a shoulderhigh tree branch at the back of the mob and she hadnt heard any variation in the arguments she stifled a yawn and looked down catching the amused eyes of firesong and his new friend and the shrug of the former firesong was particularly taken by a young man who was supposed to be a kestrachern whatever that was and who had offered to teach him some of the craft when there was time i think you would have a talent for it silverfox had said with a hint of some kind of innuendo that she couldnt read you are a healing adept after allit would be a useful skill to have well that meant that firesong was not going to be thinking about darkwind not with the lithe and graceful silverfox he of the knowing blue eyes and anklelength ebony hair giving silent invitations firesong seemed to find irresistible and that was just fine with her that left one less thing for both darkwind and herself to worry about and they certainly had enough on their hands right now even without the contention within the clan a stir of activity near the elders seats caught her eye she was too far away to see what was going on but there was certainly something happening besides the dreary old arguments she sent a silent inquiry to gwena who was somewhere on the edge of the clearing but her companion sent back a wordless negative gwena couldnt see anything either she narrowed her eyes and peered carefully through the screening of branches and bodies there was someone coming into the council oak clearing from outsideno lots of someones she craned her neck to see bracing her hands against the branch and jumped when someone grabbed her wrist she looked down to find darkwind tugging her indicating she should jump down into his arms they are calling for us he said the shinain have arrived the shinain what did they have to do with this mess but she obeyed she jumped and he caught her waist easing her to the ground with that carefully controlled strength that she never noticed until he did something like this together they wound their way through the crowd to the front where the elders sat as they broke through the final group of tayledras screening her from the elders circle she stifled a start of surprise there was old kraheerabut with him were six other shinainshinain of a kind she had seen only twice before shinain of the kind called swordsworn they crowded in behind kraheera blackclad some veiled some not leading nightblack horses and the veiled ones seemed to shimmer with power as if they were not quite of this world so we are not said a voice in her head and she stifled another start one set of iceblue eyes over a black veil caught her attention one of those eyes winked slowly and deliberately be at peace little sisterinpower student of my student of course we have known of the coming of the kaleidain kraheera was saying impatiently the faces of the elders remained inscrutable but there was no doubting the surprise and consternation in the expressions of those who had been arguing against permitting the kaledain to remain she told us they were coming and bid us find a place for them on the plains if they could not find one here or chose not to dwell here we did not expect them to come so soon or we would have told you long before they arrived he turned to fix one of the kaledain spokesmen with an acidic glare you were not supposed to arrive until midsummer the kaledain shrugged so it goes she told you one of the most ardent opponents said to kraheera feebly we are here to stand as proof of her word one of the veiled ones said in a strange voice that sounded as if it was coming from the bottom of a well although we are not wont to appear to any save our own she sent us to prove to you doubters that she approves unless you choose to doubt us as well the tayledras in question paled and shook his head kraheera snorted and turned back to the council we have been doing what we can within the limits of her decree and our own resources to give you help with your troubles he told them sharply so i think it little enough to grant our brothers their request given that they will help us all deal with this great beast our enemy and so too does she think skif who was standing near starblade with nyara at his hand blinked as if he had suddenly realized something now i know where i saw you he said to one of the blackclad shinain not just at the ruinsyou were out in the forest when we were hunting for nyara the shinain shrugged some of us she said two or three keeping an eye on our younger sister as she asked us to so that we could vouch for her to you as well the rest she chuckled the rest of us have been sending the falconsbane little trinkets and harassing his borders to keep his mind puzzling over things with no meaning and to distract him from your doings as much as we could it is no coincidence that we are black riders upon black horses little sister said the voice in her head again the falconsbane knows of your enemy to the north and eastknows that you and yours are white riders we simply counterfeited something he would expect if that enemy of yours were courting or challenging him gave him something to think upon a dangling carrot as it were with as many misdirections as we could manage elspeth stuffed her hand in her mouth to keep from giggling with a kind of giddy relief the shinain had been teasing and tormenting falconsbane no wonder theyd been able to do as much as they had been no wonder it seemed as if falconsbanes attention was divided she wondered why theyd been doing this but whys didnt really matter at the moment only that they had she turned her attention back to the council meeting but after that there was very little debateand a great deal of constructive planning the plan was set they were about to put it into motion while most of the gryphons frolicked in the vale and barbarically beautiful kaledain occupied the attentions of most of ksheyna the council of elders had already listened to and given consent to what the little war council had put together surely selenay would have had a fit if shed known what her daughters part in this was to be thank all the gods that gwena had decided to keep discreetly silent on the subject telling rolan only that elspeths studies continued wellthey did sort o the gryphonsthose dozen or so of the wing of thirty that were full mages at any ratewere going to solve one problem for them with seven pairs making the rounds of falconsbanes web of power the work of weakening his powerthreads should be done between sunset and sunrise easily under the cover of darkness they were less likely to be spotted from below nyara was going to be the arrow striking for falconsbanes heart that was a task elspeth did not envy her and she could not imagine how the changechild managed to be so calm about it perhaps it was needs steadying effect perhaps it was because she knew that if she betrayed any nervousness skif would probably fall to pieces meanwhile as nyara crept closer and closer to her fathers stronghold she and darkwind got to play target to distract him if they could the shinain could no longer play that role he had started to look for them and had laid traps for them that would catch them they had no magic to disarm those traps not as darkwind and elspeth had the leshyae kalenedral would be occupied in another way helping kraheera and kethra confusing falconsbanes farsight and farvision spells with their shamanic magic so that he would not see the newcomers to the vale and the special energies of all the new mages there that was vital to their purposes if falconsbane had any idea who and what had arrived to augment the powers of ksheyna he would not hesitate he would throw everything at them that he had knowing their massed power could take him even with the help of the kaledain there was no one in all of the new council who thought the vale and the three peoples there would survive that unscathed so darkwind and elspeth were on their own in supplying a needed distraction without distractions falconsbane might well notice the gryphons nyara or both if he noticed themshe shuddered better not to think about it with needs help she had fashioned a blade that would counterfeit need at a distance it had no real power whatsoeverlike the sword meant to select the rulers of rethwellan all it did was burn mageenergy in a spectacular fashion radiating power to anyone with magesight gwena would supply the energy for that blade elspeth would go imperfectly shielded at least on the surface looking as illtrained as possible darkwind would simply be himself that alone should bring falconsbane down on them they would ride north and west skirting the edge of what was probably falconsbanes territory as if they were heading in search of something any time they met with one of the enemys traps they would destroy it any time they found one of his powersinks they would drain it meanwhile firesong and the kaledain mages would be moving the protogate but with none of the speed they were capable of darkwind hoped that falconsbane would assume the obviousthat tthheeryefworeerchetrwyionugldtootdil stract him from diverting the protogatean ov iur something else they were distracting him from i really ought to be used to playing target by now she said as sh tightened gwenas girth and prepared to ride out into the snow and cold with darkwind they looked like a pair of fancydress heralds the two of them he wore winter scout gear which was just as white as any heralds uniform and she had finally pried her whites out of the grip of the disapproving hertasi gwena was champing at her nonexistent bit ready to goand darkwind was going to be riding firesongs very dear friend the dyhelimage brytha what was even more amazing than a dyheli mage was the fact that brytha had instantly volunteered for this before darkwind could ask any of the other stags to carry him i am not much of mage brytha had said in the stilted thoughtforms of his kind i channel power like companion i channel to you you are less tired then no one could deny the truth of that any power that could be given to darkwind without effort on his part increased his stamina tremendously but now elspeth knew why brytha was whiteand why firesong could accomplish some of the incredible things hed already done with that extra reserve of power available one healing adept could act like two or even three that was the edge they had needed to turn this from suicidal to merely horribly dangerous in elspeths opinion or at least to less suicidal i suppose you should be used to being a target in those here i am please shoot me uniforms you wear he replied with a grin carefully tightening brythas girth not you too she complained kero calls them the oh shoot me now uniforms there are perfectly good reasons why we wear white i like you better in colors he said simply and reached out to touch her hand briefly but gently they suit your quiet beauty white only makes you look remote an iceprincess your spirit is brighter even than my best scarlet she flushed and hung her head to cover it thank you she replied carefully slowly she was learning to accept his compliments without any of the doubt shed have had if they had come from anyone else and for a moment she was back in his ekele in memory surrounded by color and soft silk warmth and admiration then she shook off the memory for now all that was important was the task ahead of them and for that task she could not have asked for a better partner than the one she had now should they come out of this well enough they would celebrate in the ekele again in a similar way she mounted up he followed a moment later and looked into her eyes she nodded and he took the lead riding out through the veil and into the quiet cold and the snow the gauntlet was cast there was no going back now treyvan launched himself into the wind his wings spreading wide to catch the updraft spiraling higher above the vale with every wingbeat behind and below him hydona echoed his launch and once she reached height the others followed it was good to see other gryphons taking to the air again better still to know that they were here to stay counting himself and hydona there were thirtytwo gryphons in the vale now a full wing the little ones would have many teachers and doubtless there would be playmates for them before too long the gryphons who had volunteered for this settlement were all paired and the balmy temperatures of the vale had sent several of the pairs into precourting it should be very interesting to see the effect on the tayledras if they had not moved by the time the true courting began but that was for later now there was a job to be done they all knew what they were to do seven were to go to the south seven to the north the web of power gleamed to their inner sight seen from far above the world a construction of entirely artificial lines of energy and their anchors overlaying the natural leylines and often conflicting with them not exactly a web in shape only the powerpoles were connectingpoints that was what held the whole construction stableit was all that held the whole construction stable that would be to their benefit and falconsbanes detriment anything that ran counter to the earths own ways was subject to extreme stress maintaining this web would be much like flying against a headwind the moment the pressure was released the entire construction would implode the swiftest of the gryphons two of nearly pure gryfalcon lineage would take the farthest points on the webthose two were not treyvan and hydona but a much younger pair reaycha and taisheena treyvan and hydona as senior mages would take the nearest points but they would take more of them making up in work what they were not pu g was deapportioning the worke sianlelehtahdeatgirmeecdofthsaktatnhdisrawnaosnthneotfairnest way of cretting into flight tim ed within a gryphon wing without a majority consenting to it the two older gryphons held the middle heights providing a marker point for the others to use to orient themselves it was a moonless night and on such nights despite mageenhanced nightsight distances were often deceptive the first pair gained height above treyvan and his mate and shot off barely visible against the swiftlydarkening sky heading southwest and northwest then the second pair gained altitude and took to the skytrailthen the thirdfinally only he and hydona were left gliding in lazy circles on the valegenerated thermal the sky was entirely dark now with wisps of cloud occluding the stars and a crisp breeze coming up from below a good night for a flight well my finecrested lover she said her mindvoice a warm purring in the back of his mind are you prepared to enchant me with some fancy flying ever so my love he replied and drove his wings in powerful beats that sent him surging upward and outward as she did the same he glanced at her and felt the familiar warmth of love and lust heating him as she showed her strength and beauty angling against the wind we shall meet at dawn nyara also left at sunset riding dyheliback she had not expected that boon but the dyheli themselves had insisted on it her partner for this first part of the journey until the moment that she must go on afoot was a young female lareen fresh and strong she promised laughingly that she could keep her rider well out of any trouble by strength and speed alone that suited nyara perfectly she had no wish for any kind of a confrontationit would be far better to reach the borders of falconsbanes territory without anyone ever getting so much as a glimpse of her she had thought that this would be the worst moment of the journey for skif had been stiff and silent all during the council meeting and she feared he would remain so during the ride she had not been looking forward to spending what might be their last hours together aching with the weight of his disapproval but instead once the meeting was over he had taken her aside where no one could overhear them except for need of course for the sword had not left her side except for sleep but the sword had remained silent and he had ignored the blade entirely nyara he had begun then faltered for a moment as he looked into her eyes and gripped her shoulders with hands that shook with tension his usually expressive face had been so full of anxiety that it had become a kind of mask she had remained silent unsure of what to say only watching him steadfastly should she break the silence or would that only make things worse he had stared at her as if he thought she would vanish or flee with the first word nyara you know i dont like what theyre asking you to do he said finally his voice was hoarse as if he were forcing the words out over some kind of internal barrier she had stared deeply into his eyes dark with emotions she could not read and fear which she could and nodded slowly still holding her peace but i also wont deny the fact thatthat you have a right to do anything you want and youre capable of doing it and i wont deny you the chance to do what you think is right what you have to do youre your own person and if i tried to stop you tried to manipulate you by telling you i love you which i do absolutely completely he shook his head with a helpless desperation his eyes never once leaving hers a frantic plea for understanding in his gaze i wont do that to you i wont manipulate you please understand i dont like this but i wont stop you because i know its something you have to do she had reached up to touch his cheek gently a lump born of mingled emotions briefly stopping her voice then she had smiled and said lightly but i think you have also learned the futility of trying to stop someone who is set on a course from dealing with elspeth yes her attempt at lightening the mood had worked he had growled a little but a tiny smile crept onto his lips and a little of the worry eased from his face yes minx you would remind me of that wouldnt you she had sighed as he relaxed his grip on her shoulders and had moved forward so that he could hold herwhich is what she had wanted him to do with equal desperation ever since this morning for a long time they simply stood together holding each other taking comfort from each others warmth and nearness i think what i hate the most is not what youre doing but that i cant be with you he had said finally his arms tightening around her i feel so damned helpless i hate feeling helpless we all hate feeling helpless she had reminded him well so they did and she was not feeling less helpless than he though for different reasons her eyes adjusted to the growing darkness as they rode out into the snow following for a while the tracks of darkwind and elspeth the clean cold air felt very good on her face in fact if their situation had not been so tense she would have enjoyed this she had discovered out in her tower that she enjoyed the winter even with all the hardships she had endured once the weather had turned cold now she was adequately clothed for winter in tayledras scout gear now she was riding upon the back of a creature built for striding through snow rather than forcing her own way through the drifts this was winter taken with pure pleasure but tension had her stomach in such sour knots that she had not been able to eat much her back and shoulders were knotted with anxiety and she was terribly aware of the burden of the sword at her side and what it meant need was cloaking her presumably as well as itself but she absolutely required that cloaking and she would require every bit of her mentors skill and learning to come through this alive the alarms and traps should not react to me she told herself once again father has been otherwise occupied in no way would he ever expect me to return to him of my own will after attacking him and betraying him surely he will not have tampered with the defenses since i left him last he has been beset by the shinain launching his own attackswhen has he had time to reset them once i leave skif and wintermoon at the border there should be no difficulty in getting within the territory or the strongholdso why am i as frightened as a rabbit walking into the den of a changelion she shivered though not with cold and touched the hilt of the sword unconsciously im here little one the sword said calmly im screening us both for all im worth you can do this i trained you and i know some of the swords calm confidence seeped into her own soul and eased the cramps in muscles and stomach there was no point in getting so knotted up that she would accomplish nothing after all no point in worrying until it was time to worry the trail widened at that point and skif rode up beside her she turned to smile at him but it was so dark that although she could see his face she doubted that he could see hers we should talk like this wintermoon says came his mindvoice deep inside her head although she had never heard it she knew it for his and it gave her unexpected comfort like feeling his hand holding and steadying her im notvery good at it i should warn you have to be this close to you i willtry she replied the same way stumbling a little despite her practice with need her father had never spoken mindtomind with her he had only used his mind to coerce her and to hurt her youd like valdemar i think he said unexpectedly especially the hills in the south theyre very beautiful in the winter youd probably like the forest of sorrows too thats way in the north there are mountains up there so tall that some of them have never been climbed she saw the image of the mountains and the forest at their feet in his mind saw it drowsing in the heat of summer alive with birds in the spring cloaked in flame in the fall and sleeping beneath a blanket of snow in winter why so sad a name she asked ohthats because of vanyel he replied and told her the tale embellished with images out of his own experiences and imagination that tale led to anotherand anotherand soon it was midnight and time to stop for a bit of a rest and a chance to check their bearings against the stars wintermoon oriented himself she and skif dismounted and walked a short distance thisbeing a herald i do not understand she told him as he held her within the warmth of his arms and coat and they waited for wintermoons two bondbirds to report with their findings sometimes i dont understand it either he admitted i suppose the closest i can come is to say that its something i have to dojust as what were doing now is something you have to do but what i do is not because of hate or anger or the feeling that i owe it to anyone she moved her cheek against his chest and closed her eyes then why she asked simply longing suddenly to understand would it sound entirely stupid to say that it was out of love he asked thats not the whole of it thats not even the largest part but its the start she waited patiently for the rest of the answer and it came in bits and pieces they were pieces that did not yet fall together to make a whole but like the pieces of a mirror they reflected bits of him that made her see him a little more clearly when one assembled a broken mirror one could still discern an image some of his reason was gratitudethe heralds had literally saved his life and given him something like a real family that revelation made her feel kinship and a bitter envy she had known only brief affection and never any sense of real family she had now and again spied upon the lesser creatures of her fathers stronghold with wonder and jealousy she had seen fathers who caressed their children with nothing ever coming of those caresses but care she had seen children greeting their fathers with joy and not fear and she had seen that strange and wondrous creature a mother a creature that could and would die to save the offspring she had given life to a creature that gave life and love without asking for anything other than love in returnno matter what the child became no matter what darkness it turned to skif had not known a mother like that either in that much they were kin yet he received that kind of unquestioning love fromhis companion she suppressed another surge of envy to have that kind of lovewhat did he need from her somehow he sensed that doubt and answered it not with words though with feeling feelings that she could not possibly doubt in her mind he held her close and warmed her their peaceful reverie was broken by his companion who stole up beside them and nudged his shoulder he turned to her after a moment of silent dialogue cymry says that elspeth and darkwind have managed to attract some attention by springing a trap she doesnt think falconsbane is personally involved yet but now would be a good time to move on while his guards are occupied with trying to catch them she nodded and sensed needs agreement as well the moment passed but something of it remained she examined herself carefully trying to figure out exactly what it was and finally gave it up the terrain became uneasily familiar and she felt that cold fear rising up her spine and chilling her throat soon nowsoon the first of the borderprotections was not that far from here soon she would have to dismount shed cloak and coat and key herself up to the point where she could ignore pain and exhaustion and run like one of the dyheli herself by dawn if all went well she would be inside the fortress itself alonealone like bloody hell the sword snorted scornfully what am i an old tin pot the image that need sent to her of nyara wielding a tin pot against fearful guards made her smother a giggle and completely dispelled the fear of course she wasnt alone she had need beside her skif behind hershe would never really be alone again thats the spirit just keep thinking that way and somehow she did as she and skif followed wintermoon deeper into the forest past the valley where the dyheli herd had been caught by one of her fathers traps so long ago closer to the border and the first of the barriers that she must cross chapter twentyfour treyvan and hydona elspeth had been feeling eyes on the back of her neck for the past league and more ever since they had sprung the trap meant for a bondbird a particularly nasty thing brytha had spotted it and had alerted them to the fact that there were both physical and magical defenses in the trees as well as on the ground if vree had encountered such a thing unprepared it would certainly have caught and hurt him and might well have killed him but then falconsbane was well aware that harming the bondbird meant harming its bondmate the nightshrouded forest had held plenty of traps not all of them falconsbanes rocks and roots lurked beneath the snow to trip even the wariest shadows could hide anythingor nothing elspeths nightsight was not of the best and she was forced to rely on gwenas physical senses entirelyalthough truthfully that meant she could devote most of her attention to her magesenses spying out trouble trouble there was right enough and it increased the closer they got to falconsbanes lands alarms and more traps some meant to hold and some meant to kill places where falconsbanes underlings had simply left things to trip up the unwary to make them delay nothing living though elspeth was not sure if that was a good or bad sign now with the gray light of dawn creeping over the forest and vree scouting overhead she was so tense with anxiety that she felt like a spring too tightly woundand would have been starting at every little sound if she had not held herself under careful control this was the first time she personally had played decoythe heir to the throne of valdemar was far too important to risk as a decoy or baitand now she knew how kero and the skybolts had felt when they were playing this little game i cant show i know were in danger or we stop being such attractive targetsif everything was going according to plan the gryphons would be completing their task if they had not already done so nyara would be deep inside her fathers stronghold and very soon they would be free to sprint back for the shelter of the vale and the protections of a vale full of mages and adepts nyara was already inside her fathers lands if not his stronghold skif had relayed that via cymry just past midnight he and wintermoon had seen her safely past the first line of defenses and had gone to the rallypoint the place she would reach if she could when this was all over but there was no way of knowing how far she was at this point please whatever gods there bestareyed kemos astera whatever you call yourselveslet us all come through this with bodies and minds and hearts intactelspeth was exhausted and getting wearier with every passing moment this business of springing traps was not as easy as it had sounded yes they could use the power of the leylines to augment their ownwhen they could reach them some of falconsbanes own lines overlaid the natural ones rendering them inaccessible and some of the lines were protected against meddling by falconsbanes own power no nothing was as simple as it had sounded when they first made this plan and it had not truly seemed all that simple then she caught darkwinds eye he smiled at her but it seemed more than a little strained hes in about the same shape you are gwena said gentlyand your imagination is not acting up you are being watched imperfectly the shinain are doing what they canbut falconsbane knows youre here and he knows who you are well that was the object of this little excursion wasnt it to take the attention off of nyara and the gryphons nevertheless she felt a chill run up her back as the feeling of being watched increased and the malevolence behind the watching eyes made itself felt vree says the gryphons are done darkwind exulted suddenly the last line is loose distancemindspeech was a hazard around falconsbanethe kind he was watching for at any rate but they had something he didnt the gryphons mindspoke to vree and he in turn to darkwindand all at a level it was doubtful falconsbane was even aware of much less could eavesdrop upon she and gwena turned following darkwinds lead as if they had decided they had come far enough on an ordinary patrol and were turning back ice crawled up her spine her stomach was one huge knot of fear and nausea and she kept looking out of the corners of her eyes for the first signs that falconsbane was going to attack we cant run if we run hell chase us we cant hold him off if he goes allout against us so we have to look as if were just changing directions and hope that he doesnt lose interesthuh better hope that he doesnt decide hes not going to let us slip away when he realizes were headed away from him at least we know the gryphons succeeded if only they had some such bond with nyara she licked lips gone dry with a tongue just as dry with fear and felt her stomach tighten a little more nyara crept along the dusty passages between the walls of her fathers stronghold moving as quietly as only she could in this she was her fathers superior he had never mastered the art of moving without noise without even the sound of a breath then again he had never had need to he had never had anyone to fear or avoid in all his life he never had to hide from anyone not like a certain small girl who had huddled for hours in these passageways to avoid himto avoid what he had in store for her she felt fear starting to cramp her stomach and sternly told it to relax deep breaths slowly tension brings mistakes fear is his weapon she was glad of the dust for all that it might have choked her had she not come prepared for it she breathed through a silken cloth wrapped closely around nose and mouth slowly evenly taking each step only after testing the surface before her the dust meant that no one had walked this passage since she had last been hereand that had been years the last timecertainly it had been two years and more the last time she had been here was long before she had even dreamed of escape from her fathers power and then it had taken a year of planning before she dared to try how bitter it had been to learn that the attempt had been watched and planned by falconsbane all alongthat thought plays into his hands again no nyara once you were free of him you did things he had never anticipated you would you won free of him you turned his own plan against him surely it is he who tastes bitterness now she put that old disappointment behind her throttled her fear again and concentrated completely on setting each foot down carefully noiselessly at the moment this was the only thing in the universe that was important what was past could not be changed the future lay beyond this passageway this was all that she controlled this moment of now and she must control it completelyso far need had detected no alarms or traps in this passageway itself perhaps her father did not feel he needed any perhaps he trusted in the narrowness of the passage to keep anything of real danger out of it certainly it was much too small to permit the movement of an armed man but not too small for one small slender female armed with only the sword that she kept out and pointed into the darkness before her thirty steps from here was her goal her fathers study one of his workrooms it lay in a suite in the heart of his stronghold the heart of his power there was an entrance into this passage from that room behind a tapestry at the farther end through the back of a wooden wardrobe that falconsbane kept some of his special garments in he knew all about it of course for he had built itbut because he knew about it she did not think he ever thought about it anymore the passage and the entrance had been there since before she was born and no one that he knew of had ever used it but him in all that time if she was very lucky he might assume that since no one ever had no one ever would twenty steps more hes ahead up there need cautioned in the suite no one but him and hes busy ten steps she had never prayed before dont worry about that kitten im praying enough for both of u im an expert at it fiveelspeth sensed something change like the sharpness in the air before lightning strikes alarm shrilled along her nerves and every hair on her body stood on end a bitter metallic taste filled her throat gwena snorted and froze where she stood sensing it as welldarkwind and brytha beside them did the same at the same moment they were no longer being watched they were being targeted no use to run nowthey couldnt escape what was coming shields darkwind cried he stuck out his hand blindly as they had planned if it came to this she linked to gwena and caught his hand and with it his link he was better at shielding she flung her power to him taking whatever gwena could pour into her she sensed the blow coming and cringed over gwenas neck he met the blow with one of his owna defense of offense something she hadnt even thought of the two bolts of power met over their heads in a silent explosion of power and a shower of very physical sparks that landed in the snow all around him sizzling and melting the drifts wherever they landed he took the moment to weave a hasty shield about them both but it had none of the layering or complexity he needed the next bolt came splashing and burning against the shield scorching it half away and blinding her physically as well as in magesight a thunderclap of sound deafened her in the next instant they hadnt had enough timethey hadnt known falconsbane could strike like this where did he get all that power falconsbane should have been wounded should have been at less power than hed had before not more unless he was already tapping into the protogate or unless he had ruthlessly sacrificed many of his underlings building a network of deathenergies stronger than anything they had or unless hed found an ally somewhere darkwind couldnt shield all of them the group was just too big he reinforced where the shield had burned away and this time she aided him weaving light and snowglare into a dazzle trying to recreate the kind of shielding they had learned to make in the safety of the vale but falconsbane was keeping them both offbalance destroying the rhythm of their dance of power with sheer brute force he controlled the situation now it was his land they walked on and the land held energy away from them she whimpered in sudden pain as a lick of flame burned through and across her hand the hand that held darkwindsbut she would not let go not even if she died in the next moment instead she kneed gwena closer to brytha until their legs were halfcrushed between the two mounts to make the physical gap between them smaller she closed her eyes and sheltered against darkwinds back sweat of fear and exertion running down her back under her coat feeling him tremble with strain falconsbane did not let up not even for a heartbeat blow after blow rained down on them driving all sense from her until the last of the shields eroded and they clung together waiting for the strike that would take them both together at leastshe thought faintly the blow never came they opened their eyes fearing something worse then a scream from above made them jump and look up like two golden streaks of light the two gryphons plummeted down from above they crashed through the thin lace of branches ending their dive barely above the ground and pulling up with wingbeats that sent the snow spraying in all directions both screamed again an unmistakable note of taunting in their voices as they plunged upward through the tree canopy run darkwind found his voice run theyve made targets out of themselves if we give him too many to choose from we may all get away brytha broke from his paralysis and hurled himself down their backtrail gwena followed a moment later but not directly behind making herself and elspeth into yet another target to track on above the interlace of bare branches hydona and treyvan had separated as well skydancing as if they were courtingbut far enough apart that falconsbane would have to make a choice of victims four targetswhen the two young fools rode along the edge of his territory at first falconsbane could not believe the testimony of his own senses it must be an illusion he thought at first it is meant to distract me but the closer the pair came the clearer they were despite the best attempts of whatever it wasthat was trying to cloud his scrying between midnight and dawn he knew that the pair were something more than they seemed by false dawn he knew that one of them was the young outland woman he had wanted so badly to take for his own by true dawn he knew that the other was the fool called darkwind and that the girl still carried her artifact by then he could not withstand the temptation to attack any longer he had not lived this long by neglecting an opportunity when it was given to him and he would not botch this chance by holding back or making testing feints he gathered all of his power together prepared his weaponry and attacked darkwind would die then the girl and the sword would be his there was no point in being prudent or cautious now not with this prize in his grasp he rained blow after blow upon them heedless of the expenditure of power heedless of anything about him elation held him like a powerful drug making him laugh aloud with every shred of shielding burned away giving him an elation he had not felt in decades he held his arms high and power crackled between his hands power from his network made of the deathenergies of his mages he was draining that network but it did not matter for in moments he would have her and the birdfools power as well and there would be nothing standing in the way of his revenge and his glory and then just before he was to strike the blow that would take them both gryphons the sight of them in his scrying bowl struck like a physical blow driving the breath from him they dove down out of nowhere interposing themselves between him and his quarry taunting him flaunting themselves at him flying as if they thought agility alone would protect them gryphons he snarled with overwhelming rage how dared they step between him and his prey anger and hatred filled him granted him a strength far beyond anything he normally possessed they thought to confuse him did they they thought he could only strike one of them at a time they would learn differentlyin the few heartbeats it took for all of them to die he gathered his powersreadied the blast to destroy that entire section of his borderlands nyara took three deep breaths focused herself there is no future there is no past there is only now and the target there is no fear there is only balance there is only myself and the task she slipped through the false wall in the back of the wardrobe and slid soundlessly into the room her eyes focused quickly as she swept them from left to right once to orient herself there the target yes she took two steps raising need high over her head to give additional momentum to her swingand brought the mageblade down squarely on the huge crystalcluster that mornelithe falconsbane had invested and anchored with all of his powera crystal that cried out to her of death and pain and even now was glowing with internal fires of red and angry yellow as he drew upon itdrew upon it to destroy her friends no sword crashed down upon crystaland crystal exploded falconsbane brought his hands up rage a hot taste of blood in his throat thenwhata fractional instant of something wrong no more than that an instant of disorientationsearing painpain engulfing every nerve every fiberout of the pain the void rushing upon him like the open mouth of a giant to devour himand then oblivion elspeth picked herself up out of the huge drift of snow she had landed in slowly one moment they had been running for their lives and the nextgwena she scrambled to her feet flailing in the deep snow trying to get herself turned around itsall right im fine mostly elspeth stopped trying to flail her way out of the snow and relaxed thank the gods oh thank the gods although gwenas mindvoice soundedodd as if i feel as if i have a hangover the companion replied ithink i may be sick the overtones of nausea that came with the thoughts almost pushed elspeth into sickness herself she got herself back to her feet and turned around her head pounding her stomach heaving along with gwenas the companion was on her knees in another snowdrift sides heaving as her breath hissed between clenched teeth i willnever againmock youwhen you arewinesick gwena managed closing her eyes as if the sun hurt her elspeth staggered to her side eat some snow she urged holding a handful up to gwenas muzzle do it i think this might be reactionsickness and eating snow will help if youthink so gwena opened her jaws gingerly and accepted a bite of snow swallowing it quickly the nausea subsided and she took another bite that helps thank you its not going to help the headache though elspeth warned squinting against the pain in her own head were all alive i thinka shadow loomed beside her darkwind leaning on brytha he smiled wanly and the joy that flooded her almost made her forget her pounding head she would have jumped up if she could as it was he simply let go of brythas shoulder and fell into her arms what happened she asked holding him being held and ignoring the chill of the snow penetrating her clothing i think he must have had something ready to hit us with when nyara destroyed his focus darkwind replied unsteadily most of it aborted but there was enough left to knock us all headoverhind i hope treyvan and hydona were out of range thank you the hearty mindvoice made her wince and snow blew up in all directions as the gryphon backwinged to a landing arrre you unwell childrrren he continued folding his wings and cocking his head to one side vree landed beside him imitating his pose in a way that would have been funny if elspeths head had not hurt so much and not only her head it felt rather as if someone had been beating her with blunt clubs all over her body i sssee the gryphon said although none of them had replied wait a moment he walked over to a little sheltered area amid a cluster of bushes within a few moments he had the earth scraped bare and overlaid with pine boughs herrre i have made you a nessst he said turning back to them go and wait therrre all of you i ssshall brrring back sssome help meanwhile eat ssssnow with that he launched himself into the air again vanishing into the bright sky in a few wingbeats well elspeth said to darkwind he shrugged i cant go any further he replied and brythas not feeling much better than gwena lets let someone else take charge for a change good idea she replied and the four of them collapsed together into the nest that treyvan had made to share the heat of their bodies and await their rescuers nyara prowled the complex of three rooms study library and workroom and found only the destruction of a whirlwind in the workroom need went quiet for a moment he was here kitten this was mad he meant to anchor the protogate partially in himself hes gone nowpulled right into the void along with half of the stuff in this room can he return she whispered dont know but if he does he wont be the same she shivered and started back to the hidden passageway the sound of people murmuring on the other side of the door made her hurry her steps they might welcome her as saviorbut more likely theyd welcome her with the points of blades mornelithes servants were steeped in suspicion and fear time to go you did great kitten i was impressed the vale had never looked better and elspeth felt as if she would like to drink tea and stay in bed for a week the tea she got but she wasnt allowed to seek her bed yet there were a number of people waiting for all of them chiefest of whom was firesong firesong actually looked chagrined elspeth had never seen that particular expression on his face before and had not ever thought that she would i have some strange news he said as she sipped the tea that was slowly dulling her headache to a bearable level she looked at darkwind who only shrugged and accepted another mug from the healing adept im beginning to think thats the only kind of news we ever have around here she said dryly pulling her blanket a little closer firesong sat back on his heels and shrugged this isnews that will probably not please most of ksheyna he opined it is concerning the protogate it did not settle where i intended it was pulled awayvery strongly not falconsba elspeth exclaimed alarmed when he interrupted her with a shake of his head nay but it also did not go to the new ksheyna heartstone he sighed and shook his head i am at a loss to explain this it has gone east and north far east and north he looked up at her from under long white eyelashes to your land to be precise she blinked feeling suddenly very stupid was there something here she was missing valdemar she replied butwhy how better to ask who firesong replied standing up again there was a force came out of the north at the moment of backlash it used the force of backlash to snatch the powerpoint out of our hands and when all was done it had settled nicely as a heartstone in the center of your crown city or so i surmise since i cannot imagine any other place with so many of your companions in one small area one corner of his mouth crooked in a slight smile as he nodded at gwena i do suspect that all of them are suffering as much as yourfriendis the settling of that much power is not an easy thing north elspeth managed trying not to look too stupid north north darkwind shook his head what in the name of the gods is north of valdemars lands that could do that nothing elspeth began then stopped what both of them snapped at once the forest of sorrows she said hesitantly the foresthas always had a reputation for strangeness since vanyel died there anyway at the name of vanyel firesongs eyes narrowed and he nodded thoughtfully you are ready now he said directly to her the rest of your training is largely a matter of practice and learning what will work for you i think you both should go to this forest go darkwind said faintly elspeth took a glance at him out of the corner of her eye he was pale and looked as if someone had just struck him yes firesong repeated forcefully go and you should go with her it is obvious to a blind man that you wish toand with all the kaledain here there will be nothing that the clan needs that you alone could provide he shrugged they may even choose to move back here which i think would be an excellent thing but you shouldmustgo with elspeth buti cannot darkwind cried out and winced at the sound of his own cracking voice i cannot he repeated at a lower volume tayledras never leave their vales sheka firesong said rudely my own foster forefathers did so to help herald vanyel in valdemar when he needed their aid they have not in centuries it is true but this is a time of changes or he finished his tone heavy with sarcasm had that fact escaped you but the move darkwind said feebly can be accomplished with the help of the kaledain either bringing them here or your mages there now that the stone is gone you could use the node in the ruins to create a new one or build a gate to the new vale firesong shrugged carelessly tossing his hair back over his shoulders it matters little to me my task is done here and i am returning home father darkwind began then shook his head father has kethra and the kaledain and shinain healers and wintermoon i am being foolish but he licked his lips nervously this is not easy fledging rarely is firesong said dryly i shall leave you to make your decision firesong stood and smiled and now they saw that he had been toying with a black rose at elspeths curious look he smiled a little wider and said only a gift brought to me by a scarletcrested firebird darkwinds brow creased in concentration butthat breed is from the far north firesong closed his eyes and sighed content as any maiden paid a compliment yes darkwindnorth of valdemar elspeth sat quietly as firesong left them alone in the little clearing below her ekele she wanted to look away from him but she was afraid that if she did he would take it as a rejection and that was the last thing she wanted he stared into his cup for a long long time while the tea cooled and both of them were locked inside their own thoughts finally he looked up this will not be easy he said awkwardly i ami have never been outside our own lands i know nothing of the outlands there are good people bad people and middling people she replied as casually as she could just more of them than youre used to perhaps but i would like you to come i need you not just the magebut yourself darkwind that last slipped out before she could stop it but once escaped she did not want to take it back he let out a breath he had been holding in i had hoped you would say that he said and took her hand i had hoped but i had not expected it she felt her heart racing as she put her own hand over his so she said dizzy with elation shall we go see where all these changes are taking us together he replied yes i think we should once again elspeth made up her full packs with everything she owned and moreall the possessions she had accumulated in the vale it was still the deep of winter but the expedition that prepared to set out from kena lesheyana vale was not one that was likely to be daunted by a little cold and snow not only were there three adepts in the party firesong electing to guide them as far as ktreva but there were four gryphons granted that two of them were barely fledged and would make their groundbound way alongside the riders in between their short flights but even a young gryphon was likely to give predators pause that was something elspeth had not expected but she welcomed them completely treyvan would not say what his ultimate intentions were but since he had begun asking for lessons in her tongue elspeth suspected that he and hydona had been elected as the kaledain ambassadors to valdemar it made a certain amount of senseand the gryphlets would be their wordless assurance to the people of valdemar that they intended no ill i cant wait to see them in court how is the seneschal going to call their credentials i wonder besides with gryphons to gawk at nyara was going to seem almost commonplace changes indeed it would take several weeks to make all the preparations weeks during which she and darkwind could help the kaledain to build the gate to send the mages and scouts of ksheyna on to their new vale once that was complete there would be nothing more holding darkwind hereexcept dark memories of a kind he would do well to leave behind thenie unknownfor both of usshe started to shiver then a hawkcry made her look up she wasnt certain why since hawks cried out all the time in a vale but something about that cry compelled her to raise her eyes to the sky above her were two vorcelhawks skydancing courting circling higher and higher into the sun authors note falcons and horses bondbirds and companions the latter are a whatif portrait of the formerbut a bondbird is as unlike a realworld hawk or falcon as a zebra is unlike a companion yet there is always that longing to have something like a bondbird or a companion dragons are not possible in this worldbut this world does hold hawks and horses the demand on time money and special resources is similar for both the dedicated horseman and the falconer first outfitting the human both require specialty items not found in stores a falconer needs a hawking glove specially constructed for extra protection where the hawks talons will be yet flexible enough to handle leash and jesses he must either make thisexpensive in terms of timeor buy itexpensive in terms of money the horseman requires riding boots if he is going to ride seriouslyalso expensive next outfitting the bird or horse the bird needs a hoodan object very difficult to construct properly and again expensive either in terms of time or money she also needs bracelets jesses leash portable perch transportation box training lureall of which must be made to her size by her falconer the horse requires tack hackamore halter bit bridle saddle saddleblanket and grooming materialsall of which must be bought housing bird or horse here is where the horseman has an advantage over the falconer the bird must by federal regulation have a house of a certain size and construction a weatheringyard of certain size and construction and a permanent perch in the weathering yard all these must be constructed on the falconers property for by federal regulations he must have the bird available for inspection at any reasonable time of the day there are no boardingstables for birds feeding and veterinary care expensive propositions for both bird or horse the bird must have fresh highquality food every dayof the kind he would normally eat in the wild not hamburger steak or chicken one can buy in a grocery horses eat likea horse it is a great deal more difficult to find a vet who will care for a raptor than one who will care for a horse however and there is an additional worry because hawks and falcons are protected species if a bird becomes ill and dies the federal government automatically becomes involved to ensure that the death was due to accident and not mistreatment time and training again this is something where the falconer has no choice in the matter he must work with his bird on a daily basis whereas if a horseman has boarded out his horse he can arrange for other riders to take leases to ride on those days when he may not be able to in training the birds there are no birdbreakers the falconer must do all of his training himself unless of course he happens to be so wealthy that like the nobility of old he can employ a falconer to man his birdsthough in that case they will never be his for they will truly answer only to the hand that trained them by contrast papers and magazines are full of advertisements for horses in all stages of training the falconer must have access to land in which to train exercise and hunt with his bird that means that training and hunting with the bird will put many miles on his vehicle the trained bird requires working every day of the year acquisition there are captivebred birds available to the general and master falconers but for the apprentice obtaining a bird means hoursdaysweeks spent attempting to trap a passage redtail or kestrel the horseman must visit many breeders or dealers and try many horses before he finds one to his liking care once again since there are no boardingstables for raptors the entire burden of care falls to the falconer and a big bird like a redtail produces an astonishing quantity of leavings houses must be scraped and scalded periodically as must perches the sand in the house and weathering yard must be raked daily the bird must be offered his daily bath under conditions that will not leave him open to catching disease yards must be inspected and repaired since many predatorsincluding the large owlsregard a bird on a perch as a meal waiting to be taken outside dangers horsemen have to contend with people who honk their car horns at horses being ridden along the side of the road with dogs who attack horse and rider and with people who out of pure maliciousness will attempt to injure horse rider or both falconers have to contend with those who are under the mistaken impression that all birds of prey are lawful targets that birds of prey are taking the game that belongs to them and with those who regard birds of prey as vermin and with those who out of pure maliciousness will attempt to injure or kill the bird both sports require substantial investments of time and money neither should be undertaken lightly or without serious thought for someone considering becoming a horse owner there are usually excellent stables offering training in care and riding for someone considering falconry the best place to consult is the state fish and game department they will have further information on falconers and regulations in your area
