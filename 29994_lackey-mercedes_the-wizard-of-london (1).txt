the wizard of london elemental master book by mercedes lackey isabelle hellen harton waited on the dock beside the gangplank for the last of the steamer passengers from egypt and africa to disembark she was not the only person waiting there there were a number of friends and relations eager to greet returning soldiers posted to distant climes tourists hunters adventurers businessmen and assorted missionaries but she was one of a small handful of quiet soberlydressed folk who were waiting for some very special passengers indeed the vast majority of the passengers had come from egypt it was a popular destination for those english who could afford it especially in the winter there were not many soldiers they generally returned on troopships those who disembarked from this passenger liner were pale thin sometimes missing a limb or an eye invalided out and sent home by the transport that they could get on firstor best afford for those who were returning under happier circumstances there were the usual gay greetings crowds swirled made noise and left and at last the final passengers made their solemn way down the gangplank a little gaggle of children none older than ten all very quiet and subdued were accompanied by their guardians three young english nannies none pretty all as subdued as their charges isabelle fingered the letter in her pocket she didnt have to read it again to know what it said and what it did not say in words written on the page but in those hopes and fears scribed between the lines in thought and emotion dear mrsharton as terrible as it is for us we must send our daughter sarah out of the dangers of africa and back to the more healthful climate and safety of england as we have no relatives with which to entrust our child we cast about for a school and yours has come highly recommended by those we trust she is our only child and very dear to us we have been told that you are kind and caring which speaks more to us than that you have french tutors and dancing masters not mentioned of course was that the harton school was not expensive either a pair of missionaries would not be able to afford a great deal soi suspect they must have asked about a great many schools before they came to us there was a dusting a faint glow of true magic about the letter not that isabelle was a magician herself but she was sensitive enough to detect it in those who were the writer was no master of any element but was surely a practitioner of earth magic not surprising in one who had gone to africa to be a healer and serve at the side of another and the fatherdoctor lyonwhitewas he too magician as well as healer that hadnt occurred to isabel until now and as she waited she brushed her fingers across the surface of the envelope and under the first faint trace discovered another fainter still yes another earth magician and this one a master but if this little daughter had been so gifted the parents would have sent her to another elemental mage to be schooled so as she is not an incipient elemental mage and they have little money to afford the only school that has a reputation for training the otherwise gifted among the other elemental mages they must have been quite desperate once again it was what was not written in the letter that resonated to isabelles own finelytunedand extrasenses sarah has gifts we cannot train the letter whispered to her nor can anyone we know those we trust tell us that you can but they could not put that into words of course they were writing to a stranger who might not be as they had been told who might think them mad for saying such things rumors of our special students at best among their set and among missionaries and the like only the assurance that we are kind and gentle they could only be sure of this that those who ran this school would be good to a little girl who had been sent so far away from everything she knew and loved isabelle wondered just what it was that little sarah jane had been gifted with then dismissed it whatever it was she would find out soon enough down the gangplank at last came the line of little girls and boys two by two with one nanny leading and the other two following all of them quiet and roundeyed and apprehensive subdued perhaps by the gray northern skies the smokes the looming dark city that was so completely unlike cairo or timbuktu isabelle had eyes for only one of them a slender bigeyed child in a shabby coat a little too large for her who looked with reserve but no fear all around her not pretty brownhaired and browneyed a little wren of a child this was sarah jane she knew it felt it and felt something under that surface that told her that doctor and mrslyonwhite had been very wise in sending their child to the harton school for boys and girls so it was isabelle of all of those waiting for their charges who stepped forward first and presented her credentials to the leading nanny i am mrsharton and i am here for sarah jane lyonwhite she said in a firm voice as the nanny looked the letter over with hesitant uncertainty and before the nanny could say anything more she turned to the child she had singled out and held out her hand and put all of the welcome and love she could into her voice and gaze come along my dear your parents asked me to meet you the childs eyes lit up as she met isabelles gaze with her own there was relief there too a relief that told isabelle how lonely the poor thing had been on this journey and how much she had hoped to find a friend at the end of it without asking for permission she left the group and took isabelles hand trustingly there was some fuss about getting the childs things sorted out from those of the rest of the children and then a bit more nonsense with getting a cab during the entire time sarah did not say more than ten words altogether but she was good and patient despite a growing fatigue that showed in her pinched face and shadowed eyes finally they were settled in the cab and alone at last as the horses drew away from the curb isabelle put her arm around the child and immediately felt the girl relax into the embrace for her part she felt her own heart respond without reserve to the trusting child my dear you are welcome with us isabelle said softly i wont insult your intelligence by saying ill be like a mother to you and that youll never miss your home you dont know me and i dont know you but in my school besides learning our lessons we set a great deal of store by taking care of each other and being good to each other and i do say that youll have friends here i hope youll be happy if you are not it will not be because the rest of us have not tried to help you be as happy as you can be so far from home sarah looked up at her and hesitated a moment my mother said she began then swallowed and went on my mother said you might be able to teach me things the kind of things mdela was teaching me with that name came a flash out of sarahs memory of a very black man with all the usual accouterments of a shaman a man as seen through sarahs eyes with an aura and talents and possessed of great wisdom and talents yes my dear i can she tapped sarahs nose gently and we will begin by teaching you how to keep your thoughts and memories out of other peoples heads unless you intend for them to see such things sarah gaped at her a moment and then laughed and isabelle smiled so it was well begun isabelle sat in her office reviewing the progress of each student in the days lessons the harton school was not all that large and she liked to know where each of her pupils stood in his or her studies on a daily basis in no small part because if any of the teachers fell ill it would be isabelle who took over the class until the teacher was well again she felt it the moment her husband crossed the threshold of course the moment when everything inside her relaxed and said yes my other self my other half is at my side again her heart rose as she looked up from her work feeling him draw nearer with every moment her door was openit was never closed unless she was having a private conferenceand he limped in frederick harton was a fine figure of a man despite his limp with broad shoulders the unruly wheatcolored hair of the cockney street urchin he had once been and merry blue eyes well my angel he said with that open grin she cherished how is your newest imp not an imp at all she replied getting up and coming around to his side of the desk to nestle unselfconsciously in his arms truth to be told shes a little dear a touch of telepathy both receptive and projective i believe and as young as she is it may get stronger i cant tell what else she has the most remarkable set of tales about a pet of hers that she left in africa that i hardly know whether or not to believe however at his look of inquiry she told him some of the stories little sarah jane had imparted to her about her grey parrot i know she believes them to be truei am just not certain how much of it is imagination and how much is real frederick harton looked down at her somberly this shaman gave her the bird in the first place did he not he asked she nodded and he said the bird was to be her protector he did and i see where you are going she pursed her lips thoughtfully well in that case i think we should assume the tales are true i wish she had been able to persuade her mother to allow her to bring the bird here if the bird is meant to be with her a way will be found he replied and kissed the top of her head and i believe if a way is found little sarah will prove to have more interesting talents than merely a touch of telepathy he let her go and rubbed his hands together now i am famished my love i trust vashti has prepared one of her excellent curries she had to laugh at that and reached up to ruffle his hair how fortunate we are that your tastes are so economical yes of course she has and she is waiting in the kitchen to spoil her favorite man the object of their discussions was tucked up in bed in her own room although it was a room that had another empty bed in it feeling very mixed emotions she was horribly homesick and longed for her parents and her parrot grey and her friends among the african tribe that had adopted the little family with an intensity that was painfulbut she was not as unhappy as she had been on the journey here in fact there was a part of her that actually felt as close to happy as she had been since she left memsab harton was everything mummy and papa had promised and more kind and warm and always with a comforting hug for anyone who looked in need of one the journey from africa to london had been sheer misery once alone with the children the nannies had been horribly standoffish and cold scolding anyone who cried or even looked as if they wanted to the children had had to share the tiniest of cabins two to a bunk the food had been bland and mostly cold the other children had not been particularly nice and one of the boys nigel pettigrew had three older brothers who had made this trip before him and he was full of stories about schools and how terrible they were until all of the children were ready to weep with fear as they got off the ship for sarah at least the nightmares had vanished like morning fog and now she felt sorry for the others who were not being sent to the harton school even though some of them had looked down their noses at her because she wasnt being sent to a firstclass academy when memsab had determined that sarahs tummy wasnt going to revolt shed done her best to give her a supper like the ones she was used to the same as the grownups were getting most of the children and both cooks were from india rather than africa so it was at best an approximation and she had milk for the first time in as long as she could remember milk tended to go off very quickly in the congo shed never had a curry before but it all agreed with her and if it tasted strange it also tasted good and didnt make her feel half starved like the watereddown tea and toast and thin broth and gruel which was all the three english nannies seemed to think suitable for children on the ship now she was in a soft bed with enough blankets to make a tropicraised child finally feel warm again and with a little fire in the grate to act as a night light she sighed and felt all of her tense muscles relax at last for all of her nine years until this moment sarah jane lyonwhite had lived contentedly with her parents in the heart of africa her father was a physician her mother a nurse and they worked at a protestant mission in the congo she had been happy there not the least because her mother and father were far more enlightened than many another mission workeras sarah well knew having seen others when she and her mother visited other mission hospitals her parents took the cause of healing as being more sacred than that of conversion even though they were technically supposed to be saving souls as well as lives somehow that part never seemed to take any sort of precedence and they undertook to work with the natives and made friends instead of enemies among the shamans and medicine people because of this sarah had been a cherished and protected child by everyone around her although she was no stranger to the many dangers of life in the congo when she was six and far older in responsibility than most of her peers one shaman had brought her a parrot chick still in quills he taught her how to feed and care for it and told her that while it was still an immature bird she was to protect it but when it was grown it would protect and guide her she had called the parrot grey and the bird had become her best friendand she missed grey now more even than her parents her parents had sent her to live in england for the sake of her health now this was quite the usual thing it was thought that english children were more delicate than their parents and that the inhospitable humors of hot climes would make them sicken and die not that their parents didnt sicken and die quite as readily as the children who were in fact far sturdier than they were given credit forbut it was thought by anxious mothers that the climate of england would be far kinder to them so sarahs mummy had carefully explained to her and explained that the climate of england would probably be bad for grey and so grey would have to remain behind though why if the climate was supposed to be good for sarah it could be bad for grey mummy had not been able to sufficiently explain perhaps if im good memsab will tell mummy that grey must come here she whispered to the friendly shadows around her bed some of the other children already had petstwo of the boys and one of the girls had rabbits one girl had a canary and there were fine fat contented cats roaming about perfectly prepared to plop into any lap that offered itself all of whom seemed to belong to the school in general rather than anyone in particular so it seemed that memsab was more than willing to allow additions to the menagerie provided any additions were properly taken care of if there was one thing that sarah was well versed in it was how to take care of grey and she had already determined that the same vegetableandrice curries that the cooks made for the school meals would serve grey very well so food would not be a problem and this room was warm enough and memsab had explained and sarah saw no reason to doubt her that she had made it very clear to the cats that while they were welcome to feast on as many mice and rats and insects as they could catch anything with feathers was strictly offlimits so that was sorted all she had to do really was figure out a way to ask memsab to explain to mummy and as she tried to puzzle out how to do that the weariness of a journey that had been much too long and too stressful and the release of discovering she was in a safe and welcoming place all caught up with her and she fell asleep sarahs first day had been good but the ones that followed were better not that the other children were all angelic darlings who took her to themselves and never teased herbecause they werent but bullying was not allowed and teasing was met with remonstrations from every adult in authority from the two indian ayahs who cared for the babies to memsab herself so that it was kept to a minimum and if sarah didnt make any bosom friends partly because she was more used to the company of adults than children she at least got along reasonably well with all of the other children her own age and for the most part enjoyed their company as far as schooling went she was ahead of most of them in most subjects since both mummy and papa had given her lessons so that wasnt a worry and it wasnt that she didnt make fast friendsbecause she did it just wasnt another child the third day of her residence she went into the kitchen in search of a rag to clean up some spilled water to find a very slim quite diminutive very dark man in a turban sitting patiently at the table waiting for tea there was something about him that drew her strongly perhaps it was that she could not hear his thoughts and yet there was no sense that he was hiding anything only that he had the kind of knowledge and discipline that memsab was trying to train her in he turned to look at her as she came in and nodded to her or she would not have said anything but the nod seemed to invite a response hello she said gravely and offered her hand im sarah jane ive just come im from africa he took it and bowed over it i am agansing he told her just as gravely i am from india i am a gurkha as it happened there had been enough british military visitors passing through the congo and taking advantage of the missions medical facilities and hospitality that sarah knew what a gurkha was in fact she had seen some and her papa had told her about them that they were exceedingly brave exceedingly good warriors and so trusted they had their very own regiment she blinked why are you here she asked boldly because while many many gurkhas were in service to the empire once they retired they always went home to the hills in nepal rather than coming to england i have no family except memsab and sahib agansing said without taking offense my family perished in a mudslide when i was younger than you and i never had other family except my regiment and my sworn brother sahib harton when sahib was to muster out he offered me a home and work it is also so with selim and karamjit who are his sworn brothers as well karamjit is a sikh we three guard sahib memsab and you children though i am usually with sahib at his warehouse selim she knew from the name alone was likely to be a moslem and her eyes went round many indians came to africa to become storekeepers and the like in the cities and sarah knew very well how unlikely it was that a gurkha a moslem a sikh and the other hindu and buddhist servants that she also knew were here would coexist amicably in the same household agansing smiled at her surprise and then smiled over her head karamjit my friend he said little missy sarah is come to us from africa and we surprise her sarah turned another surprise because she could almost always tell when someone had come up behind her and she had not sensedanything there was a very tall very dark man in a turban standing there regarding her with grave eyes welcome missy sarah he said holding out his hand she shook it we are a surprising tribe here i do think though you will not meet with agansing and selim often you will see me my duties keep me mostly here though she could sense nothing from them she had the feeling a feeling so strong that she had never felt anything like it except in the presence of the shaman mdela who had given her grey that she could trust these men with anything and she gave karamjit one of her rare smiles we need guarding mrkaramjit she asked he nodded the leopards and tigers that prowl outside our gates are of the twofooted kind he told her solemnly and the more dangerous for that so you must not venture out of the garden except with another grown person she nodded then hesitated and looked from one to the other for she knew without knowing how she knew that both these men had knowledge that she needed can you she hesitated then ventured it all can you help me be quiet in my mind like you are she begged memsab gives me lessons but youre better than she is because youre so quiet you arent even there and i know i need to be better the men exchanged a glance and it was karamjit who answered i will if it suits memsab if i do you will pledge me the obedience that i gave to my master for the teaching is not easy and needs much patience and she knew at that moment that she had gained the respect and the friendship of both these men i promise she swore she went and told memsab what she had done at once of course in order to gain that permission and as she had suspected memsab entirely approved karamjit and agansing both know meditation techniques that i never learned she said to sarah and if you have the patience at your young age to learn them they will be very good for you you can use the conservatory its quiet and you can tell karamjit i have given you permission to do so and thank him for agreeing to teach you that was an astonishing privilege as children were not allowed in the conservatory or hothouse as one of the boys called it without an adult this was in part because all the conservatory walls were glass and children and glass walls usually do not coexist well and in part it was because the adults used it as a refuge since children were allowed to come and go in virtually every other room of the school so having one place where there was some peace from childish racket was a necessary thing as sarah now knew the school had not originally been built for such a function it had been converted from an enormous house and grounds that had once belonged to some very wealthy georgian merchant or so memsab said but which had been abandoned when the london neighborhood in which it stood began to deteriorate now it was a very bad neighborhood indeed which was why memsab and sahib had been able to afford such an enormous place when they looked for a building to use as their school the bad neighborhood was one of the reasons why it was not a firstclass school firstclass schools were situated outside of cities far from bad neighborhoods bad air and the dangers and temptations of a metropolis but the people who sent their children here like sarahs own parents had very particular reasons for choosing it mostly they only wanted their children to be cherishedbut there were several other children here who also had what memsab referred to as talents now sarah had been just old enough and just sensitive enough before she left that she knew very well her parents shared mdelas magic though she could not herself duplicate it and she knew that though she did not have that sort of power she had always been able to talk to grey in her head and she could often see the thoughts of other peopleand these were things her parents could not do as mummy had told her now that she was here the people at the school were going be able to help her sort these things she could do out apparently other people knew that memsab and sahib could do this too and probably those people felt that being sorted out was the most important thing that their children could learn so thank you memsab she said sincerely dimly sensing that karamjit did not often offer his services in this business of being sorted out and that though this would be a great deal of work the reward was likely to be very high if she mastered what he could teach and that she had gained a very very valuable teacher perhaps one of the most valuable she was ever likely to have as long as she lived she went back to the kitchen where karamjit was still waiting memsab says to thank you that you will teach me and that we can use the conservatory she told him one dark eyebrow rose but that was the only way in which karamjit showed that he found the second statement remarkable memsab is wise he replied and paused you have a question why are you quieter in your mind than memsab she asked he pondered that for a moment while vashti one of the cooks pretended to ignore them both out of politeness for what was a private conversation memsab believes that it is because of the way i was taught he said finally this is only in part true it is because of what i was taught memsab has not learned this because she cannot not because of ignorance it isit is exactly that reason that you cannot learn what your parents do memsab is not even truly aware that i do this thingthat i become not there to all inner senses unless i wish to be there thusly and suddenly to her astonishment she sensed him just as she could sense anyone else then just as suddenly he was gone again except of course that he was still sitting right there you and i are alike in this missy sarah karamjit continued just as agansing and selim and i are it is uncommon sometimes it means that one is to be a kind of warrior though not always she thought that over i dont feel like a warrior she said truthfully he shrugged one need not have this to be a warrior sometimes it is a protection nevertheless this is why memsab cannot teach you you must be very diligent and very patient it is a skill that takes years to learn and a lifetime to master so you must not expect to be proficient any time soon she nodded like being a doctor he smiled very like now here is your first lesson in patience i will undertake to begin your teaching only after i feel that you have settled well into the school i will choose the time she sighed a little disappointed but knowing better than to arguebecause mdela had schooled her in much the same way and since that was clearly karamjits way of saying you can go now she excused herself besides it was teatime sarah was used to being taught in a very large class she had been learning her letters along with the rest of the african children whose parents thought it wise to learn the foreigners ways unlike some missions there was neither bribery nor coercion involved in getting the african children to come to school but sarahs parents had pointed out that whether the natives liked it or not the foreigners had the guns the soldiers and the big ships to bring more of both that they were unlikely to be rid of them and it would be a good thing to not have to rely on translators who might lie and might come from another tribe altogether and that it would be an even better thing to be able to read treaties and agreements for themselves and not depend on someone else to say what was in such things and it was the tribal chief who had thought it over and decreed that those who were apt to the teaching should come there had been nearly thirty people in sarahs class and only one teacher there were only six in this class and she had three different teachers to her mind this was quite astonishing a tall thin woman miss payne taught reading penmanship grammar and literature she looked as if she was the sort who would be very cross all the time but in fact she was quiet and reserved and when she got excited her cheeks went quite pink but there were no other signs of her state other than that she was evidently someone memsab trusted and she always seemed to know when one of her students was having difficulties because she always came right to the desk to help him or her out professor hawthorne an old man who spoke very slowly and with great passion about mathematics was in charge of teaching that subject and geometry as well he did not have anything like the patience of miss payne and if he thought a pupil was being lazy he was able to deliver quite a tonguelashing the ability to understand mathematics he would say with vehemence is the only thing that distinguishes man from the lesser animals sarah decided that she was not going to tell him that grey could count madame jeanette taught french latin and history she spoke french with a parisian accent which she was quite proud of she was also extremely pretty and young and there were rumors among the boys that she had been a ballet dancer at the paris opera or perhaps a cancan girl at the moulin rouge sarah thought that the boys would be quite disappointed if they learned the trutha truth that sarah had inadvertently overheard when madame jeanette was thinking very hard one day the truth was simply that she was extremely welleducated but that her family had fallen on hard times and she had to go be a schoolteacher or a governess after several wretched postings a friend had directed her to england and memsab memsab and sahib placed no restrictions on her movements did not spy upon her did not forbid her to have beaus and encouraged her to spend all the time she liked at the british museum outside of lessons the tiny difference in pay was far outweighed by the enormous difference in freedom to her mind and lately there was a handsome young barrister who kept taking the carrel next to hers in the reading room there were four other teachers not counting the nursery teachers but sarah wasnt taking any classes from any of them madame jeanette was perfectly normal but professor hawthorne and miss payne hadsomethingabout them sarah didnt know just what it was yet but she had the feeling there was a great deal more to both of them than appeared on the surface the other five children in her class were very nice butwell sarah was just used to spending a great deal of time in the company of adults or people who acted like adults and it didnt seem to her as if she had much in common with the others they invited her to play in their games but they seemed relieved when she declined she was a great deal more attracted to some of the older children but they ignored the younger ones and she couldnt think of a good way to get their attention so for the first month she spent most of her free time alone in the kitchen with the cooks and their helpers or with karamjit often she simply followed karamjit on his rounds he didnt seem to mind in fact when he wasnt busy he would talk to her as if she were a grown person telling her about his home in india asking her about africa and sometimes he would drop little nuggets of information about the school the teachers and how it had all come to be it was all quite interesting and during the daytime enough to keep her from being at all lonely but at nightat night she wished for she wouldnt call it praying which she instinctively knew should be reserved for very special needs for two things a friend a real friend another girl by preference and grey nanthat was her only name for no one had told her of any otherlurked anxiously about the back gate of the big house she was new to this neighborhood for her slatternly mother had lost yet another job in a gin mill and they had been forced to move all the way across whitechapel and this part of london was as foreign to nan as the wilds of australia she had been told by more than one of the children hereabouts that if she hung about the back gate after tea a strange man with a towel wrapped about his head would come out with a basket of food and give it out to any child who happened to be there now there were not as many children willing to accept this offering as might have been expected even in this poor neighborhood they were afraid of the man afraid of his piercing black eyes his swarthy skin and his way of walking like a great hunting cat some suspected poison in the food others murmured that he and the woman of the house were foreigners and intended to kill english children with terrible curses on the food they offered but nan was faint with hunger she hadnt eaten in two days and was willing to dare poison curses and anything else for a bit of bread furthermore nan had a secret defense under duress she could often sense the intent and even dimly hear the thoughts of others that was how she avoided her mother when it was most dangerous to approach her as well as avoiding other dangers in the streets themselves nan was certain that if this man had any ill intentions she would know it still as teatime and twilight both approached she hung back a little from the wroughtiron gate beginning to wonder if it wouldnt be better to see what if anything her mother brought home if shed found a jobor a genlmunthere might be a farthing or two to spare for food before aggie spent the rest on gin behind the high grimy wall the big house loomed dark and ominous against the smoky lowering sky and the strange carved creatures sitting atop every pillar in the wall and every corner of the house fair gave nan the shivers whenever she looked at them there were no two alike and most of them were beasts out of a rummys worst deliriums the only one that nan could see that looked at all normal was a big gray bird with a fat body and a hooked beak that sat on top of the righthand gatepost of the back gate nan had no way to tell time but as she waited growing colder and hungrierand more nervouswith each passing moment she began to think for certain that the other children had been having her on teatime was surely long over the tale theyd told her was nothing more than that something to gull the newcomer with it was getting dark there were no other children waiting and after dark it was dangerous even for a child like nan wise in the ways of the evil streets to be abroad disappointed and with her stomach a knot of pain nan began to turn away from the gate i think that there is no one here missy sab said a low deep voice heavily accented sounding disappointed nan hastily turned back and peering through the gloom she barely made out a tall dark form with a smaller one beside it no karamjitlook there replied the voice of a young girl and the smaller form pointed at nan a little girl ran up to the gate and waved through the bars hello im sarahwhats your name would you like some tea bread weve plenty the girls voice also strangely accented had none of the imperiousness that nan would have expected coming from the child of a toff she sounded only friendly and helpful and that more than anything was what drew nan back to the wroughtiron gate indeed missy sarah speaks the truth the man said and as nan drew nearer she saw that the other children had not exaggerated when they described him his head was wrapped around in a cloth he wore a long highcollared coat of some bright stuff and white trousers that were tucked into glossy boots he was as fiercely erect as the iron gate itself lean and angular as a hunting tiger with skin so dark she could scarcely make out his features and eyes that glittered at her like beads of black glass but strangest and perhaps most ominous of all nan could sense nothing from the dark man he might not even have been there there was a blank wall where his thoughts should have been the little girl beside him was perfectly ordinary by comparison a bright little jennywren of a thing not pretty but sweet with a trusting smile that went straight to nans heart nan had a motherly side to her the younger children of whatever neighborhood she lived in tended to flock to her look up to her and follow her lead she in her turn tried to keep them out of trouble and whenever there was extra to go around she fed them out of her own scant stocks but the tall fellow frightened her and made her nervous especially when further moments revealed no more of his intentions than nan had sensed before the girls bright eyes noted that and she whispered something to the dark man as nan withdrew a little he nodded and handed her a basket that looked promisingly heavy then he withdrew out of sight leaving the little girl alone at the gate the child pushed the gate open enough to hand the basket through please wont you come and take this its awfully heavy in spite of the clear and open brightness of the little girls thoughts ten years of hard living had made nan suspicious the child might know nothing of what the dark man wanted woire yer givin food away she asked edging forward a little but not yet quite willing to take the basket the little girl put the basket down on the ground and clasped her hands behind her back well memsab says that she wont tell maya and vashti to make less food for tea because she wont have us going hungry while were growing and she says that old stale toast is fit only for starlings so people ought to have the good of it before it goes stale and she says that theres no reason why children outside our gate have to go to bed hungry when we have enough to share and mummy and papa say that sharing is charity and charity is one of the cardinal virtues so memsab is being virtuous which is a good thing because shell go to heaven and she would make a good angel most of that came out in a rush that quite bewildered nan especially the last about cardinal virtues and heaven and angels but she did understand that memsab whoever that was must be one of those daft religious creatures that gave away food free for the taking and nans own mum had told her that there was no point in letting other people take what you could get from people like that so nan edged forward and made a snatch at the basket handle she tried that is it proved a great deal heavier than shed thought and she gave an involuntary grunt at the weight of it be careful the little girl admonished mischievously its heavy yer moighto warned me nan said a bit indignant and more than a bit excited if this wasnt a trickif there wasnt a brick in the basketoh shed eat well tonight and tomorrow too come back tomorrow the little thing called as she shut the gate and turned and skipped toward the house remember me im sarah jane and ill bring the basket tomorrow thankee sarah jane nan called back belatedly then just in case these strange creatures would think better of their generosity she made the basket and herself vanish into the night isabelle listened to sarahs version of the meeting at the gate and nodded gravely she had already gotten karamjits narrative and the two tallied both sarah and karamjit sensed nascent talent in the child this must have been the talent that she herself had sensed a day or two ago and had sent out a gentle lure for it looked as if her bait had been taken probably the little girl in question had very minimal control over what she could do in her world it would be enough that she had the sense of danger before something happened to her that might well be enough for the short run at any rate but her own husband had been a street boy collected from a sad and deadend life by another talented benefactor and if this child was just as salvageable isabelle would see to it that she was taken care of as well thank you sarah she told the child standing before her id like you to make friends with this little girl if she will let you we will see what can be done for her sarah beamed and it occurred to isabelle that the poor little thing was very lonely here so far she had made no close friends this chance encounter might change that for the better good there was nothing like catching two birds with one stone nan came earlier the next day bringing back the nowempty basket and found sarah jane waiting at the gate to her disappointment there was no basket waiting beside the child and nan almost turned back but sarah saw her and called to her before she could fade back into the shadows of the streets karamjit is bringing the basket in a bit the child said theres things memsab wants you to have andwhat am i to call you its rude to call you girl but i dont know your name nan nan replied feeling as if a cart had run over her this child though younger than nan herself had a way of taking over a situation that was all out of keeping with nans notion of how things were supposed to be the children of the rich were not supposed to notice the children of the poor except on boxing day on which occasion they were supposed to distribute sweets and whatever outworn or broken things they could no longer use and the rich were not supposed to care if the children of the poor went to bed hungry because being hungry would encourage them to work harder wot kindo place is this anyway its a school a boarding school sarah said promptly memsab and her husband have it for the children of people who live in india mostly memsab cant have children herself which is very sad but she says that means she can be a mother to us instead memsab came from india and thats where karamjit and selim and maya and vashti and the others are from too they came with her except for some of the teachers yer mean the black feller nan asked bewildered yer from injuh too no sarah said shaking her head africa i wish i was back there her face paled and her eyes misted and nan moved by an impulse she did not understand tried to distract her with questions wots it loik then izit loik lunnun like london oh no it couldnt be less like london nans ploy worked the child giggled at the idea of comparing the congo with this gray city and she painted a vivid word picture of the green jungles teeming with birds and animals of all sorts of the natives who came to her father and mother for medicines mummy and papa dont do what some of the others dothey went and talked to the magic men and showed them they werent going to interfere in the magic work and now whenever they have a patient who thinks hes cursed they call the magic man in to help and when a magic man has someone that his magic cant help right away he takes the patient to mummy and papa and they all put on feathers and charms and mummy and papa give him white medicine while the magic man burns his herbs and feathers and makes his chants and everyone is happy there havent been any uprisings at our station for ever so long and our magic men wont let anyone put black chickens at our door one of them gave me grey and i wanted to bring her with me but mummy said i shouldnt now the child sighed and looked woeful again wots a grey nan asked shes a polly a grey parrot with the beautifullest red tail the medicine man gave her to me when she was all prickles he showed me how to feed her with mashedup yams and things shes so smart she follows me about and she can say oh hundreds of things the medicine man said that she was to be my guardian and keep me from harm but mummy was afraid the smoke in london would hurt her and i couldnt bring her with me sarah looked up at the fat stone bird on the gatepost above her thats why memsab gave me that gargoyle to be my guardian instead we all have them each child has her own and that ones mine she looked down again at nan and lowered her voice to a whisper sometimes when i get lonesome i come here and talk to her and its like talking to grey nan nodded her head understanding oi useta go an talkt a stachew in onea the yards till we adta move it looked loik me grammum felt loik i was talkin to er i fair did a footstep on the gravel path made nan look up and she jumped to see the tall man with the head wrap standing there as if he had come out of the thin air she had not sensed his presence and once again even though he stood materially before her she could not sense anything like a living man there he took no notice of nan which she was grateful for instead he handed the basket he was carrying to sarah jane and walked off without a word sarah passed the basket to nan it was heavier this time and nan thought she smelled something like roasted meat oh if only theyd given her the drippings from their beef her mouth watered at the thought i hope you like these sarah said shyly as nan passed her the muchlighter empty basket memsab says that if youll keep coming back im to talk to you and ask you about london she says thats the best way to learn about things she says otherwise when i go out i might get into trouble i dont understand nans eyes widened at the thought that the head of a school had said anything of the sortbut sarah jane hardly seemed like the type of child to lie all roit ispose she said dubiously if youll be ere soll oi the next day faithful as the rising sun sarah was waiting with her basket and nan was invited to come inside the gate she wouldnt venture any farther in than a bench in the garden but as sarah asked questions she answered them as bluntly and plainly as she would any similar question asked by a child in her own neighborhood sarah learned about the dangers of the dark side of london firsthandand oddly although she nodded wisely and with clear understanding they didnt seem to frighten her garn nan said once when sarah absorbed the interesting fact that the opium den a few doors from where nan and her mother had a room had pitched three dead men out into the street the night before yer aint never seen nothin loik that you forget mummy and papa have a hospital and its very dangerous where they are sarah replied matteroffactly ive seen dead men and dead women and even babies when nkumba came in clawed up by a lion i helped bring water and bandages while my parents sewed him up when there was a blackwater fever i saw lots of people die it was horrid and sad but i didnt fuss because nkumba and papa and mummy were worked nearly to bones and needed me to be good nans eyes widened again wot else ysee she whispered impressed in spite of herself after that the two children traded stories of two very different sorts of jungles despite its dangers nan thought that sarahs was the better of the two she learned other things as well that memsab was a completely remarkable woman for she had a sikh a gurkha two moslems two buddhists and assorted hindus working in peace and harmony togetherand mummy said in her letter that its easier to get leopards to herd sheep than that memsab was by no means a fool the sikh and the gurkha shared guard duty patrolling the walls by day and night one of the hindu women was one of the ayahs who took care of the smallest children the rest of the motley assortment were servants and even teachers she heard many stories about the remarkable grey who really did act as sarahs guardian if sarah was to be believed sarah described times when she had inadvertently gotten lost she had called frantically for grey who was allowed to fly free and the bird had come to her leading her back to familiar paths grey had kept her from eating some pretty but poisonous berries by flying at her and nipping her fingers until she dropped them grey alerted the servants to the presence of snakes in the nursery always making a patrol before she allowed sarah to enter and once according to sarah when she had encountered a lion on the path grey had flown off and made sounds like a young gazelle in distress attracting the lions attention before it could scent sarah she led it away and didnt come back to me until it was too far away to get to me before i got home safe the little girl claimed solemnly grey is very clever nan didnt know whether to gape at her or laugh she couldnt imagine how a mere bird could be intelligent enough to talk much less act with purpose nan had breath to laugh with nowadays thanks to baskets that held more than bread the food she found in there though distinctly odd was always good and she no longer felt out of breath and tired all the time she had stopped wondering and worrying about why memsab took such an interest in her and simply accepted the gifts without question they might stop at any moment she accepted that without question too the only thing she couldnt accept so easily was the manservants eerie mental silence but it didnt unnerve her as it once had she wanted desperately to know why she couldnt sense him but it didnt unnerve her if she couldnt read him she could read the way he walked and acted and there was nothing predatory about him with regard to herself or sarah besides sarah trusted him nan had the feeling that sarahs trust wasnt ever given lightly or wrongly and how is sarahs pet street sparrow frederick asked as isabelle brooded at the window that overlooked the garden karamjit thinks she is talented isabelle replied watching sarah chatter animatedly to her friend as they took the empty basket back to the kitchen in the evening gloom i dont sense anything but shes quite young and i doubt she can do anything much beyond a few feet her husband sat down in a chair beside the window and she glanced over at him theres something about all of this that is worrying you he said im not the precognitive butyes we have a sudden influx of talents and it might be nothing more than that we are the only place to train young talents whereas there are dozens who are schooling their elemental magicians still my training says that coincidences among the talented are virtually unheard of and an ingathering of talents means that talents will be needed there it was out in the open frederick grimaced theres something in the air he agreed but nothing i can point to and saythere it is thats whats coming do you want to spring the trap on this one or let her come to our hands of her own will if we trap her we lose her isabelle told him turning away from the window and while we are ingathering talents they are all very young whatever is going to happen will not happen this week or even this year let her come to us on her ownor not at all how is your mother sarah asked one day as they sat in the garden since the day before nan had confessed that aggie been on a tear and had consumed or so nan feared something stronger and more dangerous than gin nan shook her head i dunno she replied reluctantly aggie didn wake up when i went out thas not roight she uslly at least waked uptfoind out wha i got she don loik them baskets cause it means i don go beggin as much and if you dont beg money she cant drink sarah observed shrewdly you hate begging dont you mostly i don like gettin kicked an cursed at nan temporized it aint loik im gettin underfoot but sarahs questions were coming too near the bone tonight and nan didnt want to have to deal with them she got to her feet and picked up her basket i gotter go she said abruptly sarah rose from her seat on the bench and gave nan a penetrating look nan had the peculiar feeling that the child was looking at her thoughts and deciding whether or not to press her further all right sarah said it is getting dark it wasnt but nan wasnt about to pass up the offer of a graceful exit tis that she said promptly and squeezed through the narrow opening karamjit had left in the gate but she had not gone four paces when two roughlooking men in shabby tweed jackets blocked her path you nan killian said one hoarsely then when nan stared at him blankly added aggie killians girl the answer was surprised out of her she hadnt been expecting such a confrontation and she hadnt yet managed to sort herself out yees she said slowly good the first man grunted yer ma sent us shes gonet a new place an she wants ustshow y the way now several thoughts flew through nans mind at that moment the first was that as they were paid up on the rent through the end of the week she could not imagine aggie ever vacating before the time was up the second was that even if aggie had set up somewhere else she would never have sent a pair of strangers to find nan and third was that aggie had turned to a more potent intoxicant than ginwhich meant she would need a deal more money and aggie had only one thing left to sell nan their minds were such a roil that she couldnt hear any distinct thoughts but it was obvious that they meant her no good wait a minnit nan said her voice trembling a little as she backed away from the two men edging around them to get to the street didjer say aggie killians gel me ma aint called killian yer got th wrong gel it was at that moment that one of the men lunged for her with a curse he had his hands nearly on her and would have gotten her too except for one bit of interference sarah came shooting out of the gate like a little bullet she bodyslammed the fellow going into the back of his knees and knocking him right off his feet she danced out of the way as he fell scooting past him in the nick of time ran to nan and caught her hand tugging her toward the street run she commanded imperiously and nan ran the two of them scrabbled through the dark alleys and twisted streets without any idea where they were only that they had to shake off their pursuers unfortunately the time that nan would have put into learning her new neighborhood like the back of her grimy little hand had been put into talking with sarah and before too long even nan was lost in the maze of dark fetid streets then their luck ran out altogether and they found themselves staring at the blank wall of a building in a deadend culdesac they whirled around hoping to escape before they were trapped but it was already too late the bulky silhouettes of the two men loomed against the fading light at the end of the street oos yer friend ducky the first man purred think shed loiktcome with to nans astonishment sarah stood straight and tall and even stepped forward a pace i think you ought to go away and leave us alone she said clearly youre going to find yourselves in a lot of trouble the talkative man laughed thems big words from such a little gel he mocked we aint leavin wiout we collect whats ours an a bit more fer th trouble yer caused nan was petrified with fear shaking in every limb as sarah stepped back putting her back to the damp wall as the first man touched sarahs arm she shrieked out a single word grey as sarah cried out the name of her pet nan let loose a wordless prayer for something anything to come to their rescue she never would have believed that anything would then something screamed behind the man startled and distracted for a moment he turned for a moment a fluttering shape obscured his face and he screamed in agony shaking his head violently clawing at whatever it was get it off he screamed at his partner get it off get what off the other man asked bewildered and suddenly frightened backing away a little from his agitated partner there aint nothin there the man flailed frantically at the front of his face but whatever had attacked him had vanished without a trace but not before leading more substantial help to the rescue out of the dusk and the first wisps of fog karamjit and another swarthy man ran on noiseless feet in their hands were cudgels which they used to good purpose on the two who opposed them nor did they waste any effort clubbing the two senseless with a remarkable economy of motion then without a single word each of the men scooped up a girl in his arms and bore them back to the school at that point finding herself safe in the arms of an unlookedfor rescuer nan felt secure enough to break down into hysterical tears the man who had hernot the silent karamjitpatted her back awkwardly then muffled her face against his coat and for the first time since her granny had died nan felt safe enough to take advantage of the comfort offered she clutched at him and sobbed until they passed through the gates of the school nor was that the end of it though she completely expected to be set on her feet and shooed away she found herself bundled up into the sacred precincts of the school itself plunged into the first hot bath of her life wrapped in a clean flannel gown and put into a real bed sarah was in a similar bed beside her it all happened so swiftly and with such an economy of action that she was hardly able to think until that moment as she sat there numb a plainlooking woman with beautiful eyes came and sat down on the foot of sarahs bed and looked from one to the other of them well the lady said at last what have you two to say for yourselves nan couldnt manage anything but that was all right since sarah wasnt about to let her get in a word anyway the child jabbered like a monkey a confused speech about nans mother the men shed sold nan to the virtue of charity the timely appearance of grey and a great deal more besides the lady listened and nodded and when sarah ran down at last she turned to nan i believe sarah is right in one thing she said gravely i believe we will have to keep you now both of yousleep the ladys eyes seemed to get very very big nans own head filled with peace and she found herself lying down obedient as a lamb and to nans surprise she fell asleep immediately isabelle harton stood leaning against the doorframe of the girls room for some time feeling limp with relief that had been a very near thing if little sarah had not been able to summon the spirit of her parrot she sensed her husband behind her and relaxed into his arms as he put them around her holding her with her back to his chest well my angel i assume we are going to keep this ragged little street sparrow sarah desperately needs a friend she temporized you dont fool me wife he replied tightening his arms around her you would march straight out there and bring them all in if you thought we could afford to feed them but i agree with you sarah needs a friend and this friend is both clever and talented karamjit says she is definitely a telepath and possibly other things we cant leave one of those wandering about on the streets you wanted her to come to you of her own accord well here she is and she doesnt look like shes interested in leaving when she comes into her full power shed either go mad or become a masterful criminal of some sort and in either case it would be you and i who would have to deal with her or one of our pupils but youre right i would much rather salvage her now she relaxed further with a sigh thank you for indulging me no such thing im indulging both of us and it isnt as if the girl hasnt the potential to earn her keep if shes any good with the infants she can help the ayahs and that will save us the expense of another serving girl or nursemaid in the nursery he bent and kissed her cheek and she relaxed a little more he was right of course they needed another pair of hands in the nursery particularly at bath and bedtime and she had been worrying about how to pay for that pair of hands this just might work out perfectly for everyone concerned then ill ask if she wants to stay and make her the offer tomorrow she told him i doubt that shell turn us down he laughed not if she has any sense so ended nan killians introduction to the harton school she joyfully accepted memsabs offer of bed board and school in exchange for help with the babies and within days she was being idolized by the toddlers and fully accepted as the new pupil by the others and best of all she was sarah janes best friend she had never been anyones best friend before nor had she ever had a best friend of her own it was strange it was wonderful it gave her the most amazing feeling as if now there was something she could always count on and she hadnt had that feeling since her gran died but that was not the end to this part of the story a month later sarahs mother arrived with grey in a cage after an exchange of telegraphs and letters to which neither sarah nor nan had been privy nan had by then found a place where she could listen to what went on in the best parlor without being found and she glued her ear to the crack in the pantry to listen when sarah was taken into that hallowed room found grey senseless beside her perch sarahs mother was saying i thought it was a fit but the shaman swore that sarah was in trouble and the bird had gone to help grey awoke none the worse and i would have thought nothing more of the incident until your telegraph arrived and so you came very wisely bringing this remarkable bird memsab made chirping noises at the bird and an odd little voice said hello bright eyes memsab chuckled how much of strangeness are you prepared to believe in my dear she asked gently would you believe me if i told you that i have seen this bird once beforefluttering and pecking at my window then leading my men to rescue your child i can only answer with hamlet sarahs mother said after a pause that there are more things in heaven and earth than i suspected she paused again you know i think that my husband and i are elemental mages as are a great many of my friends which is why you got the recommendation for our school i understand your powers though frederick and i do not share them it was memsabs turn to pause nor does your daughter her powers are psychic in nature as you suspected though i have not yet deciphered them completely she is being instructed however not only by myself but by others who are even stronger in some aspects than i haha said the funny little voice theres a good friend cor i wunner what this elmental business is whatever it was it was new to nan who was only now getting used to the idea that her sense was a thing that could be trained and depended on and that she was most unusual for possessing it oh bless sarahs mother cried i hopedbut i wasnt sureone cant put such things in a letter true enough but some of us can read however imperfectly what is written with the heart rather than a pen memsab replied decidedly then i take it you are not here to remove sarah from our midst no came the soft reply i came only to see that sarah was well and to ask if you would permit her pet to be with her gladly memsab said though i might question which of the two was the pet clever bird said grey veeeeeery clever memsab laughed yes i am my feathered friend and you would do very well never to forget it a month had gone by since nan was brought into the harton school another child picked up food at the back gate of the harton school for boys and girls on the edge of whitechapel in london not nan killian children no longer shunned the back gate of the school although they treated its inhabitants with extreme caution adultsparticularly the criminals and most particularly the disreputable criminals who preyed on childrentreated the place and its inhabitants with a great deal more than mere caution word had gotten around that two child procurers had tried to take one of the pupils and had been found with arms and legs broken beaten senseless they survivedbut they would never walk straight or without pain again and even a toddler would be able to outrun them word had followed that anyone who threatened another child protected by the school would be found deadif he was found at all the three fierce swarthy blackfellas who served as the schools guards were rumored to have strange powers or be members of the thugee cult or worse it was safer just to pretend the school didnt exist and go about ones unsavory business elsewhere nan killian was no longer a child of the streets she was now a pupil at the school herself a transmutation that astonished her every morning when she awoke to find herself in a neat little dormitory room papered with roses and curtained in gingham made her often feel as if she was dreaming to then rise with the other girls dress in clean fresh clothing and go off to lessons in the hitherto unreachable realms of reading and writing was more than she had ever dared dream of she slept in the next bed over from sarahs in a room inhabited by only the two of them and the parrot grey and they now shared many latenight giggles and confidences instead of leftover tea bread nan also had a job she had not expected pure charity and would deep down have been suspicious if shed been offered this place for nothing but memsab had made it clear if she was to stay she had to work and nan was not at all averse to a bit of hard work she had always known somewhat to her own bemusement that the littlest children instinctively trusted her and would obey her when they obeyed no one else so nan paid for her tutoring and keep by helping nadra and mala the babies nurses or ayahs as they were called nadra and mala were from india as were most of the servants from the formidable guards the sikh karamjit the moslem selim and the gurkha agansing to the cooks maya and vashti mrsisabelle hartonor memsab as everyone called herand her husband had once been expatriates in india themselves master hartoncalled with ultimate respect sahib hartonnow worked as an adviser to an import firm his military service in india had left him with a small pension and a permanent limp and now nan knew why the harton school was here in the first place when he and his wife had returned they had learned quite by accident of the terrible conditions children returned to england to escape the dangers of the east often lived in relatives exploited or abused them schools maltreated and starved them and even the best schools ignored homesickness and loneliness insisting that the bereft children buck up and keep a stiff upper lip and above all never be seen to shed a tear children who had been allowed by their indulgent ayahs to run the nursery like miniature rajahs were suddenly subjected to the extreme discipline of tyrannical schoolmasters and the bullying of their elders originally they had resolved that the children of their friends back in the punjab at least would not have to face that kind of traumatic separation then as their reputation spread especially among those with a bent for the arcane other children were sent to them now there was a mix of purely ordinary children and those like nan and sarah with more senses than five here the children sent away in bewilderment by anxious parents fearing that they would sicken in the hot foreign lands found not a cold and alien place with nothing they recognized but the familiar sounds of hindustani the comfort and coddling of a native nanny and the familiar curries and rice to eat their new home if a little shabby held furniture made familiar from their years in the bungalows but most of all they were not told coldly to be a man or stop being a crybabyfor here they found friendly shoulders to weep out their homesickness on if there were no french dancing masters and cricket teams here there was a great deal of love and care if the furniture was unfashionable and shabby the children were wellfed and rosy and for a fewthose with what the hartons called talentsthere were lessons of another sort and their parents would not dream of sending them anywhere but here it never ceased to amaze nan that more parents didnt send their children to the harton school but some folks mistakenly trusted relatives to take better care of their precious ones than strangers and some thought that a school owned and operated by someone with a lofty reputation or a title was a wiser choice for a boy child who would likely join the civil service when he came of age and as for the girls there would always be those who felt that lessons by french dancing masters and language teachers lessons on the harp and in watercolor painting were more valuable than a sound education in the same basics given to a boy sometimes these parents learned of their errors in judgment the hard way ready for mlesson memsab nan called into the secondbest parlor which was memsabs private domain it was commonly understood that sometimes memsab had to do odd thingsimportant things that we dont need to know about sarah said wiselyand she might have to do them at a moments notice so it was better to announce oneself at the door before venturing over the threshold but today memsab was only reading a book and looked up at nan with a smile that transformed her plain face and made her eyes bright and beautiful by now nan had seen plenty of ladies who dressed in finer stuffs than memsabs simple artistic gown of common fabric made bright with embroidery courtesy of maya nan had seen the pictures of ladies who were acknowledged beauties like mrslillie langtry ladies who obviously spent many hours in the hands of their dressers and hairdressers rather than pulling their hair up into a simple chignon from which little curling strands of browngold were always escaping memsabs jewelry was not of diamonds and gold but odd heavy pieces in silver and semiprecious gems but in nans eyes not one of those other ladies was worth wasting a single glance upon then again nan was a little prejudiced come in nan the headmistress said patting the flowered sofa beside her invitingly youre doing much better already you know you have a quick ear thankee memsab nan replied flushing with pleasure she like any of the servants would gladly have laid down her life for memsab harton they all worshipped her blatantly and a word of praise from their idol was worth more than a pocketful of sovereigns nan sat gingerly down on the chintzcovered sofa and smoothed her clean pinafore with an unconscious gesture of pride memsab took a book of etiquette from the table beside her and opened it looking at nan expectantly go ahead dear good morning maam how do you do i am quite well i trust your family is fine nan began and waited for memsabs response which would be her cue for the next polite phrase the point here was not that nan needed to learn manners and mannerly speech but that she needed to lose the dreadful cadence of the streets which would doom her to poverty forever quite literally nan spoke the commonplace phrases slowly and with great care as much care as sarah took over her french an accurate analogy since the kings english as spoken by the middle and upper classes was nearly as much a foreign language to nan as french and latin were to sarah she had gotten the knack of it by thinking of it exactly as a foreign language once memsab had proven to her how much better others would treat her if she didnt speak like a guttersnipe she was still fluent in the language of the streets and often went out with karamjit as a translator when he went on errands that took him into the slums or the street markets but gradually her tongue became accustomed to the new cadences and her habitual speech marked her less as untouchable beautifully done memsab said warmly when nan finished her recitation your new assignment will be to pick a poem and recite it to me properly spoken and memorized i think id loikeliketo do one uv mrkiplings memsab nan said shyly memsab laughed i hope you arent thinking of gunga din you naughty girl the woman mockchided it had better be one from the jungle book or just so stories not something written in cockney dialect yes memsab i mean no memsab nan replied quickly ill pick a rightun mebbe the lullaby for the white seal you mustnt swim till youre six weeks old or your head will be sunk by your heels ever since discovering rudyard kiplings stories nan had been completely enthralled memsab often read them to the children as a gotobed treat for the stories often evoked memories of india for the children sent away that will do very well are you ready for the other lesson memsab asked so casually that no one but nan would have known that the other lesson was one not taught in any other school in this part of the world ithink so nan got up and closed the parlor door signaling to all the world that she and memsab were not to be disturbed unless someone was dying or the house was burning down for the next half hour memsab turned over cards and nan called out the next card before she turned it over when the last of the fiftytwo lay in the faceup pile before her nan waited expectantly for the results not at all bad you had almost half of them and all the colors right memsab said with content nan was disappointed she knew that memsab could call out all fiftytwo without an error though sarah could only get the colors correctly sahib brought me some things from the warehouse for you to try your feeling on memsab continued i truly think that is where one of your true talents lies dear nan sighed mournfully but knowin the cards would be a lot more useful she complained what so you can grow up to cheat foolish young men out of their inheritances now memsab actually laughed out loud try it dear and the gift will desert you at the time you need it most no be content with what you have and learn to use it wisely to help yourself and others but cardsharpin would help me an i could use the takins to help others nan couldnt resist protesting but she held out her hand for the first object anyway it was a carved beetle very interesting nan thought as she waited to feel what it would tell her it felt like pottery or stone and it was of a turquoise blue shaded with pale brown its old she said finally then really old old asmethusalum it was made for an important man but not a king or anything she tried for more but couldnt sense anything else thats all she said and handed it back to memsab now this the carved beetle that memsab gave her was for all intents and purposes identical to the one shed just held but immediately nan sensed the difference piff that uns new she also felt something else something of intent a sensation she readily identified since it was one of the driving forces behind commerce in whitechapel feller as made it figgers hes put one over on somebody excellent dear memsab nodded they are both scarabs a kind of goodluck carving found with mummieswhich are indeed often as old as methuselah the first one i knew was real as i helped unwrap the mummy myself to make sure there was no unrest about the spirit the second however was from a shipment that sahib suspected were fakes nan nodded interested to learn that this gift of hers had some practical application after all so could be i could tell people when they been gammoned very likely and quite likely that they would pay you for the knowledge as long as they dont think that you are trying to fool them as well here try this the next object placed in nans hand was a bit of jewelry a simple silver brooch with gems of cut iron nan dropped it as soon as it touched her hand overwhelmed by fear and horror lummy she cried without thinking he killed her she stared at the horrible thing as it lay on the floor at her feet who he and her were she had no sense of that would require more contact which she did not want to have but memsab didnt seem at all surprised she just shook her head very sadly and put the brooch back in a little box which she closed without a word she held out a childs locket on a worn ribbon dont be afraid nan she coaxed when nan was reluctant to accept it this one isnt bad i promise you nan took the locket gingerly but broke out into a smile when she got a feeling of warmth contentment and happiness she waited for other images to come and sensed a tired but exceedingly happy woman a proud man and oneno two strong and lively mites with the woman slyly nan glanced up at her mentor shes ad twins asnt she nan asked when was it i just got the letter and the locket today but it was about two months ago memsab replied the lady is my best friend in indias daughter who was given that locket by her mother for luck just before the birth of her children she sent it to me to have it duplicated as she would like to present one to each little girl id ave it taken apart an put half of th old un with half of the new un nan suggested and memsab brightened at the idea an excellent idea and i will do just that now dear are you feeling tired have you a headache weve gone on longer than we did at your last lesson nan nodded quite ready to admit to both memsab gave her stillthin shoulders a little hug and sent her off to her afternoon lessons nan had finally learned to relax and enjoy hugs shed never gotten one from her mother and her gran had not been inclined to physical demonstrations either her cheeks flushed with pleasure as she went off to her lesson figuring came harder to nan than reading shed already had some letters before she had arrived enough to spell out the signs on shops and stalls and the like and make out a word here and there on a discarded broadsheet when the full mystery of letters had been disclosed to her mastery had come as naturally as breathing and she was already able to read her beloved kipling stories with minimal prompting but numbers were a mystery arcane and she struggled with the youngest of the children to comprehend what they meant anything past one hundred baffled her for the moment and sarah did her best to help her friend after arithmetic came geography but for a child to whom kensington palace was the end of the universe it was harder to believe in the existence of arabia than of fairyland and heaven was quite as real and solid as south america for she reckoned that she had an equal chance of seeing either as for how all those odd names and shapes fit together well history came easier although she didnt yet grasp that it was as real as yesterday for to nan it was just a chain of linking stories perhaps that was why she loved the kipling stories so much for she often felt as out of place as mowgli when the human tribe tried to reclaim him at the end of lessons nan usually went to help nadra and mala in the nursery the children there ranging in age from two to five were a handful when it came to getting them bathed and put to bed they tried to put off bedtime as long as possible there were half a dozen of them which was just enough that when nadra and mala had finally gotten two of them into a bathtub the other four had slithered out and were running about the nursery like dripping naked apes screaming joyfully at their escape but tonight karamjit came for nan and sarah as soon as the history lesson was over summoning them with a look and a gesture as always the african parrot grey sat on sarahs shoulder she was so wellbehaved even to the point of being housebroken that she was allowed to be with her mistress from morning to night the handsome bird with the bright red tail had adapted very well to this new sort of jungle when sarahs mother brought her to her daughter sarah was very careful to keep her warm and out of drafts and she ate virtually the same food that the children did memsab seemed to understand the kind of diet that let her thrive she allowed her only a little of the chicken and beef and made certain that she filled up on carrots and other vegetables before she got any of the curried rice she loved so much in fact she often pointed to grey as an example to the other children who would rather have had sweets than green stuffs telling them that grey was smarter than they were for she knew what would make her grow big and strong being unfavorably compared to a bird often made the difference with the little boys in particular who were behaving better at table since the parrot came to live at the school so grey came along when karamjit brought them to the door of memsabs parlor cautioning them to wait quietly until memsab called them what do you suppose can be going on sarah asked curiously while grey turned her head to look at nan with her penetrating paleyellow eyes nan shushed her pressing her ear to the keyhole to see what she could hear theres another lady in there with memsab and she sounds sad nan said at last grey cocked her head to one side then turned his head upside down as she sometimes did when something puzzled her hurt she said quietly and made a little sound like someone crying nan had long since gotten used to the fact that grey noticed everything that went on around her and occasionally commented on it like a human person if the wolves in the jungle book could think and talk she reasoned why not a parrot she accepted greys abilities as casually as sarah who had raised the bird herself and had no doubt of the intelligence of her feathered friend had either of them acquired the wisdom of their elders they might have been surprised that memsab accepted those abilities too nan jumped back as footsteps warned her that the visitor had risen and was coming toward the door she and sarah pressed themselves back against the wall as the strange woman passed them her face hidden behind a veil she took no notice of the children but turned back to memsab katherine i believe going to this woman is a grave mistake on your part memsab told her quietly you and i have been friends since we were in school together you know that i would never advise you against anything you felt so strongly about unless i thought you might be harmed by it this woman does you no good the woman shook her head how could i be harmed by it she replied her voice trembling what possible ill could come of this a very great deal i fear memsab said her expression some combination of concern and other emotions that nan couldnt read impulsively the woman reached out for memsabs hand then come with me she cried if this woman cannot convince you that she is genuine and that she provides me with what i need more than breath itself then i will not see her again memsabs eyes looked keenly into her friends easily defeating the concealment of the veil about her features you are willing to risk her unmasking as a fraud and the pain for you that will follow i am certain enough of her that i know that you will be convinced even against your will the woman replied with certainty memsab nodded very well then you and iand these two girlswill see her together only now did the woman notice sarah and nan and her brief glance dismissed them as unimportant i see no reason why you wish to have children along but if you can guarantee they will behave and that is what it takes you to be convinced to see madame varonsky then so be it i will have an invitation sent to you for the next séance memsab smiled and patted her friends hand sometimes children see things more clearly than we adults do was all she replied i will be waiting for that invitation the woman squeezed memsabs hand then turned and left ushered out by one of the native servants memsab gestured to the two girls to precede her into the parlor and shut the door behind them what did you think of the lady nan asked their teacher as the two children took their places side by side on the loveseat they generally shared when they were in the parlor together nan assessed the woman as would any street child economics came first shes in mournin an shes gentry nan replied automatically silk gowns fer mournin is somethin only gentry kin afford i spect shes easyt gammon too paid no attentiontus an i was near enought get me hand into er purse an she would never be knowin till she was home an she didn ask fer a cabt be brung sos i reckon she keeps er carriage thats not jest gentry thas quality right on all counts my dear memsab said a bit grimly katherine has no more sense than one of the babies and never had her parents didnt spoil her but they never saw any reason to educate her in practical matters they counted on her finding a husband who would do all her thinking for her and as a consequence she is pliant to any hand that offers mastery she married into money her husband has a very high position in the colonial government nothing but the best school would do for her boy and a spoiled little lad he was too grey suddenly began coughing most realistically a series of terrible racking coughs and sarah turned her head to look into her eyes then she turned back to memsab hes dead isnt he the child said quite matteroffactly her little boy i mean grey knows he got sick and died thats who shes in mourning for quite right and as grey showed us he caught pneumonia memsab looked grim poor food icy rooms and barbaric treatment she threw up her hands and shook her head theres no reason to go on at least katherine has decided to trust her two youngest to us instead of the school her husband wanted shell bring them to nadra tomorrow nan and theyll probably be terrified so im counting on you to help nadra soothe them nan could well imagine that they would be terrified not only were they being left with strangers but they would know at least dimly that their brother had gone away to school and died they would be certain that the same was about to happen to them that however is not why i sent for you memsab continued katherine is seeing a medium do either of you know what that is sarah and nan shook their heads but grey made a rude noise sarah looked shocked but nan giggled and memsab laughed i am afraid that grey is correct in her opinions for the most part the woman told them a medium is a person who claims to speak with the dead and help the souls of the dead speak to the living her mouth compressed and nan sensed her carefully controlled anger all this is accomplished for a very fine fee i might add real mediums are very rare and i know all of the ones in england by name ho like them gypsy palm readers an the conjure men nan exclaimed in recognition aye theres a morta gammon there and thats sure you reckon this ladys been gammoned then yes i do and i would like you twothree she amended with a penetrating look at grey to help me prove it nan if there is trickery afoot do you think you could catch it nan had no doubt i bet i could she said cant be hardern keepin a hand out uv yer pocketor grabbin the wrist once its in good girlyou must remember to speak properly and only when youre spoken to though memsab warned her if this socalled medium thinks you are anything but a gentlyreared child she might find an excuse to dismiss the séance she turned to sarah now if by some incredible chance this woman is genuine could you and grey tell sarahs head bobbed so hard her curls tumbled into her eyes yes memsab she said with as much confidence as nan mluko the apprentice to the medicine man that gave me grey said that grey could tell when the spirits were there and someday i might too did he now memsab gave her a curious look how interesting well if grey can tell us if there are spirits or not that will be quite useful enough for our purposes are either of you afraid to go with me i expect the invitation will come quite soon again memsab had that grim look katherine is too choice a fish to be allowed to swim free for long madame will want to keep her under her control by consulting with her as often as possible and if she can she will get katherine to remain in england and become dependent on her sarah looked to nan for guidance and nan thought that her friend might be a little fearful despite her brave words but nan herself only laughed i aint afraid of nobodys sham ghost she said curling her lip scornfully an i aint sure id be afraid uv a real one wisely said nan spirits can only harm us as much as we permit them to nan thought that memsab looked relieved like maybe she hadnt wanted to count on their help until she actually got it thank you both of you she reached out and took their hands giving them a squeeze that said a great deal without words now both of you get back to whatever it was that i took you from i will let you know in plenty of time when our excursion will be it was past the babies bedtime so sarah and nan went together to beg maya for their delayed tea and carried the tray themselves up to the nowdeserted nursery they set out the tea things on one of the little tables feeling a mutual need to discuss memsabs strange proposition grey had her tea too a little bowl of curried rice carrots and beans they set it down on the table and grey climbed carefully down from sarahs shoulder to the tabletop where she selected a bean and ate it neatly holding in on one claw while she took small bites watching them both do you think there might be real ghosts sarah asked immediately shivering a little i mean what if this lady can bring real ghosts up grey and nan made the same rude noise at the same time it was easy to tell where grey had learned it gam nan said scornfully reckon that memsab only asked if you could tell as an outside bet but the livin people might be the ones as is dangerous she ate a bite of bread and butter thoughtfully i dunno as memsabs thought that far but that missus katherines a right easy mark an a fat un too people as is willint gammon the gentry might not be real happy about bein found out sarah nodded should we tell karamjit she asked showing a great deal more common sense than she would have before nan came into her life memsabs thinking hard about her friend but she might not think a bit about herself aye an selim an agansing an mebbe sahib too nan was a little dubious about that having only seen the lordly sahib from a distance ill ask selim to tell sahib if youll talk to karamjit and agansing sarah said knowing the surest route to the master from her knowledge of the school and its inhabitants but tell me what to look for three sets of eyes are better than two first thing whatever they want yout look at is gonna be what makes a fussnoises or voices or whatever nan said after a moment of thought i dunno how this medium stuff is gonna work but thats what happens when a purse gets nicked you gotta get the marks attention so he wont be thinkin of his pocket so whatever they want us to look at we look away from thats the main thing mebbe memsab can tell us what these things isspposed to be likeif i know whatst happen i kin guess what tricks theyre liket pull she finished her bread and butter and began her own curry shed quickly acquired a taste for the spicy indian dishes that the other children loved if there aint ghosts i bet they got somebody dressed upt look like one she grinned slyly at grey an i betcha a good pinch or a bite would make im yell proper and you couldnt hurt a real ghost with a pinch sarah nodded i suppose were just going to have to watch and wait and see what we can do nan as always ate as a street child would although her manners had improved considerably since coming to the school she inhaled her food rapidly so that no one would have a chance to take it from her she was already finished although sarah hadnt eaten more than half of her tea she put her plates aside on the tray and propped her head up on her hands with her elbows on the table we got to talk to karamjit agansing an selim thats the main thing she said thinking out loud they might know what we should do selim will come home with sahib sarah answered but karamjit is probably leaving the basket at the back gate right now and if you run you can catch him alone and he can tell agansing taking that as her hint for sarah had a way of knowing where most people were at any given time nan jumped to her feet and ran out of the nursery and down the back stairs flying through the kitchen much to the amusement of the cook vashti she burst through the kitchen door and ran down the path to the back gate so quickly she hardly felt the cold at all though she had run outside without a coat mustafa swept the garden paths free of snow every day but so soon after boxing day there were mounds of the stuff on either side of the path snow with a faint tinge of gray from the soot that plagued london in almost every weather somehow though the sooty air never got inside the school the air indoors in all the buildings was as clear as a spring day with a sea wind in the streets nan saw the sikh karamjit soon enough to avoid bouncing off his legs the tall dark immensely dignified man was bundled up to the eyes in a heavy quilted coat and two mufflers his head wrapped in a dark brown turban nan no longer feared him though she respected him as only a street child who has seen a superior fighter in action could karamjit she called as she slowed her headlong pace i needt talk wi ye there was an amused glint in the sikhs dark eyes though only much association with him allowed nan to see it and what does missy nan wish to speak of that she comes racing out into the cold like the wind from the mountains memsab asked ust help her with somethintheres this lady as is a meedeeyum that she thinks is gammonin her friend wethats sarah an grey an mewe says acourse but here nan stopped because she wasnt entirely certain how to tell an adult that she thought another adult didnt know what she was getting herself into i just got a bad feelin she ended lamely but karamjit did not belittle her concerns nor did he chide her instead his eyes grew even darker and he nodded come inside where it is warm he said i wish you to tell me more he sat her down at the kitchen table and gravely and respectfully asked maya to serve them both tea he took his with neither sugar nor cream but saw to it that nans was heavily sweetened and at least half milk now he said after she had warmed herself with the first sip tell me all nan related everything that had happened from the time he came to take both of them to the parlor to when she had left sarah to find him he nodded from time to time as he drank tea and unwound himself from his mufflers and coat i believe this he said when she had finished i believe that memsab is a wise good and brave woman i also believe that she does not think that helping her friend will mean any real danger but the wise the good and the brave often do not think as the mean the bad and the cowardly dothe jackals that feed on the pain of others will turn to devour those who threaten their meal and a man can die from the bite of a jackal as easily as that of a tiger so you think my bad feelin was right nans relief was total not that she didnt trust memsab butmemsab didnt know the kind of creatures that nan did indeed i dobut i believe that it would do no good to try to persuade memsab that she should not try to help her friend karamjit smiled slightly the barest lifting of the corners of his mouth nevertheless sahib will know how best to protect her without insulting her great courage he placed one of his long brown hands on nans shoulder you may leave it in our hands missy nanthough we may ask a thing or two of you that we can do our duty with no harm to memsabs own plans for now though you may simply rely upon us thankee karamjit nan sighed he patted her shoulder then unfolded his long legs and rose from his chair with a slight bow to maya then he left the kitchen allowing nan to finish her tea and run back up to the nursery to give sarah and grey the welcome news that they would not be the only ones concerned with the protection of memsab from the consequences of her own generous nature sahib took both nan and sarah aside just before bedtime after karamjit agansing and selim had been closeted with him for half an hour can i ask you two to come to my study with me for a bit he asked quietly he was often thought to be older than memsab by those who were deceived by the streaks of gray at each temple the stiff way that he walked and the odd expression in his eyes which seemed to nan to be the eyes of a man who had seen so much that nothing surprised him anymore nan had trusted him the moment that she set eyes on him although she couldnt have said why so long as nadra dont fuss nan replied for both of them sahib smiled his eyes crinkling at the corners i have already made it right with nadra he promised karamjit selim agansing and memsab are waiting for us nan felt better immediately for she really hadnt wanted to go sneaking around behind memsabs back from the look that sarah gave her nan reckoned that she felt the same thank you sir sarah said politely we will do just as you say very few of the children had ever been inside the sacred precincts of sahibs office the first thing that struck nan was that it did not smell of tobacco but of sandalwood and cinnamon that surprised her most of the men she knew smoked although their womenfolk disapproved of the habit but evidently sahib did not not even in his own private space there was a tiger skin on the carpet in front of the fire the glass eyes in its head glinting cruelly in a manner unnerving and lifelike nan shuddered and thought of shere khan with his taste for man cub had this been another terrible killer of the jungle did tigers leave vengeful ghosts heavy dark drapes of some indeterminate color shut out the cold night hanging on the walls which had been papered with faded gold arabesques upon a ground of light brown was a jumble of mementos from sahibs life in india crossed spears curious daggers and swords embroidered tapestries of strange characters twined with exotic flowers and birds carved plaques of some heavy dark wood inlaid with brass bizarre masks that resembled nothing less than brightly painted demons on the desk and adorning the shelves between the books were statues of halfand fullynaked gods and goddesses more bits of carving in wood stone and ivory book shelves built floor to ceiling held more books than nan had known existed sahib took his place behind his desk while memsab perched boldly on the edge of it agansing selim and karamjit stood beside the fire like a trio of guardian statues themselves and sahib gestured to the children to take their places on the overstuffed chairs on either side of the fireplace nan waited tensely wondering if memsab was going to be angry because they went to others with their concerns although it had not fallen out so here she was far more used to being in trouble over something she had done than in being encouraged for it and the reflexes were still in place karamjit tells me that you six share some concern over my planned excursion to the medium nan memsab said with a smile that told nan she was not in trouble for her meddling as she had feared they went first to sahib but as we never keep secrets from one another he came to me and i commend all of you for your concern and caution for after some discussion i was forced to agree with it and i would like to commend both of you nan and sarah for having the wisdom to go to an adult with your concerns added sahib with a kindly nod to both of them that nan had not expected in the least that shows great good sense and please continue to do so in the future i thoughti was afeared nan began then blurted out all that shed held in check memsab is bout the smartest goodest lady there is but she dont know bad people me i know i seed em an i figgered that they werent gonna lay down an lose their fat mark without a fight and very wise you were to remind us of that sahib said gravely i pointed out to memsab that we have no way of knowing where this medium is from and she is just as likely to be a criminal as a ladymore so in fact just because she speaks acts and dresses like a lady and seeks her clients from among the gentry means nothing she could easily have a crew of thugs as her accomplices as you say sahib karamjit said gravely for as it is said it is a short step from a deception to a lie from a lie to a cheat from a cheat to a theft and from a theft to a murder memsab blushed i will admit that i was very angry with you at first but when my anger cooled it was clear that your reasoning was sound and after all am i some gothic heroine to go wideeyed into the villains lair never suspecting trouble so we are here to plan what we all shall do to free katherine of her dangerous obsession me i needta know what this seeants is gonna be like memsab nan put in sitting on the edge of the chair tensely what sorta things happens generally the participants are brought into a room that has a round table with chairs circling it memsab spoke directly to nan as if to an adult which gave nan a rather pleasant if shivery feeling the table often has objects upon it that the spirits will supposedly move often a bell a tambourine and a megaphone are among them though why spirits would feel the need to play upon a tambourine when they never had that urge in life is quite beyond me she laughed as did sahib the girls giggled nervously at any rate the participants are asked to sit down and hold hands often the medium is tied to the chair her hands are secured to the arms and her feet to the legs nan noticed that memsab used the word legs rather than the mannerly limbs and thought the better of her for that the lights are brought down and the séance begins most often objects are moved including the table the tambourine is played the bell is rung all as a sign that the spirits have arrived the spirits most often speak by means of raps on the table but katherine tells me that the spirit of her little boy spoke directly through the floating megaphone sometimes a spirit will actually appear in this case it was just a glowing face of katherines son nan thought that over for a moment be simple nufft tilt the chair an get yer legs free by slippin the rope down over the chair feet she observed an all ye hevt do is have chair arms as isnt gluedt their pegs an ye got yer arms free too be easy enough to make all kind uv things dance about when ye got arms free be easy nufft make th table lift if its light enough an rap on it too sahib stared at her in astonishment i do believe that you are the most valuable addition to our household in a long time young lady he said with a delight that made nan blush i would never have thought of any of that i dunno how yed make summat glow though nan admitted oh i know that sarah said casually theres stuff that grows in rotten wood that makes a glow some of the magic men use it to frighten people at night it grows in swamps so it probably grows in england too karamjit grinned his teeth very white in his dark face and selim nodded with pride what is it that the black robes book says sahib out of the mouths of babes comes wisdom memsab nodded i should have told you more earlier she said ruefully well thats mended in time now we all know what to look for grey clicked her beak several times then exclaimed ouch grey is going to try to bite whatever comes near her sarah explained i dont want her venturing off your arm memsab cautioned i wont chance her getting hurt she turned to sahib the chances are the room we will be in will have very heavy curtains to prevent light from entering or escaping so if you and our warriors are outside you wont know what room we are in then id like one of you girls to exercise childish curiosity and go immediately to a window and look out sahib told them at least one of us will be where we can see both the front and the back of the house then if there is trouble one of you signal us and well come to the rescue just like the shining knights you are all four of you memsab said warmly laying her hand over the one sahib had on the desk i think that is as much of a plan as we can lay since we really dont know what we will find in that house its enough i suspect sahib replied it allows three of us to break into the house if necessary while one goes for the police he stroked his chin thoughtfully with his free hand or better yet ill take a police whistle that will summon help in no time he glanced up at memsab what time did you say the invitation specified seven she replied promptly well after dark although katherine tells me that her sessions are usually later nearer midnight the medium may anticipate some trouble from sleepy children sahib speculated but thats just a guess he stood up still holding his wifes hand and she slid off her perch on the desk and turned to face them ladies gentlemen i think we are as prepared as we can be for trouble so let us get a good nights sleep and hope that we will not find any then sahib did a surprising thing he came around his desk limping stiffly and bent over nan and took her hand perhaps only i of all of us can realize how brave you were to confide your worry to an adult you have only just come to trust nan he said very softly then grinned at her so impishly that she saw the little boy he must have been in the eyes of the mature man aint no doubt uv thet missy yer a cunnin moit an ad more blows than pats oi reckon he continued in street cant shocking the breath out of her i came up the same way you are now dear thanks to a very kind man with no son of his own i want you to remember that to us here at this school there is no such thing as a stupid question nor will we dismiss any worry you have as trivial never fear to bring either to an adult he straightened up as memsab came to his side nodding now both of you try and get some sleep for every warrior knows that sleep is more important than anything else before a battle ha nan thought as she and sarah followed karamjit out of the study theres gonna be trouble i kin feel it an so can he he didn get that tiger by not havin a nose fer trouble buti reckon the troubles gonna have its hands full with him im glad you arent angry with me isabelle and her husband had turned to each other and said virtually the same words at the same time and now both laughed oh we know each other far too well my love frederick took her in his arms and she laid her head contentedly on his shoulder far too well so you were annoyed because i was being the warrior and not giving you credit for being one in your own right and you were annoyed because i was planning on wandering off into danger without thinking she said ruefully in hindsight she had very nearly made a dreadful decision and yet it had seemed harmless enough the address of the medium was suitably genteel no real harm had come to katherine except to be fleeced of a few gifts in order to see what she thought was her son isabelle now acknowledged that she just hadnt thought deeply enough i would never have made that mistake in india she admitted i would have assumed there was an entire clan of thieves behind the fraud or worse because there had been worse it was not always money that was at stake in india and there were worse fates than death you were thinking of your friend and not of danger she nodded i think he paused i think danger here has become more subtle than when we first lived in england the attacks are indirect she frowned a little i would have said more petty and that bothers me we know there are great occultists with cruel agendas still living here so where are they in hiding he paused and released her she stood away from him a little looking up into his face i wonder if they are not waiting for science to make people forget that they ever existed so that they can return to prey on the utterly unwary she shivered an uncomfortable thought but not one we need to confront tonight or tomorrow he smiled down at her sufficient unto the day are the evils thereof true enough she took his hand and looked coyly up at him and since it happens to be night he laughed the medium lived in a modest house just off one of the squares in the part of london that housed those clerks and the like with pretensions to a loftier address than their purses would allow an area totally unfamiliar to nan the house itself had seen better days though as had most of the other homes on that deadend street and nan suspected that it was rented the houses had that peculiarly faded look that came when the owners of a house did not actually live there and those who did had no reason to care for the property themselves assuming that was the duty of the landlord memsab had chosen her gown carefully after discarding a walking suit a mourning gown and veil and a peculiar draped garment she called a sari a souvenir of her time in india the first she thought made her look untrusting sharp and suspicious the second would not be believed had the medium done any research on the backgrounds of these new sitters and the third smacked of mockery she chose instead one of the plain simple gowns she preferred in the mode called artistic reform not particularly stylish but nan thought it was a good choice for one thing she could move in it it was looser than the highest mode and did not require tight corseting if memsab needed to run kick or dodge she could the girls followed her quietly dressed in their starched pinafores and dark dresses showing the best possible manners with grey tucked under sarahs coat to stay warm until they got within doors it was quite dark as they mounted the steps to the house and rang the bell the door was answered by a sourfaced woman in a plain black dress who ushered them into a sitting room and took their coats with a startled glance at grey as she popped her head out of the front of sarahs jacket she said nothing however and neither did grey as she climbed to sarahs shoulder the woman returned a moment later but not before nan had heard the faint sounds of surreptitious steps on the floor above them she knew it had not been the sour woman for she had clearly heard those steps going off to a closet and returning if the séance room was on this floor then there was someone else above the sitting room had been decorated in a very odd style the paintings on the wall were all either religious in nature or extremely morbid at least so far as nan was concerned there were pictures of women weeping over graves of angels lifting away the soul of a dead child of a woman throwing herself to her death over a cliff of the spirits of three children hovering about a man and woman mourning over pictures held in their listless hands there was even a picture of a girl crying over a dead bird lying in her hand crystal globes on stands decorated the tables along with bouquets of funereal lilies whose heavy sweet scent dominated the chill room the tables were all draped in fringed cloths of a deep scarlet the hard severe furniture was either of wood or upholstered in prickly horsehair the two lamps had been lit before they entered the room but their light hampered as it was by heavy brocade lamp shades cast more shadows than illumination they didnt have to wait long in that uncomfortable room for the sour servant departed for a moment then returned and conducted them into the next room this evidently was only an antechamber to the room of mysteries heavy draperies swathed all the walls and there were straightbacked chairs set against them on all four walls the lily scent pervaded this room as well mixed with another that nan recognized as the hindu incense that nadra often burned in her own devotions there was a single picture in this room on the wall opposite the door with a candle placed on a small table beneath it so as to illuminate it properly this was a portrait in oils of a plump woman swathed in pale draperies her hands clasped melodramatically before her breast her eyes cast upward smoke presumably that of incense swirled around her with the suggestion of faces in it nan was no judge of art but memsab walked up to it and examined it with a critical eye neither good nor bad she said measuringly i would say it is either the work of an unknown professional or a talented amateur a talented amateur said the lady that memsab had called katherine as she too was ushered into the chamber my dear friend lady harrington painted it it was she who introduced me to madame varonsky memsab turned to meet her and katherine glided across the floor to take her hand in greeting it is said to be a very speaking likeness she continued i certainly find it so nan studied the woman further but saw nothing to change her original estimation katherine wore yet another mourning gown of expensive silk and mohair embellished with jet beadwork and fringes that shivered with the slightest movement a black hat with a full veil perched on her carefully coiffed curls fair hair too dark to be called golden but not precisely brown either her full lips trembled even as they uttered words of polite conversation her eyes threatened to fill at every moment and nan thought that her weak chin reflected an overly sentimental and vapid personality it was an assessment that was confirmed by her conversation with memsab conversation that nan ignored in favor of listening for other sounds over their heads the floor creaked softly as someone moved to and fro trying very hard to be quiet there were also some odd scratching sounds that didnt sound like mice and once a dull thud as of something heavy being set down a little too hard something was going on up there and the person doing it didnt want them to notice at length the incense smell grew stronger and the drapery on the wall to the right of the portrait parted revealing a door which opened as if by itself taking that as their invitation katherine broke off her small talk to hurry eagerly into the sacred precincts memsab gestured to the girls to precede her and followed on their heels by previous arrangement nan and sarah rather than moving toward the circular table at which madame varonsky waited went to the two walls likeliest to hold windows behind their heavy draperies before anyone could stop them it was nans luck to find a corner window overlooking the street and she made sure that some light from the room within flashed to the watcher on the opposite side before she dropped the drapery come away from the windows children memsab said in a voice that gently chided nan and sarah immediately turned back to the room and nan assessed the foe madame varonskys portraitist had flattered her she was decidedly paler than she had been painted with a complexion unpleasantly like wax she wore similar draperies garments which could have concealed anything the smile on her thin lips did not reach her eyes and she regarded the parrot on sarahs shoulder with distinct unease you did not warn me about the bird katherine the woman said her voice rather reedy the bird will be no trouble madame varonsky memsab soothed it is better behaved than a good many of my pupils your pupilsi am not altogether clear on why they were brought madame varonsky replied turning her sharp black eyes on nan and sarah nan is an orphan and wants to learn what she can of her parents since she never knew them memsab said smoothly and sarah lost a little brother to an african fever the bird was her brothers and it is all she has of him ah madame varonskys suspicions diminished and she gestured to the chairs around the table please all of you do take your seats and we can begin at once as with the antechamber this room had walls swathed in draperies which nan decided could conceal an entire army if madame varonsky were so inclined the only furnishings besides the séance table and chairs were a sinuous statue of a female completely enveloped in draperies on a draped table with incense burning before it in a small charcoal brazier of brass and cast iron the table at which nan took her place was very much as memsab had described a surreptitious bump as nan took her seat on memsabs left hand proved that it was quite light and easy to move it would be possible to lift it with one hand with no difficulty at all on the draped surface were some of the objects memsab had described a tambourine a megaphone a little handbell there were three lit candles in a brass candlestick in the middle of the table and some objects nan had not expecteda fiddle and bow a rattle and a pair of handkerchiefs this is where were supposed to look nan realized as sarah took her place on memsabs right next to madame varonsky and katherine on nans left flanking the medium on the other side she wished she could look up as grey was unashamedly doing her head over to one side as one eye peered upward at the ceiling above them if you would follow dear katherines example child said madame as katherine took one of the handkerchiefs and used it to tie the mediums wrist to the arm of her chair she smiled crookedly this is to assure you that i am not employing any trickery sarah behaving with absolute docility did the same on the other side but cast nan a knowing look as she finished nan knew what that meant sarah had tried the arm of the chair and found it loose now if you all will hold hands we will beseech the spirits to attend us the medium turned her attention to memsab as katherine and sarah stretched their arms across the table to touch hands and the rest reached for the hands of their partners pray do not be alarmed when the candles are extinguished the spirits are shy of light for they are so delicate that it can destroy them they will put out the candles themselves for several long moments they sat in complete silence as the incense smoke thickened and curled around then although there wasnt a single breath of moving air in the room the candle flames began to dim one by one and go out nan felt the hair on the back of her neck rising for this was a phenomenon she could not account forto distract herself she looked up quickly at the ceiling just in time to see a faint line of light in the form of a square vanish she felt better immediately however the medium had extinguished the candles it had to be a trick if she had any real powers she wouldnt need a trapdoor in the ceiling of her séance room as she looked back down she realized that the objects on the table were all glowing with a dim greenish light spirits are you with us madame varonsky called nan immediately felt the table begin to lift katherine gasped memsab gave nans hand a squeeze understanding immediately what she wanted nan let go of it now memsab was free to act as she needed the spirits are strong tonight madame murmured as the table settled again perhaps they will give us a further demonstration of their powers exactly on cue the tambourine rose into the air shaking uncertainly first the megaphone joined it then the rattle then the handbell all floating in midair or seeming to but nan was looking up not at the objects and saw a very dim square too dim to be called light above the table a deeper shadow moved back and forth over that area and nans lip curled with contempt she had no difficulty in imagining how the objects were levitating one by one theyd been pulled up by wires or black strings probably hooked by means of a fishing rod from the room above now rapping began on the table to further distract their attention madame began to ask questions is there a spirit here for isabelle harton she asked one rapthat was a no not surprising since the medium probably wouldnt want to chance making a mistake with an adult is there a spirit here for katherine boughmont two rapsyes is this the spirit of a child two raps and already katherine had begun to weep softly is it the spirit of her son edward two raps plus the bell rang and the rattle and tambourine rattled and nan found herself feeling very sorry for the poor silly woman are there other spirits here tonight two raps is there a spirit for the child nan two raps is it her father one rap her mother two raps and nan had to control her temper which flared at that moment she knew very well that her mother was still alive though at the rate she was going she probably wouldnt be for long what with the gin and the opium and the rest of her miserable life but if she had been a young orphan her parents dead in some foreign land like one or two of the other pupils what would she not have given for the barest word from them however illusory would she not have been willing to believe anything that sounded warm and kind there appeared to be no spirit for sarah which was just as well madame varonsky was ready to pull out the next of her tricks for the floating objects settled to the table again my spirit guide was known in life as the great paganini the master violinist madame varonsky announced as music is the food of the soul he will employ the same sweet music he made in life to bridge the gap between our world and the next listen and he will play this instrument before us fiddle music appeared to come from the instrument on the table although the bow did not actually move across the strings katherine gasped release the childs hand a moment and touch the violin dear katherine the medium said in a kind but distant voice katherine evidently let go of sarahs hand since she still had hold of nans and the shadow of her fingers rested for a moment on the neck of the fiddle the strings she cried isabelle the strings are vibrating as they are played if this was supposed to be some great longdead music master nan didnt think much of his ability if she wasnt mistaken the tune he was playing was the childs chant of london bridge is falling down but played very very slowly turning it into a solemn dirge touch the strings isabelle katherine urged see for yourself nan felt memsab lean forward and another hand shadow fell over the strings they are vibrating she said her voice suddenly uncertain the music ground to a halt before she took her hand awayand until this moment grey had been as silent as a stuffed bird on a ladys hat now she did something quite odd she began to sing it was a very clever imitation of a fiddle playing a jig tune that a street musician often played at the gate of the school for the pennies the pupils would throw to him she quit almost immediately but not before memsab took her hand away from the strings and nan sensed that somehow grey had given her the clue she needed to solve that particular trick but the medium must have thought that her special spirit was responsible for that scrap of jig tune for she didnt say or do anything nan sensed that all of this was building to the main turn and so it was remembering belatedly that she should be keeping an eye on that suspicious square above she glanced up just in time to see it disappear as the medium began to moan and sigh calling on paganini nan kept her eye on the ceiling sure enough the dim line of light appeared again forming a grayish square then the lines of the square thickened and nan guessed that a square platform was being lowered from above pungent incense smoke thickened about them filling nans nose and stinging her eyes so that they watered and she smothered a sneeze it was hard to breathe and there was something strangely disquietingly familiar about the scent the mediums words spoken in a harsh accented voice cut through the smoke i the great paganini am here among you once again katherine gasped harken and be still lo the spirits gather nans eyes burned and for a moment she felt very dizzy she thought that the soft glow in front of her was due to nothing more than eyestrain but the glow strengthened and she blinked in shock as two vague shapes took form amid the writhing smoke for a new brazier belching forth such thick smoke that the coals were invisible had appeared in the center of the table just behind the candlestick it was above this brazier that the glowing shapes hovered and slowly took on an identifiable form nan felt dizzier sick the room seemed to turn slowly around her the faces of a young woman and a little boy looked vaguely out over nans head from the cloud of smoke katherine began to weeppresumably she thought she recognized the child as her own but the fact that the young woman looked nothing like nans mother and in fact looked quite a bit like the sketch in an advertisement for bovril in the times woke nan out of her mental haze and so did grey she heard the flapping of wings as grey plummeted to the floor the bird sneezed urgently and shouted aloud bad air bad air bad bad air and that was the moment when she knew what it was that was so familiar in the incense smoke and why she felt as tipsy as a sailor on shore leave hashish she choked trying to shout and not managing very well she knew this scent on the rare occasions when her mother could afford itand before shed turned to opiumshed smoked it in preference to drinking nan could only think of one thing that she must get fresh air in here before they all passed out she shoved her chair back and staggered up and out of it it fell behind her with a clatter that seemed muffled in the smoke she groped for the brazier as the two faces continued to stare unmoved and unmoving from the thick billows her hands felt like a pair of leadfilled mittens she had to fight to stay upright as she swayed like a drunk she didnt find it but her hands closed on the cool smooth surface of the crystal ball that was good enough before the medium could stop her she heaved up the heavy ball with a grunt of effort and staggered to the window she halfspun and flung the ball at the draperies hiding the unseen window it hit the drapes and carried them into the glass crashing through it taking the drapery with it a gush of cold air as fresh as air in london ever got streamed in through the broken panes as bedlam erupted in the room behind nan she dropped to the floor ignoring everything around her for the moment as she breathed in the air tainted only with smog waiting for her head to clear grey ran to her and huddled with her rather than joining her beloved mistress in the poisonous smoke katherine shrieked in hysteria there was a man as well as the medium shouting and memsab cursed all of them in some strange language grey gave a terrible shriek and halfran halfflew away nan fought her dizziness and disorientation looked up to see that memsab was struggling in the grip of a stringy fellow she didnt recognize katherine had been backed up into one corner by the medium and sarah and grey were pummeling the medium with small fists and wings memsab kicked at her captors shins and stamped on his feet with great effect as his grunts of pain demonstrated nan struggled to her feet guessing that she must have been the one worst affected by the hashish fumes she wanted to run to memsabs rescue but she couldnt get her legs to work in a moment the sourfaced woman would surely break into the room turning the balance in favor of the enemy the door did crash open behind her just as she thought that and she tried to turn to face the new foe but it was not the foe sahib charged through the broken door pushing past nan and using his cane to belabor the man holding memsab within three blows the man was on the floor moaning before nan fell karamjit caught her and steadied her more men flooded into the room among them selim and agansing who went to the rescue of sarah and grey and nan let karamjit steer her out of the way concentrating on those steadying breaths of air she thought perhaps that she passed out of consciousness for a while for when she next noticed anything she was sitting bent over in a chair with karamjit hovering over her frowning at some point the brazier had been extinguished and a policeman was collecting the ashes and the remains of the druglaced incense it was a while before her head cleared by then the struggle was over the medium and her fellow tricksters were in the custody of the police who had come with sahib when nan threw the crystal ball through the window sahib was talking to a policeman with a sergeants badge and nan guessed that he was explaining what memsab and katherine were doing here katherine wept in a corner comforted by memsab the police had brought lamps into the séance room from the sitting room showing all too clearly how the medium had achieved her work a hatch in the ceiling to the room above through which things could be lowered a magic lantern behind the drapes which had cast its image of a woman and boy onto the thick brazier smoke that and the disorienting effect of the hashish had made it easy to trick the clients finally the bobbies took their captives away and katherine stopped crying nan and sarah sat on the chairs karamjit had set up watching the adults grey on her usual perch on sarahs shoulder a cushion stuffed in the broken window cut off most of the cold air from outside i cant believe i was so foolish katherine moaned buti wanted to see edward so very much i hardly think that falling for a clever deception backed by drugs makes you foolish my dear lady sahib said gravely but you are to count yourself fortunate in the loyalty of your friends who were willing to place themselves in danger for you i do not think that these people would have been willing to stop at mere fraud and neither do the police his last words made no impression on katherine at least none that nan sawbut she did turn to memsab and clasp her hand fervently i thought so ill of you that you would not believe in madame she said tearfully can you forgive me memsab smiled always my dear she said in the voice she used to soothe a frightened child since your motive was to enlighten me not to harm meand your motive in seeking your poor childs spirit a chill passed over nan at that moment that had nothing to do with the outside air she looked sharply at sarah and saw a very curious thing there was a very vague and shimmery shape standing in front of sarahs chair sarah looked at it with an intense and thoughtful gaze as if she was listening to it more than that grey was doing the same nan got the distinct impression that it was asking her friend for a favor grey and sarah exchanged a glance and the parrot nodded once as grave and sober as a parson then spread her wings as if sheltering sarah like a chick the shimmering form melted into sarah her features took on a mischievous expression that nan had never seen her wear before and she got up and went directly to katherine the woman looked up at her startled at the intrusion of a child into an adult discussion then paled at something she saw in sarahs face oh mummy you dont have to be so sad sarah said in a curiously hollow piping soprano im all right really and it wasnt your fault anyway it was that horrid lord babington that made you and papa send me to overton but you must stop crying please laurie is already scared of being left and youre scaring her more now nan knew very well that memsab had not said anything about a lord babington nor did she and sarah know what school the poor little boy had been sent to yet she wasnt frightened in fact the protective but calm look in greys eye made her feel rather good as if something inside her told her that everything was going wonderfully well the effect on katherine was not what nan had expected either she reached out tentatively as if to touch sarahs face but stopped short this is you isnt it darling she asked in a whisper sarah noddedor was it edward who nodded now ive got to go mummy and i cant come back so dont look for me and dont cry anymore the shimmering withdrew forming into a brilliant ball of light at about the level of sarahs heart then shot off so fast that nan couldnt follow it grey pulled in her wings and sarah shook her head a little then regarded katherine with a particularly measuring expression before coming back to her chair and sitting down out of the mouths of babes katherine memsab said quietly then looked up at karamjit i think you and selim should take the girls home now theyve had more than enough excitement for one night agansing can stay here with us while we deal with the results of this nights adventure karamjit bowed silently and grey added her own vote wan go back she said in a decidedly firm tone when selim brought their coats and helped them to put them on grey climbed right back inside sarahs and didnt even put her head back out again they didnt have to go home in a cab either katherine sent them back to the school in her own carriage which was quite a treat for nan whod had no notion that a private carriage would come equipped with such comforts as heated bricks for the feet and fur robes to bundle in nan didnt say anything to sarah about the aftermath of the séance until they were alone together in their room and karamjit and selim had returned to memsab and sahib only then as grey took her accustomed perch on the headboard of sarahs bed did nan look at her friend and ask sarah nodded i could see him clear as clear too she smiled a little he mustve been a horrid brat at times but he really wasnt bad just spoiled enough to be a bit selfish and hes beenlearning better manners since all that nan could think of to say wasah still i think it was a bit rude of him to have been so impatient with his mother she continued a little irritated i spose that magicman friend of yours is right nan replied finally about what you cn do i mean oh youre right sarah exclaimed but you know i dont think i could have done it if grey hadnt been there i thought if i ever saw a spirit id be too scared to do anything but i wasnt afraid since she wasnt the parrot took a little piece of sarahs hair in her beak and preened it wise bird replied grey isabelle sat holding her friends hand as the police sergeant questioned her in a painstaking but ponderous manner isabelle felt obscurely sorry for katherine it was a difficult thing to have to admit that you had given your trust to someone who had then not only abused it but done so in such a fashion as to make you look incredibly foolish as katherine reluctantly admitted the large sums of money she had pressed into madames handsprobably memsab reflected with all the fervent devotion of a religious convertshe flushed and looked acutely uncomfortable until even the policeman noticed begging your pardon mum he said apologetically but we have to hev these particulars down in the report or we cant prosecute the woman properly thiss theft it is and no two ways about it as im sure the magistrate will say well while it might morally be theft it actually was fraud under the law and if katherine hadnt been wealthy and highly connected isabelle very much doubted whether this police sergeant would be bringing it up to a magistrate on such charges but she was both of those things and the upshot of that was that madamebased on the amount of money she had takenwould probably be in prison for the rest of her life or at least would be transported to australia even more uncomfortable for katherine was divulging the names of her other wealthy titled or connected friends who had been fleeced by this fraud that was worse than embarrassment it was very nearly social suicide katherine would have to live in india for another five years before people like lady harrington forgot who had been the cause of common police appearing at her door to question herand the ensuing embarrassment on her part of discovering she had been taken in by such a fraud still there was nothing for it and if lady harrington had been the one who had introduced katherine to madame in the first place perhaps her annoyance would be tempered by guilt finally the police released them all and katherine fled to the safety and seclusion of her carriage looking utterly shattered she should have thanked you at least memsab said selim gravely as the carriage rolled away into the darkness frederick had gone to look for a cab with agansing leaving her with the third of the guardians well i cant say as i am surprised that she did not isabelle admitted she was one of the girls i went to school with one in whom elemental magic burns very dimly we tended to be thrown together within the group of the gifted and the talented on that account you see i had none of their magic and she had very little but i did have something quite powerful that demanded a certain amount of respect i may have been less than circumspect in my conversations about my powers and as a consequence i believe poor katherine got some unrealistic notions about occult abilities and yet missy sarah has them selim observed hmm isabellas lips compressed i fear that if katherine makes this known the consequences will be some exceedingly intrusive and unwanted attention on all of us there are many bereaved people in the world none of whom really wishes to know that a loved one has moved on and left them behind one cannot blame them selim replied but it would be hard on missy sarah to be the one to suffer at the hands of their need the sound that emerged from isabelles throat was of a laugh with no humor in it and there is not one in a thousand of them who will consider that asking a very young child to perform mediumistic work is both cruel and uncaring each of them is so enwrapped in her grieffor it is predominantly women who flock to mediumsthat nothing else is of consequence they would be better off seeking solace in the arms of their religion and leave the child out of it selims tone was grim well they will be leaving the child out of it because we are her guardians and i have no intention of allowing her to do any such thing isabelles tone was just as grim as selims ah here is sahib with our cab the short journey back was conducted mostly in silence it was isabelle who finally broke it i know i thanked you all beforebut now i have to thank you again with the full knowledge of what foolishly rushing in to this situation could have brought me to in fact she felt a bit shaken and rather humbled at this point it was painfully clear that at the least she the girls and katherine could have been harmed and at worst and who was it memsab that kept me from believing i could brave the temple of kalima alone asked agansing or insisted that if i would go to meet that fakir it would be while i was under the eye of my friends said selim or told me to go direct to bhurka singh with my suspicions instead of allowing them to fester added karamjit his teeth gleaming in a white smile in the shadows of the cab or kept me from rushing into a hundred foolish ventures frederick concluded with his arms around her this is what it means to be human as i quite recall you saying the last time i came home with a broken head you succeed you become a trifle overconfident and at that point it is the duty of your friends to haul you back and point out the edge of the cliff at your feet well nevertheless she said feeling a little better and a trifle less stupid thank you nevertheless said frederick with a squeeze you are welcome provided you continue to do me the same good turn my love and somehow that made her feel very much better indeed nan sat on the foot of sarahs bed with her feet curled up under her flannel nightgown to keep them warm sarah janes parrot grey lay flat on sarahs chest eyes closed cuddling like a kitten warm light from an oil lamp mounted on the wall beside the bed poured over all of them it wasnt a very big room just room for nans bed and sarah janes a perch with cups screwed to it for food and water and a selection of toys hanging from it for grey and a wardrobe and chests for their clothes and things if the wallpaper was old and faded and the rugs on the floor threadbare it was still a thousand times better than any place that nan had ever lived inand as for sarah well she was used to a mission and hospital in the middle of the jungle and their little room was just as foreign to her as it was to nan though in entirely different ways while only little sarah had a pet from home there were plenty of pets acquired here in england for the other children to make sure that the children never forgot those who had sent them here other reminders of absent parents were encouraged here and there was a supply of paper ink and penny stamps in each room most schools encouraged lettersso long as they were written in class where the teacher could ostensibly check for spelling grammar and penmanship but in reality making sure nothing uncomplimentary about the school or the teachers went out through the mails there was a great deal of laughter in the harton school and the lessons learned were all the surer for it and that was the least of the eccentricities here in a school where not all of the lessons were about what could be seen with the ordinary eye nan was alone in not wanting reminders of her family she had no idea who her father was and her mother had finally descended last nan had heard to the lowest rung on the social ladder her type could reach that of a street whore in whitechapel she roamed the streets now with everything she owned on her back without even a garret or cellar room or even an understairs cubbyhole to call her own satisfying first her craving for drink before looking for the extra penny for a bed or a meal she would probably die soon of bad gin of cold and exposure of disease or of everything at once as her chronicallydamaged body gave out nan had neither time nor pity for her after all it had been her gran that had mostly raised her not her mam whod only been interested in the money nan brought in by begging sarah had a very special sort of bond with greywho sarah insisted was a great deal more than just a parrot nan was in wholehearted agreement with that estimation at this pointafter all it was no more difficult to believe in than to believe that wolves could adopt a mancub and nan was convinced of the truth of mrkiplings stories sarah had a new set of lessons now that they had learned she could on occasion talk with and see the dead this could be a very dangerous ability so memsab had told nan who had appointed herself as sarahs protector well if nan and grey had anything to say about the matter danger would have to pass through them to reach sarah nan tickle grey demanded in her funny little voice eyes still closed sarah was using both hands to support the bird on her chest which left no hands free to give grey the scratch she wanted nan obliged by crawling up to the head of the bed settling in beside her friend and scratching the back of greys neck it was a very gentle scratchindeed more like the tickle grey had asked for than the kind of vigorous scratching one would give a dog or a tough london catfor nan had known instinctively from the moment that grey permitted nan to touch her that a birds skin is a very delicate thing of all of the people in the school only nan memsab sahib himself and agansing were permitted by grey to do more than take her on a hand sarah of course could do anything she liked with the bird wisht oi had a friend loike you grey nan told the bird wistfully the remnants of her cockney accent still clinging to her speech despite hours and hours of lessons the parrot opened one yellow eye and gave her a long and unreadable look kitty grey suggested but nan shook her head not a moggy she replied mind oi loike moggies butoi dunno a moggy dont seem roight not clever nuff sarah laughed then you must not be a witch after all she teased a witchs familiar is always a cat or a toad nan made a face don want no toads she objected so oi guess oi aint no witch no matter what that tommy carpenter says tommy a recent addition to the school had somehow made up his mind that she sarah and memsab were all witches he didnt mean it in a derogatory sense in fact he gave them all the utmost respect it had something to do with things his own ayah back in india had taught him nan had to wonder given whom hed singled out for that particular accolade if he wouldnt be getting private lessons of his own with memsab before too long there was something just a little too knowing about the way tommy looked at some people but oi still wisht oi adhada bird friend loike grey and she sighed again grey reached around with her beak and gently took one of nans fingers in it greys equivalent so nan had learned of a hug well she said when grey had let go mebbe someday lotsve parrots comes in with sailors thats right sarah said warmly letting go of grey just long enough to give nan a hug of her own before changing the subject nan promise to tell me all about the tower as soon as you get back tomorrow i wish i could gomaybe as much as you wish you had a grey parrot of your own course oi will nan replied warmly oi wisht you could go toobut you know why memsab said not she shuddered but it was the delicious shudder of a child about to be regaled with delightfully scary ghost stories without a chance of turning around and discovering that the story had transmuted to reality for sarah however the possibility was only too real that even by daylight that very thing would happen it was one thing to provide the vehicle for a little child ghost who had returned only to comfort his mother it was something else entirely to contemplate sarah coming facetoface with one of the many unhappy tragic or angry spirits said to haunt the tower of london memsab was not willing to chance such an encounter not until sarah was old enough to protect herself so the history class would be going to the tower for a special tour with one of the yeoman warders without sarah sarah sighed again i know and i know memsab is right but i still wish i could go too nan laughed wut an you gettin t got sahibs warehouse an pick out whatever you want on account of missin the treat yes but she made a face then i have to write an essay about it to earn it an were all writin essays bout the tower so i reckon its even all around cept we dont get no keepsakes nan ended the discussion firmly i know ill pick a whole chest of turkish delight then we can all have a treat and ill have the chest sarah said suddenly brightening up in that way she had that made her solemn little face just fill with light grey laughed just like a human smart bird the parrot said then shook herself gently wordlessly telling sarah to let go of her made her ponderous way up sarahs shoulder and pillow and clambered up beakoverclaw to her usual nighttime perch on the top of the brass railing of the headboard of sarahs bedwrapped and padded for her benefit in yards and yards of tough hempen twine she pulled one foot up under her chest feathers and turned her head around to bury her beak out of sight in the feathers of her back and since that was the signal it was time for them to sleepa signal they always obeyed since both of them half expected that grey would tell on them if they didntnan slid down and climbed into her own bed turning the key on the lantern beside her to extinguish the light it was a gloomy cool autumn day that threatened rain a day on which nan definitely needed her mac a garment which gave her immense satisfaction for up until coming to the school she had relied on old newspapers or scraps of canvas to keep off the rain getting to the tower was an adventure in and of itself involving a great deal of walking and several omnibuses when they arrived at the tower nan could only stare shed been expecting a single building not this fortress why it was bigger than buckingham palaceor at least as big their guide was waiting for them under an archway with not one but two nastylooking portcullisesand the tour began immediately for this was no mere gate but the middle tower the yeoman warder who took the children under his capacious wing was an especial friend of sahibs and as a consequence took them on a more painstaking tour of the tower than the sort given to most schoolchildren he did his bestwhich was a very good best because he was a natural storytellerto make the figures of history come alive for his charges and peppered his narrative with exactly the sort of ghoulish details that schoolchildren loved to hear creepy but not terrifying ghoulish but not ghastly nan was very much affected by the story of poor little jane grey the ninedays queen and of queen anne boleyn but she felt especially saddened by the story of the execution of katherine howard who had been rather naughty but had been very young and pretty and shackled in marriage to a king who was so fat he could hardly move on his own no wonder she went after a bit of fun on her own and the old king should have expected it they walked all over the tower up and down innumerable stairs from the old mint buildings to the armory in the white tower even to the yeoman warders private quarters where their guides wife gave them all tea and cakes nan felt quite smug about that no one else was getting tea and cakes most of the other visitors had to blunder about by themselves accompanied with maps and guidebooks or join a crowd of others being given the general tour by another of the yeoman warders and dependent on their own resources for their refreshment she tasted the heady wine of privilege for the first time in her young life and decided that it was a fine thing but the one thing that she found the most fascinating about the tower was the ravens faintly intimidating they flew about or stalked the lawns wherever they cared to they had their very own yeoman warder to attend to them because of the story that if they were ever to leave the tower it would be the end of england but nan found them fascinating and kept watching them even when she should perhaps have been paying attention to their guide finally nan got a chance to watch them to her hearts content as memsab noted her fascination would you like to stay here while the rest of us go view the crown jewels nan memsab asked with a slight smile nan nodded going up another set of stairs along with a gaggle of other silly gawpers just to look at a lot of big sparklers that no one but the queen ever would wear was just plain daft she felt distinctly honored that memsab trusted her to stay alone the other pupils trailed off after their guide like a parade of kittens following their mother while nan remained behind in the quiet part of the green near the offlimits area where the ravens had their perches and nestingboxes watching as the great black birds went about their lives ignoring the sightseers as mere pointless interlopers it seemed to her that the ravens had a great deal in common with someone like her they were tough no nonsense about them willing and able to defend themselves she even tried once or twice to see if she could get a sense of what they were thinking but their minds were very busy with raven businessstatus in the rookery being a very complicated affair though the second time she tried the minds of the two she was touching went very silent for a moment and they turned to stare at her she guessed that they didnt like it and stopped immediately they went back to stalking across the lawn then she felt eyes on her from behind and turned slowly there was a third raven behind her staring at her ullo she told him quoark he said meditatively she met his gaze with one equally unwavering and it seemed to her that something passed between them dont touch him girl that was one of the yeoman warders hurrying up to her they can be vicious brutes when theyre so minded the vicious brute wasnt interested in the warders estimation of him quork he said making up his mindand pushed off with his strong black legs making two heavy flaps of his wings that brought him up and onto nans shoulder awwrr he crooned and as the yeoman warder froze he took that formidable bill as long as nans hand and knifeedged and gently closed it around her ear his tongue tickled the ear and she giggled the yeoman warder paled but nan was engrossed in an entirely new sensation welling up inside herand she guessed it was coming from the bird it was a warmth of the heart as if someone had just given her a welcoming hug could this be her bird friend the one shed wished for want tickle she suggested aloud thinking very hard about how greys neck feathers felt under her fingers when she scratched the parrot orrrr the raven agreed right in her ear he released the ear and bent his head down alongside her cheek so she could reach the back of his neck she reached up and began a satisfying scratch she felt his beak growing warm with pleasure as he fluffed his neck feathers for her the yeoman warder was as white as snow a startling contrast with his blueandscarlet uniform the ravenmaster who was another yeoman warder came running up puffing hard and rather out of breath and stopped beside his fellow officer he took several deep breaths staring at the two of themthe ravens eyes were closed with pure bliss as nans fingers worked around his beak and very very gently rubbed the skin around his eyes blimey he breathed staring at them he walked with extreme care toward them and reached for the bird here now neville old man you oughter come along with me quick as a flash the raven went from cuddling pet to angry tyrant rousing all his feathers in anger and lashing at the outstretched hand with his beak and it was a good thing that the outstretched hand was wearing a thick falconers gauntlet because otherwise the warder would have pulled it back bloody then as if to demonstrate that his wrath was only turned against those who would dare to separate him from nan the raven took that formidable beak and rubbed it against nans cheek coming within a fraction of an inch of her eyes she in her turn fearlessly rubbed her cheek against his the warders both went very still and very white neville i blieve youre horripilatin these gennelmun nan said thinking the same thing very hard wouldjer come down onta me arm she held out her forearm parallel to her shoulder as the warders held their breath quock neville said agreeably and stepped onto her forearm she brought him down level with her chest and as he rested his head against her she went back to scratching him in the places where she was now getting a sense that he wanted to be scratched he was a great deal less delicate than grey in fact he enjoyed just as vigorous a scratching as any alley cat miss the ravenmaster said carefully i think you oughter put him down i cn do that she said truthfully but if e dont want to leave me ell just be back on my shoulder in the next minute then he looked about helplessly the other warder shrugged miss them ravens belongst her majesty just like swans does she had to giggle at thatthe idea that anyone even the queen thought they could own a wild thing i doubt anybodys told them she pointed out rrrk neville agreed his voice muffled by the fact that his beak was against her chest the ravenmaster was sweating now little beads standing out on his forehead he looked to his fellow officer for help the man only shrugged ollis you was the one what told me that nevilles never been what youd call a natural bird the first warder said judiciously and with the air of a man who has done his best he slowly turned and walked off leaving the ravenmaster to deal with the situation himself orperhapsto deal with it without a witness who might have to make a report and what he didnt witness he couldnt report nan could certainly understand that since shed been in similar situations now and again sweating freely now the ravenmaster bent down hands carefully in sight and down at his sides now neville he said quietly addressing the raven ive always done right by you avent i neville opened one eye and gave him a dubious look ork he agreed but with the sense that his agreement was qualified by whatever the ravenmaster might do in the next few moments now you lissen to me if you was to try an go with this girl id haveta try an catch you up youd be mad an mebbe id get hurt an youd be in a cage nan stiffened fearing that neville would react poorly to this admission but the bird only uttered a defiant grunt as if to say youll catch me the day you grow wings fool the feathers on his head and neck rose and nan sensed a sullen anger within him and the fact that she was sensing things from him could only mean that as the warder had said neville was no natural bird in facthe was like grey nan felt excitement rise in her the fact was a tough bird like a raven suited her a great deal more than a parrot but the yeoman warder wasnt done now ontother hand he continued if the young lady was to toss you up in th air when youd got your scratch and you was to wait over the gate till her an her schoolmates comes out an then you was to follow herwell i couldnt know you was missing till i counted birds on perches could i an then i couldnt know where youd gone could i an this young lady wouldnt get in no trouble would she slowly the feathers neville had roused flattened he looked the warder square in the eyes as if measuring him for falsehood and slowly deliberately he nodded quok he said right gennelmuns agreement the warder said heaving an enormous sigh and turning his attention at last to nan miss i dunno what it is about you but seems you an neville has summat between you an since nevilles sire has the same summat with the ravenmaster afore me an went with im to wight when e retired i reckon it runs in the family you might say so nan nodded and looked at neville who jerked his beak upward in a motion that told her clearly what he wanted she flung her arm up to help him as he took off and with several powerful thrusts of his wings he took off and rowed his way up to the top of the main gate where he ruffed up all of his feathers and uttered a disdainful croak now miss the yeoman warder said straightening up you just happen to ave a knack with birds and i just give you a bit of a talkinto about how dangerous them ravens is an you never heard me talkin to neville an if a big black bird should turn up at your school then ill be avin an uncommon big jackdaw as a pet she said staring right back at him unblinking which mustve been summuns pet on account uv es so tame thatd be it miss the warder said and gathering his dignity about him left her to wait for the rest of the class to come out memsab nan was firmly convinced knew everything her conviction was only strengthened by the penetrating look that her teacher gave her when she led the rest of the harton school pupils out to collect nan since the crown jewels were the last item on their programme it was time to go how did you get on with the ravens nan memsab asked with just that touch of irony in her voice that said far more than the words did could someone have come to tell her about neville being on nans shoulder or was this yet another demonstration that memsab knew things without anyone telling her nan fought hard to keep her accent under control im thinkin i got on well memsab she said with a little smile memsab raised an eyebrow if there had been any doubt in nans mind that her teacher might not be aware that there was something toward it vanished at that moment she raised another when as they made their way down the broad walk away from the tower a black winged shape lofted from the gate and followed them taking perches on any convenient object for her part nan felt all knotted up with tension for she couldnt imagine how the great bird would be able to follow them through london traffic it seemed that the ravenmaster hadnt yet got around to trimming nevilles wing feathers for he had them all but two so at least he wasnt going to be hampered by lack of wingspan but still how was he to get from here to the harton school they boarded a horsedrawn omnibus andsince it wasnt raining yeteveryone ran up the little twisting staircase to the open seats on top after all what child cares to ride inside when he can ride outside they were the only passengers up there due to the chill and threatening weather and nan cast an anxious look back at the last place shed seen neville he wasnt there her heart fell and right down out of the sky the huge bird landed with an audible thump in the aisle between the rows of seats just as the bus started to move he folded his wings and looked about as if he owned the place lummy said one of the boys thats a raven he started to get out of his seat no it isnt memsab said firmly and no one move except nan when memsab gave an order like that no one would even think of moving so as neville walked ponderously toward her nan crouched down and offered her forearm to him he hopped up on it and she got back into her seat turning to look expectantly at memsab this is not a raven their teacher repeated raking the entire school group with a stern glance this is an uncommonly large rook correct yes memsab the rest of nans schoolmates chorused memsab eyed the enormous bird for a moment her brown eyes thoughtful memsab was not a pretty womanmany people might in fact have characterized her as plain with quiet brown hair and eyes and a complexion more like honest brown pottery than porcelain her chin was too firm for beauty her features too angular and strong but it was nans fervent hope that one day she might grow up into something like those strong features for to her mind memsab was a decidedly handsome woman right now she looked quite formidable her eyes intent as she gazed at neville clearly thinking hard about something bird she addressed the raven directly we are going to have to go through a number of situations in which you will not be welcome before we get home for instance the inside seats on this very bussince i think it is going to rain before we get to our stop now what do you propose we do about you neville cocked his head to one side ork he replied now none of the children found any of this at all peculiar or funny perhaps because they were used to memsab sarah and nan treating grey just like a person but none of them wanted to volunteer a solution either if it involved actually getting near that nastylooking beak oiican put im under me mac memsab nan offered their teacher frowned thats only good until someone notices youre carrying something there nan she replied children at the next stop i would like you to divide up and search the bus for a discarded box pleasebut be back in a seat when the bus moves again just then the bus pulled up to a stop and slightly less than twenty very active children swarmed over the vehicle while passengers were loading and unloading the boys all piled downstairs they were less encumbered with skirts and could go over or under seats quickly the boys hadnt returned by the time the bus moved but at the next stop they all came swarming back up again carrying in triumph the very thing that was needed a dirtied and scuffed pasteboard hatbox as their teacher congratulated them young tommy proudly related his story of charming the box from a young shopgirl who had several she was taking home with her because theyd been spoiled meanwhile nan coaxed neville into the prize which was less than a perfect fit he wasnt happy about it but after thinking very hard at him with scenes of him trying to fly to keep up of conductors chasing him out of the windows of buses and of policemen finding him under nans mac and trying to take him away he quorked and obediently hopped into the box suffering nan to close the lid down over him and tie it shut her nerves quieted down at that moment and she heaved a sigh of very real relief only then did she pay attention to her classmates i owes you tommy she said earnestly sarah she said last night she was gonna get a chestve turkish delight from sahibs warehouse for her treat and share it out you cn hev my share tommy went pink with pleasure oh nan you dont have to he was clearly torn between greed and generosity of his own half he suggested i dont want to leave you without a treat too i got a treat she insisted patting the box happily an minell last longer nor turkish delight naw fairs fair you get my share and she settled back into her seat with the pleasant warm weight of the box and its contents on her lap memsab casting an amused eye on her from time to time neville shifted himself occasionally and his nails would scrape on the cardboard he didnt like being confined but the darkness was making him sleepy so he was dozing when the box was on her lap and not being carried there were no difficulties with the rest of the journey back to the school no one saw anything out of the ordinary in a child with a shopworn hatbox and neville was no heavier than a couple of schoolbooks they walked the last few blocks to the school the neighbors were used to seeing the children come and go and there were smiles and nods as the nowthoroughlyweary group trudged their way to the old gates which were unlocked by memsab to let them all back inside true to her word sarah had gotten the sweets and when the others filed in through the front door she was waiting in the entrance hall with grey on her shoulder as usual to give out their shares as soon as they came in nan handed hers over to tommy without a murmur or a second glance although she was inordinately fond of sweetssarah looked startled then speculative as she spotted nans hatbox sarah you just gotter see nan began when memsab interrupted i believe that we need to make a very careful introduction nan she said steering nan deftly down the hall instead of up the stairs sarah would you and grey come with us as well i believe that nan has found a friend very like grey for herselfbut we are going to have to make sure that they understand that they must at least tolerate one another there was a room on the first floor used for roughhousing on bad days it had probably been a ballroom when the mansion was in a better neighborhood now other than some ingenious draperies made out of dust sheets it didnt have a great deal in it but chests holding battered toys and some chairs pushed up against the walls for heat there was an iron stove fitted into the fireplace this being deemed safer than an open fire this was where memsab brought them and sat sarah and grey down on the worn wooden floor with nan and her hatbox which was beginning to move as a restless raven stirred inside it across from her all right nan now you can let him out memsab decreed nan had to laugh as neville popped up like a jackinthebox when she took off the lid his feathers very much disarranged from confinement in the box he shook himselfthen spotted grey grey was already doing a remarkable imitation of a pinecone with every feather sticking out and growling under her breath neville roused his own feathers angrily then looked sharply at nan no she said in answer to the unspoken question you aint sharin me grey is sarahs but you gotter get along cause sarahs the best friend i got an my friends gotter be friends with her friend you hear that sarah added to grey catching the parrots beak gently between thumb and forefinger and turning the parrots head to face her this is nans special bird friend hes going to share our room but hell have his own food and toys and perches so you arent going to lose anything you see and you have to be friends because nan and i are both birds clearly thought this over and it was grey who graciously made the first move want down she said smoothing her feathers down as sarah took her off her shoulder and put her down on the floor neville sprang out of his hatbox and landed within a foot of grey and now it was his turn to make a gesturewhich he did with surprising graciousness ork he croaked then bent his head and offered the nape of his neck to grey now in greys case that gesture could be a ruse for nan had known her to offer her necksupposedly to be scratchedonly to whip her head around and bite an offending finger hard but neville couldnt move his head that fast his beak was far too ponderous furthermore he was offering the very vulnerable back of his head to a stabbing beak which was what another raven would have not a biting beak would grey realize what a grand gesture this was evidently she did with great delicacy she stretched out and preened three or four of nevilles feathers as collective breaths were released in sighs of relief truce had been declared alliance soon followed in fact within a week the birds were sharing perches except at bedtime when each perched on the headboard of their respective girl it probably helped that grey was not in the least interested in nevilles raw meat and neville was openly dismissive of greys cooked rice and vegetables when there is no competition for food and affection alliance becomes a little easier within a remarkably short time the birds were friendsas unlikely a pair as the street brat and the missionarys child neville had learned that greys curved beak and powerful bite could open an amazing number of things he might want to investigate and it was clear that no garden snail was going to be safe come the spring grey had discovered that a straight pointed beak with all the hammerlike force of a ravens neck muscles behind it could break a hole into a flat surface where her beak couldnt get a purchase shortly afterward there had ensued a long discussion between memsab and the birds to which neither nan nor an anxious sarah were party concerning a couple of parcels and the inadvisability of birds breaking into unguarded boxes or brightlywrapped presents after the incident with the faux medium and the spirit of the child of one of memsabs school friends rumors concerning the unusual abilities sarah and nan possessed began to make the rounds of the more esoteric circles of london most knew better than to approach memsab about using her pupils in any waythose who did were generally escorted to the door by one of sahibs two formidable school guards one a gurkha the other a sikh a few a very few of sahib or memsabs trusted friends actually met the girlsand occasionally nan or sarah were asked to help in some occult difficulty nan was called on more often than sarah although had memsab permitted it sarah would have been asked to exercise her talent as a genuine medium four times as often as nan used her abilities one day in october after memsab had turned away yet another importunate friend and her friend a thin and enthusiastic spinster wearing a rather eccentric turban with a huge ostrich plume ornament on the front and a great many colored shawls draped all over her in every possible fashion nan intercepted her mentor memsab why is it you keep sendin those ladies away she asked curiously there aintisntno harm in emleast not that one anyway a bit silly she added judiciously but no harm the wonderful thing about memsab was that when you acted like a child she treated you like a childbut when you were trying to act like an adult she treated you as one memsab regarded her thoughtfully and answered with great deliberation i have some very strong ideas about what children like sarahor youshould and should not be asked to do one of them is that you are not to be trotted out at regular intervals like a musichall act and required to perform another is that until you two are old enough to decide just how public you wish to be it is my duty to keep you as private as possible and lastly her mouth turned down as if she tasted something very sour tell me something nando you think that there are nothing but hundreds of ghosts out there queuing up to every medium simply burning to tell their relatives how lovely things are on the other side nan thought about that for a moment well she said after giving the question full consideration no if there was i dontsppose sarahd hev a moment of peace theyd be at her day an night leave alone them as is still alive memsab laughed exactly so given that can you think of any reason why i should encourage sarah to sit about in a room so thick with incense that it is bound to make her ill when nothing is going to come of it but a headache and hours lost that she could have been using to study or just to enjoy herself an a gaggle of silly old women fussing at er nan snorted i see memsab and some of the things that you and sarah are asked to do i believe are too dangerous memsab continued with just a trace of frown and why if grown men have failed at them anyone should think i would risk a pair of children she shook herself and smiled ruefully down at nan adults can be very foolishand very selfish nan just snorted as if she didnt know that hadnt her own mother sold her to a pair of brothel keepers and neville perched on her shoulder made a similarly scornful noise has he managed any real words yet nan memsab asked her attention distracted she crooked a finger in invitation and neville stretched out his head for a scratch under the chin not yet memsabbut i kind uv get ideers about what he wantst tell me nan knew that memsab would know exactly what she was talking about and she was not disappointed they say that splitting a crow or ravens tongue gives them clear speech but i am against anything that would cause neville pain for so foolish a reason memsab said and it is excellent exercise for you to understand what is in his mind without words quork said neville fairly radiating satisfaction after that nan put her full attention on the task of understanding what was in nevilles mind without words it proved to be a slippery eel to catch sometimes it all seemed as clear as the thoughts in her own mind and sometimes he was as opaque to her as a brick i dunno how you do it she told sarah one day when both she and neville were frustrated by her inability to understand what he wanted hed been reduced to flapping heavily across the room and actually pecking at the book he wanted her to read or rather to open so that he could look at the pictures shed have gone to memsab with her problem but their mentor was out on errands of her own that day and was not expected back until very late grey cocked her head to one side and made a little hissing sound that nan had come to recognize as her sigh she regarded nan first with one greyyellow eye then with the other it was obvious that she was working up to saying something and nan waited hoping it would be helpful ree grey said at last lax she means that youre trying too hard both of you sarah added thoughtfully thats why grey and i always know what the others thinkingwe dont try we dont even think about it really we just do and thats because weve been together for so long that its likelike knowing where your own hand is you see we dont have to think about it we dont even have to try nan and neville turned their heads to meet each others eyes nevilles eyes were like a pair of shiny jet beads glittering and knowing itshard nan said slowly sarah nodded greys head bobbed i dont know nan i guess its just something you have to figure out for yourself nan groaned but she knew that sarah was right neville sighed sounding so exactly like an exasperated person that both of them laughed it wasnt as if they didnt have plenty of other things to occupy their timeordinary lessons for one thing nan had a great deal of catching up to do even to match sarah they bent their heads over their books nan with grim determination to master the sums that tormented her so it wasnt the simple addition and subtraction problems that had her baffled it was what miss bracey called logic problems little stories in which trains moved toward each other boys did incomprehensible transactions with each other involving trades of chestnuts and marbles and promised apple tarts and girls stitched miles of apron hems her comprehension was often sidelined by the fact that all these activities seemed more than a little daft sarah finished her own work but bravely kept her company until teatime by that point nan knew she was going to be later than that in finishing go get yer tea lovey she told the younger child ill be along in a bit so sarah left and she soldiered on past teatime and finished her pages just when it was beginning to get dark she happened to be going downstairs to the kitchen in search of that tea that she had missed when she heard the knock at the front door at this hour every single one of the servants was busy so she answered it herself it might be something important or perhaps someone with a message or a parcel somewhat to her surprise it was a london cabby who touched his hat to her scuze me miss but is this the harton school he asked nan nodded getting over her surprise quickly it must be a message then either from memsab or sahib harton they sometimes used cabbies as messengers particularly when they wanted someone from the school brought to them usually it was sahib wanting agansing selim or karamjit but sometimes it was nan and sarah who were wanted then oive got a message an oive cometfetch a miss nan an a miss sarah he cleared his throat ostentatiously and carried on as if he was reciting something he had memorized missus harton sez to bring the gurrels to er for shes got need of em thats meimtbring em upt number ten berkeley square nan nodded for this was not by any means the first time that memsab had sent for them although she was loath to make use of their talents there were times when she had felt the need tofor instance when they had exposed the woman who had been preying on one of memsabs old school friends london cabs were a safe way for the girls to join her no one thought anything of putting a child in a cab alone for a tough london cabby was as safe a protector as a mastiff for such a journey nan however had a routine on these cases that she never varied come in she said imperiously to the cabby you sits there oill get the gels she did notyetreveal that she was one of the gels the cabby was not at all reluctant to take a seat in the relative warmth of the hall while nan scampered off without thinking about itshe suddenly knew exactly where sarah and grey and neville were she knew because neville was in the kitchen with the other two and the moment she needed them shed felt the information like a memory but different stunned she stopped where she was for a moment without thinking about itso that was what grey had meant but if memsab needed them there was no time to stand about contemplating this epiphany she needed to intercept karamjit on his rounds he would be inspecting the cellar about now making certain that no one had left things open that should have been shut as long as the weather wasnt too cold memsab liked to keep the cellar aired out during the day after all it wasnt as if there was fine wine in the old wine cellar anymore that needed cool and damp karamjit however viewed this breech in the security of the walls with utmost suspicion and faithfully made certain that all possible access into the house was buttoned up by dark so down into the cellar nan went completely fearless about the possibility of encountering rats or spiders after all where she had lived rats spiders and other vermin were abundant and there she found karamjit lantern in hand examining the coal door not an easy task since there was a pile of seacoal between him and the door in the ceiling that allowed access to the cellar karamjit memsabs sent a cabtfetch men sarah she said nummer ten berkeley square berkeley square was a perfectly respectable address and karamjit nodded his dark head in simple acknowledgment as he repeated it i shall tell sahib when he returns from his warehouse karamjit told her turning his attention back to the cellar door he would karamjit never forgot anything selim might if he was distracted or concentrating on something else but karamjit never satisfied nan ran back up the stairs to collect sarah grey and nevilleand just for good measure inform the two cooks of their errand in nans mind it never hurt to make sure more than one person knew what was going on why do you always do that sarah asked when they were both settled in the closed cab with grey tucked under sarahs coat and neville in his hatbox do what nan asked in surprise tell everyone where were going sarah replied with just a touch of exasperation it sounds like youre boasting that memsab wants us and were getting to do things nobody else in the school gets to it does nan was even more surprised that aspect simply hadnt occurred to her well that aint what i mean and i aint goin ter stop cause summun oughter know where were goin sides us what if memsab got hurt or somethin else happened to er wouldn even hevtbe anything about spooks or whatnotjust summun decidin tcosh er on account uv shes alone an they figger on robbin er whatre we supposed ter do if that appens oos gonna lissentcouple uv little girls eh ow longud it take ustfind a perleeceman so longs summat else knows where weve gone if theres trouble sahibll come lookin fer us but e cant if e dont know where we are see oh sarah looked less annoyed im sorry i thought you were justshowing off nan shook her head nah i show off plenty as tis she added cheerfully butwell i figger around memsab theres plenty uv thingstgo wrong an why make it worse by bein stupid an not tellin where were goin clever bird grey said voice muffled by sarahs coat quork neville agreed from within his box sarah laughed i think they agree with you she admitted and changed the subject i wonder why memsab sent for us dunno cabby didnt say nan admitted i don think e knows all i knows that berkeley squares a respectble neighborhood so it might be one of er fancy friends again not she added philosophically that ye caint get coshed at a respectble place as easy as anywheres else plenty uv lightfingered lads as works ascot fer instance do you always look on the bright side nan sarah asked in a teasing tone of voice that told nan she was being twitted for her pessimism nan was just about to let her feelings be hurtafter all just how was someone whose own mother tried to sell her to a brothel keeper supposed to thinkwhen her natural good humor got the better of her nah she said dismissively sometimes i get pretty gloomy sarah stared at her in surprise for a moment then laughed it was fully dark when they arrived and the cabby dropped them off right at the front door the lady sedtgo on in an upt the room up there as is lit he told them pointing to an upper room light streamed from that window very much more welcoming than the rest of the darkened house before either girl could ask anything further he snapped the reins over the horses back and drove off leaving them the choice of standing in the street or following his directions nan frowned this dont seem rightthere aughter be servants about sarah however peered up at the window memsab must be with someone whos hurt or ill she said decisively someone she doesnt dare leave alone and before nan could protest shed run up to the door and pushed it open disappearing inside bloody ell nan hurried after her with neville croaking his disapproval as his box swung beneath her hand but she hadnt a choice sarah was already charging up the staircases ahead of her something was very wrong herewhere were the servants no house in berkeley square would be without a servant to answer the door and as she rushed through the door she noticed something else there wasnt any furniture or pictures in the front hall eitherand that was just wrong all over she raced up the stairs with her feet thudding on the dusty carpet covering the treads aided only by the light from that single door at the top she wasnt in time to prevent sarah from dashing headlong into the lit roomso she perforce had to follow right in through that door left invitingly half ajar memsab she heard sarah call were here mem only to stop dead in the middle of the room as sarah had staring at the cluster of paraffin lamps on the floor near the window lamps which had given the illusion that the otherwise empty room must be tenanted there was nothing in that room but those four lamps nothing and more importantlyno one its a filthy trick nan shouted indignantly and turned to run out only to have the door slam in her face before she could get over her shock there was the rattle of a key in the lock and a further sound as of bolts being thrown home then they heard the sound of footsteps rapidly retreating down the stairs the two girls looked at each other aghast nan was the first to move because her immediate thought was that the men shed been sold to had decided to collect their property and another girl as well for their troubles anyone else might have run at the door to kick and pound on it screaming at the top of her lungs she put down the hatbox and freed neville even more than grey the raven with his murderous claws and beak was a formidable defender in case of trouble and neville knew it she felt his anger and read it in his ruffled feathers and the glint in his eye grey burst from the front of sarahs coat all by herself growling in that highpitched grating voice that she used only when she was at her angriest she stood on sarahs shoulder every feather erect with aggression and wings halfspread nan growled under her breath herself and cast her eyes about looking for something in the empty room that she could use as a weapon there was what was left of a bed in one corner and nan went straight to it sarah get that winder open if you can she said wrenching loose a piece of wood that made a fairly satisfactory club mebbe we can yell fer help she swung the bit of wood feeling the heft of her improvised club with that in her hand she felt a little betterand when whoever had locked them in here came backwelltheyd get a surprise nantheres something wrong at the hollow tone in sarahs voice nan whirled and saw that she was beside the window as white as a sheet nani dont think a stick is going to be much use now she faltered pointing a trembling finger at the lamps and as nan watched the flames of the lamps all turned from yellow to an eerie blue all nan could think of was the old saying flames burn blue when spirits walk nan felt every hair on her body standing erect and her stomach went cold and not because of some old saying no oh no there was danger very near sarah might have sensed it first but nan felt it surrounding both of them and fought the instinct to look for a place to hide neville cawed an alarm and she turned again to see him scuttle backward keeping his eyes fixed on the closed door the lamp flames behind her dimmed throwing the room into a strange blue gloom neville turned his back on the door for a moment but only long enough to leap into the air wings flapping frantically to land on her shoulder he made no more noise but grey was making enough for two his eyes were nothing but pupil and she felt him shivering theres something outside that door sarah said in a small frightened voice and whatever tis locks and wood aint goint keep it out nan said grimly she did not say aloud what she felt deep inside whatever it was it was no mere ghost not as she and sarah knew the things it hated the living it existed to feed on terror but that was not all that it was or did it was old oldso old that it made her head ache to try and wrap her understanding around it and of all that lived it hated people like sarah the most that thing out there would destroy her as casually as she would swat a flybut it wanted sarah greys growling rose to an earpiercing screech sarah seemed frozen with fear but grey was not grey was ready to defend sarah with her life grey was horribly afraid but she was not going to let fear freeze her neither was neville and i aint neither nan told herself defiantly and though the hand clutching her club shook she took one steptwothree and planted herself squarely between whatever was behind the door and sarah it would have to go through her neville and grey to reach what it wanted i tol karamjit where we wentan when memsab comes ome wiout us she knew that was the only real hope that help from the adults would come before thatpresencedecided to come through the door after them or if she could stall it could somehow delay things keep it from actually attacking suddenly grey stopped growling the light from behind her continued to dim the shadows lengthened collected in the corners and stretched toward them there was no more light in here now than that cast by a shadowed moon nan sucked in a breath something dark was seeping in under the door like an evil pool of black water the temperature within the room plummeted a wave of cold lapped over her and her fingers and toes felt like ice that wave was followed by one of absolute terror that seized her and shook her like a terrier would shake a rat ree grey barked into the icy silence lax the word spat so unexpectedly into her ear had precisely the effect grey must have intended it shocked nan for a split second into a state of notthinking just being suddenly all in an instant she and neville were one knowledge poured into her and fire blossomed inside her a fire of anger that drove out the terror a fierce fire of protectiveness and defiance that made her straighten take a firmer grip on her club she opened her mouth and words began pouring out of herguttural words angry words words she didnt in the least understand that passed somehow from neville to her going straight to her lips without touching her mind at all but she knew she knew they were old words and they were powerful the light from the lamps strengthened and with each word she felt a warmth increasing inside her a fierce strength pouring into her was it from her feathered companion just as the words were or was it the words that brought this new power no it wasnt the light behind her that was increasing it was the light around her cor a golden halo of light surrounded her increasing in brightness with every word that spilled from her lips and now grey joined in the chanting for chanting it was she caught the pattern now a repetition of some fortytwo syllables that sounded like no language fragments nan had ever heard she knew what italian hebrew and chinese all sounded like even if she couldnt speak or understand them for folk of all of those nationalities thronged the slums where she had lived from whitechapel to limehouse she knew what latin greek and french all sounded like too since those were taught at the school this language definitely wasnt any of those but when grey took over the chant nan stopped she didnt need to speak anymore now it was grey who wove an armor of words about herand a moment later sarahs voice shaking faltering but each syllable clear if faint thenshe went all wobbly for a moment as if something gave her a good cuff she experienced a sort of internal lurch of vision and focus a spirit earthquake the room faded thinned became ghostly the walls receded or seemed to everything became dim and gray and a cold wind buffeted her swirling around her on the other side of that door now appallingly transparent bulked an enormous shadow that was what was oozing under the door reaching for them held at bay by the golden light around her the shadow wasnt what filled her with horror and fear howeverit was what lay at the heart of it something that could not be seen even in this halfworld but which sent out waves of terror to strike devastating blows on the heart and images of exactly what it intended to do to those who opposed itand the one it wanted now the shadow was on their side of the door and there was no getting past it the shadow billowed and sent out fat writhing tentacles toward her but nan was not going to break not for this thing whatever it was not when her friend needed protecting from this horror that was going to devour her and take her body for its own she brandished her cluband as the weapon in her hand ripped through the thick gray tendrils of oily fog the thing sent toward her out of the shadow she saw with a shock that she no longer held a crude wooden club not anymore now she held a shining sword with a blade polished to a mirror finish bronzegold as the heart of the sun and the arm that swung the blade was clad in bronze armor she was taller older stronger wearing a tunic of bright red wool that came to her knees a belt of heavy leather her long hair in a thick plait that fell over one shoulder and neville neville was no heavier than he had been but now he was huge surely the size of an eagle and his outspread wings overshadowed her as his eyes glowed the same bronzegold as her sword and the golden aura that surrounded them both but the form within the shadow was not impressed the shadow drank in her light swallowing it up absorbing it completely then it began to grow even as it loomed over her cresting above her like a wave frozen in time she refused to let the fear it wanted her to feel overwhelm her though she felt the weight of it threatening to close in on her spirit and crush it defiantly she brandished her sword at it no she shouted at it you dont get by it swelled again and she thought she saw hints of something inside it something with a smoldering eye a suggestion of wings at the shoulders and more limbs than any selfrespecting creature ought to have she knew then that this was nothing one single opponent however brave however strong could ever defeat and behind her she heard sarah sob once a sound full of fear and hopelessness grey and neville screamed and the ghost door burst open behind the horror in this strange halfworld what nan saw was a trio of supernatural warriors the first was a knight straight out of one of her beloved fairy books broadsword in hand clad head to toe in literally shining armor visor closedthough a pair of fierce blue eyes burned in the darkness behind the visor with a light of their own the second bore a curved scimitar and was wearing flowing colorful silken garments and a turban centered with a diamond that burned like a fire and could have stepped out of the pages of the arabian nights an avenging jinn and the third carried not a sword but a spear and was attired like nothing nan had ever seen except in a brothel or a filthy postcardin the merest scrap of a chemise a bit of draped fabric that scandalized even nan for inside that little wisp of cloth was memsab the shadow collapsed in on itselfnot completely but enough for the knight to slam it aside with one armored shoulder enough for the jinn and memsab to rush past it and past nan to snatch up sarah and make a dash with her for the now open door with grey flapping over their heads in their wake nan saw the shadow gather itself and knew it was going to strike them down bloody hell she screamedor at least that was what the words that came out of her mouth meant although she certainly didnt recognize the shape of the syllables and desperate to keep it from striking she charged at the thing neville dove at it and the knight slashed frantically upward again it shrank backnot in defeat oh nobut startled that they had dared to move against it and that was enoughjust enoughfor memsab and the jinn to rush past bearing sarah for nan and neville and grey to follow in their wake and for the knight to slam the door shut and follow them down the stairs stairs which with every footstep became more and more solid more and more real until all of them tumbled out the front door of number ten berkeley square into the lamplit darkness the perfectly ordinary shadows and smoke and night sounds of a london street neville fluttered down panting to land on the ground sahib slammed the front door shut behind them and leaned against it holding his side and breathing heavily gone were his armor his swordhe was only ordinary sahib again with a cane to help his bad knee selimand not the jinnput sarah down on the pavement and grey fluttered down to land on her shoulder neville looked up at nan and quorked plaintively while memsab clad in a proper suit but with her skirt hiked up to scandalous shortness did something that dropped her skirt from above her knees to street length again are you two all right she asked anxiously taking sarah by the shoulders and peering into her face then doing the same with nan yesm nan said as sarah nodded faugh sahib coughed as he straightened lets not do that again any time soon shall we im getting too old for lastminute rescues last minute rescuescause we went off alone like a pair of gormless geese oh sahibmemsab nan felt her eyes fill with tears as it suddenly came home to her that her protectors and benefactors had just put themselves into deadly danger to save her oh im sorry i didn mean nan nan you arent to blame sahib said immediately putting one strong arm around her shoulders you did nothing that you shouldnt have done and if you hadnt been so careful we wouldnt have known where you were until it was too late no it was our fault it certainly was memsab said grimly but it was someone elses as well and there is going to be a reckoning when i find out who but lets get away from here first i dont altogether want to find out if the bindings keeping that thing confined to this house will hold under provocation sahib took sarahs arm giving her grey to tuck inside her coat and selim offered a hand to neville who was so tired he hopped onto it without a protest and then lifted the raven onto nans shoulder as they walked quickly away from the building memsab continued someone came to me a few days ago with a story about this place how some haunt was making it impossible to rent out and he was in dire difficulty because of it he wanted sarah or me or both of us together to lay the spiritbut i have heard all of the stories about this address and i knew better than to try something came to dwell there over a hundred years ago and it is not a thing to be trifled with men have died here and more than one and many people have gone mad with fear whatever that thing was is old nan put in with a shudder real real old i dunno how it got ere but it aint no spook well evidently this person decided to force our hand sahib said thoughtfullyand as nan looked up when they passed under a streetlamp she saw that both his face and selims were grim i believe that i will have a private word with him as will ialthough i am sorely tempted to tell him that his devil has been laid and suggest he spend a night there himself memsab said with deep anger in her voice and from now on we will contrive a better way of bringing you girls if i should need you please sarah said in a small voice what happened to nan and neville and you and sahib and selim sahib cleared his throat awkwardly selim just laughed deep in his throat you saw us as we seem to be are sahib corrected dryly are thenwhen we are warriors of the light selim concluded though how nan happened to slip over into a persona and power she should not have until she is oldermuch olderi cannot imagine memsab added with a note in her voice that suggested that she and nan would be having a long a very long talk at some point in the near future then she sighed pray heaven i will not need to begin teaching you ancient celtic any time soon but for now nan was beginning to feel the effect of being frightened nearly to death fighting for the life of herself and her friends and somehow being rescued in the nick of time she stumbled and nearly fell and sahib sent selim in search of a cab in a good neighborhood like this one they were not too difficult to find shortly both the girls were lifted in to nestle on either side of memsab birds tucked under their coats with the heads sticking out for nan had left nevilles hatbox and was not at all inclined to go back after it and in the shelter of the cab neville providing a solid oblong of warmth and the drone of the adult voices above her head safe at last she found herself dropping off to sleep but not before she heard memsab saying i would still like to know how it was that the child came into her aspect without any trainingand where she found the words of power for invoking the holy light and heard grey answer smart neville she said in her sweetest voice very smart nan the children and birds were tucked up safely in their beds and sahib had gone out for that private word with the one who ostensibly owned number ten he had taken both selim and agansing with him leaving karamjit and isabelle herself to stand watch over the house karamjit had made the rounds reinforcing his shields and wards and she had gotten out the set of elemental wards given to her a long time ago before she had left for india and placed them at the cardinal points of the grounds she had no way of knowing on her own if they were still powerful those little fourcolored pyramids of stone and glass but she had faith in the friends who had given them to her she had seldom had to use them twice in india once in england but never since her return the troubling thing about this was that she was not altogether certain the incident had been one mans illconceived attempt to clear his property of the evil that haunted it in fact the more she thought about it the less likely that seemed she sat in her favorite chair beside the fire and though the fire was warm her spirit felt chilled by the prospects of that eventuality karamjit she said to the shadow standing at the window are you as uneasy about this evening as i am at least shining star he replied grimly we have not ended what this night began and the thing behind that door may be the least and most obvious of the evils we face sahib is returned she leaped to her feet as the front bell rang and with karamjit behind her hurried to the front hall not here frederick said sotto voce as he handed his hat coat and gloves to sia to take away she nodded and all five of them returned to the warmth and privacy of his study the bird he said succinctly as he settled into his chair has flown not only that but he was a bird in false feathers i am reliably told and selim has verified that there was no deception on the part of our quarrys servants that mister benson has not been resident in his townhouse for a month he has been salmon fishing in scotland and knowing the gentlemans sporting reputation that is not an opportunity he would have forgone even for a death in the family so whoever it was that called himself benson had no right to that name and no financial interest in the property he grimaced we have as young nan would say been gammoned isabelle took a deep breath which leaves us with the question of why someone would lure those two children there if nan had not told karamjit where she was goingwe would not have known where they were until they were found which would not have been until morning fredericks eyes were dark with rage and we know what state theyd have been in at best if they had lived at least four people who remained overnight in that room have died and several more have gone mad someone wanted those two children dead or insane specifically those two children and not you as well my heart because the cabby was sent at a time when you were away from the school isabelle felt her eyes widening and a cold rage welling up in her heart so we have two linked mysteries to unravelwho and why he nodded and when we have those answers we need something more we need to know what we are going to do about it a deep growl like that of an angry lion interrupted him only let me have my hands upon the dog sahib said karamjit and i added selim darkly the prophet does not forbid peace agansing said unexpectedly this has a larger shape than someone who wishes harm to our children perhaps it is not what they are but what they may become that is at issue here that they may be a great threat in the future perhaps we should first see if other such children have beennegatedof late if so then we deal with someone who takes the long view and is willing to eliminate opposition before the opposition is more than a potential isabelle wrinkled her brows but how can we possibly discover that she protested it would be like trying to find footprints after the tide has washed them away even if children have beenmurderedhow could we find out who they were and what they could have been had they grown up agansing raised an eyebrow there is one here who can discover that memsab fredericks eyes widened and isabelles hand came involuntarily to her throat sarah they said at the same time agansing nodded but it was karamjit who raised the objection they all felt not until all other ways have been tried he said in that tone that meant he would not countenance any other course of action peace agansing said again this time with a suspicion of a twinkle in his eye we are your long friends lion when have you known us to do otherwise karamjit visibly relaxed never he admitted it is my anger speaking not my reason isabelle closed her eyes a moment then said reluctantly this does tend to point in the direction of magic rather than the esoteric you know frederick raised an eyebrow then sighed and you my heart are the only one of us with contacts in those circles i am loathe to ask it of you but i can only suggest that you will need to pursue them then he shook his head and added with a smile it could be worse it could be the esoteric rather than the magic and some of our friends are a trial even to my patience isabelle thought over the last party they had attended when aleister crowley had swept in wearing a flamboyant scarlet cape circled the room without saying a word to anyone then swept out again and as a few people bristled assuming insult beatrice leek had announced in a voice loud enough to be heard in all parts of the room dont mind aleister darling hes just being invisible again trying to get any two of that lot to move in the same direction was like trying to train cats to pull in a tandem harness youre right as usual my love she said and put her hand to her temple in the meantime i am exhausted and so should the rest of you be if we sleep on the problem we may be given some direction at least that was something she could always hope for the next day everything was pretty much back to normal which was both a relief and a bit of a vexation for nan for sarah it was unalloyed relief she had confessed to nan last night that she never ever wanted to see or even think about that thing but nan like the elephants child was full of satiable curiosity and like rikkitikkitavi if she could not get the answers immediately she was bound and determined to run and find out so when her hour with agansing came around before he even opened his mouth to begin her breathing exercise she forestalled him with master agansing what was that orrible thing and for a very long moment there was no sound in the conservatory but the hiss of the steampipes and the drip of water now at the harton school it was the policy of the adults to be as absolutely honest with the pupils as they could sometimes the answer to a question was i dont know often it was i know but i want you to go find out for yourself and i will help you very rarely it was i dont think you are old enough to need that answer but i promise when you are i will tell you this last was seldom if ever invoked for nan as a streetchild there was very little she was too young to know and most of the things under that heading she probably knew already anyway the main use for that particular answer to nan was to let her know as subtly as possible that she was not to impart that information either if one of the other pupils asked her so agansing merely sighed for the disruption of his lesson and answered i do not know missy nan i know that it is old and we are of the opinion that it is a thing more of magic than of spirit now this would be the first timeeverthat agansing had used that word with reference to things nans gran would have labeled uncanny he had always spoken of mental discipline and the full use of all of the senses and transcending the physical and the like she looked at him uncertainly thoughtcher said there aint no such thing as magic she retorted i said nothing of the sort agansing replied with unruffled dignity i said that we do not use such a thing nor use that name i never said it did not exist there are two sorts of ways in which one can manifest power he continued one is to use the power that is within us all which is what we do here myself karamjit selim sahib and memsab and you and missy sarah and some of the other children of course odd he never had come out to tell her which of the other children had talents for that matter neither had any of the other adults briefly she wondered why was this one of those things she was supposed to find out for herself or was this a reflection of the careful way in which the adults guarded the privacy of all the children the second way however is to use the power that exists around us often through an intermediary creature either by means of its cooperation or its coercion that is magic that is what missy sarahs parents can do though we cannot she gaped at him they can this was news to her she wondered if it was news to sarah but they cannot teach sarah in the use of her talents nor do they have any understanding of them this is why she is here he shrugged at any rate we believe that creature is a twisted creature of magic something called an elemental although which it could be or what element it owes its form to we are not equipped to tell this is why it is not like an ordinary haunting which we could banish with some work but since it is clearly a creature either powerful enough transmuted enough or both for ordinary mortals to see and be affected by it is quite beyond us to do anything about it and i can tell you nothing more on that subject and very little on the subject of magic you must ask memsab though she may not answer you and now you will assume the position of meditation her mind buzzing she obeyed and despite her curiosity eating at her she kept her mind on her lessons enough so that agansing gave her a well done under the circumstances you may go the next lesson was history and after that she helped the ayahs get the little ones down for a nap but she kept thinking about magic now given what she had already been learning she was quite prepared to believe that the sort of magic you found in fairy tales was real what she had difficulty in grasping was that there was something that memsab and sahib couldnt master after some consideration she decided that she wouldnt ask memsab about it not just yet last night had been hard on everyone it might be best to let things settle for a bit before she started asking questions especially since there was no telling just where those questions might lead because it might be to a place where she really didnt want to go isabelle was paying a call on an old acquaintance and she wasnt entirely certain what her reception would be it was an acquaintance she had last seen before she had left brokenhearted or so she had persuaded herself for india somehow in all the years she and frederick had lived in london she had not been able to bring herself to renew those old friendships the one or two from those days who had sought her out had made the first overtures not she but after all she was in a very different social circle from theirs and far lower in class as merely the daughter of a country vicar she had been out of their social class back then toobut she had deluded herself for a while that social distinctions did not matter the vicar and his family were always welcome in the homes of the ennobled and wealthyprovided she now knew that they did not overstep their place nor in the case most especially of a daughter dare to think they could actually fit in she felt the old bitterness creeping into her thoughts and ruthlessly throttled it down dont be a fool she scolded herself if you were to ask most of them if they would trade places with you if they were honest with themselves they would how many of those girls she had once called friend were now shackled in loveless marriages to men whose sole qualification for the position of husband was a pedigree wealth and the interesting distinction of being an elemental mage half surely among the elemental masters there was the commonlyheld sentiment that if one was not wedded for family or love by the time one reached the age of twentyone the best one could do would be to at least marry someone appropriate of the right breeding from whom one would not have to conceal ones magic even if you scarcely knew the prospective spouse and had less in common with her than an oxford don with an irish bricklayer yes and i was common as dust and without a penny to my name and no elemental magic small wonder she stifled the rest of the bitter thought it had taken isabelle part of the morning and a steady perusal of the present and past editions of burkes peerage to find out what had become of beatrice delancy she was now lady beatriceor rather as etiquette would have it lady nigel lady nigel lytton to be precise and since lord nigel had figured nowhere in beas adolescent daydreams it was probably safe to assume she could be counted among those who held with the philosophy of marry appropriately isabelle mounted the steps of the elegant townhouse after paying the cabbie and was let in by a faintly contemptuous butler i have faced down psychic vampires old haunts and dacoits my lad you do not frighten me a bit she sent in her card with the added words nee carpenter neatly printed after harton but she was damned if she was going to be ashamed of the address of harton school for boys and girls on it nor was she going to pretend she was anything other than what she was shed tried to do that once and look where it had gotten her if this meant she cooled her heels in the hallway only to be told that my lady is not at home so be it one snub was not going to kill her and beatrice was by no means the only name on her list in fact she had gotten herself so completely prepared for rejection that when bea came flying down the stairs in her soft pink morning wrapper much to the horror of the supercilious butler her hands outstretched in greeting it took her so much by surprise that for a moment she simply gawked at her old friend dumbfounded fortunately the moment didnt last she was too used after all these years to thinking on her feet so it was to her feet that she jumped and the two of them met in an embrace which wiped out all of the years in between their last meeting and this one after which beatrice drew her up the stairs and into her dressing room the harton school now that is the last place i would have expected to find you so no wonder i had no idea you were in london who is this mysterious harton bea asked in teasing tones as she settled isabelle in a comfortable chair and handed her a plate of sugar biscuits he must be something remarkable to have turned you into a schoolmistress i thought you were going to go become some sort of female guru amongst the hindus frederick is rather more than remarkable she replied noting with amusement that aside from a slight fading of the yellowgold of her hair and a slightly plumper figure bea hadnt changed a bit i could equally ask you who lord nigel is bea shrugged dismissed her maid with a little wave of her hand and picked up the teapot nigel isnt the love of my life but he doesnt bore me to death either we both had to marry or our families would have nagged us to death about it and at least we were friends but you bellewho is this harton fellow did you meet him in india tell tell tell there isnt that much to tell she replied he was with the army hes common as clay god bless him and straight from the streets of this very city but a very kind and childless gentleman recognized him for what he was saw to his education and bought him his commission ah another paranormal like you then bea asked shrewdly something like though his talent lies in clairvoyance and clairaudience rather than telepathy and psychometry she admitted with a slight smile well being able to see what was going on over the next hill would be quite useful for a soldier i would think bea chuckled pouring her a cup of tea a good thing he had a mentor though a very good thing his mentor owned a bookshop here in london specializing in rare and esoteric volumes as you might expectand i am sure you will be unsurprised to learn that i frequented the place by that time frederick was already in india and had earned his way up the ranks when this gentleman discovered i was determined to go to india he sent me with introductions to some teachers of his acquaintance and that was where i met frederick all perfectly true so far as it wentthough her explanation did not go nearly far enough and you are leaving out all the good parts i am sure beatrice retorted wagging a finger at her curses and dacoits phantoms and secret societies and all manner of dreadful menaces that the two of you faced which you are sworn not to tell anyone because it all involves occult oaths she had to laugh because bea was actually far too close to the truth something like that yes with the one detail that i can tell you that it was love at first sight for the two of us and when he was discharged weand some fellow native occultistsdecided to come back here to put up the school so that children with psychical talents would have somewhere to go to learn how to manage themselves she sighed and a school that would care properly for the poor little dears who might not have such talents but who still were being shipped back to england there are more bad schools than good i fear and it is useful for anyone dealing with even ordinary children to have some occult talent fellow occultists beatrices eyes sparkled this becomes more interesting all the time hindus one gurkha one sikh and one moslem she replied and a motley assortment of our old servants from india so we do have some hindus among us and buddhists she thought for a moment i am reasonably sure there are no sufis jainists or farsi but i would not be willing to swear to that good heavens belle you brought back the entire crosssection of the subcontinent bea seemed delighted at some point i am going to have to visitand now that i know your school exists i have somewhere to refer children who are talented rather than magicians that is exceedingly useful i know i can count on you to be practical and caring and too many of these people mean well but havent the common sense of my canary your canary has rather more common sense than some of them isabelle said dryly at least the elemental mages are moreorless levelheaded and disciplined which brings me to the reason i wanted to talk to you if i were going to find the person who was the closest thing to a leader in your esoteric circle who would that be and beatrice hesitated that was distinctly peculiar and not at all like beatrice in terms of being a leader in virtually all ways she said slowly i would have said alderscroft lord alderscroft now his father died two years ago poor man hes immensely skilled and quite eclipses most of the other elemental masters hereabouts theyre calling him the wizard of london now and the young lion isabelle managed a slight smile although it gave her a pang to think of how well that name suited him i can see how that would please him she said in as neutral a tone as possible he always did enjoy being the recipient of accolades if he thought he had earned them bea nodded dont men always nigel is just as susceptible but alderscroft does have power and skill and its not just esoteric power either hes gotten political and he has connections hes talking about finding a sympathetic minister revealing what we can do to him and making the elemental masters into an adjunct arm of the war department he says that we will have to reveal our powers to someone eventually so it ought to be on our terms so that we are the ones negotiating from a place of strength but but isabelle prompted buthes just so cold which is an odd thing to say of a fire master i know but he is and he gets worse every time i meet with him even nigel remarked on it and when it comes to commenting on the foibles of his fellow man nigel simply doesnt she smiled slightly he has a terribly sweet temper does my nigel which i thought was a decent reason to marry him earth of course which is why i am here and he is not he cannot abide even this little clean area of london for more than a week at a time but at any rate alderscroft began getting distant just before you left and he would be a hermit i think if he didnt have to interact socially with the rest of us to herd us in the direction he wants or she wrinkled her browhe wouldnt exactly be a hermit because he is everywhere socially one cant go to a party without seeing him but he might as well have an invisible barrier about him she shook her head im doing a very bad job of explaining myself i suppose you would have to see it for yourself thats hardly likely isabelle hesitated a moment then asked the loaded question is lady cordelia still his mentor oh her ladyship is very much present in his life i assure you bea pursed her lips and looked wise if she werent such a pillar of dignity chastity and sanctity one would assume all manner of goingson but i cannot imagine her ladyship removing so much as a glove in the presence of a man she sighed one wants to like her after all it isnt as if there were that many female elemental magicians in london much less another air mage but that offputting manner its as bad or worse than that barrier alderscroft has about him isabelle nodded understanding all too well she was more than halfway convinced that lady cordelia brycecoll was at least partially if not fully responsible for that final snub on alderscrofts part that had sent isabelle off in tears but of course the woman had been as sweet and smooth as honeyed cream in public and had even sent a little bon voyage gift so there was no way to prove anything lady cordelia never gossiped never said an unpleasant word about anyone in public back in her girlhood isabelle and her friends had formed the habit of referring to cordelia as the nun both from her penchant for dressing all in iceblue or white and her demeanor even thinking improper thoughts about her was impossible to this day isabelle who had spent so many years in the sensuous east and been exposed to things that would send most english women reeling back in a dead faint if even hinted at could not imagine cordelia brycecoll in any state other than fully clothed ramrod straight and cool and calm as the marble image of a saint you know bea said thoughtfully i always thought it was her fault that alderscroft snubbed you isabelle gazed at her friend in astonishment whatever makes you say that she asked well who else would it have been after that incident at vesuvius his father wasnt capable of putting two sentences together and besides the old lord liked you if his mother had been alive there might have been trouble but i cant think of anyone else who would have wanted to meddle bea shook her head no it was delia i would stake my diamonds on it isabelle made herself shrug with feigned indifference and sipped her tea it doesnt matter really now does it its all in the past but i think i would rather not consult with alderscroft about this especially not if she is still hanging about him well bea said slowly winding a strand of hair around her finger you might tell me what this is all about i know practically everyone in elemental circles at least in london these days i might be able to help since isabelle could not imagine anyone she would rather talk to she launched into her narrative with a will she began all the way back at the point when little sarah and nan joined the schoolbecause sarah and nan were so integral to the story though i cant in all honesty call nan a charity case when she more than pays for her way with all of the hard work she does then she went on to the phony medium sarahs true mediumistic abilities all the inquiries about the girlsand went from that to the incident in berkeley square bea listened intently to every word well i must say i wish nigel was here that sounds like an earth elemental to be sure but i dont know enough to make an identification she frowned and i dont imagine that an earth master gone wrong is going to identify himself to the rest of us probably not isabelle agreed and sighed still if one of you could look into the situation that my dear is a given bea told her raising her head with a determined set to her chin we simply cant have something like that loose even if it is confined to a single building someone could be hurt if we havent dealt with it by the time nigel returns im sure hell banish it but i suspect i can find a water master to get rid of the vicious thing isabelle sighed and nibbled a biscuit for the sake of politeness this was deliberate you know whoever did this intended to frighten or harm my charges id like to know who set it she braced herself knowing she was unlikely to get an answer to that statement that she would like wellthis is really something that the elemental masters should deal with belle came exactly the reply she had expected we do try to police our own run along little girl and dont bother your pretty head about it the old isabelle would have snapped something rude at her old friend over the years although diplomacy did not come naturally to her she had been forced to acquire it it isnt precisely an issue internal to the elemental masters anymore bea she said gently whoever did this mounted an attack on talented children my charges and my charges specifically were lured there and locked in to be attacked someone sent a cabby to the school to ask for them by name two boundaries have been violated the one that says that the masters are not to attack the talented and vice versa and the one that holds that children are offlimits at the very least i would like to know why if not who there may be more such attacks and i am the protector of these children i have the right to know who i am protecting them against bea had the grace to flush thats true enough she admitted ill see that youre told whatever it is you need whatever you think it is i need still it was the biggest concession she was going to get out of them she nodded and changed the subject to that of her old schoolmates she needed to find out what they were up to anyway she stayed through luncheon at beas insistence it was definitely a treat it wasnt as if the harton school could afford the sorts of dainties lady nigel could put on her table she had arrived by cab she went home in lady nigels carriage the congested streets that slowed the carriages pace to practically nil allowed her to sit back against the velvet cushions and think about her old friends the youngnow not so youngwomen she had gone to school with that school was home to mostly young ladies of rank and privilege she had in fact been given a scholarship or her family never could have afforded it her benefactress had been a talent of no mean ability herself and knowing that there was no school for talented girls had found and sent her to the next best thing presumably the idea had been that she would get the sort of education fit to make her a governess but whatever had been in the donors mind isabelle had found herself in the company of those who also recognized her talent for what it was and shared with her the secret of their own powers for the first time she had found herself among girls from whom she needed to hide nothing for she had been sent to a school populated entirely by and taught by the daughters of elemental masters and magicians there was only one other school like it and that one was for the sons of these same families she was not the only girl on scholarship there nor was she the only one who did not share a spot in burkes peerage but she was the only one of the lessprivileged lot who was comfortable around the titled the legacy of hundreds of tea parties tennis parties and dinner parties accompanying her father to the great house since her mother was no longer alive to do so in english polite society the vicar was the one man who was welcome in the drawing rooms of the rich and the front stoops of the poor and isabelle was well used to accompanying her father to both venues had it not been for her limited and modest wardrobe she could not have been told apart from any of the girls of rank and title isabelle had a knack for making friends for being a warm and caring companion and for acting as both a sounding board and a peacemaker once again of course such traits were invaluable to the daughter of a vicar as she had soothed tempers around the tea table of the ladys friendly society she now soothed ruffled feathers at the school and was accepted as a friend by all as a consequence she was brought along on every possible excursion and if her wardrobe was lacking the clothes chests of all the other girls were flung open and at her disposal and that of course was how the trouble really started there was no way for david alderscroft to have known that she was not in his social circle her borrowed clothing did not betray the fact nor did her manners whenever there was a party that was a girl short isabelle with her wonderful manners got an invitation since the parents in question would always think ah now shes not an elemental mage nor has she independent means shell be no competition for my girl and it was true enough that she should not have beenmost of the young men in question already knew of her and her status and while they laughed and flirted with her it was lightly and with no intent on either side not so david alderscroft he had no idea she was only a vicars daughter he had been schooled at home by private tutors and was not privy to the crucial information that she was in the delicate terminology of his class not quite up to the mark at least in the sense that a marriage to her for any of the scions of these noble houses would have been a marriage far beneath them but she had flattered herself when he began to pay her attention that perhaps she was not so ineligible as all that after all although she was not a magician she did have arcane abilities of her own inherited from both sides of the family her father the vicar was sensitive to spirits and to the emotions of others although she barely remembered her mother her older sisters hinted that mariana carpenter had been even more talented than isabelle was and vicar though he might have been her father saw to it she was properly trained in the use of her unusual abilities and looked the other way when that teaching skirted close to things that might be called pagan he himself did not have the strength of talent to become a warrior of the righthand path and a light bringer but he was terribly proud when she proved to have that level of ability by the time she was enrolled in madame graysons academy in her late teens she had already achieved that accolade and it was one acknowledged by the elemental masters as well as the talented the families of the elemental masters themselves were known to acquiesce to marriage across class boundaries so long as both parties were masters and surely the title of light bringer was the equivalent so there was every reason for her to consider herself david alderscrofts equal and carry herself that way as for david as bea had said his father approved of her entirely though his lordship was a tragic case he and a handful of other elemental masters had been forced to deal with an occult circle led by a renegade fire master and as isabelle understood the story he had stepped in between the master and his own men and absorbed most of the power of an awakening phoenix himself he had not been the same man afterward he acted like one lightning struck with tremors facial tics and an inability to speak clearly but he was able to convey to david that he approved of belle probably because i read him newspapers and books for hours on end of course she and bea could both have misread the poor man maybe he thought david was planning to engage her as a companion and not that david was interested in making her his wife she stared at her hands fingers entwined in her lap and sighed no no she was sensitive enough to know although she had not actually read the poor mans mind on the subject that the late trevor lord alderscroft had liked her for herself and would have been perfectly happy to see her take a wifes place beside his son no she didnt think old lord alderscroft had anything to do with what happened after lady cordelia appeared on the scene without his father david had had no one to properly train him there was no truly strong male fire master in that part of the country but lady cordelia was one of those rare creatures that though she was a master of air also had just enough of fire to do as a teacher and she volunteered to train david the day he turned eighteen davids father must have consented to the plan for lady cordelia was soon a longterm guest at harwinton house the alderscroft ancestral homewhen she wasnt living in her own town house in cambridge none of this however filtered down to the girls at isabelles school nor even to isabelle all she had known at the time was that david had just begun his university education david was attending cambridge most of the girls brothers were either going into the military as officers too young or too old for university or going to oxford david himself never wrote to isabelleafter all it would hardly have been proper and any letters from a young man not ones brother would have been confiscated by the headmistress there should have been no reason for anyone to inform isabelle about anything having to do with david alderscroft isabelle brooded out the carriage window staring at nothing that of course was the official version the unofficial version was that she and david had come to what was known as an understanding or at least she had thought so he had said and more than once that he was going to speak to her father when she came of age if he had meant the comment in jest she thought she would have sensed that shed had every reason to think he regarded her with deep affection even love and she had certainly felt the same she had dreamed not of what life would be like as lady david but of what life would be like as an occultist warrior of the light and a master working together i honestly dont recall ever thinking much about the prestige or the money or the title she sighed and closed her eyes leaning back against the seat cushions the carriage was stalled in traffic and had this been a cab it would have been a great deal less pleasant it would have been even worse in a bus this made a good place to think about the past truth to tell surrounded as she was by the noise of traffic she was conversely as isolated as if she had been on top of a mountain or sitting in splendid silence in a deserted temple in the jungle no it wasnt that the money and the title meant nothing it was that she didnt regard anything above and beyond what constituted a comfortable life as being terribly important pleasant yes but not vital so far as her ambitions well they had always been centered on the realms of the esoteric rather than the mundane and she really truly did not think she had thought covetously about what being married to one of the wealthiest peers in the county would have meant if her memories were correct the largest part of the equation had been that she felt very strongly about davidand if it was perhaps only first love it was still the most powerful emotion she had ever experienced at the time true they had done nothing except walk and talk together for hours at a time but that was far more than many of their contemporaries ever did the understanding that they had was something she had clung to dreamed about and cherished she had been so certain that the bond between them was such that she didnt need letters to know how he felt nor to confirm the depth of his feelings toward her ah but understanding or not that all changed the moment lady cordelia came into his life the next time she saw him at a shooting party he was literally a different person when he greeted her although it was polite enough there was no mistaking his tone of detachment he treated her exactly as he treated all the other girls insofar as affection wentbut insofar as the level of courtesy to her utter shock he had added to his demeanor with her a touch of arrogance that clearly said you are tolerated here because you are polite and wellmannered but you do not and never will belong and that was that his attitude clearly surprised and puzzled the other girls but they said nothing perhaps they assumed he and isabelle had had some sort of lovers quarrel at any rate it was one of those situations where nothing was said but everything was understood and the moment when isabelle first saw lady cordelia she had known deep in her heart who was to blame you could not have said that david danced attendance on her ladyship because he did not and there was nothing remotely loverlike about the way he treated her if anything his attitude was of deference as of the disciple to the great teacher as if she were conveying some great favor to him by giving him her attention it was the sort of attitude one would expect if she had been a great and wise philosopher of the sort that isabelle eventually found in india but the pupils of those great and wise teachers grew more humble in their attitudes toward others not more arrogant the abrupt change in davids attitude was perhaps the worst and most painful experience of isabelles short life perhaps it was just as well that the encounter had occurred at teatime she had been able to plead a headache and retreat to her room not to emerge even for dinner the headache had been real she had cried for hours until her eyes were swollen and her head pounding and fortunately the friend that had invited her in the first place quickly took pity on her and arranged for her to return to the school the next morning so that there were no more such encounters she never accepted another invitation again instead she concentrated on her studies both academic and occult and set her eyes on the goal of leaving the country altogether and somehow getting to india since that had also been a longtime ambition of her benefactress they had arranged for a trip for the two of them with isabelle as the ladys companion her father had been bewildered but accepted it her friend the london bookshop owner gave her people to contact and when she had met frederickeverything changed for the better well she said aloud now i know that my memory of things matches beas that too had emerged from their morning of catching up she had not been mistaken everyone around her had assumed that she and david alderscroft were going to make a couple as soon as she came of the proper age to do so she was not the only one who had been shocked by his change of attitude but perhaps most importantly there had been one fundamental mistake that she had made her immediate circle of friends did not condone davids behavior toward her much less share it now there probably were some girls at the school and there were certainly some young ladies in the exclusive social circle in which david resided who applauded what he had done and felt that isabelle had been pushing herself in where she did not belong but her real friends though she had been blind to it at the time were incensed by his treatment of her their doors were still open to her just as beas had been and that was of vital importance for she was going to have to try to find some way of discovering who had set the trap for sarah and nan without the aid of the tacit leader of the elemental masters hereabouts she laughed aloud remembering what frederick had once said to her when you want something done you ask a man when you want it done quietly and without any fuss you ask a woman perhaps a circle of old friends wasnt a bad place to start david alderscroft looked out over the treeshaded boulevard in front of his town house and frowned too many people too many untidy people clattering back and forth along the pavement a nurse pushing a pram some wretched boy running an errand two carriages and a tradesmans vantoo many people how much better it would have been had there been no one out there the pavement spotless the street silent better still had it been winter everything lightly coated in snow all the imperfections invisible beneath the frozen blanket that would be ideal it would be so tidy if winter remained year round no mess people properly remaining inside their own four walls tradesmen keeping to their proper place in the alleys he entertained himself with a vision of the frozen city for a moment everything as pure and white and clean as new marble with nothing to mar the shining perfection of it he shook his head slightly he shouldnt be obsessing over such trifles he had some serious campaigning to do if he was going to penetrate the circle surrounding her majesty queen victoria it wasnt a circle he would normally have entrée to the queen was very particular about those she allowed near her he wasnt a family man nor was he particularly fond of children her majesty was not noted for her partiality to young men nor was she inclined to put her trust in them but she was susceptible to men in general in the sense that she tended to rely heavily on them and to be manipulated by themnot easily but when you knew what to say to her when and how to say it she tended to defer to your judgment over and above her own david didnt know what those things were nor when and how to say thembut lady cordelia did so if he did his job correctly and managed to get into that magic circle the rest would be easy so she had told him and he believed her nothing she had told him thus far had ever been wrong he turned back to his desk and the frown smoothed here in his office everything was precisely as it should be the books had all been shelved in their proper place along the walls his massive mahogany desk was dustless and polished until one could see ones face in it the turkey carpet was newly swept the ashtrays washed the two leather chairs on the far side of the desk the exact distance from the desk that he favored the blotter was precisely in the middle and his pens pencils paper and ink right where he wanted them this was more like it here was order everything properly arranged and tidy he glanced at his pocket watch saw that it was precisely ten oclock and sat down to begin his correspondence for the day parliament would not be in session again until october there would be nothing to occupy him there until the summer recess was over but that did not mean that he would not be planning for the opening politics was something of a new field for the alderscrofts his father had taken no interest in his seat in the house of lords and neither had his grandfather but david had on lady cordelias advice been active since before his father died he had been taking his seat nearly every day when parliament was sitting for the past three years and had been making a quiet name for himself there in the cleverest way possibleas a voice of moderation no one expected a young man to be the voice of moderation he was attracting attention for that reason it was good attention too the queen approved he worked steadily until luncheon his secretary james came in twice quietly and unobtrusively removing what he had finished with and bringing him new correspondence to deal with some of it was political much was social a very little was business relating to the running of the estate he spent very little time there since his father had died the old manor troubled him in a way he could not define perhaps it was simply that there were too many memories there in any event he left most of that business in the hands of his estate manager pay competent people who know the job lady cordelia had said do not try to attempt things you are not expert at and do not care for good advice and he had gratefully left the estate in the hands of colin foxward the report was good neither too much rain nor too little crops looking favorable and he dismissed the estate from his mind with a feeling of relief it was more of a burden than a blessing so far as he was concernedexcept of course for the income and these days no one held it against a gentleman if his income derived from investment rather than land if it were his choice but it wasnt and besides the old place was useful in the shooting season near enough to london to take the train far enough for good hunting and his gamekeeper did a fine job in making sure there were plenty of pheasant duck and quail it was useful socially and would become more so as he rose in social circles at noon precisely he rose from his desk he did not need to call for his carriage for his household knew his habits it was waiting at the door to take him to his club where he lunched he then spent precisely three hours making social calls not returning home until teatime he couldnt abide taking his tea as a social call difficult enough to make calls on ladies when they were merely receiving for at least then one could escape when the level of chatter grew too high one was trapped at tea and the clatter of china was only eclipsed by the chatter of gossip lady cordelia was the only female of his acquaintance who eschewed gossip she was the only female of his acquaintance who showed any sense about the matter now that he was not busy with politics until the october opening she had resumed his lessons in elemental magic she would be here for tea and then a lesson precisely on time no more than ten minutes after he had arrived he looked out of the window to see her carriage roll up to the front entrance it was a distinctive vehicle most carriages in london were black or dark shades of red green or blue hers was white trimmed in light blue and it was probably the entire job of one servant to keep it clean and shining in the filthy air of the city her horses were matched grays her coachmans livery was light blue a moment after the carriage rolled to a halt the footman opened the door and lady cordelia dressed in her customary colors of paleblue and white descended from the carriage she moved with a cool grace he had never seen in any other woman she glided as if she was on wheels she was curiously ageless her hair so white a blond that it was not possible to see any silver or gray in it her face as smooth and unwrinkled and serene as if carved from alabaster her eyes were a pale bluegray her form as slender as a young birch but as erect and straight as a wand of silver and all in all there could not possibly have been a more perfect physical representation of an air master there was nothing about her of the occasional giddiness or spontaneity of an air master and no sign at all that she had a touch of the passionate element of fire in her but lady cordelia had too firm a grip on the reins of her character and her element to allow passion to come into play in fact she had taught david that passion especially when dealing with fire was dangerous she had instilled in him a discipline and control he had no notion existed before she began teaching him and taught him to keep his elemental creatures under firm control and tight rein she had also taught him something else something he had never seen nor heard of before the absence of fire was cold she taught him how to harness his element in a way that allowed him to create an arctic chill instead of furnace heat and there were elementals that thrived in that atmosphere odd creatures of negative fire if that was possible strange little ice fey and frost fey a kind of countersalamander creatures of snow and glacier andor so she claimedeven the famous yeti though it was highly unlikely he would ever see one of those in england they were utterly obedient to his will never fighting him as opposed to their flamedriven brethren perhaps this was why he liked them so much preferring them over the common aspect of his element one would have thought that water in the form of snow and ice being inimical to his element would have made these creatures just as hostile but in fact this was water locked away in a crystalline form that rendered it unreachable by water elementals in a sense this was where fire conquered water sometimes though he looked back on the days of raw power of careful negotiations with a phoenix with nostalgic longing still those were the days when he was very young childish in fact only children preferred chaos over order uncertainty over certainty children did not understand control and selfcontrol cordelia had set him straight on that path there was a crystalline order to cold that appealed to him as well as every snowflake was an orderly lattice mathematical and precise so was the matrix of spells that controlled the cold the only flaw in the situation and it was a small one was that the elemental creatures he had so far encountered were inferior in power to those of flame still it wasnt as if he was going into duel arcane any time soon those unhappy days were over cordelia entered the drawing room followed immediately by the maid with the tea cart and he advanced to greet her exactly as always the comfort of wellrehearsed pathways making him feel settled she extended a kidgloveclad hand for him to shake he took it squeezed it once and released it she smiled faintly my dear david she said taking her place in her favorite chair and motioning to the maid to begin serving i am given to understand you have been exceptionally busy this afternoon following up on an invitation to meet with the prime minister no less i am impressed by your progress he no longer wondered how she knew these things her sources of information were logical they were in the same circle of friends she would have been told of the invitation at some point during her morning calls and it was beyond the realm of possibility that he would not have been putting great thought into the exact wording of his acceptance this afternoon its only a large dinner party he replied hastily making it clear that although he had managed this himself it was an inferior achievement to those things she could do for him i doubt very much that i will be able to get more than a word or two with him but that will be several words more than you have gotten heretofore she countered with no sign of disapproval congratulations he felt a little glow at her praise and indeed he had worked hard to get this invitation he suspected that he had ultimately gotten the invitation because he was an eligible bachelor and the lady of the house had two unmarried daughters to dispose of not that he would even consider either of them he had higher ambitions and any wife he took would have to fit those ambitions neither of the two hapless daughters fit that mold but of course she would not know that you manipulated people by knowing their weaknesses and exploiting them in such a manner that they did not actually feel exploited best of all was if you could exploit them in such a manner that they felt an obligation to accommodate you or a desire to fulfill your desire he had never met anyone quite as skilled at doing this as cordelia she could extract nearly anything she wanted from someone and leave him or her with the feeling that it was cordelia who had been conferring the favor and yet this approach failed regularly with elemental masters who seemed impervious to her charms david found that something of a puzzle perhaps it was only that she was a mere female while men as a whole were susceptible to womanly wiles elemental masters took a longer view of things and were inclined never to make hasty decisions when it came to matters of magic so although they might smile and nod and be charmed while cordelia was with them they would commit to nothing without first taking time to think it over without cordelia there her propositions often seemed less attractive and even reasonable suggestions coming from a woman appeared to be trivial matters even a woman like cordelia the most that i hope for is to be memorable in a positive sense to the pm he told her anything beyond that is less than likely but the next time i stand to speak if the pm has some recollection that i appeared to be a grave sensible fellow he is more likely to note my speech her faint smile bestowed her approval on him i wish that all my protégés could have been as wise as you she replied those of air could never achieve a proper understanding of how a serious approach to all things is of great benefit and those of fire never would understand that the discipline of the opposite aspect of fire allows one to impose control on every aspect of fire he did not allow her rare praise to go to his head instead he turned the subject to commonplaces things the invitations he had accepted or declined whether he intended to go to the country at all this summer and some initial planning for the first shooting party of the season she no longer gave him daily instruction in the control of his element only if he found himself at an impasse did he ask for her help and that only rarely she was more likely to direct him to certain volumes in her esoteric library or his own she left at six precisely they both had social obligations which often but by no means always overlapped tonight he had nothing a rare evening to stay at home not that it would be a leisurely evening he had reading to catch up on yet when the house was silent the servants all safely belowstairs and only the everpresent hum of london a steady backdrop to his thoughts he found himself paying very little attention to the book in his hand instead he found his eyes straying to the greenery outside the window and his thoughts back to a time before he had ever met cordelia belle the memories of his first love no say infatuation rather since it was obvious from the first how unsuitable the attachment had been had he only been sensible enough to acknowledge the fact the details of her face had become hazy over the years but certainly belle had never been the sort of striking beauty that cordelia was even to this day fine eyes though really her best feature odd he hadnt thought of her in years shame hed had to snub her the way he had but cordelia had been right it was the only way to effectively put the girl in her place and show her that her foolish dreams were only that dreams and no more substantial than air some of the other girls in her set had initially come over a bit nasty to him afterward hed been forced to make his indifference to their anger clear and after all they were only schoolgirls they couldnt possibly have understood that romance had no place in the alliances of their class and their calling a word or two by cordelia in certain parental ears had cleared all that up after all if the masters were to start indulging in the foolishness of romantic attraction when it came to marriage well the next thing you knew some duchess daughter would go running off with the dustman or the chimney sweeper still the hurt that had been in those eyes he shook his head to rid it of the unwanted thought it was not as if he had plunged a dagger into her it was nothing more than something she should have expected from the beginning it had been no worse a tragedy than a child denied a sweet it ought not to have been promised nor craved in the first place it was her own fault anyway she had brought all the hurt on herself with her silly lendinglibrary romances and the friends who had done her no favors by allowing the country vicars daughter to think she was the social equivalent of the rest of them it had been on a night exactly like this one a summer house party the first of the summer after the end of the oxford term probably that was why his thoughts had wandered in this unpleasant direction a breath of breeze holding more than usual of the scent of blossoms perhaps or a momentary lull in the sound of the traffic that triggered memories best forgotten memories of startlingly intelligent conversation of learning with some fascination about the world of those whose talents had nothing to do with magic sometimes just listening to the stories of life in a small village so different from his own childhood he shook his head again what was wrong with him this was ridiculous yes the girl had been vaguely attractive had a certain intelligence and a naïve charm but that was all she certainly didnt warrant more than a passing thought still he wondered what had become of her she had vanished from the party had not come down to dinner and the next day there had been some specious story about being taken ill and going back to schoolif the girl really had been ill she wouldnt have made a journey all the way back to a school that was ninetenths empty over the summer recess and after that nothing except for a rumor she had gone to india probably chased down some poor officer and married him before anyone got a chance to object the women that went out to india alone or as someones companion were generally husband hunting there were a great many unattached officers in india and very few unattached british women isabelle was probably over there now queen of a bungalow having snared herself a captain his mind began to complete that pictureexcept that the bungalow began to shape itself into his drawing room and the hindu servant into his own parlor maid and that was when he resolutely and with an unwarranted feeling of anger set his mind to reading that damned book it was a small room and austere but exquisite in every detail the floor of the finest white carerra marble was polished to a mirror gleam the walls were likewise of the same marblewhich was a little unusual and gave the room the look of a cube made of snow the ceiling was made of glass panels but not clear they were opaque glass swirled whites and pale pale blues leaded into a pattern that teased at the mind because it almost looked like a great many things but it was not possible to say precisely what it was the effect was slightly disturbing there were no windows light came from four lamps of opaque white glass standing on four metal marbletopped tables one in each corner there was something odd about those lamps the light they gave off was dim and blue not the yellow of an oilfueled flame it could have been gas turned down until the flame was blue but there was no evident gas pipe and at any rate a flame like that should have been too hot for a glass shade and in an era when people crowded furniture into their rooms until there was scarcely space to turn this room had only the four small tables and in the center a very strange chair and a fifth table the chair a single solid piece of quartz crystal looked like something carved out of ice the table identical to the four in the corners of the room held at the moment nothing the chair however held lady cordelia her eyes rested on the empty surface of the table and there was a frown of concentration on her face and only when a puff of mist and a breath of cold manifested on the tabletop did she stop frowning speak she said the mist curled into the shape of a tiny wingless dragon that seemed to be made of transparent crystal this was an ice wurm the elemental opposite of the salamander yet strangely controlled by fire the children are now further protected it hissed by earth and air by fire and wateras well as by spirit the woman has new allies cordelia frowned again powerful allies she asked but the ice wurm did not reply as it would not if it did not know the answer so show me the woman she demanded she had viewed the face of her enemy in the past but only briefly to assess and dismiss her it seemed further examination was in order the ice wurm breathed on the tabletop and a mirror of ice formed at its feet cordelia leaned forward and stared into it pondering the rather uncompromising features of the woman shown there as she stared she tapped one perfectly manicured fingernail on the tabletop she ignored the simple gown which was perfectly in keeping with a schoolmistress of modest means this woman was far more than she seemed on the surface and gowns were irrelevanta mistake in assessment that cordelia had already made with her she had begun to form the reluctant conclusion that this unprepossessing woman was the same forgettable girl with whom david had formed an inappropriate relationship years ago just as she herself had come on the scene she thought the chit had been properly dealt with then butthere was an echo of that girl there and how many female occultists in london had attained the levels to which this woman had risen and yet it seemed the height of improbable coincidence that it should be she there was no reason for their paths to cross at this point much less their swords the girl had vanished from polite society as was only proper no mere vicars daughter should have been pushing herself into elemental master circles much less the social circles in which cordelia was a leading light cordelia had not even troubled herself to discover where she had gone it was fruitless to attempt to hunt down the fly one has swatted away so long as it does not return david had seen the error of his ways and it was unlikely in the extreme that he would ever encounter the girl again butthe given name was the same isabelle andthe child had formidable psychical powers even back then she would not have been in the school she had been attending if she had not the features were similar enough at least insofar as cordelias vague memory of the girl went cordelias frown deepened this was more than mere coincidence the longer she stared the more convinced she became this woman was the older version of that child she had sent packing how else would she have gotten magicians of all four elements to protect her charges certainly not by recruiting from occult circles which contained by and large people with no elemental power worth speaking of the mere existence of those children could be detrimental to her plans for david alderscroft there were just not that many genuine mediums around and certainly none of the power the younger of the two children possessed elemental magicians of course while they could certainly see spirits were disinclined to do anything much about them if there was a particularly troubling revenant one might send it on its way of course but for the most part elemental mages considered the realm of the spirits to be something in which they did not meddle renegade earth masters could and did use them as weapons but they were generally not terribly effective against another master in full possession of his or her powers it was rather like trying to use a swarm of bees to kill a horse it could be done of course but the horse would have to face a swarm of immense numbers be unaware of the attack until it was too late and be unable to run once the attack began cordeliatook a different tack it had begun much longer ago than she cared to think about when the honorable cordelia westron had made the grand tour with a number of her schoolmates they had found themselves locked into one of the finer resorts in switzerland by an unseasonable spate of blizzards and while the rest of her party amused themselves with cards and dancing flirting with the young men similarly stranded and complaining about the conditions cordelia had decided to take up a guides offer to walk to a glacier after all she was an air master in her opinion there was nothing that mere weather could do to harm her with her own powers keeping her much more comfortable than the shivering guide she found the landscape utterly fascinating there was something very attractive to her in those vast stretches of pure white snow and ice and stark black rock a spartan beauty that was very appealing especially after being locked in an overheated hotel smelling of rich food and perfume with a lot of chattering magpies and when she found the ice cave despite the guides remonstrations she insisted on going in the blue stillness drew her the silence in which she and the guide were the only living things the purity of it the hygienic sterility and then suddenly the guide became very quiet she had turned to find him as frozen in place as any statue she had tried to shake him then slap him out of his stupor but nothing broke the spell she had been about to invoke the element of air to wake him when a flat sheet of ice formed between her and him the ice took on a mirror sheen and she found herself staring at herselfor rather a reflection of herself pretty mortal child a voice in her head had crooned so strong in her element she had looked wildly about for the source of the internal voice but had seen nothing a pity such beauty is mortal too the voice continued and as she watched in horror the image before her aged aged rapidly until what stood before her was a hideously distorted reflection of an old senile and withered crone wearing her clothing which sagged and bagged on the shrunken bent body with a gasp she had stepped forward and involuntarily touched the mirror you do not like what you see the voice had been sardonic oh of course not you silly mayfly mortals who do not understand preservation only consumption you devour in moments what has taken long years to produce then wonder why everything about you withers including yourselves look at yourself you who are the very epitome of the eroding property of air instead of the slow preserving of ice you could remain ageless in your beauty and instead you fling yourself headlong into the abyss to whirl yourself away to nothingness that had caught her attention but she was cautious enough not to grasp for what the voice had hinted at instead she had stepped back you imply a great deal she had said boldly but ice is only the other side of the element of fire i am a master of air and even if i do not yet know how to control you whoever you are i have the means to destroy you a silent laugh had been her only answer and the mirror dispersed into icy mist again the guide woke from his frozen state without knowing he had ever been in it and the two of them left the ice cave but she had come back oh yes she had come back again this time alone this time determined to have some answers she had gotten them too some of them anyway though she was still not entirely sure what the creature of the ice cave called itself possibly an ice dragon it was more powerful than any phoenix or firebird she had ever encountered and the only elemental of the flame aspect of fire that was more powerful was an avatar of a fire god or a dragon in return for subjugating her power of air to the power of ice she would be granted a force far more effective than that of air alone it didnt matter to cordelia she had gotten what she wanted and near as she could tell the only thing the entity wanted in return was for more control to be exerted in the world by ice sometimes it was difficult to fathom the motives of elementals by definition they didnt think like humans but that was not pertinent to the moment at this juncture she faced an obstacle in her path in the form of a child medium and the woman who guarded that child the other masters who had taught her made little or no use of revenants and other lingering spirits either from foolish sentimentality or the mistaken conviction that they were byandlarge powerless and that might well be true of those that had been created of random tragedy or out of their own will and reluctance to leave the earth but at the promptings of the elemental in the ice cave cordelia had done some specific and very secret research she learned it was not true of those who were created and bound from the beginning and though the power was subtle it was sure when properly guided cordelia had been creating such servants for decades now a few at a time in any time and place there were always the poor and in any given time and place threefourths of the poor were children now setting aside the difficulties inherent in their immaturity children were the best and easiest human beings to manipulate and thus the best subjects for someone looking for immaterial servants they were used to obeying orders without question they would believe anything told them with authority and they were disinclined to rebellion they were trivially easy to lure away from parents who had little time for them anyway at best and at worse were brutish and brutal cordelia exploited all of these aspects of childhood first she found children with a certain amount of elemental or psychical power then she lured them into the hands of one of her agents with the promise of food and shelter using agents who were not much older than the children themselves where street children were wary of adults they were often inclined to trust one of their own with great care and subtlety she gradually introduced them to herself as the authority figure to which they owed everything and when they were accustomed to obeying her orders even those which seemed odd or even bizarre she killed them quietly peacefully so that they were not even aware that they were dead a dose of morphia in their evening meal and then cold that enveloped them stilled their hearts their breathing their lives painlessly without trauma they woke when she called them and went about the business she sent them on and even when they eventually realized what had happened to them it took weeks months years before they had that revelation by then of course they were used to their situation in many ways it was an improvement over their old life they were no longer hungry cold or in need and none of those cordelia selected were acquainted enough with christianity or any other religion to have any expectation of a joyful afterlife most in fact had been told repeatedly that they were destined for hell and were not in any hurry to proceed on the next leg of that journey they had each other for company and in the endless twilight of their new existence without the powerful and developed personality that an adult would have to hold them together they gradually faded into passive obedient wraiths all looking very much alike so they served her and the few that rebelled she was able to control despite their willfulness and this was what they could do they slipped inside the thoughts of the unwary they drifted into dreams whispering whatever message cordelia wished the victim to hear they hovered waiting for the right moment to murmur cordelias words when there was a flash of doubt they could and did haunt individuals tirelessly relentlessly feeding them what cordelia wanted them to think until the victim became convinced that cordelias thoughts were his own not even elemental masters were immune to this for it was not an attack and the wraiths drifted in past the shields and protections effortlessly so cordelia had won higher title then position then property so she had won social status in the highest of circles and amusingly enough only the fact that she did not want the position and in fact had worked tirelessly to prevent anyone from offering it had kept her from being appointed one of the queens ladiesinwaiting firstly she found victoria herself to be a terrible bore with her obsession with her dead husband and her living children and complete lack of understanding of politics both domestic and international and secondly it was an appointment with less than no power so one child spirit was assigned permanently to the queen murmuring that lady cordelia was an admirable woman perfect in all ways that victoria herself was not really interesting enough to be worthy of lady cordelias friendship that lady cordelia already had so many good works in hand that victoria would be imposing to offer her the position that other honors would certainly be much more appropriate there really was only one group standing in the way of cordelias ambitions men the world was owned and ruled by men women were distinctly secondclass citizens cherished pets at best or chattel at worst men maneuvering for positions of power who listened to the advice of women were thought weak only the artistic could grant status to women and the artistic had no power except in their own circles no matter what she did no matter how many little whisperers she created she would never have the position of power she required men were particularly resistant to those whispers of selfdoubt that were so effective against women the day that cordelia had finally given in to that truth had been one of the few times she had indulged herself in rage but she had not permitted the rage to last long instead she had gotten down to work and knowing that she would never have the secular power she craved in her own name she had set about finding a proper vehicle to be her puppet david alderscroft had not been the first but he had proven to be the most malleable unlike many he was susceptible to those whispers of negativity especially when he began his university studies left the relative isolation of tutors and small private academies and found himself no longer the leading light of his group once he accepted that and once he accepted her as his mentor in magic he was hers there had been the small diversion of that girl but it and she were easily dealt with or so cordelia had thought she pursed her lips bad enough that there was a true medium in london now who was strong enough to hear her whisperers and free them but that this child was being guarded by the same person cordelia had separated from davidthat smacked not of coincidence but of the intervention of something or someone you may go she told the ice wurm who vanished taking its mirror with it to say this was displeasing was an understatement but it was by no means a major setback yet patience that was the byword here patience and vigilance she would have to make sure that her control over her whisperers was absolute and make certain the child in isabelles custody never got the opportunity to spot one of them she would also have to investigate isabelle harton and her school looking more thoroughly for chinks in the armor weaknesses to be exploited ways to bring the school into disrepute perhaps or put them on ground of cordelias choosing it would be enough merely to drive the school and the woman into the countryside for instance or perhaps not even driveperhaps if she could manipulate matters the offer of a suitable building would suffice a building of cordelias selection of course and one in which any number of accidents could happen should it become necessary to try and kill the child again but the main thing was to be patient and enterprisingand no more use of intermediaries that mad irish anarchist earth master had managed to get himself shot by the police only just in time to keep the others from tracing him back to cordelia the first step investigation this time as thorough and as exacting as even the fictional sherlock holmes would appreciate that was one thing she had truly learned back there that day on the ice there was never enough time to rush into something because the amount of effort you would spend undoing hasty mistakes would more than exceed the time you spent doing things carefully thus was the path of the glacier slow relentless unstoppable she left the room to itself closed the hidden door behind her and set her mind on that path nan and neville held themselves very still in the darkness of the closet this was no time for the adults to discover her listening post neville did not so much as flick a feather memsab was pacing and memsab never paced nan recognized the quick light sounds of her footsteps going up and down up and down the room sahib was not pacing but memsab was restless enough for both of them and memsab was not at all happy the mysterious friends of hers who were going to find out who had lured nan and sarah into the clutches of that horrible haunt had found out the whobut not the why and as for the who well he was in nans cynical mind all too conveniently dead in nans world when you wanted to make sure no one spilled a secret you made him a grave man there are more things left unanswered than answered she complained an edge of anger to her voice why would an irish anarchist who had only been in london for two months set a trap to harm or kill two obscure british children that was a very good question the only irish nan knew were not the sort to use a haunt to get revenge when a boot to the head was so much more immediate and satisfying and she rather doubted sarah knew any irishmen at all the workings of a damaged mind asked karamjit doubtfully memsab tsked and he came to learn of them how replied agansing an elemental master was he not in psychical circles and why this makes no sense even for a madman madmen follow their own logic it is true but it is logic the children could have been of no threat no rivalry to him no real interest he could have made no use of them and their harm would not help him in any way he was working for someone else obviously replied sahib someone who does see one or both of the girls as a potential threat now or in the future well never know who now and having gotten their immediate answer the masters are disinclined to look further into the matter sometimes my dove these people make me very annoyed memsab sighed trying to get them to work together is as bea says like trying to herd cats not that our kind is very much easier but at least we are a bit more inclined to gather in groups than they are and to think on the larger scale than personal rivalry and alliance i wish david alderscroft joy of them hmm one hears that he has succeeded in reviving a masters circle from the days of mad king george said agansing with some success if rumors i have heard are true he and his followers have laid some troublesome things to rest memsab sniffed it is a mens club in fancy dress she said dismissively it is even headquartered in his club they admit no women thus halving their available resources and few commoners thus further depriving themselves of power and they admit none who are not white british at all if i were to revive a masters circle i would do so in the country where one could find earth masters and i would scour the countryside for masters and mages of both sexes while i was at it i would see to it that foreigners were welcome because there is foreign magic in england now like it or not and it would be much wiser to have the weapons to counter the misuse of it in hand before there is need for them that would be effective and its not to the point except insofar as it was the masters circle who discovered who was responsible but only after beas husband confined the earth creature for them nan made notes in her head masters circle david alderscroft memsab might dismiss both but at least they had found out something that counted as a partial success at least which was more than sahib and memsab had nan got a feeling there was something about this alderscroft fellow that memsab didnt like the moment she thought that from his perch on her shoulder neville rubbed his big warm beak against her cheek to get her attention she closed her eyes and consciously relaxed the image she got from him was set in bird terms of course and seemed to be a mate squabble two females competing over the same male ravens were monogamous keeping to one mate their whole life barring accident so such things were comprehensible to a raven neville was much better at picking up feelings and the images called up by those feelings than nan was and now with much practice he was better at projecting them to nan so memsab and some other skirt got into it over this alderscroft another quick rub of nevilles beak and the impression that the winning rival was much older than the younger bird confirmed that mustve been way before memsab went to india an met sahib cor that splains a lot no young woman in nans circle was ever graceful in romantic defeat well now that was interesting so memsab was probably going to dismiss this alderscroft fellow right out of hand which in nans estimation was a mistake all the signs were pointing at an elemental master being the one who wanted sarah gone it just made sense to go to the elemental masters about it preferably the fellow on topbut it appeared that the fellow on top was someone memsab wanted to see only the back of we have thanks to your lady friends protection against all four elemental magics on the girls and on the school sahib pointed out nothing is going to get past those without at least giving up some warning which still leaves perfectly ordinary attacks as a possibility leaving aside the fact that my friends are not the most powerful elemental masters in london she replied with a stubborn tone to her voice i am not convinced that this is over by any means nor i selim put in as nan kept her breathing as still as she could in order to catch every word i am far more convinced there is something about young sarahs powers that is a threat to someone in this city i do not anticipate that unknown person would lightly give up his attempt to rid himself of that threat i agree with selim said karamjit firmly me too thought nan time began agansing are you willing to wait to see what time will bring when realistically speaking it could bring a threat from an unexpected quarter memsab demanded nan could picture her whirling and fixing agansing with a gimlet stare but running off blindly serves no purpose either agansing was silent for a moment the wise warrior examines all possibilities we have a possibility before us and we have many possible responses to it we can hunt down the one who is responsible and confront him we could ignore this and hope that the threat will fade or go away we could move the school once removed from london perhaps the unknown assailant will conclude the children are no longer a threat retreat karamjit sounded aghast never if we were all warriors herebut we are not these are children selim said reluctantly they can hardly defend themselves and they are not old enough to be required to do so moving from our stronghold into unknown territory would be a grave error karamjit growled we have a fortified home here it will take very long before a new place is as well suited moving at all is out of the question memsab replied flatly in the first place all of our available monies are sunk into this building and its grounds and in the second even if someone were to offer us as good or better a place elsewhere we havent the money to make such a move there are resources we can draw on to help educate the children that we cannot find elsewhere and in the third place although this is a relatively trivial concern outside of london there are no places where most of the foodstuffs you all favor can be easily obtained ah said selim there was a note to his voice that made nan smile trust a feller to think of his stomach she thought wryly an trust memsabt think hed think of it nan distinctly heard sahib stifle a chuckle so she wasnt the only one with that particular thought i see no reason to leave permanently sahib said firmly however an interesting offer has come my way by way of a holiday for the school the gentleman who actually owned that cursed property wishes to offer the use of his country home near windsor to the school for a summer retreat it seems my dear that you know him peripherally as he is in some of the saner occult circles he is going to france for next month it is not that far from london but the property includes a small home farm as well as a pond and plenty of parkland to romp in he feels very much responsible for what happened and wishes to make some sort of amends he paused this would remove the children from london and potential harm temporarily and perhaps that would be enough if the perpetrator sees the school standing empty he might believe we had gone only a month you say memsab replied dubiously as nan held her breath she had never been outside of london in her life and london in june could be stiflingly hot the country was something she had only read about the wildest place she had ever been were the overgrown parts of the school garden possibly more if the situation works to everyones advantage a summer holiday would be good for all concerned everything needed could be brought down in a couple of cartloads sahib said coaxingly it would be very good for the children no lessons fresh air country food think how they would blossom and let them run wild for a month memsab countered in someone elses home i am not sure i would care to take responsibility for that theres a nursery sahib replied a proper nursery big enough to hold all the infants and toddlers twice over the place is a vast barn from what he tells me he has autumn shooting parties for up to fifty there but theres no fishing no adult amusements and hes a bachelor outside of hunting season and some lazing about in summer he never uses the place he says it would be a good thing for the house and the servants to have someone there to look after over the summer a house that big an e never uses it cor nan thought with raw envy must be nice to be rich strange how her vision of rich had changed not that long ago she had thought memsab and sahib were richand of course by the standards of poverty in whitechapel they were but now she was privy to the economies of running a school the compromises memsab had to make had seen both memsab and sahib consulting over the bills and working out what could and could not be done nothing here was ever wasted not a stitch of fabric not a bit of space not a scrap of food it might be given away in charity but it was never wasted and how would his servants feel about an army of children descending memsab countered i have no wish to suffer the vagaries of a staff full of resentful servants and neither will our own people and as to our own people i also do not wish to subject them to the rudeness and prejudice of those who are not prepared to welcome them as equals and superiors he says he believes there will be no problem sahib paused but i see your point let me explore this further ill even visit the place with selim and we will sound out the servants but if there is no problem memsab sighed it sounded reluctant then i agree it would be a good idea but there will be half holidays only i do not want the children to get out of the habit of the discipline of lessons it took every bit of discipline in nans body to keep quiet about the promised treat for one thing she didnt want to disappoint anyone if it turned out not to come to pass shed had far too many disappointments of her own things her mother promised in the euphoria of gin that never happened or promises that sounded enticing that turned out to be traps set by unscrupulous adults eager to take advantage of a child for another if she revealed it theyd know she had a listening post and then there would go the source of information so she kept her lips firmly shut and went on with life as usual not that it was unpleasant far from it there were a great many school treats in these summer months as she came to learn there were trips by omnibus to the zoo to the many parks to the british museum there were sunday school treats for parish children not only for churches in their parish but for others nearby that memsab with her clever ways managed to get them all invited to sahib somehow contrived a boat ride on two canal barges one going upriver and another back down for the return trip that took them through camden lock a fascinating thing for nan and even more fascinating for the boys many of these occasions involved ice creams a treat nan had never before encountered which left her wondering what possible reward could be in heaven if earth was able to provide ice creams well perhaps if heaven included ice creams for breakfast luncheon tea and dinner neville and grey came along on these excursions of course one of the problems of taking grey had been completely negated by the presence of neville there was not a bird in the sky that would dream of attacking grey with the enormous raven flying escort nor was anyone likely to try stealing the parrot with neville flashing a wicked eye and nasty beak nearby only once was there any trouble when a bully of a lad at hyde park tried to make a grab at grey neville dove down out of a nearby tree and made a slashing stab at his clutching hand coming so close to actually connecting that neither the boys governess nor the nowhysterical boy himself could be convinced he hadnt until the intact fingers were displayed for the policeman who intervened by then neville had wisely taken himself back up into the tree again so there was nothing to prove that the raven even belonged to anyone in the school party but hearsay witnesses sounds to me like you been aggravatin all the birds hereabouts the bobby said having had just about enough of both boy and governess by then if i was you id go hop over to the museum birds are all stuffed there you cant aggravate em they cant harm you while nan hadnt completely forgotten the conversation she had just about convinced herself that the summer could hold no better joys than this continuing series of excursions when one night memsab called for silence just before dinner was served since these wildly infrequent occasions always meant some grand surpriseshe always saved bad news for morning assemblyshe got instant quiet a very kind gentleman has offered the school the use of his country home for the month of june she said and quelled the uprising before it started with a single look there will be rules this is not our home and we will take as much care of the things in it as we would the things in the museum tommy tommy who had very nearly caused an incident over his desire to drop into an enormous jar at the british museum and leap out again like the thieves in ali baba hung his head nan stifled a grin you will treat his servants with respect as you treat your teachers and my helpers here at the school she continued you will obey them when they ask you to do something or refrain from doing something you will refer to them as miss mrs and mr and you will not play the little sahib and missy sahib with them if you are good there will be half holidays in the week and saturday and sunday will be full holidays if you are not we will pack up and return here the silence remained unbroken but the children exchanged looks of delight even grey mantled her wings and pinned her eyes though neville contrived to look bored tomorrow will be free of lessons as you pack up your belongings for the month memsab continued and the day after tomorrow we will all take the train to highleigh court only now did she smile as whispers began she said nothing more though merely sat down as the signal for serving to begin all the children ate together except for the few in the nursery at four big tables arranged down the dining room one teacher sat at each table while memsab sahib and the other teachers sat at a fifth table sarah leveled grave eyes on her friend you knew about this didnt you she whispered as she passed the bowl of boiled carrots to nan who served herself and passed it to amanda truitt sarah handed a piece of carrot to grey who took it and held it in one claw while taking neat bites out of it nan nodded just a little sarah smiled its all right she continued i know why you didnt tell of course she did she had listened in that same closet herself more than once but nan was relieved that she didnt take it amiss it was hard to sleep that night knowing that the treat really was in store nan expected she would be quite busy the next day not with her own packing but with helping to pack up the little ones things it wasnt as if she had much of her own after all but at midmorning she got a surprise as memsab took her away from folding little pinafores and pressing small shirtwaists to go back to her own room where sarah was packing there was an enormous stack of clothing on her bed i have several friends with little girls a bit older than your age nan memsab said without preamble so i canvassed them for outgrown clothing for the summer some of it wont fit of course and some will be unsuitable but we should find some things in these piles that will do so lets begin trying them on you some of the clothing made nan blink she could not ever imagine herself in a dress so covered with frills she thought she looked like a right guy in it nor in the item of embroidery and lace so delicate she was afraid to touch it lest her rough hands snag on it but a fair amount fit her reasonably well and was tough enough to survive her for when nan played she played hard and with the determination of someone who had the fear she might never be allowed to play again she played cricket with the boys as often as dolls with the girls when they were through nan had a wardrobe only a little less extensive than sarahs after she had packed up these new things she returned to help with the littlest ones and the next day when they all filed out to take the omnibus to the train station with a cart to follow with all of their luggage it was with startlement that she realized she had just as much as anyone else neville had something new as well a fine new round cage to travel in with a handle on top as did grey both cages had cloth covers over them more to prevent the curious from looking in and poking at them than to prevent the birds from doing anything or seeing things that might affright them as there wasnt much that would frighten either of them grey settled onto her perch with a sigh of resignation but neville grumbled they wont let y on the train loose neville nan explained to him with patience look grey knows and shes bein good grey gave neville the same look memsab gave naughty boys neville bristled for a moment with resentment then shook himself hopped onto the perch and muttered once more as nan closed the cage door and dropped the cover over the top the omnibus ride to the station was uneventful except for the excitement of the children sahib had closed the warehouse for an hour or two and brought his workers down to help with the luggage at the station he and selim would remain living at the school with two of the servants to tend to them and keep the school up he would only be coming down on the weekends seven pushcarts heaped with luggage were all duly checked in and tagged with their destination and the children all filed into the bright red railway carriages practically vibrating with anticipation the birds of course came in the carriage one conductor looked as if he might demand that they ride with the luggage but a gimlet stare delivered by memsab made him change his mind the seats right next to the windows were the most desired but no one disputed the right of the girls and their birds to have two of them sitting across from one another on the highbacked wooden benches with the cages held on their laps nan and sarah pulled up the covers on the window side of the round brass cages so that the birds could see out the train pulled out of the station with a metallic shriek of wheels the final warning hoot of the whistle and a lurch it quickly picked up speed to the point where nan was a bit uneasy she had never traveled this fast before she hadnt known you could she wasnt entirely sure you ought to she had to keep glancing at memsab sitting beside sarah calmly reading a book to reassure herself that it was all right the city gave way to the suburbs houses each with its own patch of green lawn set apart from its neighbors rather than crowded so closely together that the walls almost touched or actually did touch and then out of the suburbs they burst into green space that nan immediately and automatically identified as park except that it went on as far as the eye could see it was somewhat overgrown divided by fences walls and hedges andand there were animals in it herds of sheep of placid cows even of goats all of them browsing or occasionally raising their heads to watch the train pass nan was beside herself this was the first time she had ever seen a cow a sheep or a live goat until this moment they had only been images in a picture book she was surprised at how big the cows were and when she saw the woolly sheep with their halfgrown lambs frisking alongside her fingers itched to touch them horses of course were everywhere in the city and she knew horses quite well but it was the first time she had ever seen a foal and the lively awkward creatures made her exclaim and forget her fear of how fast they were going grey was excited and interested atypically she said nothing in words instead commenting on the passing scenery with little mutters whistles and clicks sarah too kept her attention riveted on the landscape which surprised nan considering how far her friend had traveled until sarah said in a surprised voice this is nothing like africa it ainisnt nan replied sarah shook her head the trees are different the leaves are smaller the trees arent as tall or as green there are big vines with huge leaves everywhere in the jungle the bushes are different too even the cattle are different the cattle in africa are leaner with longer horns we dont have sheep the goats are the same though grey whistled neville yawned doing his best to look blasé nan laughed nothing flusters his feathers sarah said fondly youd think he journeyed by train every day well he has done just about everything else nan replied reflectively an its not as if he dont know what countryside looks like reckon hes flown out to look at it a time or two all four of them continued to watch the landscape fly past with great interest nan wondered fleetingly what a longer trip would be like they were due to arrive so memsab said before noon and would be at highleigh park by that hour at the latest did you eat on the train she supposed you could sleep on it the seat was more comfortable than many other places she had slept but what did you do about a loo did the train stop so that everyone could traipse out use one and come back aboard this was not a special and it made several stops along the way the little towns and villages surrounding the railway station were picturebook perfect so far as nan could tell so perfect it was hard to believe people actually lived in them she wondered what life would be like in one so small that everyone knew everyone else and all about everyone elses business too finally at just about the point where she was beginning to wish she could get up and move about the conductor announced their village maidenstone bridge maidenstone bridge and to nevilles disgust nan dropped the cover over him again and prepared to leap to her feet to get out for she had a sudden panicked image of herself not managing to disembark before the train pulled out of the station and the train leaving with her trapped on it she neednt have worried the train remained in the station for a good long while after they all poured out and their luggage was sorted out and piled once again on pushcarts but as nan surveyed the quiet village street without seeing a sign of an omnibus she had another feeling of repressed panic now what were they supposed to walk to this place pushing the handcarts before them that was when the first of the wagons came around the corner there was a veritable parade of them big commodious farm wagons and when the first driver hailed memsab it became clear the carts had come for them one came with an empty bed for the luggage and the rest had been padded with a thick layer of hay for the children to sit on with the wagons came a set of burly farm workers smelling of tobacco horse and hay who tossed the children up into the back of the wagons as if they weighed nothing when they came to nan and sarah they lifted each of them cage and all over the back of the wagon to settle at the rear a more dignified charabanc had been provided for memsab the teachers and some of the servants though the ayahs were happy enough to be helped in alongside their small charges in a third wagon just for the little ones wisely the farmers had separated the boys and the girls into separate wagons they boys were able to tumble about in the hay and roughhouse as much as they pleased without getting into too much trouble over it in nans opinion they were missing the best part of the journey with their skylarking there was so much to look at she felt as if her whole body was filling up with new sights it was all like something out of one of her books all those things that had been described in words now suddenly had things attached to them the lane they traveled down with thick hedgerows on either side was nothing like the thoroughfare called a lane in london and now she understood really how one could get tangled in a hedgerow and be unable to get through it when they traveled down a part of the lane where the trees formed a dense green archway above it so it was as if they were traveling in a long living tunnel she was practically beside herself with pleasure as she recalled just such a description in another book the horses hooves had a different sound on the soft dirt of the road than they did on the paved streets of london and the scents she had never smelled so many wonderful things flowers and newcut hay a fresh green scent of water utterly unlike the smelly old thames wood smoke and things she couldnt even begin to identify birds sang and twittered everywhere the hedges were alive with little birds and there were rooks twanging in trees everywhere even neville forgot to look bored and then they found themselves passing beside a wall a very tall creamcolored brick wall topped with an edge of white stone exactly like the one around the school except this went on for a very long distance it was covered in ivy and craning her neck nan saw a gate in the wall a gate made of wrought iron like the one at the school the charabanc ahead of them turned and went into the gate as a man stood there holding the gate open right inside the gate there was a house of black timbers and white plaster with a thatched roof and at first nan was horribly disappointed wondering how all of them were supposed to fit into that house because it didnt look as if it had more than two or three bedrooms at best but the charabanc and then the wagons kept going and that was when the word gatehouse connected in her mind with the house at the gate and she stared at it in awe realizing that here was a house just for a man and his family to live in so he could tend the gate and that was all he did the cavalcade continued on up a twisting lane that led through wooded and meadowed land that looked exactly as well groomed as a park and then turned a corner and there it was and nan blinked in surprise and even shock at the place that would be their home for the next month it was a chaotic glorious pile of a place a mishmash of styles and eras and if nan could no more have named those styles and eras she could certainly tell that the blocky stone tower with its slitlike windows that anchored the left was nothing like the mathematical center of more creamcolored brick and tall narrow windows which was in turn nothing at all like the florid wing thrown up on the right the only unifying force was that except for the square tower it was all built of the same mellow creamcolored brick of the wall and that was all and it was enormous easily three times the size of the school nan looked around her and so did the rest of the children eyes as wide as they could stretchat manicured parkland that could easily hold three hyde parks and then someat the huge pile of a building that promised endless opportunities for explorationat the glimpse of gardens in the rear and beyond that a hint of water and for the first time they all understood that all of this was within reason theirs for the month to run in play in explore hide make up stories in and act them out and it was nan who summed up all their feelings in a single word a word which burst out of her like a cannonball out of a gun cor she shouted in glee memsab being handed down out of the charabanc merely looked up and smiled much as he admired and depended upon lady cordelia there was some relief for david alderscroft in being in a place to which she could not go here in his club surrounded by men and the things of men with not even a hint of women about the few maidservants kept themselves discreetly out of sight as best they could there was a sense that one could let down ones guard and relax not that cordelia was like most women but still here one didnt have to be so terribly careful of manners and speech and if one made a faux pas a man would simply wave it off where a woman would stew about it for hours women were grand ornaments to life but even the best of them forgot that a man needed to be a man among men on a regular basis small wonder that many men all but lived at their clubs even when they did not have rooms there even working men knew the pressure of tooattentive female companionship and had their pubs and their coffeehouses he never felt quite so comfortable as when he was at the club with women restricted to the visitors parlor and visitors dining roomand if there were females in a resident members rooms well that was his business and had nothing to do with the rest of the members one could have sisters and a mother after all and aunts and if they were deuced attractive sisters and aunts who might or might not have careers on the stage well such things happened so long as they did not intrude on anyone else it was none of his business here not only were the members incurious about who came in and out so long as it was discreet they were incurious about what came in and out and a phenomenal number of them were elemental mages occultists or had had brushes with the uncanny here they knew how to keep secret and silent when odd things happened and here he had chosen to make the headquarters of his new incarnation of a much older elemental masters masters circle the masters circle or white lodge was an ancient magical tradition created for the purpose of selfpolicing ones own kind as it were originally intended to hunt down and destroy the enemies of the members it had evolved to the more civilized function of ensuring that no elemental master within its jurisdiction attacked another or attacked those not blessed with magic it had been at its most active during the regency when the notorious hellfire club which actually had very little in the way of true magical power and those modeled after it some of which did had flourished since that time it had declined to little more than a social group that occasionally did some investigative and disciplinary work one of the most recent had been the illfated though ultimately successful attempt to track down and bring to heel a wayward fire masterthe attempt that had cost davids own father so much it had been davids idea not cordelias to revitalize the lodge and make it more effective in this he flattered himself he had been quite successfulenough so that he heard that he was being called the wizard of london now truth to tell cordelia did not much like the circle he suspected that she resented the fact that she was not permitted inside the club and had not been invited to join but really a woman had no real place in a masters circle well most women there were a few a very few who like the few neckornothing riders in his hunt club could keep up in terms of energy and sheer instinct for the kill with the best of the men but they were rare indeed he could not imagine lady cordelia in such a position with her cool calm demeanor and immaculate manners she would regard much of what the circle did with distaste as dirtying her hands for heavens sake he couldnt even imagine her on the back of a horse in hunting dress much less traipsing across the countryside in search of a rogue magician so he ignored her obvious disdain for the work of the circle as he ignored nothing else she said or did and went early to the meetings of the circle so he could enjoy the masculine ambience of the club before he picked up his arcane duties this particular masters circle had been the one to which his father had belonged and it had been when his father had been unable to muster an adequate hunting party and had been injured that had made david take notice he had decided then that the situation simply would not do and began rectifying it now it was a matter of sending a few messages across the city to muster a fullstrength hunting party within the hour and within three a circle of initiates could be assembled there were in fact enough mages and masters in the group to gather a circle trine if the need arose and that had not been the case since the circle had first been formed possibly the fact that the circle had been moved to london where most of the members at least had town homes had made the difference perhaps it was because in london there simply were so many people it was not at all difficult to find enough mages perhaps it was because it was in a mens club it was easy to give the wife the excuse that one was going to ones club in order to slip out granted mages usually married mages but women with the talent were still women and inclined to favor commitments to dinner parties over commitments to the masters circleand were equally inclined to be both far too curious and far too suspicious when a gentleman had to be evasive about where he was going and what he was doing nor could they manage to keep the secrets secret but a man could say im going to the club and a woman would nod and think nothing more of it and perhaps that was the main reason for the success of the masters circle a man could come here do the work of the circle and return home late and the spouse would ask why so late a return and a man could say oh lytton went off on one of his shooting stories and we lost all track of time or a billiard game turned into a match you know how it is and if there were no signs of inebriation or the presence of floozies there would be no further questions yes that might be the best reason for success of all tonight would be routine a followup meeting of the key members of the circle to find out the disposition of a little problem nigel lytton had reported a matter of an elemental magician gone wrong in london itself it was fairly trivial as such things went and a preliminary report had stated that the miscreant in question had already passed the jurisdiction of mortal justice but alderscroft liked to have things properly neatened up in the wake of the resolution of any situation and besides it was as good an excuse as any to take supper here although his cookhis chef ratherwas good he was also french and it was a secondary relief to enjoy simple english fare once in a while as well it had occurred to david and more than once that perhaps he ought to sell or close up his town home take up residence here and a great many aspects of his life would be improved there would be no more servants crises for instance those details were taken care of invisibly by the club staff normally such things were handled with equal invisibility by ones wife or mother but david had neither and had to deal with staff upheavals himself but no cordelia would not be able to go past the visitors parlor room which would mean that to get further lessons from her he would have to come to her home and something about that made him feel rebellious silly perhaps but nevertheless such a feeling would be counterproductive to actually learning anything he took the steps of the club briskly and nodded to stewart the doorman as that worthy held the portal open for him the familiar and comforting aroma of tobacco and brandy books and newspaper struck him as he entered and he headed straight for the members dining room without a pause the savory scent of good roast beef met his nose as he entered which cemented what his selection would be in his mind before he even sat down scotch broth to begin and oysters then roast beef and potatoes yorkshire pudding new peas and an apple tart wonderful he savored his brandy and a cigar afterward and wondered why his expensive chef could not understand that plain food was just as good as if not superior to the fancy sauces of french cooking and it made him think fleetingly of their good old cook back at the manor who had made it very clear that she would not be moving to london but no the disadvantages of life there so far outweighed the advantages that there was no comparison he was not and never had been the sort to enjoy country life nor was cordelia really now isabelle with a faint oath he forced the thought of isabelle from his mind what was wrong with him anyway time and time again he found himself thinking of the silly girl someone he had given no thought to whatsoever for years it was enough to put him right off enjoying his brandy and cigar and with irritation he extinguished the latter and left the table to go up to the top floor of the club where the rooms reserved for the masters circle were located the top floor was called the founders suite and had once been the residence of the founder of the club who had himself been an elemental master it had been vacant for years no one had the temerity to consider taking over the space that had once housed so formidable a personality but a good half the space was taken up by a meeting room and a working room and when david had brought the masters circle to his club it had been with the idea in mind of using these rooms that founding member in question had been an air master and the light blues and whites with which the area was decorated had not fared well over the years by the time he got permission to use the rooms the whites had yellowed and the blues gone to muddy bluegray the net effect was of ingrained grime at his own expense david had arranged for it all to be redone in turkey red ocher and other colors he found comfortable no one seemed to object though he suspected one or two of the others found it amusing that the place was clearly a haven for a fire master but he consoled himself with the knowledge that the colors were practical unlike lighter tones that honestly would not survive a winter of soot and pea soupers there should be no work tonight so he went straight to the meeting room deliberately with the vague idea that king arthurs round table was a good idea to establish equality among peers there was no head or foot to the square table in the middle of the room and no difference in the quite comfortable chairs as he had requested the gaslights had already been lit he brought in a newspaper and settled down to read it until the rest arrived it would not be a full meeting tonight by any stretch of the imagination so as the others trickled in they all clustered at the end of the table where he was when they were all assembled he rang for the servant who brought the decanters of port and brandy and glasses and left as was their custom they served themselves the brandy had been supplied by david from his fathers private stock the port by atherton crey both liquors were over a hundred years old the pouring of the drink signaled the start of business so nigel david said cradling his snifter in his left hand to warm the contents and release the aroma give us the full report on that anarchist incident nigel lord lytton was an earth master and as such acutely uncomfortable in london where so much of the soil was covered over poisoned or both he always looked halfchoked whenever he came into town and today was no exception his long solemn face looked even longer than usual and was certainly several shades paler than it ought to be if you dont mind ill begin this where i think it ought to start and not with that rogue talent connor obrian he said passing his hand over his thinning nondescript brown hair and that is with a little girl two of them actually since they seem to be inseparable but the one that concerns us is already a powerful medium and shes barely ten david who knew some of this already merely nodded but the others looked variously surprised or impressed depending on their natures theres a lady and her husband who have a school for the gifted children of expatriates mostly posted in india nigel continued not all the children are gifted of course but this is where theyre sent if their parents know of the place harton school isabelle and frederick harton she met him in india where they picked up some more gifted servants from among the natives there my wife knows the woman old school friend of hers that went off to india once her school days were over the name isabelle had struck david alderscroft with the force of a blow and to hear that the woman was a school friend of nigels wife only made it worse to sit there and listen to a description of a woman that he was more convinced with every word was his isabelle took all his strength of will it took a great deal of effort to wrench himself out of his numb shock to listen even with half an ear as nigel explained how the little girls had been lured to the building in question and shut in while an earth wight specially conjured and bound to an existing spirit that already haunted the place there was loosed on them he wasnt the least interested in two little girls no matter what their plight had been he managed to get his attention back on the subject as nigel described capturing the creature then interrogating it as to who had brought it there then banishing it it was a strong elemental it had taken nigel and three friends to do the job it didnt know the masters real name of course but what it knew led us to obrian who was by that time dead nigel concluded the problem with all of this is that those little girls obscure little girls with no enemies were without any shadow of a doubt the real targets of the attack alderscroft that makes no sense killing them would accomplish nothing get no notoriety for his cause unless unless what asked crey unless heor someone using himwanted to be rid of that specific little girl nigel pinched the bridge of his nose probably to relieve a headache that she is already a powerful medium could make her dangerous to someone who demanded old scathwaiteold in years and experience but keen in mind and as agile in body as some of davids contemporaries i would say ask that of those in psychical circles david said slowly slowly getting control back over his runaway emotions especially those who claim mediumistic powers and have none they have the most to lose and are the most threatened by a real medium and if you wanted to hide what you were in order to prevent being caught by your own kind what better than to hide behind an elemental master by heaven david you may be right nigel sounded surprised and relieved at the same time its the psychical ones who knew about the girl in the first place all right ill go back to mrsharton and suggest that if she hasnt checked her friends and acquaintances for someone willing to use anyone and anything to further his own ambitions she ought to then see if any of them can be traced back to a contact with obrian the simplest solution is often the right one david replied and shrugged of course the simplest solution is usually something not very palatable he had managed by dint of great effort to shove his emotional reactions off to the side and cool masculine logic had reasserted itself the point is our involvement in this distasteful incident is fundamentally closed agreed thomas markham a viscount it seems clear to me at least that it is wildly unlikely that the instigator is one of ours the harton woman should definitely be encouraged to look among her own kind for the enemy heaven knows there are more than enough unstable types in psychical circles to account for an attack on those poor little children and bea has made sure that the children and school are protected from all sorts nigel put in eagerlyno doubt thinking with relief that now he would be able to go back to his country estate and escape the miasma of london again i think everything has probably been done now nods all around the table david smiled good he said now i would like to discuss some of our tentative plans for becoming more involved with those in political office who are at the moment unaware we even exist nan had decided that if heaven was anything like highleigh park she was going to have to put a lot more effort into being good so she could end up there there had been some initial reserve on the part of the servants about a horde of strange children running loose not that nan blamed them no not at all they all got rooms in the area that held the nursery which also held the rooms for the servants of visiting guests that was not at all bad the rooms were plain and they had to share but the rooms at the school were also fairly plain and they had to share the littlest children too young for lessons yet got the best of it nan thought because the nursery and schoolroom were both enormous and the nursery was full of old worn but perfectly good toys from previous generations or left by visiting children all the toys were new to the harton school toddlers of course so they were very happy the first of the children to get into trouble was predictably tommy who seemed to gravitate toward trouble the way a moth was attracted to flame they had all had their luncheon and most of them had gone off in little groups to explore the parkland except for tommy who had gone off by himself nan and sarah werewith grey and nevilles assistanceinvestigating a charming but neglected little stone building when suddenly there was a great crash from the direction of the manor house followed by a veritable chorus of barks and howls sarah and nan exchanged a glance tommy they said as one as grey and neville exchanged a glance of their own then flew in the direction of the noise by the time they all got there the howling and barking had subsided and tommy was in the custody of the master of the hounds for it appeared that highleigh court was home to a foxhound pack and tommy had decided the halfgrown pups were irresistible unable to get into the locked kennel he had climbed the fence around the pens fallen off and landed among the hounds who reacted with confusion and startlement once he had fished tommy out of the pen and ascertained he was not seriously hurt the master of the hounds was pink with anger by this time most of the children from the school had arrived and so had most of the servants who could spare a moment the master had tommy by one ear and looked as if he was going to haul the boy up in front of some authority but hadnt yet figured out who that was as nan and sarah hid memsab appeared and the stormy expression she wore did not bode well for tommy the master of the hounds misinterpreted it however now see here missus he began to bluster this boy of yours has been getting into where he had no business being memsab said interrupting her voice stern i know this because your master told me that the kennels are kept locked tommy knows this because he was told not to attempt any place that was locked up so what do you suggest his punishment should be on the whole i am against whipping or caning but a good spanking would not go amiss for one long moment the master of the hounds stared at her mouth agape as tommy hung limp with resignation in his grasp ah the man began dont much care for beating a boy myself beating never helped boy nor dog to my knowledge memsab raised an eyebrow perhaps then you could put him to some useful work instead since he seems so determined to see the dogs he could help your underlings clean the kennels now taken even more aback by the suggestion that tommy should do manual labor reserved for menials the master began to stammer ahmissuswhat would his parents his parents have left his discipline in my hands memsab replied and i think he will come to far less harm having a set down to his dignity by learning how much work a servant must do than he would by a caning perhaps afterward he will be more considerate of his servants when he is grown with a silent and astonished audience of manor servants listening raptly the master and memsab worked out a compromise that kept tommy in the kennels helping to water and feed the dogs and other chores with the hawks and horses until just before suppertime giving him just enough time for a bath and a change of clothing nan couldnt help but grin not because tommy was one of the few who would have been inclined to play little sahib over the manor servants but at the reaction of those servants themselves theyre all on memsabs side now arent they sarah whispered as a chastened tommy was shooed into the precinct which he had but a few moments ago so much desired to get into nan nodded feeling gleeful shed known she could count on tommy to get into something that would put him at odds with the manor staff but she hadnt thought hed do so that quickly and memsab cemented that by turning to her audiencean audience which others in her position might have ignoredand addressing them if any of the children get into mischief that discommodes you or violates one of the house rules i would appreciate it if you would bring your complaint and the child in question directly to me at once she said thank you the servants went back to their work and the rest of the children went back to their explorations and tommy put in a muchscrubbed appearance at dinner in an interesting moodchastened by the amount of hard work hed had to put in but very full of information about foxhounds rat terriers and the huge mastiffs that the caretaker and gamekeeper used to help them guard the place the next day and the day after that passed with only minor incidentsthe head cook found three of the boys investigating the cellars looking for a dungeon and one of the housemaids discovered a toddler who was supposed to be napping running gleefully naked down the portrait gallery but the next incident alas was all nans doing she was passing the kitchen door when a heady aroma seized her and dragged her inside it was a scent she had whiffed only once before and then shed had no possibility of trying the product and furthermore on that occasion she had been literally starving and the aroma had nearly driven her out of her head with longing and despair strawberry tarts fresh strawberry tarts her mouth watered and the hunger of that longpast day came back quite as strongly as if she had not been eating well and steadily for the past several months perhaps if anyone had been in the kitchen she would simply have begged a tart from the first servant that looked kind but the kitchen was momentarily empty and the tarts were all set out in rows on the big table to cool and the temptation was too much to resist she seized as many as she could carry and scurried out with them to hide she thought in a little nook and share them with neville but an alert kitchen maid not only saw that the tarts were missing but thought to look in the kitchen garden and spotted neville with half a tart in his beak and traced his path back to nans hiding place found with crumbs on her face and surrounded by empty tins her guilt had been clear hauled up to memsab with a full belly and just a twinge of regret she found it hard to look completely repentant memsab shook her head and sighed without even asking nan if she was guiltythough of course the sticky fingers were mute evidence of thatshe turned to the kitchen maid who of the kitchenstaff did the preparations for the tarts she asked surprising the maid the cleaning and hulling and so forth ah thatd be me maam the maid stammered then you have charge of her shes no stranger to hard work though you might have to show her what to do she is yours for the remainder of the day only see that she gets luncheon and is free in time to clean herself for dinner and with that memsab consigned her to her fate so she suffered through the hard work of a day in the kitchen under the direct supervision of the kitchen maid who took immense and vindictive satisfaction in giving nan all the most tedious jobs and nan discovered at firsthand how much work went into feeding a vast and now augmented household like the one at highleigh park worst probably had been that she had been denied nevilles company the entire afternoon of her incarceration only getting free to scamper outside and try to explain it to him at luncheon neville did not entirely understand how doing something so natural as raiding a ready food supply of delicious treats was a bad thing nan got the feeling that he comprehended that people thought it was a bad thing but he still didnt grasp the reasoning behind that attitude however though nan was incarcerated for the day there was plenty for him to do and he simply accepted it phlegmatically two days later nan was still debating whether or not the pleasure of stuffing herself with strawberry tarts had been worth the pain of kitchen duty by that time the half holiday here was enough to make her giddy with happiness she could have spent days merely exploring and observing the little lives in the brook that ran through the grounds the home farm was near enough to run over to and lambs were just as delicious to pet as she had imagined there were half a dozen orphaned or rejected little things and extra hands to help bottle nurse them were always welcome this was when tommy who was now on good enough terms with the master of hounds to be allowed inside the kennel to play with puppies discovered the home farm now he had been utterly forbidden to even consider trying to ride any of the great highbred horses in the stable even though the grooms who were not a great deal older than he did so regularly to exercise them there were no ponies there as there were no children in the household and he was mad to try and ride something and there lord of the flock of sheep in the pasture nearest the manor was a great big ram relatively placid in nature and inclined to accept graciously any tidbits and scratches that came his way the combination was as irresistible for tommy as strawberry tarts had been for nan nan and sarah had been bottlefeeding lambs when shouts from the pasture made them and the farm manager come running by that time so she later learned tommy had already climbed the fence jumped aboard and had managed to stay on the rams back long enough to get halfway across the pasture before the offended animal bucked him off they arrived just in time to see tommy trying to runthen see tommy flying through the air when the ram administered his own form of punishment he picked himself up again and the ram repeated the procedure one more time as he tried to scramble over the fence that divided the pasture from the goose pond sent him sailing into the midst of the geese who had halfgrown goslings with them and were not inclined at all to take this interloper lightly the geese decided to compound the retribution mister thackers in charge of the farm was by this time laughing so hard that tears were running down his face and waded in to tommys rescue oh my lad he said as tommy tried very hard not to cry but was clearly in no little pain youre one of those aint you come along of you i think youve learned more than enough of a lesson for one day without me taking you to your mistress at that point he took tommy off to the farmhouse nan lingered as she and sarah soothed the rams anger and indignation and sarah wordlessly promised him that no one would try that trick on him again when tommy came out again this time alone he was walking a bit easier and smelled strongly of horse liniment memsab found out about it of course but other than a single pointed remark at dinner nothing more ever came of it neville was in heaven too here he had an entirely new set of interesting things to get into and investigate than in london memsab had gotten him to tolerate a set of bright red gloveleather leggings before they left carefully fitted to and sewn onto his lower legs and the gamekeepers and farmers were under strict orders not to shoot the raven with the red legs so even an incident of egg eating at the home farm was let off with a scolding fortunately the number of eggs a raven could eat at a sitting was far less than the number of strawberry tarts that could be consumed by an active girl at one go when it was made clear to him that while pigeon pheasant quail and chicken eggs were strictly offlimits rook starling sparrow and crow nests were fair game he was a much happier raven as for sarah and grey there was no doubt in anyones mind that both were as happy as they could be outside of being home again grey like neville managed to get into a great deal of mischief with her curiosity and her prying beak unlike neville she was sneaky about it and never got caught like neville however she brought back all manner of curious objects for sarah and their little treasure boxes were filling fast neville found a great deal of trash and treasure in his raids on the nests of rooks and crows some were clearly valuable a silver locket for instance and a broken rosary of delicate gold wire and blackened seed pearls that looked extremely old indeed and a small hoard of coins memsab always made sure there were no existing claimants for such finds before allowing the girls to keep them some were merely interesting odd pebbles potmetal charms tiny faded pottery figurines and three small dolls of the sort called frozen charlottes because they were all one solid piece some were just trash horseshoe nails bits of ribbon and string unidentifiable pieces of china and metal those the birds kept in their own little treasure boxes a couple of old tea chests they could open themselves and poke about in memsabs plan for lessons every day was not as onerous as it had sounded one morning was completely devoted to splashing about in the pond and learning about aquatic life and similar mornings were spent exploring other parts of the home farm gardens and parkland on rainy days the servants would open older parts of the building and they would examine history in context as they looked at antique furnishings pictures and the rooms themselves they spent whole evenings learning about stars and planets and the myths behind the names of the objects in the night sky there was a daily lesson in gardening and when the mood was on her the cook would even give lessons in plain cookery there was a trip to the forge to learn about metal working right down to the chemistry of it and another to the mill to study the mechanics of turning flowing water into something that could grind grain into flour and run other machinery the french teacher took them out on walks taught them the french names of things and required that they converse in that language the entire time memsab did the same in latin another set of lessons was that they were going to perform a play shakespeare a midsummer nights dream they were having to make the costumes and props learn their speeches by heart and were also learning what some of the odd things they were saying meant in nans opinion none of it was really lessons at all just a way for memsab to say she was giving lessons without really doing it but there were two places where neither nan nor sarah felt the least urge to go two places that made them both feel strange uneasy and acutely uncomfortable one was an old dry well that the servants called a wishing well though no one ever made any wishes there nor in fact ever seemed to visit it was in the back of the kitchen garden near the oldest part of the manor no bird or animal could be persuaded to approach it and even tommy after one curious toss of a pebble into it to see how deep it was left it alone the other was the bridge over the river on the road that led to the next village a place none of the children had visited yet nan and sarah had followed the road on a long walk one afternoon out of pure curiosity to see where it went they came to a signpost eventually which at least told them that they had come a half mile from the highleigh park gate and that some place called shackleford was another mile farther on at this point the wall of the park ended the road continued on as far as they could see cutting through farm fields in the far hazy distance was a church steeple presumably marking the village go on or go back nan asked sarah shrugged they didnt say we couldnt she pointed out they just said not to get lost we cant get lost if we stick to the road nan nodded and they went on but they could not have gone more than a quarter mile before they came to a bridge over a substantial river there was nothing remarkable about the bridge itself it was built of the same brick and stone as the manor and was in good repair yet the nearer they drew to it the more uneasy they becamevery much like the feeling they had at that dry well though not quite as strong as they paused about ten feet from it neville circled overhead croaking that he did not like nan getting so near to the structure and grey fluttered down from where she usually flew beside him landed on sarahs shoulder and growled that settled it without a word they turned and made their way back to the manor but both situations had the effect of not rousing nans curiosity but cooling it she did not want to know why the bridge and the well made her feel so uneasy and even felt a reluctance to discuss it with sarah or anyone else finally she decided that it was a natural reaction after that encounter with that horrible thing in berkeley square leave well enough alone she told herself and made an effort to put both of them out of her mind for now at least david alderscroft descended from his carriage at the gate of a longforgotten manor at the edge of some of the leastdesirable real estate in london though the building itself was substantial surrounded by an impressive wall and seemed to be in reasonable repair he could not imagine anyone in his set willing to admit they owned it much less live in it he hesitated a momentsurely this could not be the correct addressbut the inscribed brass plaque inset into the righthand gatepost assured him that this was indeed the harton school for boys and girls so this was where isabelle his isabelle had come with a stern mental hand he shook sense into himself isabelle harton if indeed she was the same person as the girl he had once been acquainted with was not and had never been his isabelle not that he couldnt have had her had he wanted her possibly even in the crudest and most biblical sense had he put his mind to it but of course such an action besides leaving him open to all manner of unpleasant repercussions was unworthy of him and unworthy of the name he wore and he reminded himself yet again he had not wanted her well except during the first flush of infatuation but cordelia had persuaded him to responsible behavior and that flush had cooled under the harsh light of reason even assuming she and the headmistress of this school were one and the same that was by no means certain despite the name and the fact that nigels wife had known the woman in schoolthat was why he was here after all to find out the truth of the matter he rang the bell and while he waited contemplated the gardens just visible inside the walls though not showing the hand of a professional gardening staff they were not as overgrown and neglected as he would have thought the plants growing here were all hardy things sturdy specimens that could tolerate a little neglect and a great deal of londons bad air not manicured but at least trimmed and contained it took a very long time for someone to answer long enough that he was about to give up and assume that there was no one in residence when he became aware with a start that he was no longer alone a tall swarthy fellow in a coat of faintly military cut and indian antecedents had come up soundlessly while he stared at the hostas and ivies through the bars of the gate it startled him actually how long had the fellow been there how had he managed to slip up so quietly may i help you sir the tones flavored with a faint accent were as cultured as his own he coughed momentarily taken offguard i would like to speak with mrsisabelle harton please he replied after a pause i am devastated that we cannot meet your request sir came the immediate reply followed by his own surge of anger and disappointment both quickly repressed the headmistress has taken the pupils to the country for a holiday may i conduct you to master harton instead suddenly he found himself hoist on his own petard he had wanted to see this woman for himself and if he discovered that she was the girl of his youthful infatuation use her current state to destroy any lingering sentimental memory of that girl after all the years were generally not kind to poor vicars daughters and he was certain they would not have been kind to her one look at a primfaced sterneyed creature in the severe dark unfashionable gown that seemed to be the universal garb of all schoolmistresses and he was sure the soft pastelcolored memory of that girl would be burned from his mind the last thing he wanted to do was to confront her husband but there seemed no way that he could avoid such a confrontation now if he declined to meet with mrharton there would be questions as to why he had turned up and why he wanted to meet with mrsharton and not her spouse questions he did not want to have to answer nor did he want the absent mrsharton to have to answer an interrogation about his presence later eitherwhoever she was yes he said simply if reluctantly master harton will suffice the servant bowed unbolted a little postern door on the left side of the gate and let him inside the walls silently the man led the way to the front door and with continued silence brought him into the vestibule from there into a small parlor if you will wait sir i will summon the master the servant said taking his card it will be no more than a few minutes at most in fact it was less than that david had no time at all to look at most of the souvenirs of india displayed on the walls and tables of the parlor the servants steps had hardly faded when a different set of footsteps with a limp this time heralded the approach of someone new david rose and turned toward the door standing in the doorway was a middleaged mana gentleman in fact who was probably no more than five or six years older than davidwith the physique of someone considerably younger than his apparent age david was immediately conscious that he was not nearly so robust as this fellow jaunts in carriages around london did not lend themselves to looking as if one hiked six miles through the jungle before breakfast in coloring he was ordinary enough brown of hair and eye though there was a set to his jawline that suggested toughness and a hint of a smile that suggested sardonic good humor the hair itself was just a little long and carelessly untidy as if the wearer had put off seeing a barber for a little the eyes were frank honest and appraising david had expected a military bearing given the servant but there was less of it than he would have anticipated he stepped forward holding out his hand the other clasped it a good strong handshake warm dry and firm david lord alderscroft david said wondering what the other made of his own grasp the man chuckled plain frederick harton and pleased to meet you i had been hoping to make your acquaintance since my wife and i had a bit of a problem with an elemental master not long ago david tried not to blink the fellow certainly did not beat about the bush erm yes he temporized but the problem seems to have solved itself more or less so ive been told came the noncommittal reply would you care to come to my office you might find it more comfortable than this parlor david had intended to say no intended to claim he had only stopped to let the hartons know that the problem with the renegade had been disposed of but found himself saying instead yes thank you the man led the way to a small room just off the parlor lined with books displaying more exotica and quite comfortable in that shabby wellworn way that the lounges of the adventurers clubs often looked without being asked frederick harton poured and handed him a brandy wordlessly david accepted it and took a seat in a handsome if slightly battered leather chair that accepted his weight and embraced it he also hadnt intended to drink what he had been handed but a whiff and a cautious taste proved it was not an inferior product on the wall over the fireplace was a photographic portrait of the hartons presumably made in india since the woman was wearing a white gown suited to the tropics and there was no doubt the woman was his isabelle nor did that sepia photograph do anything to erase the memories from his mind though looking grave and serious and certainly as if she had seen many things and perhaps endured many trials isabelle harton looked considerably less aged than the face that gazed back at davids from his mirror every morning the years which had not been kind to him had laid a light hand on her i hope you understand that while we are grateful for your attention we are not entirely convinced that the threat has ended with the death of your miscreant frederick harton said as he seated himself behind his desk ah well that is what i came here to speak to mrsharton about david replied grateful for a chance to turn the tide of conversation in his own favor he drew himself up a little and gathered all of his authority about himself you see mrharton my associates and i think you would be doing better to look among the ranks of the psychical set for your enemy if indeed there is one he rattled on repeating all the arguments made in advance to an attentive but neutral frederick harton until at last he ran out of arguments i see harton said sounding unconvinced these are all good arguments to be sure but it does not answer how such presumed enemy contacted an elemental master in the first place nor how he or she convinced said master to work for them in the second place it is a conundrum that has as yet to be addressed drat the man why did he have to be so intelligent and thoughtful david had hoped to find a stereotypical retired colonial soldier rigid and uncomfortable with matters nonmilitaryor else a moony mystic easily persuaded by a stronger personality he found neither instead he discovered he was facing an intellect as powerful as his own he had literally met his match if this man did not lead a psychical masters circle it was because he felt enough of them existed that he did not need to create one unfortunately he replied setting down the empty glass and rising the one person who can answer that has gone beyond the reach of our justice so we shall never know i expect good evening mrharton i hope your school continues to flourish with an absence of incident oh where there are children there will always be incidents came the ironic reply as harton rose and shook his hand one simply hopes to keep them confined within the four walls of the school david alderscroft took his leave and his carriage feeling that somehow though swords had never been crossed in the meeting he had come off secondbest props and costumes for the play had mostly been constructed and still the full cast had not yet been chosen nan and sarah were to be helena and hermia the two friends whose tangled affairs formed the bulk of the playa natural choice though nan was a little disappointed as she had hoped to be hippolyta the amazon queen she rather fancied herself in armor but memsab and sarah had convinced her that the semicomic role of helena suited her better and after studying the text with memsabs help nan agreed anna thompson a girl tall for her age and rather angular would be hippolyta the role was not precisely a demanding one when it all came down to it and anna would fill it well enough almost all the other roles had been filled except two of the most crucial bottom and puck the difficulty was that the most natural choice for either of them was tommy and he clearly could not fill both roles given a choice he wanted bottom he clearly lusted after the donkeys head worn by the character for the scene with the fairies he had already tried the papiermâché creation on so often that not even the muchamused servants were startled to see him cavorting about in it anymore but in nans opinion there was no one else clever and lively enough to play puck memsab the girls and the birds had ensconced themselves in that overgrown summerhouse which memsab referred to as a folly to sort through the final cast options and memsab was growing a little frustrated in an amused sense i vow she said in exasperation after yet another sortthrough of the boys shuffling them into various parts to see if a new configuration would solve the dilemma i am tempted to play puck myself at this point there is not a single boy half as able to do bottom as tommy he has most of the part by heart already but there isnt anyone girl or boy as well suited to puck either except perhaps you nan but ive already got most of helena by heart nan wailed aghast at the notion of having to learn a different role after all that work ah dear lady and tender maidens said a bright voice from the doorway making them all turn perhaps i can solve this problem for you there was a boy there perhaps a little older and a trifle taller than nan he had a merry face sunbrowned with reddish brown hair and green eyes and wore very curious clothing at first glance it looked perfectly ordinary if the local farmers hereabouts were inclined to wear a closefitting brown tunic and kneebreeches rather than sensible undyed linen smocks and buff trousers but at second glance there was something subtly wrong about the cut and fit of the garments first they looked like something out of a painting something antique and secondly they looked as if they were made of leather now the blacksmith wore leather trousers and the village cobbler but no one else did around here and there was something else about this boy a brightness a spirit of vitality that was not ordinary at all and that was the moment when neville made a surprised croak and jumped down off the marble seat where he had been pecking with great interest at a hole in the stone to be joined on the floor by grey both of them stalked over to the boys feet looked up at him and bowed there was no other name for what they did and nans mouth fell agape but this was not the only shock she got for memsab had risen from her seat and sunk again into a curtsy not a headbowed curtsy though this was one where she kept her eyes firmly on the newcomer hail to thee blithe spirit she said as she rose the boys eyes sparkled with mischief and delight correct author but wrong play and character for never could i be compared to ariel he replied and swiftly stooped down to offer neville and grey each a hand each accepted the perch as nan stared her mouth still open how now bane of rooks he said to neville i think you should return to your partner before bees see her open mouth and think to build a hive therein with another bow and a croak neville lofted from the boys outstretched hand and landed on nans shoulder nan took the hint and shut her mouth wordlessly he handed grey back to sarah who took her bird with round eyes as if she saw even more than nan did to surprise her so ho fair dame did you think to plan to play my play on midsummers day and not have me notice he said to memsab fists planted on his hips i had not thought to have the honor of your attention good sirrah memsab replied her eyes very bright and eager indeed i had not known that such as you would deign to notice such as we he laughed well spoke well spoke and properly too well then shall i solve your conundrum with my humble self and let your restless tommy play the ass nan blinked hard as a furtive glimmer of light that could not have actually been there circled the boy and then her brain shook itself like a waking dog everything that wasnt quite right shifted itself into a configuration she could hardly believe and she burst out with youre him youre puck the boy laughed a laugh that had a friendly tone of mockery in it but as much to mock himself as to make fun of nan he bowed to her with a flourish robin goodfellow at your service my london daisy not often evoked these present days but often in the thoughts of my good country folk who care very little for the passage of time and how am i to explain one extra boy to the others memsab asked dryly rising from her curtsy not that i would dare to contradict your will but we poor mortals must have our proper explanations ah that he waved his hand airily a simple thing say i am the son of a friend of yours i have conned the part at my school and will come to fill it here and in your practices do you take my part as you threatened to memsab smiled a sound plan but what of those others in my charge who will see you for something of what you are and may ask questions i cannot answer without your leave he laid his finger alongside his nose and then pointed it at her well asked well thought perhaps a touch of glamorie will not come amiss with your permission twill do them no harm they will notice nothing amiss nothing that their minds cannot find an explanation for and the explanation will seem to come from outside their minds ere nan objected not on us please a touch of glamorie sounded to her as if puck was going to do something that would make her and sarah forget what he wasand she didnt want to forget wed like to know what is really happening please sarah chimed in as grey bobbed in agreement and neville shifted his weight from foot to foot on nans shoulder puck cast a glance at memsab and so what think you that both these girls can hold a secret memsab said instantly certainly they already have done so many times in the past then i bow to your will london daisy puck replied with a grin let it be as you wish and you will see me again on midsummers night nan blinked as there was a sudden glare across her eyes like a flash of sun reflected from water and when she could see again he was gone neville bobbed and quorked once he sounded surprised cor grey said in nans voice blimey that was entirely unexpected memsab said sitting down hard and looking a little out of breath as if she had been running of all the things that could have happened here this is not one i would have ever anticipated to have so powerful a spirit simply walk in on onei confess it has taken my breath away was that really phim sarah asked her eyes still round as if she didnt quite dare speak the name aloud the same as in the play ah now i hesitate to pin down someone like him to any sort of limited description memsab temporized and the puck of shakespeares play is far more limited than the reality lets just say he isold one of the oldest old ones in england as a living creature he probably saw the first of the flint workers here and i suspect that he will see the last of us mortals out as well unless he chooses to follow some of the other old ones wherever they have gone sealing the doors of their barrows behind them if he does it will be a sad day for england for a great deal of the magic of this island will go with him he is linked to us in ways that some of those who were once worshipped as gods are not nan thought about asking what all this meant and how memsab knew it then thought better of the notion memsab had said that she and sarah could hold their tongues and this seemed like a good time to prove it instead she said didn you say that them barrows is burial mounds of kings an such so how can they be doors memsab chuckled and so they are but you nan are a little girl and neville is a ravenyet at the same time you are a warrior of the light and neville is your battle companion some things and some people can be two different things at the same time barrows can be both portals and burial vaults and those who have no eyes to see the doors in the hills will not be troubled by the knowledge that they are both well that seemed sensible enough and nan nodded will we see im again afore the day she asked now that i cannot tell you memsab pursed her lips if you do be polite respectful but dont fear him he is the very spirit of mischief but there is no harm in him and a great deal of good you might learn much from him and i never heard it said that any of his sort would stand by and let a child come to harm his knowledge is broad and deep and he has never been averse to sharing it with mortals but would he steal us away sarah asked suddenly growing pale dont they take children and leave behind changelings here nan was baffled she had no idea what sarah was talking about but memsab did i dont believe hed be likely to she replied after a long moment of thought firstly i dont think he would have revealed himself to us if he was going to do that secondly what i know of such things is that his sort never take children that are cared for and wanted only the ones abused and neglected she held out a hand and sarah went straight to her to be hugged reassuringly no one can say that about any of you i do hope with the casting problem solved preparations for the play went on so well that it almost seemed as if there was a blessing on the whole plan tommy was of course in ecstasy at being able to play bottom not only were the servants charmed by the idea of being an audience for such a thing but the local vicar got wind of the scheme and asked if they would be part of the church fête which was also to be midsummers day now that was something of a surprise for all of them but a welcome one at least for those who like nan and tommy felt no fear at performing before larger audiences so far as both of them were concerned theyd get right up on stage at covent garden without a qualm with the new venue in mind further touches were made on props and costumes permission was granted to rummage through selected attics and use whatever they could find there a happy discovery was that at some point in the past the inhabitants of the manor had engaged in amateur theatrics and had held many fancydress parties while much of the costuming was sized for adults there was enough for children or that could be cut down to fit children to make vast improvements in the wardrobe memsab commented on none of this but nan had the shrewd notion that they were the benefactors of someones subtle magics not that she cared she and sarah were the beneficiaries of this bounty for grecian garments or at least grecianinspired costumes were the sorts of things easily adapted to child size and they were now the proud wearers of something that looked entirely professional rather than something cobbled up from old dust sheets sarah looked utterly adorable to tell the truth like something off a wedgewood vase with her draped gown and a wreath of wax orange blossoms in her hair most spectacular though were mary dowland and henry tailor as titania and oberon respectively the most amazing fantastical costumes had been found for them and if they looked a bit over the top by daylight in evening rehearsals under dimmer light they looked very magical indeed and nothing like a pair of schoolchildren there were enough bumps in the road of production to ease nans fears that things were going entirely too well there were plenty of forgotten lines fumbled speeches and places where it was all too apparent just how amateur this amateur production was but the closer they got to the day the more excited nan became and so was everyone else right down to the servants who fell over themselves to help rather than cart everything to the church grounds permission was granted for the audience to come to them that meant that there would be no need to move anything so far as the players were concerned the performance for the servants was set in and around the folly which would serve partly as stage setting and partly as prop room and changing room since children able to remember several parts were taking several minor roles at once the semiclassical structure suited itself well to the purpose and it was surrounded by picturesque faux ruins that removed most of the need for scenery the day before the performance since the weather bid to stay fine more of pucks magic at work most of the preparations were done in advance on midsummers day the fête was held at the church and the servants got half days off to attend in shifts the children also had leave to go but since it was not a true fair and the entertainments were entirely home grown no one really wanted to do anything but final walkthroughs and a full rehearsal so the fête went on without their attendance the final rehearsal wasa disaster dropped lines abounded nerves were everywhere and even sarah was reduced to frustrated tears at least once at the end of it nan was exhausted and discouraged she felt wrung outand their puck had not appeared so memsab had once again read his lines she poked at her dinner without any real appetite until memsab noticed and had it taken away in favor of cucumber soup and buttered bread that went down easier getting past a throat tight with nerves after dinner memsab drew her aside before they all got into costume again dont worry she said with a hug the tradition in the theater is that the worse the final rehearsal is the better the performance will be but what about our puck nan asked forlornly dont worry was all memsab said and nan had to leave it at that because it was time to climb into their costumes and troop down to the folly where the servants were already stringing up fairy lights and improvised stage lights laying out rugs and cushions to sit on for themselves wagonloads of people had been arriving since before supper and people had been picnicking on the lawn in anticipation of the performance to come there was a steady buzz of talk audible even from the manor itself and the sound of all those people made nans stomach knot up it didnt get better when she heard the couple of hired musicians playing to entertain the crowda fiddler a flute player and a fellow with a guitar they had been making dance music for the morris dancers at the fête and vicar had arranged that they would also be providing incidental music during the play they were good it seemed impossible that even with the desire of the audience to be pleased the children could pull off a performance to compare favorably with the musicians and yet suddenly between one breath and the next all of that changed the moment nan set foot in the folly she felt a change come over her a curious calm overtook her curious because she felt tingly and alive as well as calm nor was she the only one a quick glance around showed her that everyone had settled the nerves and restlessness were gone from the rest of the cast the edge they all had was of anticipation rather than anxiety and not one of them mentioned the lack of the promised puck and at the moment when they were all milling about backstage waiting for memsab to announce the play nan felt a tug on her tunic and turned to find herself staring into those strange merry green eyes again this time the boy was wearing a fantastic garment that was a match for those titania and oberon were wearing a rough sleeveless tunic of green stuff and goatskin trousers with a trail of vine leaves wound carelessly through his tousled red hair how now pretty maiden did you doubt me he said slyly nay answer me not i can scarce blame you alls well now mind your cue with a little shove he sent her in the direction of her entrance mark and as she stepped out into the mellow light of lanterns and candles she forgot everything except her lines and how she wanted to say them now nan was not exactly an expert when it came to plays the most she had ever seen was a few snatches of this or thata punch and judy show a bit of something as she snuck into a music hall and the one shakespeare play memsab had taken them all to in london but the moment they all got onstage it was clear there was real magic involved all of them seemed and sounded older and a great deal more practiced not so much so that it would have been alarming butcertainlyas if they were all well into their teens rather than being children still everything looked convincing even the papiermâché donkeys head lines were spoken clearly with conviction and the right inflection nan and sarah even made people laugh in all the right places and as for puckwell he quite stole the show from the moment he set foot on stage it was clear that the play was in the end about him yet no one seemed to be in the least put out that he took the play over not even tommy and perhaps that was the most magical thing of all lovers human and faerie quarreled and reconciled the rustics put on their silly play with a great deal of shouting and bumbling about puck made mischief then made all right again the stage lights somehow put out far more illumination than they should have and the twinkling little fairy lights looked genuinely magical in fact there seemed to be a kind of golden magical haze over it all it ended all too soon with the cast being applauded wildly by an audience on its feet and all of themexcept puckcarried back bodily by the servants to be treated to a lateevening treat of cakes and ices and tea somewhere between the folly and the manor he had vanished again and no one said a word about his going oh they remembered him all right but no one seemed to find it at all strange that he wasnt here sharing in the triumphal treat basking in the admiration of the servants as nan devoured lemon ice and cake with the singleminded hunger of someone who did not eat nearly enough dinner she found herself in awe of that because it was one thing to work a bit of magic on a couple of people but puck had worked a very subtle magic on a great many people hed done it flawlessly and invisibly and in such a way that as she listened she realized he had somehow managed to implant in everyones mind that the boy who had played puck was always somewhere on the premises but in a place other than where the person talking about him was him or herself at that moment out of sheer curiosity she finally asked tommy as she got another helping of lemon ice hoy seen that lad robin went to change out of his costume tommy said around a mouthful of cake said the leaves itched nan listened with astonishment to the talk going on no one doubted that it had been him at all those rehearsals rather than memsab reading his part memory had been altered clearly in everyone except memsab and nan and sarah there were even stories about how he had done this or that in rehearsal and later that evening as the servants cheerfully collected costumes and the children prepared for bed she asked one of the maids where robin had gone and was not greatly surprised to hear that allegedly his parents had come to collect him at some point while the rest were finishing off the treats taking the last train back to london the maid said cheerfully i suppose a big boy like that hes used to staying up latebut it is a pity he couldnt stay still your memsab said she didnt like inviting them to stay without permission of the master and thats only right and proper since he dont know them and that seemed to be that memsab made it a point to come say good night to every child every night sometimes nan was already asleep by the time memsab got to them but not tonight as their mentor entered their little room nan was sitting up in bed hugging her knees sarah was beside her and even both birds were still awake and waiting memsab held up a hand forestalling the volley of questions nan wanted to fire off before they could be launched no he didnt give me any message for you yes that was his glamorie at work and no i have never seen anything quite like that in my life she shook her head it was quite amazing i stood there and watched as peoples memories changed and i could not for a moment tell you how it was done all i can think is that this is how his kind have protected themselves over the centuries i thought you said it was wrong to meddle with peoples thoughts sarah said her eyes narrowed memsab pursed her lips and sat down on the bed beside them i still think it is wrongbut it would be a greater wrong and very dangerous for robin to have left their memories alone she grimaced even i have meddled now and again sometimes you have to balance wrong against wrong and choose the one that does the least harm she patted sarahs hand as sarah looked very troubled its a hard lesson that you learn growing up that you cant always answer yes or no that something is entirely right or entirely wrong most of the time the answer is somewhere in the middle you think well see im again memsab nan asked softly hoping that the answer was going to be yes i dont know came the reply and with that unsatisfying answer she had to be content thatand their own unchanged memories david alderscroft had no intention of having any more to do with the harton school or frederick harton while the man did have a high level of native intelligence and while he did not have the advantages of a public school education and had clearly worked hard to rise above his plebian origins he was still when it came down to the matter common he was certainly not in davids social set while david considered himself to be free of snobbery he also regarded himself as a practical man and practically speaking there was nothing that a man like frederick harton and one such as himself could possibly have as mutual interests nevertheless he decided that it behooved him to do some investigation of the man after all frauds abounded in psychical circles and it was wise to make sure that harton was not of that ilk the mans insinuations that someone among the elemental mages of london could be ultimately responsible for the attacks on his charges had been subtle but exceedingly unwelcome especially since such insinuations implied that david did not know enough about the elemental mages around him to be able to completely refute such a charge and since when was he supposed to be responsible for the actions of all the elemental mages in this part of the world anyway wasnt that like implying that frederick harton was equally responsible for the actions of all the psychical talents in the city yes whispered a tiny voice inside but you are the lodge master of the masters circle here you were the one who organized it and runs it doesnt that make you responsible as if it wasnt perfectly obvious that it must have been someone in hartons own circles who was responsible who else would have had the knowledge and the motivation today he had the results of his investigation on his desk from the private agent he had employed to delve into the hartons and their school and small importation business he should have been pleased to discover that both hartons had a sterling reputation but somehow this only irritated him he knew this irritation was irrational and that irritated him even more as he turned the closelywritten pages over and read them with care drat them both i will forget about this he vowed it is a dead issue neither of them will trouble me again he decided to take refuge from unwelcome thoughts by immersing himself in the round of summer entertainments organized by lady cordelia arranged to introduce him gradually into political circles tennisparties afternoon teas dinnersall were designed to make him visible but not intrusive lady cordelia took a thamesside summer home for the purpose something where a wide spacious lawn suitable for croquet and picnicking al fresco and the proximity to london were the most important features ministers who lived in london had no difficulty in getting to these entertainments and yet the contrast between the bucolic suburb and the hot noisy city could not have been greater in such pleasant surroundings in an atmosphere in which lady cordelia laughingly forbade all talk of politics it was possible to make a good impression without ever actually saying anything though truth be told he was finding his acquaintance with these lions of parliament a bit disappointing if he had followed his inclinations they were not the folk he would have been spending these pleasant summer hours with none of them had much in the way of interests outside of politics all were devoted more or less to the arts of manipulation they were façades like stage scenery implying a substance and solidity that was in reality nothing more than paint on canvas they did not read they did not think much past the needs of themselves and their select circle when they attended plays or concerts it was not to pay attention to the performance but to be seen attending the performance their wives were pleasant nonentities chosen for their ability to adorn a dinner table and play gracious hostessand for the ability to smile and meekly accept whatever their lord and master decreed outwardly respectable the pillars of society they stood foursquare for moral behavior propriety virtue and values and there wasnt one of them that did not have a mistress tucked away in mayfair shared the attentions of a london courtesan had at least one maidservant who did a bit more for her master than dust or visited a discreet brothel on a regular basis and that was merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg that they were venial was not what bothered him so much it was the hypocrisy all men had their failings and he was no more a bastion of personal rectitude than the next fellow that he should go casting stones the problem was that these men set themselves up as the models of rectitude while secretly and deliberately choosing the opposite path he knew these thingsand other personal failingsbecause lady cordelia kept him informed of them not that he was supposed to do anything with the information no nothing like that he was supposed to hold it close against the day when a subtle hint would convey a tacit warning that cooperation was better than opposition and that bothered him too it felt somehow wrong it was a chess game on a grand scale hunting for weaknesses not exploiting them yet but having the knowledge ready if it needed to be used he liked chess he wished he could take the same pleasure in this game certainly the major pieces on the board were as bloodless as the whiteandblack marble pieces of his favorite set the trouble was it was always the pawns that were sacrificed and the pawns were anything but bloodless wives children associatespeople who would probably suffer more than the major players if everything went badly you thought about these things the innocent bystanders when you were the chief huntsman of a masters circle you had to in magic things were different when you did something knowingly wrong when you hurt people who did not deserve hurt it came back on you later the scales were evened a great deal faster for a mage than for an ordinary man who might wait until the day he was called before the almighty to answer for what he had done he consulted his calendar to discover that this evenings excursion would be a concert on the lawn of lady cordelias summer residence beneath the starstaking the cue from the muchlessgenteel church fêtes and outdoor entertainments of london and making it acceptable for the set to which she and david belonged as usual the word concert was something of a misnomer yes there would be musictonight it would be a string quartet on the terracebut the number of people actually listening to the music would be low most would be there to be seento display new frocks and jewels to be seen speaking to the right people to make ones presence known or reinforce ones standing in this particular group miss too many of these social outings without an adequate excuse and people began to talk to question if you had been invited at all and if not why not as he was assisted into his evening dress by his valet for another one of these dreary mockfestive occasions he found his mind drifting back to summer parties when he had still been in school when he had spent one week after another making the rounds of weeklong visits to estates in the country and had not considered those simpler pleasures beneath his dignity then he and the others had gone to the church fêtes and bought useless embroidered cushions and tatted antimacassars and eaten ices and listened to village musicians and actually enjoyed themselves and with a curse he flung himself into his carriage for another evening of pretense and empty smiles but he reminded himself this was the life of an adult it was more than time to put away childish notions to settle into the serious business of life life was not church fêtes and ices life was doing things one did not want to do with the goal of getting things great things accomplished besides lady cordelia had assured him that eventually he would come to take some sardonic amusement in these occasions as he watched the façades strut about pretending to be substance but in the back of his mind he couldnt help feeing this was all very inferior to honest laughter and the taste of a lemon ice beneath the stars of a country night with the excitement of the play over a languor settled over the children for the next couple of days or so there was alas no further sign of robin goodfellow either though nan looked in vain for him everywhere she went it was memsab who roused them all out of it by proposing a contest we have gone over a great deal of the history of this house she said over breakfast three days after the play but there is a great deal more here that can be discovered i want each of you to find out all you can about the history of some particular place or object in this house and link that to the greater history of england the one with the story that is best will be allowed to come with me to select a school pony at the horse fair now since the mere existence of a school pony had been the subject of much rumor for two daysoriginating with tommy who had sworn he had overheard a conversation between two grooms suggesting that some unknown benefactor was going to field the money for such a thingthe news caused a sensation every single girl knew exactly what she wanteda gentle fat white pony with a soft nose and big eyes who would willingly be hitched to a cart for rides all over the estate and every single boy knew what he wanteda lively black pony with white socks and a blaze and an eye full of mischief who would willingly run at breakneck speed beneath his rider and take fences even a tall hunter would balk at never mind that no more than two of the girls knew how to drive and of the three boys who had been taught how to ride none of them had been on a member of the living equine species in more than a year the lines were drawn the camps set up and a grim rivalry ensued now nan who was still in charge of helping the ayahs with the littlest children was at a distinct disadvantage on two counts one that she had to wait until her chores were over that morning before she could go in search of her research subject and two that while she enjoyed history her knowledge of it was extremely patchy so by the time she got to looking over the grounds and manor house all the obvious choices had been spoken for sarah graciously offered to give up her own choicethe set of african tribal weapons she found in the gun roombut nan was determined to find her own mystery to unravel but it seemed that every time she went to memsab with a choice it was only to discover that either she had misremembered and they had already learned about it as a group or that someone else had already spoken for it she didnt want to try and ferret out anything like the stories behind portraits or bits of furniture or books memsab had ruled out things that were clearly nothing more than hunting trophies like the chandelier of stag horns or the heads of dead animals in the gun room and the boys had all straightaway bagged things like suits of armor and heirloom swords it was with a sense of frustration that nan began poking around the building looking now for anything that gave her the least little stirring of interest there was nothing inside in the areas that they were allowed to explore and not even for the privilege of going to a horse fair was she going to dare the wrath of the housekeeper to venture into forbidden zones some of the other girls could get away with that but it seemed that the housekeeper had dire expectations of nans ability to stay out of trouble and kept nans leash extremely short the knot garden and the tiny maze so small even the toddlers could find their way in and out of it had already been taken the other gardens were too general according to memsab unless you can find a specific plant that is unusual or clearly imported the folly had been taken the false ruins were spoken for at this point it was late afternoon and there didnt seem to be anything that was going to be interesting to look into which meant things that were difficult dull or both at that point nan was kicking a round stone along the path in front of her in frustration when the stone smacked into the side of the dry well she made her usual aversive detourand then stopped surely if she felt a sensation that was that strong there must be something there worth looking into she went to memsab who raised an eyebrow at her it is old enough surely if that is what you want im about run out of things memsab nan confessed dunno what else to do now memsab rubbed the back of her right hand as if troubled there is something i do not like about that well she said slowly i do not know that it is dangerous but the place troubles me profoundly i would prefer that if you really want to pursue this you do it without spending too much time at the well itself there is something not quite right there unhappy memories mebbe nan ventured shrewdly it could well be well if this is what you want then by all means use it as your project memsab looked down at her own hands for a moment but nan be careful about that place it might be that there is nothing there but it might very well be that we both sense something dormant there something asleep dont wake it up nan had figured that the best place to begin in her hunt for information was with the groundskeeper but to her surprise he neither knew nor cared about something that was not only useless but a nuisance since occasionally things got dropped down it that he had to fetch back up again not by accident of course no it was generally deliberate at least as far as nan could make out from the mans grumbling he didnt like the well no one liked the well but master wouldnt brick it over because there was something historical about it excited now nan tried to pursue the question further but the old man refused to talk about it anymore frustrated she began canvassing the rest of the servants but most of them had no idea what she was talking about except that few of them cared to go near the well most of them simply said that the well was ugly and there was no reason to spend any time around it three of them however said that the well made them uneasy and wouldnt even discuss it dejected she flopped into a chair at dinner between sarah and tommy and spent most of the meal interjecting heavy sighs between their excited comments sarah began looking at her curiously and finally even tommy noticed that she was being glum no luck with your project then he said sympathetically come on nan tell us what it is and maybe we can help even if we cant help we can try and make you feel better sarah offered with another heavy sigh nan explained her idea and that she had come up dry sarah shook her headshe was doing the history of a cavalierera portrait and having no difficulty for the artist was quite a famous one and there were lots of books even in the manor library that talked about it i dont think ive seen anything in the library about the well she said doubtfully but tommy looked thoughtful maybe gaffer geordie can help he said nan blinked at him whos that she asked he lives down in the pensioners cottages tommy explained he used to work in the stable oh a long time ago before the last of the old family died and the cousins inherited well that sounded promising but if he was that old he aint dotty is e nan asked dubiously tommy shook his head vigorously not a bit whenever theres something wrong with a horse or a dog they go to gaffer before they call in the farrier or the horse doctor most times he sets it right and when they do call the horse doctor he wont do a thing unless gaffer is right there that sounded even more promising but it didnt answer the question of why tommy thought this gaffer could help before she could say anything though tommy answered that question gaffer geordie knows everything thats ever happened here right back to his grandfathers day he explained so if theres anything about the well going back that far hell know the next day armed with the information that gaffer lived in the cottage with all the dogs nan and neville trudged down to the row of cottages that had been built to house highleigh servants too old to work who had been pensioned off and very shortly nan realized that the seemingly vague directions were not vague at all for it was obvious which cottage was the gaffers dogsall of them old maimed or bothlay in the sun along the wall of the cottage on either side of the door sat quietly watching the street or attended to doggish business around the grounds there were probably thirty of them most were foxhounds though there was a threelegged wolfhound and a cluster of pretty little spaniels with various imperfections the gaffer himself like a king enthroned among his subjects sat on a stool beside his doorway smoking a pipe and watching the world pass by he was an astonishing sight in nans eyes she had no idea just how old he was but his hair and beard were snowwhite and two bushy white eyebrows overshadowed a face that was a mass of wrinkles in which his eyes appeared like two shiny black currants he certainly looked a lot older than her gran ever did and gran had been the oldest person nan had ever known he wore a linen smock and buff trousers a pair of old worn boots and a floppy hat he gave nan a friendly nod as she approached and grinned at neville she half expected to hear some sort of country dialect shed only half understand when he opened his mouth but instead out came so raven lass come to see old gaffer geordie have you nan nodded distracted by the dogs which came up to sniff and inspect her neville eyed them with disdain even contempt it was pretty clear that gaffer geordie saved the dogs no one else wanted even the spaniels at his feet while pretty and charming were not perfect specimens so what can old geordie do for you the old man continued eyeing her with curiosity i dont know much but dogs and horses lass if theres aught wrong with your bird i probably cant help you neville quorked and shook himself nevilles right as rain sir nan said as politely as possible i heard you knew a lot about highleigh park an i wanted to ask you bout something that dry well by the kitchen garden oh now thats an uncanny spot that is gaffer geordie said instantly and shook his head had a bad reputation some said it was a cursed place and some said it was a curse on the master of highleigh very uncanny and no surprise seeing them bones as was pulled out of it there could not have been anything more likely to spark nans interest than that sentence bones she repeated as neville bobbed his head oh aye bones a full skellington it was and chains leg chains and arm chains geordie nodded wisely summun dropped that feller down and clamped the lid on the top leavin him to die master of highleigh that was back when i was no more bigger than you reckoned to clean out the well maybe use it for summat but after the bones was found he gave up on the notion of usin it for anything vicar took charge of them gave the poor fellow a proper christian burial spots been a bit quieter since then he scratched his head used to be there was noise in that well of a night now and again moaning nan asked shivering but the old man shook his head curses that was all he could tell her but it was more than she had until that point the next person to approach seemed to be the local vicar who was in any case coming to take tea with memsab unfortunately he could not shed light on the matter either that was long before my time dear child he said shaking his head and that seemed to be that until however someone unexpectedly approached nan the next day rather than the other way around called out of the nursery by one of the ayahs she found the estate manager waiting in the hallway with an enormous ledger under his arm she knew he was the estate manager only because she had seen him consulting with memsab over some matter and had been told who the lean slightly stooped middleaged man was he was smiling slightly and pushed his glasses farther up his nose with one finger you would be miss nan investigating the mystery of the dry well he asked making it sound far more intriguing than it had been up until that moment she nodded and he handed the large and heavy book to her bound in brown calfskin the lord of highleigh of those days was an amateur antiquarian and archaeologist although they would not have put it that way back then in his own writing he referred to himself as a student of natural sciences he took notes on everything he found and did in and around the estate so if there is any record of anything to do with the well it will surely be in this book flabbergasted as well as astonished nan took it from him thankee she exclaimed thankee kindly he waved her thanks off peering at her benignly from behind his spectacles on the whole having you children here has been no great work or inconvenience and has been quite amusing this project of your schoolmistress is teaching you all valuable lessons in conducting research and i am happy to be able to assist with that he went on his way leaving her clutching the oversized volume to her chest after luncheon she sarah and tommywho having completed his own history of the suit of armor in the library was eaten up with curiosity about nans projecttook it to the dining room opened the book on the big table and began looking through it the three of them knelt sidebyside on dining room chairs so they could all get a good view the neat copperplate handwriting was surprisingly easy to read and the three of them with the birds looking on from nan and sarahs shoulders perused the pages with interest this selfprofessed student of natural history was more of a dabbler in anything and everything it seemed to nan there were notes on chemical experiments on stellar observations weather observations but what clearly intrigued him most was the far past it was when he was digging the foundations of the folly that he first encountered some roman artifacts and the discovery of the few coins the bits of pottery and the old dagger changed his life while he did not go wholesale into digging up his estate he used every new construction project as a reason to excavate when he was not digging he was finding other places where he could indulge his hobby and that brought him around to exploring the past through the records of his own family and trying to link what he found to the papers and diaries in the family archives he wasnt often all that successful and some of his notes seemed to be stretching the facts even to nan how on earth could he determine that a coin was roman for instance when it was so worn that there wasnt anything to show it even was a coin except that it was round and bronze eventually though he had built all that a reasonable man could and he turned his attention to other places he might go looking for bits of the past that was when he hit on the idea of clearing out the old well the children leaned over the book intently as they realized that they had struck gold at last the first few entries mostly the general dates lord mathew had uncovered telling him who had ordered the well built and why it had gone dry interspersed with observations about the weather and the implications for the harvest were rather boring one very small man had to be lowered down to the bottom on a rope and dug the debris out shovelful by small shovelful dumping it into buckets to be sent up for examination and disposal then it all got sifted once it arrived at the top of the well and anything not dirt rocks and plant life were set aside for lord mathew to look at in detail it had been difficult finding someone willing to go down into the well it had a bad reputation and according to lord mathews notes the servants claimed that on certain nights one could hear moaning and vile curses coming from the bottom then the digger found the skull and nothing would persuade anyone on the estate to go down into the well lord mathew now afire with excitement stripped to his shirtsleeves and had himself lowered down into the hole with the aid of a lantern held over his head he meticulously excavated until he uncovered the entire body whoever it was there had been manacles about his wrists and ankles with chains on them clothing had not survived but there had been silver buttons on his coat and trousers and he had worn fine leather boots with silver buckles another buckle might have been an ornament on a hat lord mathew tentatively dated these objects to the time of charles the first since this was the time of the civil war and many records were lost then when the manor was invaded by roundheads and many things stolen or burned lord mathew despaired of finding any answer still he triedand erring on the side of compassion turned the remains over to the vicar of the time for a christian burial nothing else of note was taken out of the well and that ended the tales of moaning and cursing coming from the well lord mathews researches were in vain because so many people died or vanished during that time there simply was no telling who it could have been they closed the book and looked at each other the odd sourish smell of an old book still in their nostrils well sarah said finally you have enough to write that report for memsab now and it was true that she did but the results were less than satisfying nan nodded but it dont solve the mystery she added feeling obscurely disappointed crumbs tommy said clearly disappointed it doesnt maybe memsab will have some ideas where to look next nan sighed and went to fetch pen and paper to write her report she had no illusions about her report winning the coveted place at memsabs side but now she was far more interested in getting to the bottom of this than going to the horse fair she had to wait until she was alone with the headmistress before she could bring up the topic i wonder memsab said slowly after she and nan had finished another of her special lessons i wonder if there isnt a way to find something out about the mysterious body in the well directly and she looked straight at nan the implication was obvious since nan had just completed another lesson in psychometry one in which she had learned to tell how far back in time a particular reading on an object had taken place they were sitting in the parlor and nan had just read one of the old vases there a huge blueandwhite monstrosity that was always full of fresh flowers wot me nan said startled ow we avent got the skellington or even them silver buttons whatever had become of those objects was a mystery though nan figured they had been buried along with the remains they werent novel enough nor old enough to have entered lord mathews collection of artifacts and souvenirs the well nan memsab pointed out you can read the well itself ooeck nan could have hit herself for not thinking of that solution earlier course i can mind theres been a lot uv people gone and touched that well since thingsll be a bit dimlike memsab gave her an admonishing look dont you think thats all to the good considering that we are discussing the circumstances that led to a mans perishing there laden with chains this is not something that i would care to experience at first hand nan shrugged sometimes memsab forgot how little nan had been sheltered from murder in whitechapel was a way of life so to speak sides she continued i got neville now he stood down that nasty thing in berkeley square i dont reckon something that never did wuss than swear ud bother him none from the back of the chair beside her neville bobbed his head fluffed his feathers and uttered a short quork i am more than willing for you to try this or i would not have suggested it in the first place memsab said interlacing her fingers together in her lap however there are some things we should consider first and discuss you and i and things that i should research myself i dont want you plunging headfirst into this and especially i do not want you doing this without me do i have your word with a sigh and with a glare from neville that suggested that if she did not promise he might well give her a good peck she gave her word first of all although the memories are old and the remains are no longer physically present a spirit could still be bound to the place of its death and you could awaken it memsab said thoughtfully that could be goodwe might be able to convince it to go on its wayor badbecause it might attack so at the very least i need to be there and most of the children need to be kept away i would prefer it if sahib and possibly agansing could also be present agansings people have a great deal of experience with ancestor spirits both good and bad and that might come in handy most of the othersyoure thinkin sarah ought to be there too nan hazarded memsab nodded but reluctantly keeping her eyes focused on nans yes and no yes because if there is a spirit she is the one most likely to be able to speak to it and no because if there is a spirit it may attempt to take her theres grey nan pointed out shes sarahs protector right yees memsab agreed but with some doubt i simply dont know how powerful a protector grey is and there is also the possibility that you could be harmed by this as well these are all things that need to be balanced with a sigh nan agreed by this point it was pretty obvious that memsab was not going to march straight down to the well and have nan try her power of seeing things in somethings past right soon it was going to wait until the weekend at best which was when sahib would be coming she did however go tell sarah about memsabs idea that night at bedtime both sarah and grey listened attentively and sarah who was sitting in bed clasping her knees with her arms shivered when she had finished im not very brave she said quietly not like you nan nan snorted brave enough she said roughly ow brave is brave an when does it spill over to daft eh i done plenty daft things some un might say was brave sarah had to laugh at that i dont like to think of anything trapped or in pain or both she went on but that horrible thing in berkeley squareit scared me nan i dont ever want to see anything like that again no more do i but this thing the well it dont feel like that thing in london nan pointed out then she sighed really though we aint got a choice well get to do what memsab says we can thats true and memsab wont let us do anything that is really dangerous sarah replied brightening and changed the topic to speculation on who was going to win the coveted expedition to the horse fair but nan stared up at the ceiling after the candles were out with her hands behind her head thinking it was true that memsab would normally not let them do anything dangerous not knowingly but even memsab was concerned that there were hidden dangers here she could not anticipate that factor alone was enough to give nan pause and she tried to think of things that maybe memsab would not only to decide that this was an exercise in futility oh well she decided finally as she gave up the fight to hold off sleep thingsll appen as they appen like gram used to say lettmorrow take care of itself memsab nan decided looked worried but was hiding it well nan was more excited than worried and neville looked positively impatient to get things started sarah however was showing enough nerves for both of them and she wasnt even the one who was going to be investigating the well and its haunt in the first place glaah said neville and nan got the sense of of course shes nervous shes nervous for you and immediately she felt a little ashamed of herself besides sarah had said herself she wasnt brave like nan and it wasnt nice to be scornful of her for something she had admitted to herself and with that thought she shook her head at how strange her life had become not that long ago would she have cared what anyone thought would she have cared that she herself had thought things about someone that werent very nice no of course not it wouldnt have mattered when you were going to bed hungry every night nothing much mattered except finding a way to scrounge another bit of food when you got thrown out in the street in the middle of winter all that mattered was that you could find the penny for a place under a roof that night whether or not you thought something about someone that might hurt their feelings if they found out was so far from being relevant to how you lived it struck her for a moment how much her life had changed and in her heart she apologized to sarah for belittling her neville rubbed his beak against her cheek beside memsab were sahib and agansing the latter looking entirely serene that gave nan heart for agansing was the one person she thought likeliest to sense incipient trouble before it became a problem excluding the other children would have been tricky except for one thing the new pony had arrived and all of them were down at the stable being introduced and taking their turns with him there had been neither black ponies nor white at the horse fair only varying shades of brown which averted that particular crisisthe chosen beast was an affectionate little gelding with two white feet and a white blaze tommywho had won the coveted positionimmediately named him flash but flashs main pace was an amble so he wasnt likely to live up to it he had been advertised as being trained to ride or drive so presumably everyone was going to be reasonably satisfied with him but with that sort of a draw down at the stables probably no one was going to notice that nan and sarah werent there and even if they did it was reasonable to assume that sarah raised in africa and nan raised on the london streets hadnt ever had ponies and probably didnt know how to ride or drive which was of course true nan had in fact encountered the pony and had not been impressed in comparison to neville it came off a poor second in her opinion it was no hardship to either nan or sarah to be here rather than at the stables with the rest they were all waiting for one thing karamjit to return from the stable with word that the rest were all now fully involved with the pony and unlikely to take it into their heads to come back to the manor and go looking for memsab sarah or nan and at length karamjit did appear stalking around the corner of the hedge like a twolegged panther taking his place beside sahib with that arrival memsab nodded at nan who braced herself approached the well laid both bare hands on the stone coping closed her eyes and slowly let herself see what was there there was an immediate surge of terror but she had expected that and pushed past it it was the reaction of that longago worker to discovering a corpse and she had suspected this would be something she would sense very strongly it was relatively recent in the life of the well and it was powerful with it came panic the sense of being stifled and trapped fleeting images of rough walls and above all the need to get out it didnt last long and she moved beyond the moment then there was nothing for a very long time well not nothing precisely but only vague whispers of a thousand passing personalities that hardly left an imprint at all merest hints of emotion piled one atop another in a confusing heap and nothing much in the way of images she was used to this sort of pattern emanating from a very old object but the well was so public a place and it was so easy for people to brush a bit of themselves on it in passing that it was like pushing her way through endless ghostly branches in a haunted forest without an end then a force hit her like a runaway wagon damn you wordsoh yesdefinitely words but impact that shook her and made her fall forward against the stone wall of the well the anger the fear the despair struck her with all the immediacy of a physical blow immediately she felt neville push himself into her neck as her hands clutched the rough stone and her body reeled along with her mind she reached for his mental presence even as she managed to raise a hand to touch his neck and the feelings receded but not so far that she could not read them she had images now a darkclad body curled into a fetal ball chained hand and foot a man dying of thirst knowing he was dying and such rage in him that the rage itself took on what was left of his life force i know this part she thought she pushed past the images and the rage this was the ending the last bitter moments of a life she needed to see where it started more images flooded her she let them come she knew that the best way for her to decipher the past of an object was to allow all the images to flood in at once and sort them out after she had taken them in the well had seen the man but the well had no eyes so she would never know what the man had actually looked like other than that he was lean and his clothing was dark and quite plain another surge of emotion more sustained this time outrage rather than anger and fear disbelief horror each of these in turn all linked with a thought theyre not coming back who was not coming back no answer there only the longago press of emotion as a man realized that he had been forgotten abandoned left to a fate that had only one ending e cant believe this whoever put im in there either forgot about im or somethin happened she heard her own voice saying dreamily hes hearin commotion an e reckons its the whole household packin up an leavin and not knowin es down ere es been yellin but nobody erd im more images and then not images at all but the things that had happened were happening to her being lowered carefully into the well head ringing from the blows licking swollen lips and tasting blood unable to see out of one eye anger at being defeated at being caught no words now only feelings emotional and physical there was a kernel there that was nan that knew it was a little girl that the country was ruled by a queen and not a king that none of this was real there was the sense of an anchor a protector who sheltered that kernel of herself she had to just let it all wash over her and not try to fight it because fighting would only wear her out and thin her hold on herself she closed in on herself made herself like a hard little stone the kind you got in your shoe and couldnt get rid of this wasnt an attack any more than the foot in the shoe was an attack on the stone there wasnt even a person behind it this was all just idiot emotion left behind by the trauma of long ago maybe there had been a ghost at one time howling to be found cursing those who passed by if so christian burial even though no one knew what name to put on a marker had probably put an end to the haunts finally the little stone that was nan dropped out of the swirling chaos of leftbehind emotions she had come through it she was on the other side she opened her eyes blinked twice and sat down quite suddenly on the ground isabelle shook her head a mystery still she mused from nans description i would guess that the man was a roundhead perhaps a spy for whatever reason someone here decided he was a menace and imprisoned him in the well and didnt tell anyone else her husband pointed out that was where it all fell apart we know why no one came to let him outthere was no one here now that they knew what to look for they knew that as the royalists lost ground to oliver cromwells troops the family here had abandoned their manor taken all the portable wealth they could muster and fled across the channel as it happened they had a great deal of portable wealth and they had been able to get across the countryside and into france with no real difficulty others who had waited longer had not been so lucky frederick stretched accepted a cup of tea from isabelle and looked to agansing youre certain that this wasnt deliberate murder he asked clearing that well of the taint of something like murder agansing shook his head the mans captors were hardly kind but there is no trace in the original thought patterns that he anticipated such a thing here besides dearest why would anyone go to the trouble of binding and chaining him then lowering him carefully into the well if they intended to murder him isabelle pointed out it would have take far less effort to simply knock him on the head or shoot him and throw him in the river if he was found at all it would be assumed he was another casualty of the war its what i would have done if i had wanted to murder someone at that date agansing for all that he knew her well looked a little aghast frederick reached across the distance between their chairs and patted her hand affectionately sometimes my love you make my blood run cold he said fondly im glad youre on my side she sniffed really frederick i am only saying what i would have done had i a wicked nature and been inclined to murder someone during the civil war not that i would countenance doing any such thing he chuckled hed been teasing her of course but she was a little irritated at him it was not the sort of teasing she enjoyed well perhaps her nerves were irritated by being in proximity to the negative emotions in that wellhead for so long she sat on her irritation and went on we definitely need to cleanse the place or something might well take advantage of the situation you saw for yourself how readily little nan became absorbed there is a great deal of energy there and if we still have an enemy to nan and sarah that place could be used to feed and hold a truly dangerous entity frederick nodded i completely agree he rose cracked his knuckles and held out his hand to assist her to rise and there is no time like the present cordelia was angry the servants sensed it and stayed as far out of her reach as possible she would have taken her anger out on david but he had gone off to a country house party for the next several days she had been invited but she had turned the invitation down the host bored her the hostess was worse and it would have been one stultifying round of lawn tennis and croquet in the afternoons and rubbers of bridge and politics in the evenings except she would have been excluded from the politics relegated to gossip and amateur theatrics with the ladies and the politics were the only part of the house party she would have found interesting but several important men had been invited which meant that david had to go so he was not here to suffer the sting of her anger either she sat in her exquisite parlor and after long hard consideration she leveled her gaze on an extremely expensive porcelain vase david had given her full of water and white lilies that were nearly as expensive as the vase she stared at it obedient to her will the little cold elementals that looked like white furred snakes wrapped themselves around the lilies and began to freeze them within moments they were solid enough to hammer nails with they were lovely in this form but as soon as they began to thaw they would turn into a blackened mess that the maids would have to clean up it would take them hours especially if any of the ruined rotting blossoms dropped on the tabletop and marred the finish they would be waxing and polishing half the day the gesture didnt appease her wrath but it did vent some of her feelings for the quarry had escaped before she could do anything about those wretched children someone else had the unmitigated gall to invite them to his estate for the summer she had no idea who nor where it was her agents had been unable to get anything out of the few reticent servants left and efforts to follow frederick harton had all ended in failure she hired different agents to the same end it was immensely frustrating the man was utterly ordinary a commonplace soldierturnedmerchant to be sure he had some occult power but it could not possibly be a match for that of an elemental master she was left to pursue the quarry through the only route she had left isabelle hartons friends among the female elemental masters she was forced to be extremely circumspect about it for she did not want isabelle to get wind of the fact that she was hunting for her and wonder why her rage like all her emotions was icy and calculating it was a force to be conserved and put to good use and it occurred to her suddenly that there might be one more way of finding those wretched children she could use her rage to best effect with it right now but it would take exceedingly careful work if she was not to tip her hand she closed her eyes and took several long slow deep breaths then rose and went to her workroom she closed and locked the door behind herself and sat down before her worktable no ice wurms to be summoned today but she left a single gray feather on the table in front of her she sat in her crystal throne folded her hands in her lap and began to still her body her heartbeat slowed her breathing became shallow and almost imperceptible and within the half hour anyone looking at her would have thought her dead or near it in this state it was easy to slip across the barrier between the living and the dead not far but enough across the line to shadowwalk enough to talk to the ghost she herself had created though she could not speak to nor see any of the others that she had no hand in making enough to be able to call one of her little servants to her or to see them enough to travel to a limited extent herself in spirit though she could not move far from her body she had a particular child ghost in mind a dreamraptured little thing who in life had been mute and in death was just as mute if isabelle caught the ghost she could interrogate it all she liked she would learn nothing from it the waif actually knew she was dead but did not care she had never seen the inside of church or chapel in her entire life and so had no expectation of any sort of afterlife what she did know was that she was no longer hungry thirsty or cold this was a distinct improvement over her lot when she had been alive while it was true that spirits saw the living world but dimly as if they wandered about in a london peasoup fog this did not seem to trouble little peggoty in the least she had never owned a toy she had never slept in a bed she had never had a permanent roof over her head so the lack of them did not trouble her either she had been brought to one of cordelias shelters dying of starvation and tuberculosis and while it might have been possible to prolong her life cordelia had simply taken advantage of the situation by putting the mite out of her misery in the usual way since then she had been useful for simple tasks that did not require much thinking as nearly as cordelia was able to tell peggoty passed her days as a ghost in the same way that she had passed them as a living childwrapped in some strange dream world halfawake and halfasleep what it was that she daydreamed about no one would ever know for she lacked the means to tell them whatever it was she seemed content to live there in her daydreams between times when cordelia needed her in that half world of mist and shadow cordelia moved cutting through the mist to wherever it was in the townhouse that peggoty had put herself she could have summoned the child to her of course but she knew from past experience that would frighten the waif who associated being called with punishment normally this would not be a problem but if isabelles pupil was somehow able to see and interact with peggoty the last thing that cordelia wanted was for peggoty to cling to that little girl for protection no cordelia wanted peggoty to be her usual dreamy self with nothing to cause alarm in her behavior that way the worst that would happen if she were discovered would be that isabelle would succeed in sending peggoty on to the next world wherever whatever the next world was for peggoty she was such a passive little spirit that the next world might only consist of a brighter version of the fog of dreams she moved through now passing through the real world in her ghostly equivalent cordelia found peggoty physically haunting the attic of her town house the child stood dreamily at the window staring at what to her must have been a sea of gray marked only by vague shadowy forms appearing disappearing looking more like ghosts to her than she did to the world of the living even here halfway into the spirit world as cordelia was the child was nothing more than a wispy wraith a sketch in the air of transparent white on dark gray although her head hands and chest were detailed enough the rest of her was blurred as if the drawing was incomplete and unfinished peggoty said cordelia in her sweetest gentlest voice the child turned and looked up at her mistress with large dark eyes in a colorless face a face thin with years of constant nearstarvation and as expressionless as a tombstone those eyes seemed to look through her and cordelia although she was used to that look still felt just a fraction or two colder than she had a moment before peggoty i need you to go and find someone cordelia continued it is another little girl there was one thing that the berkeley square misadventure had produced a handful of small feathers gray and black peggoty could not touch them of course but she could get a kind of scent from them and follow it the way a bloodhound would follow an actual scent of course cordelia could have used the feathers to locate the girls with magichad they not been protected by masters of all four elements cordelia made no mistake in underestimating her opponents just because they were women they were in fact rather more likely to be supremely competent than not any magical probe would be met by alarms and if she was very unlucky the instant response from whoever was responsible for setting up the fire wards cordelia knew that she was good but she was not good enough to erase her tracks before another master could identify her her magical signature was quite unique but a spirit especially a harmless little thing like peggoty could slip in and out without ever being noticed she led peggoty to her workroom drifting through the walls where she had left one of the tiny feathers on the table and peggotys big eyes rested on it the little girl i want you to find has a bird and this is one of its feathers if you find the bird youll find the girl i want you to go and find her and when you do come back here and show me where she is can you do that peggoty nodded slowly her eyes fixed on the tiny feather as she read whatever it was that told her where it had come from then without looking again at cordelia the wraith turned in the air and floated silently through the wall cordelia sighed and with a mental wrench brought herself straight back into her own body again this would take time but peggoty did not need to sleep did not even tire and was not easily distracted once she had been set a task perhaps the children enjoyed being given tasks as a change in the unvarying condition of their lives it was difficult to tell especially with one like peggoty who had never been a normal child of course the annoying thing was that none of this would have been needed if cordelia had just been born a man she rose carefully from her chaircarefully because after a session like this she was rather stiffand left her workroom after the chill of that room the summer warmth felt like the sultry breath of a hothouse in july and she winced burgeoning growth meant burgeoning decay there had been another tiny line in her face again today near the corner of her eye she had preserved her beauty for so longbut even magic could not hold time back forever it seemed soon people would stop wondering if david was her lover and start wondering if david was her son it was enough to make her break into a rage but rages were aging and she had already indulged in one today if she had been born a man no one would think twice about wrinkles and gray hair in fact such signs of aging would have been marks of increased wisdom and she would have more respect not less for possessing them galling to have to depend on someone else for the power she should rightfully have had on her own and doubly galling to see david making his own decisions without consulting her as he had been doing more and more regularly of late she hated summer she hated the heat the unrestrained growth of nature she hated being forced to relocate to that wretched house on the thames just so she could continue to attract the right people to her parties she hated the relaxation of etiquette that summer brought although the relaxation of conversation was useful very usefulbut the same relaxation could be brought about with the proper application of fine spirits and a warm room it was far far more difficult to collect children to make into her ghostly servants in the summer sleeping in alleys and staircases even on rooftops and in doorways was no longer such a hardship in summer it was easier to find food things spoiled by the heat were tossed out all the time haunting the farmers markets brought plenty of bruised and spoiled fruit and vegetables they didnt come to her recruiters and it was harder to summon the cold to kill them she stood at the window looking out unseeing at the street just beyond her walls it was such a waste too those lives those years that she could use that youth she needed all going for nothing there was no way to capture that youth and transfer it to someone else and even if she could there still remained the insurmountable barrier of her sex as long as she was a woman she would never be taken seriously enough to achieve any kind of power in her own name she breathed in the scent of summer life green and warm and hated it from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale shakespeare had said ripe turned to rot all too soon but sooner for women than men and it was a bit too late now to try masquerading as a man even if she wanted to it would take far too long to establish that male persona in the position to which she had gotten david the door of opportunity was slowly closing her hand clenched unfair unfair if only she could somehow become david to control him directly instead of in this maddening roundabout fashion after all what had he done with his life on his own reorganized that silly little masters circle of his and of what use was that if only and at that thought her mind stopped she mentally stood stock still to examine that thought again if only she could become david was it possible was it desirable the answer to that second question was an unequivocal yes it was very desirable it wasnt as if she had gotten any great use from her femininity in ages rather it was something to be suppressed as was evidence of her intelligence if she was a manif she was davidin order to masquerade as a man she would have to sacrifice what was amusingly called a love life there was no way she would be able to simulate lovemaking as a man but she would be living a life no less chaste than she was now it was no great sacrifice to give up something she wasnt enjoying in the first place and in its place she would get that access to power she craved and the respect of those to whom she could display her full and unfettered intelligence oh yes definitely desirable was it possible she turned unseeing and sat down on the fainting couch at the window to think there was a moment when she collected her ghostly servants that the body was still alive but soulless the cold kept it preserved at that moment if while the body was still in that state she could transfer her own self to it no one had ever done such a thing as far as she knew no one had ever tried but she felt herself trembling with excitement at the very idea that it could be done at all she should not try this herself not yet she should try it with two of the children none of her existing spirit servants no they were too useful and she needed most of them where they were but perhaps if she could find two children very much alike so that they themselves would not be aware that the bodies had been switched she could test it out without risking anything because she should try a switch first before trying a substitution then if a switch worked she could try disposing of the first spirit before inserting the second it would probably be useful if she could find a child with a fierce will to live unlike her usual recruits whose hold on life was already tenuous yes and then when she was certain she had the method honed and refined she could even picture it in her minds eye inviting david to a late supper wine and brandy and perhaps a dose of opiates sending him up to bedthen slipping into the room when he was too deeply asleep to feel the cold opening the window and calling the wurms just to be sure that it was cold enough the real trick would be to warm up the body quickly enough after she inhabited it if she did not she would die that would require some physical means tricky tricky perhapsyes the timing would be crucial but she could do all this just before the maid was to enter the room to awaken her guest and ask how he wanted his breakfast the maid would find the cold room and the cold bodybut still breathingand summon help only later would they find cordelias shell yes indeed tricky but it could be done yes that would be a good plan further made valuable by having witnesses that nothing worse than a mania for cold fresh air had killed cordelia herself and imperiled david and then there would be no more troubles over controlling david she would be david she could rewrite her will leaving everything she owned to david as well so that when her old body was found she would lose nothing of what she had gained and then when age caught up with the david body she could find another protégé to school and repeat the plan perhaps a girl this time perhaps by that point it would be possible for a woman to wield power in her own right but if notlook far enough and she could find a naïve young male fire magician probably among the disadvantaged hopefully without the inconvenient burden of parents with whom she could repeat the process why not childless men took on protégés all the time if anything people would think how wise she was to have done so the estate would have to go to some collateral line of course but the bulk of the money and material goods that were unencumbered could go to anyone herself of course she would be immortal she would have all the benefits of age and none of the drawbacks davids powers were different instead of the weak power of air behind the power of ice she would have the immense strength of fire if it worked and that was the first step she must find out if it could work then perfect the procedure until it was faultless and this would be all the more reason to find those children and eliminate them david knew about them now and knew what they could do if she made him into a wandering spirit he would certainly go straight to them to expose her there was a great deal of work ahead of her fortunately she had never been afraid of work fortunate for her at least sarah had an unfinished daisy wreath in her lap but she wasnt working on it nan whose talents did not run to making wreaths and flower chains had been splitting grass stems into strings and by now had more strings than sarah could ever possibly need nevertheless she kept splitting because it was a way to help her concentrate she and sarah were having a discussion and sarah was winning i think we should try it said sarah her normally sweet face was set in an expression that memsab would probably call mulish ever since they had helped to determine that the old well had been haunted by nothing more sinister than bad memories sarah had wanted to investigate the bridge which had given off the same sort of unpleasant aura nan was not so sure this was a good idea and the oddest thing was this was a complete reversal of their normal roles usually it was sarah who was the cautious one then again it hadnt been sarah who had been the one to experience those old memories either maybe that was what was making the difference this time an i dont get too sympathetic bout her havin ghosts move in it was no use turning to the birds for advice either both grey and neville had responded with the mental equivalent of a helpless shrug nan got the feeling that neither of them felt as if they had enough information to give a good answer like nan they didnt like the idea but they had no good reason to oppose it still on the other hand nan was also tempted it felt as if this was something she ought to be doing they were only going to investigate if there was anyone or anything bound to earth there surely memsab and sahib ought to know about it and if there wasnt then the nasty feelings ought to be cleaned up and memsab and agansing ought to know about it nasty feelings could affect people that were sensitive to them and might cause a mischief there was a third aspect to this which was that somewhere deep inside her nan felt as if there was a grownup person chafing to be out and doing things she couldnt explain this feeling but it was definitely there and growing stronger all the time she had to wonder if sarah wasnt feeling the same maybe that was why sarah was so adamant about doing this what can it hurt to just go and look sarah asked at last we went and looked before and nothing happened we wont do anything just look i want to fix it ourselves if we can but not this time nan grimaced but she had to think that sarah was right no touching the bridge and reading it then she asked cautiously sarah shook her head no just going there and getting the feeling of things without touching anything maybe we can take care of this by ourselves and maybe not but we wont know until we look it over nan sighed she had been losing this battle since it began and there was no point in pretending otherwise she might just as well give in now as later all right she said shrugging we can go and look but nawt more to her credit sarah did not lord it over her friend as some might have then lets go now today she urged before anyone thinks we might and tells us not to nan raised her eyebrow at that sarah meant memsab of course there was no one else they had told about the bridge and sarah was sounding just a touch rebellious that was a change sarah rebellious im tired of waiting for things to happen to us sarah added unexpectedly i dont see any reason why we have to sit here and wait for trouble to find us when we can go scout it the way a hunter would and know whats coming before it gets here nan blinked put that wayshe brushed the grass stems off her skirt and stood up lets go she said decisively memsab aint convinced more trouble aint comin an i dont know as buildin up igh walls and sittin behind em is such a good notion now neville finally roused from his own indecision and quorked enthusiastically grey just sighed but she didnt seem inclined to want to stop them so nan took that as tacit assent she followed neville as the raven flew ahead in their usual pattern of going to a tree within calling distance waiting for the girls to catch up and going on to another tree it didnt take them nearly as long to get to the bridge as it had the first time they had wandered out that farbut the first time they had been doing just that wandering with no set purpose and no real hurry to get anywhere as they approached the structure it seemed to nan that the uneasy feelings began at a point much further away than the first time was it like this this far away before sarah asked in an uneasy echo of nans own thoughts nan shook her head dunno she replied dubiously could be cause were expectin it this time could be cause we know whatt look for could be misrememberin they stood on the road in the shade of a giant oak tree and regarded the bridge carefully when you shut off those bad feelings there was nothing about the bridge to give anyone cause for alarm it was a perfectly ordinary structure made of yellowish stone arcing over the river it had three low stone arches and ended in four squat square pillars two on either side of the span the river was smooth and quiet flowing by lazily there were no sinister shadows in the bright sunlight shining down on it but when you let yourself open to those feelings it seemed as if there ought to be sinister shadows everywhere and dark forms lurking behind the pillars now even sarah began to look dubious and uneasy as if she had just decided this had been a bad idea but wasnt going to say so nan on the other hand was now determined to get to the bottom of all of this never mind that shed been against it before now she wanted to know just what it was that was at the root of all this im gettin closer she said shortly and whistled for neville to come to her he landed on her outstretched arm and jumped to her shoulder she kept her eyes wide open and pictured herself peering cautiously through a hole in a wall as she approached the bridge one slow step at a time it was at the third step that she began to make something out it wasnt just memories there was something there the feelings came first with the sense of a presence it wasnt like the horrible thing in berkeley square thoughthis was hunger a great void of need and of loneliness but not anything that nan would have called healthy the closest she could come was to those few times when her mother had gotten maudlin drunk and had hugged her too tight and cried about what an awful mum she was when all the time she wasnt so sorry that she wouldnt go right out and spend supper money on gin as soon as she sobered up and this was to that experience as the sun was to a candle another step and nan saw what it was or saw something anyway womanshaped and shadowy draped in veils and a vast pit of greed and despair so deep that nan knew if you fell into it youd never get out again and she had something she had a little girl not a living little girl but another shadow shape like a sketch made in white mist a little ghost girl the shadow woman held the girl ghost who struggled soundlessly against the shadow arms that held her eyes wide open in panic mouth open too and no sound emerging though it looked as if she was shrieking in terror the shadow woman horribly was crooning a lullaby to the ghost girl and even as nan watched the ghost girl began to fade into the shadow woman it looked as if the shadow woman was devouring it or absorbing it and the ghost girl grew limp and stopped struggling a moment later no nan shouted she reached down blindly for a stick and came up with a sword in her hand as she brandished it she saw that sarah had come to stand beside her with both hands raised over her head white light coming from them neville had flown down to land on the ground between the girls and the shadow and grey grown to four times her natural size was beside him feathers fluffed and growling the white light from sarahs hands lanced out not to touch the shadow woman but the ghost girl the fading outlines of the ghost girl strengthened and she renewed her struggles you let er go nan shouted again flourishing the sword she aint yours you let er go right now the shadow woman who had until this moment ignored the girls now turned her attention on them eyes like coals burned in the midst of her veils and a terrible wail burst from her a sound that brought with it fear and anguish that battered against nan until she could hardly stand sarah did drop to the ground and the light from her hands went outbut when the wailing stopped she struggled to her feet again and held her hands above her head and the light once again shone from them still holding the struggling girl ghost the shadow woman took one menacing step toward them freeing one hand she made a casting gesture and nan felt as if there was a hand seizing her throat choking the life from her neville and grey shrieked with anger and flew at the shadow woman but could not touch her while nan tried to shout and could get nothing out she dropped the swordbranch and clawed at the invisible intangible hand as her lungs burned and she tried to get a breath her vision began to gray out not so fast my unfriend my shadow wraith cried a fierce young voice that brought with it sun and a rush of flowerscented summer windand blessedly the release of whatever it was that had hold of nans throat she dropped to her knees gasping for breath at the same time that she looked to her right there standing between her and sarah was robin goodfellow he wore the same outlandish costume hed worn for the play only on him it didnt look so outlandish he had one hand on sarahs shoulder and nan could actually see the strength flowing from him to her as she fed the ghost girl with that light which now was bright as strong sunlight the ghost girl thrashed wildly and broke free of the shadow womans hold and that was when robin made a casting motion of his own and threw something at the shadow form it looked like a spiderweb mostly insubstantial and sparkling with dew drops but it expanded as it flew toward the shadow woman and when it struck her it enveloped her altogether she crumpled as it hit as if it had been spun out of lead not spider silk and collapsed into a pool of shadow beneath its sparkling strands the ghost girl stood where she was trembling staring at them shes stuck sarah said her voice shaky but sounding otherwise normal grey waddled over to the ghost girl looked up at her and shook herself all over neville returned to nans shoulder feathers bristling as he stared at the shadow woman trapped in pucks net she doesnt know where to go or how to get there or even why she should go sarah continued pity now creeping into her voice oh so puck took a step or two toward the ghost girl peering at her as if he could read something on her terrified young face welladay and this is one who can see further into a millstone than most no wonder she dont know where to go hell cant take her and heaven wont have her but theres a place for you my mortal child his voice had turned pitying and welcoming all at the same time and so kindly that even nan felt herself melting a little inside just to hear it he held out his hand to the ghost girl come away human child or whats left of you come take a step to me just one to show you trust your dreams and want to find them shaking so much her vague outlines blurred the ghost girl drifted the equivalent of a step toward robin he laughed nan had never heard a sound quite like it before most people shed ever heard when they laughed had something else in their laughter pity scorn irony selfdeprecation ruefulnessmost adults anyway always had something besides amusement in their voices when they laughed this was just a laugh with nothing in it but pure joy even the ghost girl brightened at the sound of it and drifted forward againand robin made a little circle gesture with his free hand something glowing opened up between him and the ghost girl nan couldnt see what it was other than a kind of glowing doorway but the ghost girls face was transformed all in an instant she lost that pinched despairing look her eyes shone with joyful surprise and her mouth turned up in a silent smile of bliss there you be my little lady robin said softly what youve dreamed all your life and death about what you saw only dimly before summerland my wee little dear summerland waiting for you go on through honey sweetling go on through the ghost girl darted forward like a kingfisher diving for a minnow a flash and she was into the glowand gone and the glow went with her now robin turned his attention to the shadow woman lying motionless under his spiderweb net heaven wont have you neither and youre not fit for summerland he said sternly nor am i the one to call hell to come and take you but youre too much mischief in the world my lady and i cant leave you free neville suddenly made a sound nan had never heard him make before something like a quork and something like a caw it made puck glance at him and nod right you are morrigans bird he replied thats all shes fit for its the hunt for her and well rid of her this middle earth will be he turned to nan and sarah close your eyes young mortals he said with such an inflection that nan could not have disobeyed him if shed wanted to these things are not for the gaze of so young as you she kept her eyes open just long enough to see him take a cow horn bound in silver with a silver mouthpiece from his belt the sort of thing she saw in books about robin hood and put it to his lips her eyes closed and glued themselves shut as three mellow notes sounded in the sultry air suddenly that sultry air grew cold and dank she shivered and neville pressed himself into her neck reassuringly his warm body radiating the confidence that the air was sapping away from her all the birds stopped singing and even the sound of the river nearby faded away as if she had been taken a mile away from it she heard hoofbeats in the distance and hounds baying shed never heard nor seen a foxhunt though shed read about them since coming to the school and it was one of those things even a street urchin knew about vaguely this however did not sound like a foxhunt the hounds had deep deep voices that made her shiver and made her feel even less inclined to open her eyes if that was possible there were a lot of houndsand a lot of horses tooand they were coming nearer by the moment she reached out blindly and caught sarahs hand and they clung to each other as the hounds and horses thundered down practically on top of themas the riders neared she heard them laughing and if pucks laugh was all joy this laughter was more sorrowful than weeping it made her want to huddle on the ground and hope that no one noticed her the shadow woman shrieked then dogs and riders were all around them except that other than the sounds there was nothing physically there feelings thoughnan was so struck through with fear that she couldnt have moved if her life depended on it only sarahs hand in hers and nevilles warm presence on her shoulder kept her from screaming in terror and it was cold it was colder than the coldest night on the streets of london so cold that nan couldnt even shiver hoofbeats milling around them the dogs baying hollowly the riders laughingthen the shadow woman stopped shrieking and somehow her silence was worst of all one of the riders shouted something in a language that nan didnt recognize robin answered him and the rider laughed this time not a laugh full of pain but full of eager gloating she felt neville spread his wings over her and there was a terrible cry of despair and then it all was gone the birds sang again warmth returned to the day the scent of newmown grass and flowers and the river filled her nostrils and neville shook himself and quorked you can open your eyes now children said robin nan did neville hopped down off her shoulder and stood on the ground looking up at robin there was nothing out of the ordinary now in the scene before them no matter how hard nan looked no shadow woman no ghost girl no dark emotions haunting the bridge just a normal stone bridge over a pretty little english river in the countryside even robin was ordinary again his fantastical garb was gone and he could have been any other country boy except for the single strand of tiny vine leaves wound through his curly brown hair what sarah began looking at puck with a peculiarly stern expression that was the wild hunt and youd do well to stay clear of it and what it hunts little seeker robin said without a smile it answers to me because i am oldest but there isnt much it will answer to not much it will stop for not too many ways to escape it when it has your scent and theres no pity in the huntsman he decides what theyll hunt and no other what does it hunt nan asked at the same time that sarah asked what is it robin shrugged run and find out for yourself what it is young sarah and go and look to see what it hunts on your own young nan theres mortal libraries full of books that can tell youin part the rest you can only feel and if your head doesnt know your heart can tell you well nan replied stubbornly determined to get some sort of answer out of him what was that thing at the bridge then and i need to tell you what you already know robin shook his head you work it out between you shes not been here long i will tell you and i should have dealt with her when she first appeared but he scratched his head and grinned one of those daybrightening grins but there was birds to gossip with and calves to tease and goats to ride and i just forgot nan snorted at the evasive answer but sarah smiled you never will answer anyone straight up will you she asked with a sidelong glance its not my way missy sahib puck replied and tickled her under the chin with a buttercup that suddenly appeared in his hand now go you back and not a word of this to your schooling dame just your bad luck that two things came together and you as the third made some things happen that might not have otherwise that was bad for you but good for the little mite then came your good luck that it all made a mighty big stirup of the world and that got my attention and me knowing you that called me an hour one way or the other and this would never have happened the shadow would have claimed the mite and no doubt of it nan could well believe that and she also had no intention of telling memsab about it but she was going to find out what that shadow lady had been and why she was at the bridge no one had missed them by the time they got back and evidently there was no sign of their misadventure clinging to them either nan and sarah stood in the garden doorway for a moment assessing the mood in the manor and exchanged a look think im gonna talk to th kitchen maids nan said thoughtfully if theres gossip about theyll know it im going to see if robin was right about the hunt being in books was sarahs answer there are a lot of oddish things in the library here with a nod they separated and nan ensconced herself first in the kitchen on the excuse of begging toast and jam and milk then in the laundry then in the dairy as the two dairymaids finished churning the butter out of the second milking and turned the cheeses as they ripened by that time the bell had rung for dinner and it was too late to talk to sarah about what shed found out she could tell that sarah was bursting with news though and so was she the news had to wait after dinner came the nightly chore memsab had set nan to doing helping put the littlest ones to bed and sarah went to help tommy catch fireflieshe had a scheme to put enough in a little wire cage hed made to read under the covers by but he couldnt get the wire bars close enough and they kept escaping much to the delight of the bats that flew in and out of their open windows at night that had been something that had shocked nan the first time it had happened the children from india were all used to it the same sort of thing happened in their indian bungalows all the time but nan hadnt ever even seen a bat before and the first time one had flitted in the open window and fluttered around she hadnt known what it was a lot of the maids hated them and shrieked when they were flying around a room pulling their caps down tight to their heads because bats allegedly would get tangled in your hair the bravest of them whacked at the poor little things with brooms and all of them kept their bedroom windows shut tight all night long but memsab told the children that sort of behavior was silly so they kept their own windows open to the night air the children all rather enjoyed the tiny creatures and eventually even nan got to liking the way they swooped around the room clearing it of insects then flitting out the window again tonight the little ones were full of mischief and each had to be put to bed half a dozen times before they actually stayed in bed weary but relieved nan trudged up the stairs to the room she and sarah shared to find sarah neville and grey already waiting for her nan changed into her nightgown and hopped up to sit crosslegged on her own little bed and looked at her friend expectantly sarah laughed you first she said nan coughed because a great deal of what she had heard was not the sort of thing that you told a nice girl like sarah country folk were earthy sorts and they had no compunction about calling a spade a spade and not an earthturning implement the maids had certainly filled nans ears particularly when the cook was out of earshot there was a gal down to the village that put on a lot of airs she said heavily editing out a great deal the whole truth was that this particular young lady was a lot like becky sharpe in vanity fair she wanted a husband with money who would let her buy whatever pleased her if she could get one she wanted a husband with a title too and she was perfectly willing to use any and every means at her disposal to get it she set her cap at this feller this captain what showed up here at one of them hunting parties nan continued friend of a friend the maids said not someun the master invited himself man didnt make himself real popular i guess he broke a lot of shooting rules right from the start the maids had been vague on that score they didnt understand the shooting rules either what they hadnt been vague about was that the shooting parties started forming up and leaving without the captain as the guests tacitly organized themselves to be off when he was busy doing something else part of that something else had been to flirt with the ladies and the maids had no doubt that if hed had his way there would have been more than just flirting going on there werent no single ladies at this party an when he made himself unwelcome hed take himself down to the pub in the village sometimes an thats where this gal saw him and decided she was gonna get him and she hadnt scrupled as to means either according to the maids she had brazenly hopped into bed with him practically from the time he first appeared so shes canoodling with this feller an wouldnt you know next thing hes caught cheatin at cards up here at the party theres a big todo an he disappears in the morning an his friend dont feel too comfortable here neither so he leaves early too that same afternoon gal at village dont find out about this till theyve both been gone two days according to the maids there had been a right row about that too complete with the abandoned girl in question storming up to highleigh demanding to see the master claiming the captain had promised to marry her and insisting that the master of highleigh make it all right except of course she never saw the master the butler handled it all with an icy calm that intimidated even the girl he had made it clear to her that the man in questionno gentleman young person i assure youwas neither a friend nor even a casual acquaintance of the master and that the master had no idea where the cad was or even if he had a right to the name and title he had claimed she got sent away with a flea in her ear the dairymaid had said maliciously nan had a feeling there had been some bad blood there so come christmas seems the gal has another problem an by spring shes got a baby an no husband the maids had been full of stories of how the girl had tried to seduce her way to a marriage license with anyone at that point but of course everyone in the village knew by that time that she had a big belly and nothing to show for it and not even the stupidest farmhand wanted himself saddled with a child that wasnt his and a wife that wasnt inclined to do a bit more work than she had to she had the baby and though her family didnt disown her they made it clear that she was a living shame to all of them and really ought to show her repentance in quite tangible ways she hadnt cared for being a housemaid she hadnt cared for the fact that the baby was the living badge of her disgrace not to mention a burden of care that no one would help her with so the baby disappears an everyone figgers she took it to th norphanage or the workhouse and left it there an she gets to tryin to find herself a husband again but she didnt take it to the orphanage did she sarah asked somberly nan shook her head no cause after some whiles she was actin pretty peculiar like shes got somethin weighin on er an kept comin back to the river at the bridge shed come there in dead of night an just stand there starin at the water pretty soon shes actin real strange askin if people can hear a baby cryin an then before christmas she drownded herself so they reckon she drownded it in the same place she done herself poor mite real strange was a gross understatement shed been caught once or twice trying to take babies out of cradles when the mothers in question stepped out of their cottages for a moment she had covered herself in a set of tatty headtotoe black veils she found somewhere and she had all but haunted the bridge everyone knew by then that she had murdered her own child but without a body or a confession it was hard to do anything about her there was some tentative movement by the village officials to get her sent to an insane asylum but before anything could be done she had already killed herself sarah shivered all over and her eyes got a little teary poor baby she said finally what a nasty wicked woman but it does pretty much account for what we saw nan replied she felt obscurely sorry for the babybut in her part of london so many babies died all the time that it was hard to get all worked up about one even the ones that were wanted died so easily that a mother was likely to bury four for every one she was able to raise so your turn sarah nodded and her sorrowful expression cleared theres more than one version of the wild hunt sarah replied licking her lips thoughtfully i looked through a lot of books and robin was right there were several in the library here that talked about legends and magic and things like that had you noticed there are a lot of odd books in that library nan scratched her head well she said finally after a moment of consideration the feller what owns this house is somebody memsab kind of knows i dont reckon hes one of her toff friends from before she went to indja you know mebbe hes like one of us and mebbe that sort of thing runs in the family so the libraryd be full of that kind of books sarah nodded i think youre right in fact you know i thought it was a bit odd that a house this old wouldnt have a ghost but maybe it doesnt because the family that lives here has always made sure that ghosts moved on nan nodded and hugged her knees to her chest i reckon youre right so you found some books whatd they say well one says that the wild hunt islike robins people she lowered her voice to whisper as if she didnt like to say the words too loudly elves the fair folk it says they come out of barrows at night to hunt the mortals that drove them out of their circles and groves that one made it sound like these were bad elves though and that they hunted people down at night for the fun of it nan mulled that one over i dont see how that can be right she said judiciously cause they took that ghost but robin did call em so mebbe it is another couple of books said it was made up of ghosts people who had lived violent lives and died violent deaths sarah unconsciously pulled her covers a little closer around her and some of those books say that theyre trying to make up for what they did by going after bad people like they are getting a second chance to keep from going to the bad place she meant hell nan knew though she couldnt imagine why sarah wouldnt just come out and say the word but some other books say that theyre wicked people who are keeping themselves from going to the bad place by hunting down people and scaring them to death or chasing them until they die and some say they are already from the bad place and it opens up to let them out sarah shook her head i just dont know because none of those seemed quite right nan sucked on her lower lip dont seem quite right to me neither she said at last like somethin is missing well the last book i found said that they werent any of those things it said they were gods now sarahs eyes were bright with excitement it said the leader was a very old god the horned god of the hunt from back before the romans came and that being hunted used to be the way they chose their kings and the way they punished criminals so when he wasnt being worshipped anymore or making kings he just went on punishing criminals by hunting them when he could the things that ride with him are the souls of those that the hunt caught nan felt a sudden conviction that this was exactly the answer they had been looking for though she could not have pointed to anything but feelings well robin said he was the oldest old one so it stands to reason he could call em she said thinking out loud an he said that he couldnt call hell to take that ghost an heaven wouldnt have er an she couldnt go to that place e sent the little girl but i reckon riding with that hunt could be as bad as hell sarah nodded soberly her eyes gone very large and solemn if the book is right she said it could be worse because you get to see the living world but you cant do any of the things you want to do youre just stuck riding whenever the hunter feels like taking the hunt out so what happens to you the rest of the time the book didnt say except that it called them tormented souls maybe just being able to see and be in the world you used to live in and never be able to touch it again is bad enough sarah shook her head it also said the worst of them get turned into the hounds which would probably be horrible nan thought about how the hounds had sounded and shivered i think she said aloud whatever happened to that ghost shes gettin whats comin to er now sarah took a long shuddering breath im glad robin made us close our eyes she said finally some of the books say that just the sight of the hunt and the huntsman is enough to drive you mad some say thats not true but that the hunt is horrible to look at and is sure to frighten you to where your hair turns white im glad robin kept us from looking reckon hed ave let memsab watch nan said judiciously but i reckon he figgered were too young then i want to be too young for a long long time sarah said firmly and got a bow from neville and a soft yes from grey and nan could not possibly have agreed more the first experiments had been a success difficult as it had been to achieve the proper depth of cold to hold the bodies in suspension cordelia had succeeded in exchanging the souls of two children she had acquired them from an orphanage where they had been two of the scant ten percent that survived infancy and emerged into childhood that had been an interesting visit in and of itself she had never considered orphanages as a source of her little servants but since she intended to let these two actually live so that she could continue to switch their souls from time to time she had decided to create the persona of a fictional housekeeper looking for two little boys to serve as errand runners usually it was factories that came recruiting to the orphanagesvery few couples were actually interested in adopting these waifs after all who would want a child whose mother was probably a whore or if not was without a doubt fallen from virtue such a child would have her bad blood and possibly the equally bad blood of some drunken laborer or goodfornothing sailor orworst of alla foreigner no one ever considered of course that the fathers of such abandoned children might be their friends their neighbors or the sons of the welltodo not of course that it mattered the director of the place had trotted out the best he had to offer and she had taken two little boys about eight years old but small and looking five at most with thin halfstarved faces and dull incurious expressions in height and weight they were virtually identical the main difference between them seemed to be that one hummed breathlessly and tunelessly to himself constantly and the other did not they were not very intelligent and altogether incurious this too was probably the result of being starved all of their lives this was not what the director would have had her believe but cordelia knew better both from scrying on these places from afar in preparation for selecting one and from the stories children who had run from the orphanages into the street had told her food was scant and poor generally as little as the directors of the places could get by with cordelia suspected that they were pocketing the difference between what they were allotted to feed each child and what they actually used to feed each child meat was practically unheard of the staple diet was oatmeal porridge thin vegetable soup and bread infants were weaned onto this as soon as possible the infants in orphanages were generally wrapped tightly in swaddling clothes and laid out on cots as many as would fit on each cot so that they looked like tinned sardines in this orphanage they were lucky their smallclothes were changed twice a day in many other places once a day was the rule they were fed skimmed milk or the buttermilk left after butter had been churned out of it this was cheaper much cheaper than whole milk they didnt cry much crying took energy and these infants did not have a great deal of that to spare it didnt take very much to kill them either a bit of the croup a touch of fever being too near an open windownine out of every ten died and were unceremoniously buried without markers in potters fields they had entered the world noisily they generally left it silently slipping out of it with a sigh or a final gasp older children fared little better though by the time they reached the age of three or four all but the strongest had been winnowed out and orphanages would have made fertile ground for cordelia to hunt for ghostly servants without ever having to kill the children herself except that these children were either wild creatures or so utterly passive that they made peggoty look lively by comparison however with a bit of feeding perhaps the passive ones could be enlivened to the point of becoming useful it would be interesting to experiment with these two she had been told their names were robert and albert virtually every other boy child in an orphanage was named albert in homage to the late prince of wales presumably this was in an effort to get the children into someone elses hands by appealing to their patriotism or sentimentality well as of this morning robert who was the one that hummed was silent and albert who had been the silent one was humming proof enough that the transfer had been successful she decided that she would wait to see which of the two developed the stronger personality over the next few days with proper feeding and access to some secondhand toys and worn picture books she had indifferently purchased from a fleamarket stall toys were supposed to be educational and she didnt want to be bothered with actually sending them to school that would be the one she would use in the second experiment to displace the spirit of the other the displaced ghost she would make into her servant if it looked as if there was anything there worth the saving the other she would feed for a while longer to see how he turned out orphanages might well prove to be an additional source of servants when her own efforts on the streets dried up provided of course she could keep people from noticing that all of the children she took to work for her died the problem with using orphanages as a recruiting ground was that the people who ran them were generally busybody nosyparkering sorts well she would deal with that difficulty later for the moment her experiment was going well and she might not even need any more ghostly recruits if she could act in her own person as a man david was deep in the countryside at the moment this was annoying because she could not keep her eyes directly on himbut it was also something of a relief because she was free to do whatever she chose without having to have him under her supervision and the cause was good a weekendwhich really meant a week or morehouse party at the estate of a very influential mp commons rather than lords but in this case that was all to the good it was time for david to move a little out of his own social circle and into the circle that lived breathed and ate politics not that the man was crude it was his grandfather who had actually made the money his father had undertaken the more genteel path of investing it prudently and skillfully the son was a solicitor with the specialty of estate management and never saw the inside of a courtroom actually he seldom saw the inside of his law offices he had lesser solicitors and an army of clerks to do most of the work for him the sole reason for becoming a solicitor both in his and his fathers minds was so he could go into politics the taint of money having become cleansed and purified by contact with the law so david was there this weekend under the great mans prudentlyextended wing this would be a purely social occasion the selected male guests would be examining him for any potential flaws such as a weakness for dabbling in art or poetry or a tendency to drink too much in publicor a tooflamboyant manner when drinking the female guests would be probing his suitability as a husbandnot that any of them would have a chance at him left to himself he would marry in due course but only within the ranks of the elemental masters or at least that was probably what he would do though there were the odd marriages outside those ranks it would make things difficult for him of course unless his wife was the sort to wish to play lady of the manor in the country while he attended to his business in the city and his position as the chief of his masters circlecordelia blinked at that thought her attention distracted from assessing the two boys as they ate graves she told the maid assigned to care for them give them the toys when they have finished and at luncheon see to it that they not be allowed the jam and cakes until after they have finished the nourishing meal cook will make for them the girl bobbed a curtsy yesm she said deferentially she had been an underhousemaid chosen by cook because she professed to have looked after her younger siblings until going into service she seemed competent she would scarcely have done as a nanny of course had these been anything other than what they werepale passive little specimens unlikely to give trouble but she was certainly up to watching them seeing that they were kept clean and neat and teaching them how to play with the toys they had been provided with cordelia retired to her parlor but to think not to conduct business or attend to social obligations the masters circle how could she possibly have forgotten that it was davids obsession and if he suddenly lost interest in it his friends among the elemental masters would certainly take note and begin to wonder but at the same time if cordelia were to continue to preside over it there would be very little time before she was unmasked the masters often performed socalled out of body work the moment she entered into such a work in the presence of others it would be very clear who she was you could not mask the soul self or could you was it possible to disguise the persona that your spirit assumed when out of body if it wasit would take time to learn if it wasnt she had better find out now another delay it seemed that every time she found a solution to the problems that beset her path yet another problem arose it made her furious and that was bad she had to control her anger to make it icy rather than fiery or it would make problems for her but it was difficult not to be angry first that wretched child medium had come to englandthe one person who could uncover the ghost servants and at that thought she mentally cursed the childsomewhere in the countrywas potentially within her grasp if only she could be found she had started the hunt days agoso where was peggoty surely the wretched little girl wasnt that difficult to locate there were only so many places near enough to london that it was possible for harton to travel there and back on the weekend peggoty must have gotten distracted or gone off into one of her dreams again it would be the first time she had done so while engaged in a task for cordelia but like many spirits the child was becoming more detached from the world as time went on that was a flaw she had to constantly battle against and was one of the reasons why she had to keep making more servants well it was time to reattach her and throw a good fright into her as well cordelia retired to her workroom pausing in the closet that led into it to take three strands of hair from a tiny drawer one of fifty in a handsome little cabinet meant to hold pills each drawer was marked with a name card only twenty were filled in each drawer held hair clipped from the living head of the child in question before it had lain down for its last sleep she locked the door of the workroom behind her and placed the hairs on the table in front of her crystal throne sitting down on her throne and raising her hands she called three ice wurms to her a breath of cold mist drifted down over the table and three of the tiny exquisitely detailed creatures coalesced out of it like salamanders they were sleek lizards unlike salamanders they were nearly transparent and looked as if someone had animated a series of three sculptures carved from the purest quartz each of them went to the three hairs lying curled against the stone each inhaled one and sat there doing nothing cordelia stared at them in growing disbelief and outrage well she finally snapped go get her fetch her back here the ice wurm closest to her looked up at her with colorless transparent eyes she is not there to be fetched it said shortly what cordelia felt as if she had suddenly run up against an invisible barrier stunned and still in disbelief what do you mean she is not there she demanded with just a hint of uncertainty in her voice she is not there to be fetched not in this world the ice wurm curled itself indifferently on the table and its two brothers did likewise if she is in another we cannot tell for a moment cordelia contemplated the notion that the creature might be lying to her butno it had no reason to lie she had other means of verifying the truth and it knew very well she would mete out punishment if she thought she had been deceived so it wasnt lying peggoty was goneelsewhere the other world whatever thing that might be and there would be no fetching her back either despite the claims of socalled necromancers no one who had ever gone to the other side ever could be pulled back by mortal intervention the harton woman it had to have been her she was the only one with the power to send a spirit on who would also have had any contact with peggoty cordelia wanted at that moment to have the interfering cows throat in her own two hands still there was always the possibility however remote that it had not been the harton woman it might even have been the wretched children it was best to be sure who did this she demanded of the ice wurms knowing that they would be able to sniff out the least trace of whoever had last intersected with peggotys being but the answer brought a chill to her heart that nothing she had ever encountered before could match it is best that you do not know master came the cool sibilant voice and it is best that we not tell you the endless rounds of empty conversation alternating with the endless rounds of polite scrutiny finally got to be more than david alderscroft could bear perhaps it was the sultry days and the warm nights that made it so hard for him to keep a cool calm demeanor it seemed much more difficult here than in london and of course a little talk with cordelia always put things in perspective the trouble was it was her perspective the longer he was away from her the more impatient he became with some of her obstinate opinions another remedy to restlessness and unhappiness was in order a polite inquiry to his host gave him permission to make free of the contents of the stable his reputation as a good rider must have made its way even into these circles he did not consider himself to be so good a rider that he was willing to mount anything under a saddle however he consulted with the chief stable hand and soon found himself atop a steady if unexciting bay gelding unexciting was roughly what he wanted right now anyway he needed to be away from the watchful eyes the endless gibblegabble the tiresome matchmaking games time alone that was the ticket hed be able to think once he was alone he had studied the map so he knew where he was his hosts guests had permission not only to ride the grounds of this estate but the far more extensive lands of the neighbors highclere was it highleigh something like that the owner was away scarcely visited the place except in hunting season according to what hed been told that was good the last thing he wanted was to meet up with anyone with that in mind it seemed like the best solution if he wanted to avoid more of the guests from this party would be to ride over to the other property he would be harder to find that way the dividing line was a hedge that must have been centuries old and was far too tall to jump he rode along it until he came to a gate in the hedge the latch was at the correct height for a rider he rode alongside it opened the gate without thinking and sent his horse through it and his horse suddenly shied violently back just as a childish voice full of indignation piped ere pay eed to where youre agoin it took him a moment to get his horse under control when he finally did so it was to stare down into four sets of indignant eyes two sets of bright beady birds eyes and two sets changeable and human what are you doing there he exclaimed one of the two children for children they were stood up arms akimbo might ast you the same thing now mightnt i her accent branded her as a londoner and from the streets her bold manner however was all her own and the bird that perched on her shoulder was easily three times as bold as that the sight made him start that was a raven and if it cared to it could probably take his eye out little miss he said cautiously you know that neville is an uncommonly large rook the child said instantly and turned to the bird which ruffled his feathers and stared up at him as if daring him to deny what the child had claimed it quorked derisively at him proving it was no rook the girl put her hand up to scratch the nape of its neck he had once seen what one of those beaks could do to a bare hand when a ravenkeeper at the tower was a little too slow in feeding one of his charges the bird had nearly added the finger to the menu for its dinner that day the girl looked at him as if she could read his thoughts and her expression hinted at her amusement with him he felt himself getting angry and warned himself not to do anything nor say anything these were only silly children he gathered cold calm about himself and looked down on them the other child had a grey parrot on her shoulder the bird looked at him measuringly then without warning barked a laugh so full of contempt it could have come from a human throat it stung so much so that his next words were a challenge who are you he asked icily and what are you doing on this property were guests which is moren you can say the first girl snapped at him dont you fret we got permission to be here hev you nan the second girl hissed warningly the first turned to her and the two went into a whispered colloquy the ruder of the two kept looking suspiciously at him as if she expected him to mount his horse and ride them down he had never encountered children quite like these twowell truth be told he had never encountered a child quite like the one that kept glaring at him the other seemed tractable enough but this one he was accustomed to street children who at worst offered to sweep a crossing for him and if glared at skittered away this one challenged him outright and acted as if he was the one who was the intruder here part of him noted that she looked like a little london sparrow too with her brown hair and brown frock finally the whispers ceased and the rude one planted a fist on either hip and looked him up and down sarah sez i hev to call you sir even though you come through from the other side of thet door an i aint niver seed you ere so sir she somehow made the word a title of contempt we got permissiont be ere were astayin at th big ouse you got permissiont come ridin through thet door onto this land actually little girl he said carefully coating his words in ice i have by mutual agreement between the gentleman with whom i am staying and the master of these lands the guests of my host may ride here whenever they choose not that it is any business of yours his tone said though his words did not the little girl snorted awright then she replied ungraciously you kin go she and her little friend cleared off to one side he mounted but was no longer in any mood to ride instead he made a show of a brief canter in the meadow beyond the door in the hedge cleared the brook a time or two then trotted his horse back through the door shouting as he did so shut the door behind me and giving it the force of an order the little girl slammed the gate so hard the hinges rattled and it was only at that point that he reined the horse in and realized that those had been no ordinary children ordinary children did not have ravens and parrots perching on their shoulders and acting like playmates theyd had no hint of magic about them but in that flash of understanding he had no doubt that they had some sort of psychical gift the second girl hadnt spoken loud enough for him to hear her voice but the first girl had been a plain streetsparrow cockney and how did that come about davids host had said that the master of highleigh was an odd duck though he had given no details now david wondered if that was a simple description of eccentricity or if the man was part of one or more esoteric circles he could think of no other reason why a cockney child of dubious ancestry and obvious psychical gifts should be on that property there was one way to find out certainly he rode back to the house to ask his valet to make inquiries an hour later he was possessed of interestingand disturbingintelligence interesting because it seemed that the master of highleigh was also the owner of that dangerous property in berkeley square that his own masters circle had been forced to cleanse disturbing because the gentleman in question had turned over his home and land to the pupils and teachers of a school for the children of british expatriates for the summer now david knew of only one school likely to harbor psychically gifted children in london he knew of only one reasonguiltwhy a welltodo london gentleman would have allowed the masters and children of that school to make free of his property for the summer and he also knew that two childrentwo little girlsin that school were the keepers of pet birds the conclusion was inescapable isabelle harton was living just on the other side of that hedge along with her pupils all other considerations all other concerns vanished in the apprehension of that knowledge she was here she was if not alone without the oversight of her husband he could go and speak to her if he liked he could and in so doing he could make an utter and complete fool of himself or he might rid himself of the memories that continued to intrude on him no matter what he did a dozen times he made up his mind to go back down to the stable and ride over and be done with it a dozen times he reconsidered and in the end the silver chime of the first dinner bell warning guests that it was time to dress rendered it all moot he had been able to escape his obligations for the afternoon but he dared not shirk them further and to abandon his place at dinner with no good excuse would be a faux pas he would be months in living down he permitted his valet to enter and dress him for dinner in the stiff evening shirt formal black suit and tie that was considered necessary here even in the midst of summer the ladies of the party glittered in their jeweltone gowns of satin and lace ornamented since none of them could even be remotely considered ingénues anymore with small fortunes in gems and as he made polite conversation and worked his way through the extensive menu memories kept reintruding of those times that seemed a world and a lifetime removed now times when the dinner menu was restricted to simpler fare than caviar and quails eggs on toast roast pheasant and baked salmon and a dozen more courses before the end of it all times when no one dressed for dinner or if they did the young men wore lightcolored linen suits loose and casual and the young ladies in their muslins and flowers looked far happier than these prosperous dames in satins and rubies times when the afterdinner entertainment would be to gather around the piano or read aloud to each other or for engaged couples to stroll handinhand in the gardennot for the men to split off in one direction to smoke cigars drink brandy and talk into the night while the women went off again to their own parlor to do whatever it was they did while their husbands conversed about important business suddenly a feeling of intense dissatisfaction washed over him but oddly enough it was not a vision of isabelle that accompanied that emotion but the contemptuous eyes of the little street urchin he had seen this afternoon he knew instinctively what she would call him with her voice dripping with scorn a toff a guvnor a stuffed shirt someone who did nothing and consumed everything who deserved nothing and helped himself to everything who had never actually earned anything he had gotten in life he wanted to protest that he had in fact earned this place at the table this glittering company and the promise of power to come oh yes said those eyes in his memory glittering with their own malicious pleasure youve earned them right enough enjoying them well no he could hear her laughter and the ravens contemptuous and dismissive quork in fact in a kind of ghostly echo he heard them all night whispering under the important conversation a countermelody of disdain i feel sorry for him whoever he was sarah said as the two of them slipped into their nightdresses and turned down the bedclothes they had been discussing the pompous and selfimportant man who had nearly ridden them both down this afternoon nan was still of the opinion that he had no right and no invitation to ride the meadow of highleigh court that he had merely pretended to it she had not liked him not at all and neither had neville it wasnt just that he was an arrogant toff it was that there was something very cold something not right about him as if someone had taken away his heart and put a clod of frozen earth where it should have been hed nearly trampled both of them and not one word of apology no he was too busy showing two poor little girls how important a fellow he was never even asked if we was all right she grumbled to herself well i dont she replied climbing into bed not even a little bit hope that fancy nag of his throws him inter a mud puddle nan sarah replied but giggled better yet nan continued starting to grin inter a great big cowflop a fresh one still hot nan now sarah could not stop giggling and that set nan off too the thought of the fellow with his dignity in rags was just too much for her sense of humor and once she started laughing at him some of her anger at him cooled not that she was going to forgive him for almost trampling them and being rude but she wasnt quite as angry at him anymore so why dye feel sorry for im she asked as sarah blew out the candle and the soft warm darkness enveloped both of them becausebecause hes unhappy and he knows why but if he actually admits that hes unhappy and why hell have to admit that hes wrong and hes been wrong about everything sarah said softly as nan heard the first soft whirring of bat wings from up near the ceiling evthing nan said surprised thats a lot its his whole life sarah said solemnly he made a wrong turn and hes never going to get it right unless he gives up most of what hes done whatever sarah knew or had sensed that led her to that conclusion it hadnt been granted to nan still she didnt doubt her friend money nan asked not able to imagine anything in a grownups life that was more important than that not money but nan could almost hear sarah groping for the words i cant explain it but its all things he thinks are important and really arent its like hes throwing away real diamonds for great big pieces of glass huh nan considered this mustve been someun convinced im those chunks uv glass was wuth something its very sad because hes never going to be happy sarah whispered then sighed well he aint our problem nan replied resolutely he aint our problem and he aint gonna be he aint no ghost and he aint no bad thought no hes not sarah agreed sounding sad i wish i knew of a way i could help him though it kind of feels as if i ought to crickets outside sang through their silence and a moth flew in the window wings white in the moonlight why dye reckon yon robin heped us out ye think nan asked she figured by changing the subject she would be able to get sarah to talk about something other than that sodislikable man and she was right i think robin likes us sarah said at last after a long moment of silence im not sure why i think he likes memsab too i think yere right nan replied and sighed happily its a nice thing avin someun like that like ye i think he admires you nan sarah replied admiration in her own voice i know he thinks youre brave eh e thinks youre pretty brave too nan countered but couldnt help feeling a bit of pride at the thought i mean you stood right upt that shadow lady not many would ave they would if they knew it was the right thing to do came the soft reply out of the darkness nan thought about that as she drifted off to sleep sometimes it was hard being sarahs friendbecause she would say things like that things that part of nan knew werent really trueor at least that everything nan had ever learned in her short life told her werent true but then just as she had made up her mind another part would at least hope for the opposite for sarahs words and not nans feelings to be the right one so part of her wanted to contradict sarah while the other part wanted to encourage her eh whats it hurt to let her think it she finally decided as sleep took her shes a queer little duck and mebbe if she believes it long enough itll acchully happen someday a comforting thought and a good one to carry into the night crickets sang outside the window and a bat flew into the room patrolled for insects and flew out again isabelle harton relaxed in the embrace of her husbands arms while she was deeply enjoying this sojourn in what was the next thing to a castle with far more servants than she could ever dream of employing herself the pleasure was flawed by not having frederick with her for most of the time good gad i have missed you she said contentedly and yet with some sadness knowing that on sunday night he would once again take the train back to london she felt him smile in the darkness what a scandal he replied contradicting his own words by pulling her closer wives arent supposed to miss the carnal attentions of their husbands they are supposed to endure them for the sake of children she chuckled and what idiot told you that she responded not the master thats for certain he laughed something a wellmeaning clergyman told a young officer a very long time ago in an attempt to persuade the young officer that his pretty wife would be happier living in england he swore that women would rather on the whole be left alone by men and that she was merely being dutiful when she told him she didnt want to leave and what young officer was that she asked curiosity piqued he chuckled deep in his chest she felt the sound vibrate through him and smiled of all of the things she loved about him hearing him laugh was one of the best myself of course he said who else she arched an eyebrow though of course he would not be able to see it in the dark i was never pretty it was an old disagreement i thought you were and i think you are beautiful now since i am the one who looks at your face more often than you do i think i should be the one allowed to make the judgment the usual argument she wasnt going to win it she never did i wish the business would run itself she sighed she felt his hand stroking her hair and i wish the school would run itself or that you and i could build a little hut on the beach of a tropical island and raise goats like robinson crusoe but goatskins make dreadful gowns or so im told smelly anyway there were many things she could have talked to him about but none of them were as important as simply being here in his arms and luxuriating in the feeling that this was the best the only place in the world for her and that she would never have felt like this about anyone else this was the still center of the whirling universe where everything was at rest in its own way the jewel in the heart of the lotus the place where love was had been and always would be buddhists of course would argue that point preferring their way of detachment from the world but on the whole she preferred hers so she would not spoil the moment with anything other than things that would make him smile so she told him about tommys latest misadventure until the bed shook with their laughter cordelia wished there was a way to look at herself in a mirror it turned out that there was a way to turn the face of your soulself into something other than a reflection of the real world you shed had to search through some excruciatingly boring manuscripts to find it plowing with determination through things that ranged from absurd to outright duplicitous but she had found it she thought that she had done a creditable job given the cryptically worded instructions fortunately she had done enough outofbody work with david that she knew what his self looked like it would have been a dreadful mistake to have appeared in something other than the chainmail and surcoat he habitually wore in that semblance perhaps it would be a wise choice to gradually have him wear a helm as well that way she would have less chance of losing hold of the likeness of his face yes that would be a good idea it should be easy enough a little suggestion that if outofbody work was becoming hazardous a helm might be in order to remind the soulself to keep its defenses up it was a very good thing that what the avatar wore was often as variable as the personality within david the most conservative of mages had been known to vary the outfitting of his own avatar to suit the occasion now and again no one would wonder that he had assumed a helmet and he himself could implement the change without much thought so the next part of the experiment could proceed as planned to discover if one living soul could be used to push out another the child that was silent was a weaker personality than the one that hummed a dose of laudanum mixed with other drugs and a great deal of honey in its bedtime milk would ensure that its hold on its body was weaker still there was a distinct advantage in that the second childs spirit would be drawn more strongly to the body that rightfully belonged to it that would simulate her own will driving her to inhabit davids shell after watching the two children sharply for an hour or so she was satisfied that she had set up the best possible conditions it did appear that the child about to be unhoused was another of the peggoty sort however unlike the other which was at least learning to play with toys in the manner of a normal child the boy just sat there staring vaguely at whatever object his nursemaid put in his hands now and again turning it over and over and studying it but otherwise showing no signs of real interest in it and it was getting fat in a pale and puffy sort of way from inactivity clearly only the scant rations at the orphanage had kept it so slender useless in every way best she get rid of it now as one would dispose of an unwanted puppy but she also wanted to eliminate every thought of suspicion so she went in and exclaimed about the childs lassitude to the nursemaid yesm the little nursemaid agreed bobbing a curtsy he dont look right and thats a fact mum but he being a foundling and all they sometimes are sickly as if your brothers and sisters werent cordelia thought with amusement knowing as the maid did not know that her mistress knew everything of note about her family including her mothers three miscarriages and five dead children one in every two poor children died in infancy and it was just too bad that cordelia didnt have a way to harvest or use those spirits ah well perhaps the answer lay in her researches now she had more than one lifetime to look into it and she no longer felt quite such a sense of urgency but for a show of concern she sent for the apothecarynot the doctor that would have been an excesswho shook his head and opined that he did not know of too many orphanage children able to thrive even in the best of situations bad blood my lady he pontificated mothers and fathers both usually addicted to gin opium hashishbad blood there and no mistake sometimes its just as well that they dont thrive she nodded and the nursemaid nodded as he prescribed a tonic a bottle of which he produced with such readiness that she knew he had brought it here on purpose to sell it to her as was appropriate however he did not offer it to her nor did he name a price he gave it to the nursemaid who thanked him a bill would be forthcoming of course and the housekeeper would deal with it there the stage was set for tonight when the apothecary had left she waited for the nursemaid to take the boys off to their bath and confiscated the tonic which might be good or ill might even be the same ingredients as her own potion only weaker but did not suit her purposes she poured the contents down a drain and substituted her own mixture the strength of what she poured in there would have put a grown man to sleep much less a small child then she waited she had been forced to make do now that it was summer and she could not expect an iceladen wind to do her work for her replacing the cold of winter with drugs and powerful magic instead of arranging for the window to be opened when the nursemaid was safely asleep thanks to a heavy dose of laudanum in her tea she made her way quietly into the nursery where the two boys lay on their cots with her arms outstretched and hands cupped upward she silently mouthed the words of invocation and felt power drain from her in response a chill white mist formed slowly over the two cots and settled over the two boys this was called the breath of the snow dragon and was the opposite side of the breath of the dragon invocation used by fire mages that brought a furnace heat this summoned the wind off the glaciers itself when she was satisfied that both boys were chilled to the bone and to all intents and purposes very near death she closed her eyes and reached with spirit hands toward the strong ones body the spirit already drifted a little above it now she had to detach it altogether the incantation she used was one that would have made any good and decent elemental mage cover his ears in horror she had found it in an ancient book that allegedly contained spells dating from the time of atlantis whether that was the truth or not this was the only one that actually accomplished what it was said to do the silver cord connecting soul with body shattered she snatched up the spirit and shoved it toward the second boys body at the same time repeating her blasphemous words the first child was already trying to reestablish a connection with a physical body the end of the cord drifting about like the groping tentacle of a cephalopod as she had hoped because his spirit was the stronger of the two it made the connection with the body that had originally belonged to it before the second boy reanchored himself the soulself sank into the body as the displaced ghost drifted toward the empty husk but before it could reach its former home she had summoned a shield around it preventing it from entering and making it into one of her servants this was a bit of magic she had long been familiar with and had used innumerable times the glow of the shield surrounded the spirit and shrank forming a kind of skin then faded now it was hers it could neither move back into the vacant body nor go anywhere else the spirit was sealed to the earthly plane unless someone could be found to open a passage into the other side for it or until it willed one open for itself it looked very like peggoty had a graywhite sketch in the air of an androgynous child figure as it opened its hollow eyes to stare at her go and play she told it and it turned away from her and drifted off through the wall it would linger somewhere about just as peggoty had until she summoned it unlike peggoty it probably could be summoned by whatever means she chose without frightening it unduly and then she felt it the triumph the glee it had worked by heavens it had worked and she allowed herself the indulgence of a feral smile unconcerned now for its effects on her face the possibility of wrinkles or creases because very soon now it would not matter not at all not when she could discard this useless body like the outworn thing that it was for a fine new replacement a replacement that was in all senses superior in every way to the original david alderscroft could not sleep it had been a productive but profoundly boring day he knew that he should feel pleased about it but all he could manage was a weary and resigned sense that he had accomplished what he had come for although the eminent politicians here were unclear as to why he wanted a new minister appointed to the cabinet and exactly what the minister would be representing it was a virtual certainty that he would get to be that minister a minister of magical sciences although that of course was not what he would actually be called and no more than a handful of people would ever know that this was in fact the purview of the office it was more than time for such a ministry however more than time for the elemental masters to step forward and put their hands on the reins of government too much secrecy had been going on over the decades and at some point without the cooperation of the government that secrecy was going to fall apart he paced the length of the terrace in the darkness as he considered the nights work none of the men here tonight would ever know that this ministry of esoteric sciences was in fact about magic only the cabinet and the prime minister would be told this but revealing the knowledge at a high level virtually ensured that it would never be revealed at a lower level at this point in davids view such protection was absolutely vital there had been too many near misses already moments when he thought for certain some enterprising soul would uncover the elemental masters along with the proof to convince the skeptical and then what well in worstcase scenario there could be a kind of latterday witch hunt a crusade of the ordinary mortals against the extraordinary magicians among them people did not like the notion that there were those who by accident of breeding had some powers or abilities that could not otherwise be attained at bottom even the lowest of day laborers swilling his gin was certain that nothing separated him from a baron of industry except luck to discover that there were people who had abilities he could never dream of having would certainly inflame tempers to the raging point and of course the government could not know of such things without wanting to have some form of control over them there would be lists and registries and fines for practicing magic without a license no it would be a nightmare but if the government already knewif in fact it was complicit in covering up the existence of magic and magiciansthen it would have every reason to continue doing so incorporating the service of magicians into say the intelligence services the great game as it werethat made a great deal more sense and it would give added impetus to keeping the existence of mages a secret after all there was no point in allowing that secret to leak out if a great deal of foreign intelligence was coming in by means of magic david already suspected that other governments had come to the same conclusion although he had no direct evidence the french of coursebah secretive and with logic as convoluted as the new ornamental balustrades of the metro stations they had probably been employing elemental mages since the time of napoleon and the italians of course most probably in the vatican the prussians were a bit more straightforward and the idea might not have ever occurred to thembut then again they were ruthless and would use any tool that came to hand the balkans thank the good lord were so disorganized that it was unlikely there was any concerted effort to use magic by the various factions of anarchists and the like the americans unlikely they simply did not believe in what they could not see weigh measure the spanish perhaps given their mystical bent but they were nonplayers so far as the world stage was concerned who did that leave india china inscrutable and of all nations they were the most likely to be employing magical agents he grew tired of hearing his own footsteps on the terrazzo and decided to stroll down into the garden instead maybe his thoughts would slow in the sultry rosescented air and he would be able to get some sleep his own muffled footsteps on the turf slow and deliberate were the only sound around him insects stilled their chatter as he passed so that he moved in a circle of silence it seemed a little odd but not unpleasant so he merely noted the fact as he passed on attempting to empty his mind so that he could eventually sleep but restfulness eluded him and he let his feet take him farther out of the manicured gardens and toward the wilderness this was a part of the grounds that differed from the lawn mostly by virtue of the fact that only the paths were mowed or at least so far as he could tell in the darkness he had just stepped under the shadow of the ancient trees there when a voice from behind startled him so son of adam you venture into my territory at last he turned no elemental mage much less a master would ever have mistaken the creature that stood on the path arms folded over his chest for anything other than what he was a powerful primal spirit some might have said a godling as it was not of any one element but of all of them though earth held primacy in his makeup in form it was an adolescent boy in antique costume with a strand of vine leaves tangled in his long curly hair and the moonlight seemed to gather itself around the spirit so that it was as easy to see him as if he stood in broad daylight there was an impression of veiled power there a great deal of it in this case the very fact that this power was concealed from davids normally acute perception told him that the creature was not the usual sort he was likely to encounter i beg your pardon he said politely no point in beginning a confrontationnot that he had any doubt of his ability to handle the situation it was only some nature spirit after all true he had never yet met one this powerful but still he was no peasant to be terrified by such a thing i come to give you fair warning son of adam it replied calmly had you ventured here in the proper season i would have no issue with the source of your power but you come out of skew with what is right and proper and i will not have it wield your might unduly and bring blight and i will remove youand at need from this mortal coil entire well he might not have intended a confrontation but there was no mistaking the challenge there insolent thing he suppressed his outrage however and merely said coldly i am afraid i do not take your meaning the seeming youth snorted you lie you do you lie and feign you do not understand but i will be plainer then you bring winter into summer you take the element that should be your companion and twist it to bitter usage and i do warn you that you tread now on my ground and i will not abide this thing use your breath of ice and bring blight here all out of season and you will suffer the consequences i do not meddle in the quarrels of mortals but i will not permit you to meddle in my affairs and with my charge use what you have on your fellow fools but do not oerreach yourself davids temper flared and you sir dare to threaten me he gathered his own power about him like a cloak the spirit laughed mockingly i do more than threaten son of adam you hold no sway over all that walks the earth and he raised only his eyebrow but the moment that he did david was driven to his kneesliterallyby fear fear so overwhelming so crushing that there was nothing he could do for his knees gave way and his thoughts collapsed and although every fiber of him urged flight his body was so paralyzed with terror that he could not move so much as a fingertip it lasted a lifetime that fear he could hardly do more than breathe and even that brought with it more fear with every intake of breath then as suddenly as it had overcome him the fear was gone and so was the spirit sarah and nan should have been in bed of course they should not have even considered setting a single toe on the floor now that the rest of the household was asleep but nan had long ago discovered whatthough they did not know itgenerations of young maids who had been assigned to the room they were now in had discovered there was a simple way to leave the house when they wanted to meet their swains in the moonlight the window gave out onto a piece of roof that was nearly flat that in turn led to a series of bits of ornamental stonework as easy to descend as a ladder and from there to the top of a wall one could walk along until that in turn led to the roof of a shed that sloped down to within a mere four feet of the ground any girl sufficiently sturdy and willing to tuck up her skirts could get out againalthough they did not know thisthe housekeeper was well aware of this means of egress and this was why there were no young maids ever given that room but she had not considered that two little girls strangers to the manor and mere children after all might also discover and use this means of egress in fact nan had worked it out within days of their arrival she just didnt bother to use it all that often there was no real reason to they hadnt transgressed so far in mischief as to have been confined to their room and they were usually so tired at the end of the day that even when they tried to stay awake they couldnt but nan had lived her entire life in ratinfested tenements that often had fires and she had early learned to find an escape route in case the normal one was cut off she had shown this one to sarah then both of them had mostly forgotten about it but not tonight there was something about the air tonight that had made both of them restless long after the lights had been put out nan had been lying in her bed staring at the ceiling and listening to the bat make his rounds and knowing from the sound of her breathing that sarah was doing the same and she felt more and more strongly that something wanted her to be awake wanted her to come outside she could practically hear it calling her name finally she threw off the covers and got out of bed im goin outside she whispered me too sarah said immediately doing the same do you feel it too someone wants us somethin like nan agreed the two of them groped for their clothing and fumbled it on in the dark helping each other with fastenings neither could see then nan eased herself over the window ledge and out onto that bit of roof and from there it was easy to feel her way down with her toes on the stonework the wall top was broad and nan felt no fear in walking it moonlight shining on the stone made it as clear as any path sarah followed and they both dropped down to the turf sidebyside nan looked around squinting as if that would make any difference in seeing better in the darkness she missed neville who was asleep and hadnt stirred even with all of their moving around he could see things she couldnt with no difficulty whatsoever but sarah acted as if she had the eyes of a cat taking nans hand and tugging at it the round meadow she said which wasnt round at all only an approximation of round but it wasnt that far from the manor just a little ways into the wilderness which was a poetical way of saying that the only things mowed or trimmed in there were the paths for horseback riding it wasnt very big either more of a pocketsized meadow in which sweet grasses grew waisthigh and flowers bloomed all the time sarah and nan liked to play there because you could trample down a little room in the grass and be quite private but still get to bask in the sun and watch the clouds go by overhead that was where they had spent most of the afternoon today in fact it had been a very lazy sleepy sort of day and no one had wanted to do much of anything memsab had let them all be somewhat lazy and not do any lessons sarah and nan had gone to round meadow with rugs and books and a picnic basket of tea things sarah had made daisy chains and crowns then theyd both made flower fairies and set them up around their little grasswalled room creating a village in miniature with houses a fairy pub with acorn cups and bowls and a shop selling new flower frocks and hats all very silly of course but then they had gathered up their fairies and divided them into audience and players and put on a midsummer nights dream with sarah and nan dividing up the parts between them nan could not help but think about that and about how the first planned performance of the play had somehow called robin goodfellow was that why the two of them felt so restless tonight had the play once again worked its magic but when they got to round meadow it was not puck that they found there was something fourlegged and white standing in the middle of the meadow where their grassroom had been at first all they could see was its back and part of its legs and its neck all gleaming silvery in the moonlight head down and grazing they could both hear the sound of the grass being torn up and strong jaws munching it for one moment nan thought it must be a small horse perhaps gotten loose from that great house on the other side of the door in the hedge but then it raised its head and looked at them it was a deer a doe actually as luminous as moonlight itself watching them with gleaming silver eyes now nan knew how to tell a boy beast from a girl well enough and this one was definitely a doe and yet crowning its graceful greateyed head were silver antlers i thought only stags had horns sarah whispered to nan who only shrugged thats what she had thought too ah but that is no common deer daughter of eve said puck who had materialized out of nowhere beside them wearing his outré fairy garb again and looking perfectly natural in it that is a sidhedeer i cn tell its a shedeer nan responded puck laughed tis spelled sidhe sparrow and tis an old old word for the good neighbors the good neighbors as they both knew were another name for the fairy folk so this must be some sort of animal out of those strange lands where the fairies still walked tis said puck continued rubbing the side of his nose with one finger thoughtfully that they can become maidens when they choose ive never seen it buttis said they watched the deer in silence as she lowered her head to the grass again why is she here sarah whispered at last puck shrugged ask the wind why it blows where it will was his enigmatic reply she is here because she chooses to be and she will go because she has decided to perhaps your making your games in a round place and your playing of the play made the spot into a fairy ring and perhaps it is that you should be wary of the hard man who rode through the hedge the other day neither of them had any doubt who he was talking about nor did pucks abrupt change of subject give either of them a moments pause the incident was still fresh in nans mind and besides there hadnt exactly been a lot of men riding through the doors in the hedges around the girls i dont like im nan said flatly theres summat cold about him and there you put your finger on it my pretty london sparrow puck responded with a nod cold cold he is cold out of season cold at the heart and theres an end to it a man that cannot feel be he mortal or fey is a man who may do anything the sidhedeer raised its head again and looked at them was it nodding but what if he could change and feel again sarah asked quickly i feel sorry for him i think he is very lonely what if he could thaw puck shrugged i warn about what is not maunder about what could be i do not meddle in the affairs of mortals except as the affairs of mortals affect what i have charge over may be he can and may be he cant and it matters not at all but his cold his icenow that matters and cold and ice are death and i will not have death in the season of life he nodded at the deer it may be she is here because of it the sidhedeer will not abide death out of season either sarah set her chin in the expression that memsab called mulish i think there is good in him she said puck shrugged again tis not mine to say nor mine to do anything about he replied thats the affairs of mortals sarah said nothing aloud but nan could almost hear her thoughtsthen i will she sighed but not loudly if sarah had made up her mind to do something then it would be up to nan to guard her in it not that she was likely to get into too much trouble the man was only a toff maybe one with a bit of magic about him but he wasnt bad evil he was only the sort that would meddle because he thought he had a right and he thought he was stronger than anything he meddled in so up to the point where he fell into the hole he hadnt seen he was safe enough well she said aloud if were gonna meddle we best do it afore he gets himself into somethin worse nor he is an brings it home puck gave her a wry little bow and theres wisdom to know when to run and when to hold fast and when to stand by your friend but his smile in the moonlight was warm with approval and when the sidhedeer moved on like a drift of mist glimmering a moment among the trees and then gone he took them off on a strange wild walk in the night he showed them an owls nest in a barn with four round faces peering at them out of it and he spoke to the mother owl when she came with a mouse so that she allowed them to stay and watch her feed the hungriest it made nan giggle to watch as the mouse tail hung out of the owlets beak and it gulped and gulped and the tail slowly disappeared she would have thought that sarah would have been revolted but sarah found it just as funny he also took them to a fox den and let them play with the cubs while mother watched benignly though he warned them after when he was taking them home that they must never try such things when he was not about i have the speech with the wild things he said and they know me they will abide much from me that they will never tolerate elsewise well of course sarah replied matteroffactly it was a good thing he was along he showed them a better way of scrambling up to their window i mind me he said reminiscently peering in through the open casement when there was a brighteyed lass a living here had a farmers lad all headtumbled and heartsore because he thought shed set her cap on the stewards son but when the banns were posted it was the farmer lad who won the day of course he said with a wink it might be that i had a hand in that with the little purple flower sarah replied archly referring back to the shakespeare play now that would be telling and i never tell and he was gone in an instant and they got back into their nightdresses and crawled into bed to fall asleep the moment they got under the covers and in the morning they might have thought it was all a dreamexcept that when sarah stuck her hand into the pocket of her pinafore she pulled out much to her surprise an owl feather the strange spirit had rattled david as nothing else had in many many years he longed for someone to discuss the incident with but cordelia was in london and he did not think there were any other masters living near this place which left only isabelle after all she was no expert on these things he didnt even know if she could see the elementals and nature spirits but on the other hand there was only one name for that terror that had overcome him panicnamed for the great god pan surely that had not beensurely not it had worn the guise of a mere boy not the great goatfooted one why would the sylvan faun do such a thing for that matter what would he be doing in england this was not his place he belonged in greece and yet david had seen with his own eyes lesser fauns in england little boyish earth spirits that haunted the gardens of earth masters they had come so why not pan but why should it be so perhaps isabelle was no elemental master but she did know of the elementals and other such creatures too perhaps she had even seen this one herself a dozen times david made up his mind to ride over to talk to isabelle and a dozen times found an excuse not to until the day after his encounter when he was very nearly run to earth by a lady determined to have him for her daughter to the point where he seized on any reason to go riding alone again my dear woman he said insincerely i would be charmed to speak with you but i have an appointment to pay a call at highleigh court mrsvenhill stared at him a call she repeated i was not aware that you had any acquaintances in this part of the county her mouth tightened she knew exactly what he was doing but he had no intention of giving her a way to disprove his statement i do not he said calmly but an acquaintance of mine a mrsisabelle harton is a guest there i have not seen her in many years and she was quite eager to renew her acquaintance with me that last was the only lie the rest was absolute truth and carried the lie like froth on the top of a wave and since he did not mention a mister harton this would he hoped lead her to think that isabelles husband was no more and she was a young lonely and presumably attractive widow and in a case such as this an acquaintance out of ones youth was going to trump just about any cards a matchmaking mama could lay out she was beaten and she knew it she retired gracefully from the battle lines murmuring ah well of course you must go it would be insufferably rude if you did not of course now he had done it he had to go or at least appear to go or mrsvennhill would be very well aware that he had been putting her off do that too many times and one found ones invitations no longer extended or answered so he found himself on horseback again riding off into a day that threatened rain not the cleverest idea he could ever have had but it was too late now and he might just as well follow through with the putative visit after all if it did rain he would have to have shelter somewhere until it passed and as a visitor he could at least claim that much even if the visit proved to be awkward he had no doubt that although he was not expected he would be received with the proper respect and so he was the horse was taken around to the stables and he was shown to the library that being a proper and reasonable place for a gentleman to amuse himself when the lady he has come to see might be busy he did amuse himself by looking through some of the titles of the books there and as he had half expected a good number of them were occult or esoteric in nature so the owner of the house was in isabelle hartons circle of acquaintances or at least presumably knew many of the same practitioners of psychical magic that she did he took one down and began to leaf through it but it was heavy going and he was having a difficult time untangling the sense of it when light footfalls heralded the arrival of a newcomer and he looked up to see isabelle stepping into the room she walked briskly over to him and boldly tilted the book up to read the spine blithering idiot she said without preamble and waved at the shelves our host collects any sort of occult writing but if you examine the shelves carefully and know some of the authors you will soon determine that he has grouped his books according to their usefulness or lack thereof the halfsmile she produced had more than a hint of irony in it it was the smile of a knowing worldlywise woman not the pretentious irony of a girl his categoriesand i apologize in advanceare useful moderately useful nothing of note idiot and blithering idiot i fear that the blithering idiots number twice as much as all the rest combined but he takes some amusement in having them about i am told though i have not actually attended such a function myself that one of the entertainments for his close circle of friends is to take down a book from those shelves and read it aloud as portentously as possible without cracking a smile or laughing he looked from the book to isabelle and back and felt something constrict in his chest the woman of the photo was in person so much more the isabelle he had known had been quiet a little shy diffident her attractive qualities had been shaded by that diffidence if you knew how to look at her she was quite pretty and he had taken a certain amount of pleasure in knowing that nine hundred and ninetynine men out of a thousand would never see her true beauty unlike cordelia of course who was so strikingly handsome that even a dolt knew how attractive she was the woman that isabelle had become was like cordelia in that she left the impression that she was completely selfconfident it probably did not matter to her that the frock she wore was a trifle out of date nor that it had never been in high mode she wore it with an air that made what she wore irrelevant and there was beauty there for those with eyes to see it she had never been beautiful before but she was now it was not the sort of beauty that would make her into a subject for photographic postcards or cause artists to beg her to pose for them but it was a beauty that would outlast those whose features made them into public icons it was the sort of beauty that would look good on the arm of a public official and presiding at his dinner table and the confidence she exuded would make her at home at any gathering of elemental masters though she did not share their gifts this could have been hisand he had thrown it away you are looking well he said making his words formal a barrier between them she inclined her head graciously with no sign that she shared the emotional turmoil that racked him and you though i confess that when your card came in i was rather nonplussed we attempted to have an interview with you about the threat to my two pupils a few months ago in which a foreign elemental master was involved is this the cause of your visit pupils what pupils an elemental master attacking children belatedly he recalled the business in berkeley square and suppressed irritation this was the last thing in the world he wanted to talk about i thought that matter had been adequately closed he replied not in my opinion the inflection was of mild rebuke but then i am responsible for them and you are not i believe steps have been taken to ensure their safety that do not require the approval of the master of the hunt nor the wizard of london he felt himself flushing with embarrassment something about the way she said those two titlesespecially the lattermade them sound overblown like something a child would give himself in a game of i conquer the castle but he endeavored to sound casually dismissive is that what others are calling me the wizard of london there is no accounting for gossip even among the elemental mages he shrugged as for master of the hunt that title and the duties that go with it have nothing to do with what others outside the masters circle do or do not do no one needs ask me permission for anything one gets from another elemental mage so long as it does not interfere with their hunt duties if they choose to squander their power they may do so in whatever fashion they like it was an insult he realized that a moment later but she didnt even blink an eye in reaction the insult simply slid past her not as if she did not understand she had been insulted but as if it simply did not matter to her but it was very clear that she was going to extract whatever guilt she could from him before she let him go if the safety of two helpless little girls has not brought you here she said then to what do i owe the pleasure of this call and now he found himself at a loss for words there were many things he could say and none of them were entirely the truth would she sense that he had to wonder about that just what were her psychical abilities i am visiting mansell hall he prevaricated doing the only thing he could which was to set it aside i understood that you were visiting here and since it had been many years since we parted i wished to pay a courtesy call the moment the words were out of his mouth he could have hit himself of all the things to say this was perhaps the one with the least truth in it and she would certainly sense that oh she raised an eyebrow i was not aware that our social stations were compatible enough for a courtesy call now there at last she showed her claws not that he didnt deserve it but the fact that he deserved it made him feel resentful she was not going to get the better of him in this situation social graces are never misplaced he replied in a swift parry and i have paid a call on mrharton at the school already but she riposted just as quickly and to better effect in that case would courtesy not have dictated that you pay the call when my husband was also in residence and not when i was here alone especially as you have already made his acquaintance hit and hit again she was right this wasdespite that there were servants all around in this place not to mention the teachers and pupils of her schoolever so slightly improper as a courtesy call alone she was in that her husband was in london and presumably not expected here for several days had he come to see the schoolmistress about her pupils it would have been one thing that would have been proper and reasonable and as he was the one of more social importance the call would have been appropriately made at his convenience not hers had he really come to see an old friend it would have been another case for long friendships dictated a relaxation of formal manners and their differing social stature would not have mattered nor would it have mattered that frederick harton was not present had he come to see the hartons socially as a couple that too would have been appropriate but to come here when her husband was absent and refer to it as a social call implied something else that he wanted to renew more than just the acquaintance and not as one of friendship and the damnable thing was now that he had seen her he realized that there had been something of that sort in the back of his mind a thought that though she was married to someone else it might merely be a marriage of convenience on her part one of the reasons why he had never been able to warm up to any of the young women of his circle was that none of them had struck that particular spark within him that isabelle had and none of them had aroused much interest in him either there just had been nothing there no moment of connection beneath young isabelles diffidence had been the banked fires of passion and the promise that the man who could arouse them would have a precious gift indeed beneath the mature isabelle hartons serene competence those fires of passion blazed for those who could read such things the promise had more than been fulfilled and it was the foundation for her attractiveness but they did not blaze for him though they might have had he taken a different path there it was what he had lost written plain and in some forgotten corner of his mind he knew that he had hoped with the knowledge of how many of his peers had kept women that he could get it back so long as she had not given her heart to frederick harton somehow he would have cut her free and married her though in that dark corner the baser part of him might have toyed with the notion of making her his mistress he knew now that he would never have settled for such a tawdry solution no if it had been possible to have this woman it would have been aboveboard oh it would have caused some difficulties a man married to a divorcee was unlikely to be made prime ministerif anyone knew his wife was once divorced and even though he knew the cause was lost he couldnt help tracing out those ways in his mind as if he was probing at a sore tooth there were ways around that trivial for someone with the power of an elemental master and the money of an alderscroft records could be destroyed memories altered no one need ever knownot even she with certain spells he could erase the memory of frederick harton entirely from her mind paying off harton himself to go lose himself in the wilds of canada or the fastnesses of the himalayas would have not even made a significant dent in the alderscroft fortunes but it would not happen a marriage of convenience could be erased a marriage of hearts minds and souls could not be and such a marriage did not allow for any other parties nor any other ties he had lost her for all time there was only one way to retrieve his dignity to tell a part of the truth before she guessed at that other hidden truth actually the truth of the matter is that this is not a social call it is one esoteric colleague calling upon the expertise of another i encountered something curious and you were the only person near enough that might be able to explain it he said gathering his dignity about him and allowing her veiled slur to slide past his own icy calm besides paying a courtesy call i wished to call upon you as a consultant of sorts her expression did not change as he described the nature spirit to herthough he took care not to describe the circumstances under which it had appeared nor the creatures threats her face turned grave you would be wise not to meddle with him she replied he is older than you can guess the country folk call him robin goodfellow good gad he exclaimed startled surely not surely for i have encountered him too she replied with warning clear in her tone and shakespeare did not do him any kind of justice he is to this land what attic pan was to greece and sylvanus to rome you meddle with him at your peril now this made him angry though he held his anger down firmly you meddle with him at your peril indeed it was like something out of a poorlywritten novel what nonsense he had been so fixated on his conversation that he must not have noticed that the threatening storm had become actuality for suddenly isabelles warning was punctuated as with an exclamation point by a bolt of lightning striking an ancient oak immediately outside the library windows with a simultaneously deafening crash of thunder they both jumped isabelle clutched at the bookshelves and he dropped the book he had been unconsciously holding his heart racing his first thoughtwhich he immediately dismissedwas that it had been a warning to echo isabelles it wasnt it was purest coincidence there was no reason no reason at all to think anything otherwise it took him a moment to recover another to pick up the book he had dropped by that time he thought he knew what he was going to say but the conversation was interrupted by the intrusion ofof all thingsthat wretchedly defiant little girl child easy enough to identify even in the storm gloom by the raven that rode on her shoulder and glared at him with bright shining eyes memsab the lightning frighted the babies half to death an they wont stop cryin and the ayahs tol me to come get you he felt the force of truth behind the words but he also felt the force of something else the girl really disliked him and was fiercely happy to be the cause of interrupting the conversation he was having with her schoolmistress nor did isabelle seem at all displeased by the interruption youll pardon me i am sure she said with absolute formality but my duties to my charges in this case are something i cannot leave to anyone else i am sure i can extend the hospitality of highleigh to you for as long as the rain lasts you may find research into the books on that shelf she pointed to be fruitful especially in light of what you just told me youll forgive me i am sure if i do not make a formal farewell and leave you in the hands of the servants and with that she turned and followed the infuriating little girl out of the room once again he found himself struggling against anger and only by invoking the disciplines that cordelia had taught him was he able to regain his selfcontrol that too made him angry oh this was the first and last encounter with isabelle harton that he was going to have he should have known better than to come here in the first place there was a reason a good one why he had broken off the nascent relationship with the woman cordelia had been right anyone who could invoke such strong emotions in him potentially had a hold over him that he did not need nor want no what he needed was control absolute and complete he had been an idiot to even think about having any connection to a woman that went past mutual regard and a calm and rational assessment of how each could supply what the other required for a reasonably comfortable life marriages of conveniencemuch better much more logical than marriages of emotion emotion sapped control and selfcontrol and no elemental master had any business in allowing that loss of control to happen he had no choice but to remain while the storm ragedbut he did not have to follow her suggestion to do further research into the nature of the creature that had accosted him he already knew enough now his suspicions had been confirmed and as irritating as it was to be challenged then beaten by a nature spirit this one had millennia of power behind him and he knew intellectually that to pit himself against robin goodfellow was as foolish as going out and howling defiance at the storm outside and really why should he there was no profit in it no sense in any sort of confrontation he did not however have to like that revelation but he needed to keep his emotional reaction to a minimum or that too would cause a loss of control nor did he have to like the fact that isabelle harton had also had an encounter or encounters with the spirit and presumably had not gotten a similar warning so petty as it was he did the only thing in his power at the moment instead of researching among the books isabelle had indicated he selected a novel and set himself in a chair at the window to read it or at least pretend to read it and the moment the sky cleared he summoned a servant to fetch his horse and was gone with her experiment a success cordelia had no further need for the second orphan she was in fact debating what to do with him when fate itself presented the solution in the form of a tap on the door of her study by the housekeeper beggin your pardon milady but id like to know if youve got any plans for the future of that boy the woman said without preamble no need to ask what boy since there was only one on the premises well i had originally thought to make him a page she allowed her voice to trail off leaving it for the housekeeper to determine that cordelia now had some doubts about the wisdom of that plan the housekeeper jumped on the opening and shook her head youre kindness itself milady but that boytheres only so much polish you can put on a lump of coal milady might be shiny but tis still a lump of coal and that boy is never going to make a good page and i dont need another head in the household that does naught but run errands hes simple milady and thats a fact not so bad to have a simpleton boy about but a simpleton man thats another kettle of herring cordelia smiled benignly mrstalbot you would not have come up here to speak to me about one little boy if you did not already have a solution in hand what is it the housekeeper relaxed visibly the sweeps here she saidwhich statement did not precisely follow but cordelia waited for elaboration seems hes not got an apprentice boys been following him about does what hes told and hes small and likely to stay so sweep asked where the boy was from and wants to know if youd prentice him out ah cordelia nodded it made perfect sense chimney sweeps apprentices had shortened life spans between falls and the unhealthy effects of crawling through tiny sootandtarladen chimneys the number of apprentices that actually made it as far as becoming fullfledged chimney sweeps was exceedingly small sweeps were always looking for nimble undersized boys the housekeeper had been more than a bit shaken by the death of the first boy and was also getting a bit tired of having the second underfoot as well as losing the services of a perfectly capable housemaid for as long as the boy required a nanny she had already registered one or two mild complaints with cordelia on the subject now if ever was the opportunity to tidy up i believe you have hit upon the perfect solution mrstalbot she said earning a smile of relief from her housekeeper and that brought the household neatly back to normal the boy was taken away his nanny returned to her normal duties and afternoon quiet settled over the town house now was a good time for cordelia to retire to her workroom perhaps the ice wurms would be able to do something about those little girls in any event it was time to put her plans for david into motion she lit the lampsmagically of courseshut the door and sealed herself inside with a word and a breath she called up the chill and the water in the air condensed into a mist and she waited for it to settle into the forms of her ice wurms but it didnt instead it spread itself in a single even layer on the marble top of the worktable and then then there was ice a thin film of ice that turned the surface of the table into a mirror which reflected her face for an instant and then reflected something else entirely she stared mesmerized into colorless eyes that took up the entire surface of the worktable and which stared back at her in some amusement so said a voice she had not heard in a very long time in her head you have found a way to achieve your desire your dream of power congratulations she shook herself loose from the fascination of those eyes and if i have she replied i cant see that it would matter to you oh but it does said the voice very much so as a mere female you were vaguely interesting even amusing but as a man you will have the reins of power in your hands that makes you more than interesting it makes you worth bargaining with in earnest bargaining now her curiosity was more than merely piqued but the first step in successful bargaining was to never show any interest what do you want she asked mostly an agent a foothold an opening into your world and freedom from this cage in which i have been confined aha so the creature had been imprisoned where she found it and what could you offer me that i would want she replied it laughed let me show you she had not wanted to see david not ever again she had thought that it was all over and done with when he appeared at the school and frederick spoke to him she had thought that she had all her resentment her hurt and her anger over and done with too long ago it should have been she should have been past all this there was no reason why he should still have been able to affect her she had been wrong and she wasnt entirely sure that the lightning strike right outside the windows had been accidental give the amount of wild magic in play here the number of arcane entities simply appearing and the feeling she had that this was both a nexus for powers and a place where they manifested easily that bolt from the heavens might merely have been her reaction to davids presence which meant that truly her anger was not under control it was merely being locked in place not good not for a warrior of the light she could not afford to have uncontrolled anger she could not afford to let this man unbalance her she thought given the circumstances that she had comported herself well no longer the tonguetied teenager when confronted with conflict she had remained at least outwardly composed her words had been civilized her manners had been impeccable he was the one who had acted poorly if anyone had she had even given him good advice not that she expected him to take it the more she thought about it the more certain she was that he had had no idea of just how angry she had been with him which merely spoke for his blindness not her ability to control herself she paced the confines of the small parlor toward the back of the manor overlooking the gardens that she tended to use as her own the babies were all soothed the storm had passed and davids physical presence had been removed mentally and emotionally however the anger roiled inside her like those storm clouds had she thought she had forgiven him clearly she had not in fact she wanted him to be hurt as much as he had hurt her this was also not good for a warrior of the light whose will could become action if she was not careful and then she would be subject to threefold retribution how had he done this to her it was unfair and grossly unjust here she was struggling to make a decent life for herself and those in her chargeunable to bear children of her own which was a terrible and deep hurt she had revealed to no one not even fredericktrying with all her soul to protect and serve as she was supposed to do with the scantiest of resources and there he was arrogant cold making demands of her offering no apologies for what he had done to her treating her like a menial like a toy he could break wait for his servants to repair and pick up to play with again clearly coming here expecting that if once the goods had been examined and he still wanted them they would be free for his taking oh she had not missed the allusion to his powerful friends had not missed the impeccablytailored and clearly expensive riding clothes the aura of power the arrogance of wealth that assumes that if it wants a thing it shall have that thing and he knew that she knew all about the estate the money and the title she had been gladgladto hear of his discomfiting encounter with robin goodfellow time and more than time for him to realize that his wants were not the center of the universe and that he was not the most powerful creature in it she was glad it was robin that had done it too spirit of mischief that he was david had never been comfortable with teasing nor with being made fun of and robin surely had taken the starch out of him time for him to get a dose of what others felt like when he casually leaned his power of rank of money of magic on them to force them to his will no one had ever rejected him or made him feel inferior it was a lesson it would do him good to learn and still here in the place where she was a guest he had done his best to make it clear to her how very much less a person she was than he she wanted at that moment to be able to actually call lightning out of the sky to strike him not lethally but memsab the small voice at the door to the parlor made her pause in her pacing she turned it was little sarah looking up at her with a worried expression bird on her shoulder she wondered if sarah had sensed her inner turmoil if so she owed it to the child to calm herself sarah she said with false calm if this is something trivial i am rather preoccupied and i would hope we can deal with whatever it is later sarah looked up at her solemnly her expression as sober as a judge memsabthat man that was here sarah paused and isabelle waited for the child to tell her that he shouldnt come around here again it was what she was expecting when sarah continued we need to help him help himhelp him after endangering these children after ignoring the corruption in his own circle after coming here to lord it over meto offer me crumbs from his table in exchange for the grace of his temporary attention she allowed none of this to show and kept her psychical walls up to keep from disturbing the little girl more than she already was sarah dear i am afraid that in this case you really know nothing of the situation she said carefully she reminded herself that she was not angry at this child she was angry rightfully at david she should not unload her anger at david onto sarah who had done nothing to deserve it two sets of eyes the round yellow ones of the bird and the round brown ones of the child looked up at her solemnly he is unhappy sarah said simply and you are unhappy too youre angry and upset and so is he and youre so unhappy you feel dangerous its the kind of unhappiness that makes bad things happen isabelle had been about to send the child off to play when something about that last sentence chilled her anger and made her blood run cold the words felt like a prediction this was not good sarah she said instead please come sit with me she turned and took a seat on a spindlylegged divan and patted the hard seat beside her sarah did not hesitate a moment to carefully climb up next to her now isabelle said would you tell me what you mean by that sarah regarded her gravely and isabelle felt another emotion but this time the opposite of the chilling effect of the childs words little sarah had a wise old soul in her isabelle had learned to recognize such people in india normally such old souls were content to enjoy their childhoods and not wake up until they reached a stage where it was appropriate for them to be active again nan too had an old soul but it was clearly the soul of a warrior not a wise man sarah however had a spirit within her that was quite remarkable it peeked out through those eyes every now and again leaving whoever it regarded usually feeling warm and protected and that wise old soul wanted to help isabelle with a sigh she knew she was going to have to set her anger to one side sarah nodded a little as isabelle settled her hands in the correct position in her lap and went into a light meditative trance she visualized her anger as a fire raging out of control and slowly confined it to its proper place on the hearth again because even negative emotions like anger had positive uses it wasnt easy but shed had good teachers in such discipline you must recognize that these things are within you and learn to use them said the voice in her memory otherwise they will use you yes teacher she said to the memory and the fires crept back to their place she opened her eyes and looked down at sarah who was patiently waiting and looked ready to wait forever hes very unhappy sarah repeated i think he must have made some bad mistakes a long time ago he thought he was being clever but he was choosing a bad path now hes all twisted up andcold and thats bad too its going to make trouble if he keeps on as he is bad mistakes the words took her aback for a moment in the long view which she was for the moment forcing herself to take how important was a failed romance it only really mattered to her didnt it how could david rejecting her possibly lead to something sarah would call a bad mistake he does have a great deal of influence she said thinking aloud what do you mean by saying he is cold i know what i mean but what is sarah seeing he doesnt feel anything anymore sarah said her little face taking on an expression of deep sadness or what he does feel he steps on right away he thinks this is being clever but its like bricking up your windows so nobody can see inside your house then you cant see outside or inside yourself youre all alone in the dark and you just kind of wither and when people dont feel anything anymore they can do bad things without really thinking about it because it doesnt matter to them isabelle felt shocked out of the mouths of babes but then sarah was no ordinary child thats quite true she acknowledged but if he doesnt feel anything anymore just what exactly can you and i do it would seem that he is so far down his chosen path that our influence is negligible he is not inclined to listen to me and he definitely will not listen to you sarah frowned well she replied i dont know for certain if he really doesnt feel anything for true or if its only that he tries not to feel anything but i think something bad is going to happen to him if we cant wake him up again and when that something bad happens to him hell do a lot of bad around other people then the child shook her head its all hard to explain and its not like i know something is going to happen its just that i feel it is i dont have a picture or anything in my head and grey just feels the same too young to see the future because she is too young to cope with needing to see it and too young to cope with knowing what is to come it would have been very useful if she and nan had been in their late teens and fully into whatever powers and abilities they were going to get well perhaps sarah could evoke more if isabelle gave her more information isabelle sighed he came here to tell me that he had encountered robin he wanted some information i suspect he was not aware of robins true nature and thought that he could simply coerce or confine robin if if he thought robin was in the way sarah finished with a decided nod like nan and me were in the way the other day when he came riding a horse through the hedge and almost ran us down isabelle felt another surge of anger but this one was clean simple anger at the careless man who would pay no attention to where he was goingnot that she thought the children had been in any danger from david first of all few horses that were not actually vicious or panicked were likely to trample people horses hated soft things underfoot and given the choice would shy rather than run something down neverthelessit was careless it was heedless and it was certainly an example of the sort of arrogance that was making her so angry with him he certainly had not come to anyone here at highleigh to report the incident which was the least he should have done any responsible adult would have done so a truly responsible adult would have made certain the girls were well then brought them to the manor himself no she was vexed very vexed with him that was twice he had endangered the lives of two little girls with no demonstration that he considered them to be as important as a pair of stray kittens obviously since you are not sporting hoofprints he didnt harm you she said with calm she did not feel i trust he apologized that would have been the least that any decent man would have done no he shouted at us for being there and nan shouted back at him and he got angry nan said she thought he had no right being there which got him more angry so he just rode around the meadow then went back sarah shook her head and thats why nans angry with him she added he didnt treat us very well but i know why he was in the wrong but he feels like he has to be right all the time the more wrong he is the more he acts badly in order to prove that he is right so since he feels that way he can hurt people quite easily she looked thoughtful a moment i suppose she said in tones that suggested she was trying to find davids point of view if we had been crying and acting scared or hurt he would have acted differently but since nan was being rude he must have supposed that we were all right and he was free to be angry with us isabelle clenched her jaw then forced it to relax and she thought about what her friend bea had said about this circle of elemental mages david was putting together and how he had political ambitions and then her blood ran cold the one thing that had kept the practitioners of the arcane from meddling as much as they could if they chose was that they had kept themselves out of secular life so to speak there was little or no interference on their part with the lives of those who were not so gifted except perhaps the occasional rescue and thus far there had been no one who was really willing to take that step into the lives of those who were not elemental mages there was an unspoken accord between the mages and the gifted and talented that they would not interfere with one another either but combine a powerful elemental master the circle he had founded political ambitions and the absolute certainty in that masters mind that he was right and what he wanted was what was best for all add to that the unwillingness on the part of that master to admit he could ever be wrong it would start small of course such things always began small first political contacts and then to a chosen man or two in very high places the proof that magic existed and it could be used to produce real effects pointing out that using magic for the good of the empire was the only patriotic way to proceed then it would begin with the elemental mages cautiously being given political and governmental positions and power perhaps there would be a special ministry in charge of the arcane and at first its work would be entirely benign renegade magicians would be tracked down rounded up and possibly laws put through so that they could be made accountable for what they did and in davids circle there would be a sort of policing force readymade they would all have official government sanction and a certain amount of power power could be very addictive but thenhow long would it be before all magicians were asked to register with this ministry how long until any magician that had elected not to register was deemed a renegade and registration was no longer voluntary how long before it wasnt just magicians but all the gifted and talented as well and then how long before the magicians extended their hands over the ordinary people who had neither gift nor talent then what there were many possibilities and all of them were chilling all of this ran through her mind while the child sat there solemneyed watching her things could be very bad if his heart stays frozen couldnt they sarah asked quietly your face went all still memsab it only does that when youre thinking that things could be bad isabelle sighed yes sarah things could be very bad the trouble is i dont know how to put them right sarahs eyes never left hers mummy says that the way to start putting things right is always to start with forgiveness isabelle felt as if someone had struck her a blow forgiveness it was the one thing she did not want to give him and yet mummy says not forgiving someone hurts you worse than it hurts him the child persisted even if he doesnt deserve to be forgiven she says not forgiving someone is like not pulling a thorn out of your foot just because you werent the one that put it there isabelle regarded the child steadily and the old soul looked back at her out of sarahs eyes somehow she doubted that sarahs mummy had said anything of the sort no this was all coming from a source that isabelle would be wise to heed so we start with forgiveness she said struggling with her own rebellious heart but where do we go from there sarah looked uncertain mayberobin isabelle blinked that was not a bad notion the worst that would happen would be that he would tell them it was none of his business and even if he himself declined to help them he might be willing to give them some idea of which way to go yes it was a very interesting idea indeed how to approach this however well the best thing might be to follow the advice of lewis carroll begin at the beginning go on until you reach the end then stop and the beginning was forgiveness you can go sarah she heard herself saying obediently the child nodded and hopped down off the settle to walk quietly out of the parlor leaving isabelle alone i dont want to forgive him the mere idea made her angry so angry she could feel a headache coming on coming on she put her hands to her head and gasped as a lance of pain transfixed her stabbing into her temple and it was that pain that finally awoke her to the reality of what she was doing to herself the child was right the rancor she held for david alderscroft was like a thorn in the foot that she refused to remove because she had not put it there nevertheless it was stabbing deeper with every step she took how long before it began to fester judging by her strong reaction not long at all bother she said aloud i am not very good at this sort of thing how to forgive when you really didnt want to convince yourself that you do of course with a sigh she resigned herself to the inevitable she went upstairs to the bedroom she had been given and got a thick pile of foolscap out of the desk pen in hand she sat down to make a list she was by nature a very methodical person it was in her nature to approach a problem by writing a list she divided the paper in half with a line down the middle on the one side she would write out all of her grievances on the other write the reasons why she should give the grudge up one he broke my heart broke it not really oh it had felt like a broken heart at the time and certainly she had been horribly unhappy but with the perspective of time it was notquitea broken heart she wrote that down on the other side of the line then something else occurred to her if he had not cast her off she would never have gone to india and never met frederick so frederick she wrote on the righthand side of the page so if he had not broken her hearthe hurt my pride true enough very true and hardly the reason to carry a grudge pride got hurt all the time it always went before a fall so true she wrote on the other side and added and no harm done he drove my friends away that was a lie she had run away and as she had discovered her true friends had not been driven away and had in fact only been waiting for her to approach them again so false she wrote on the righthand side hes arrogant true but if she began to hate everyone who was arrogant she would soon be spending all her time seething in a selfmade mass of anger too tied up in knots to actually get anything accomplished he thinks no one is right except himself also true butthe same argument held down the lists on both sides she went until she had three full pages of reasons why she should not forgive himand six pages of reasons why continuing to be angry at him was foolish she stared at her lists and began to chuckle she never could hold a grudge in the face of logic the logic here was overwhelming and with a mocking nod of selfdeprecation she acknowledged that she put down the pen and stared out the window at the neatly ordered gardens i forgive you david alderscroft she said aloud i forgive you for being an arrogant ass i forgive you for being cruel to the poor fool i was because if you had not been cruel i would not have frederick and for that blessing i can forgive you just about anything she felt some of her rancor ease not all by no means not allbut she would repeat this vow of forgiveness as often during the day as she remembered to do so and eventuallyprobably sooner rather than latershe would feel it unreservedly and in a way it would be a better revenge than continuing to hate him because the last hold on her he had would be gone she laughed put the foolscap into a drawer and went down to the kitchens she needed to find out how long the house party he was attending would last and the servants knew everything this might not be a matter of any urgency but she really dared not take that chance cordelia nibbled the end of her pen as she considered which of her social contacts would best be able to get her invited to the house party david was attending under most circumstances this would have been the very last thing she cared to do but after due consideration she had realized something quite vital it had occurred to her somewhat belatedly that it would be better far better if the transfer of souls took place somewhere other than in her own home if it was to occur during something like this house party for instance there would be no breath of scandal attached but to have david here in her london town house overnightpeople would talk there was no reason for him to stay overnight even if he drank too much which of course he never did he would not be put to bed here in a manor or a big country estate such things were done because of the distances but in london no if he were to be sick enough to be put up in the home of a single woman there had better be a doctor called and two nurses in attendance a gentleman capable of going up a set of stairs to a room would insist on going home in his carriage she wanted no taint attached to david since shortly she would be david but a country house party ideal any stigma would attach to the owner of the house the host of the party the usual difficulties of explanation involved when a lady was found wandering late at night near the room of someone who was not her husband would not come into play her magic would prevent anyone from seeing her going to and from davids room once she was in davids body she could carry the lifeless corpse of cordelia back to her own room to be found in the morning it seemed like a flawless plan so her first step find out how much longer the party was to continue and her second somehow contrive to get invited to it both were trivially easy for someone with cordelias magic and social experience to ascertain the first she sent to davids housekeeper to find out when he was expected back an unexceptional perfectly ordinary question and one she had asked the housekeeper many times before ones housekeeper was always the first to be informed of a prospective absence or return often before ones spouse knew of course she did not ask directly her secretary took that task the answer came within the hour in about a week he had already been there a week at this point it was an unusually long time for a house party but this one was hosting a number of quite important politicians but not all at once since many of them were not on speaking terms with each other such were the ways of politics ones deadliest foes were generally in ones own party still at the moment david was both an unknown and someone to be courted and david was staying on as an extended guest to meet all of them now since she did not know the host directly she had to contrive an indirect means of getting an invitation but she was the mistress of the art of the indirect by now since no mere female ever got anything done directly no they had to sneak and cajole and bargain any direct approach was unthinkable a man could pay a call on a successful host at his club and say look old man i need to be invited to your soirée this weekend no one would question such a request but a woman particularly an unmarried woman tongues would wag and people would speculate about lovers surely nothing other than a lover could prompt such behavior out of a woman so she would have to go about this carefully though there was nothing particularly complicated about what she needed to do only tedious an hour in her workroom scrying in her ice mirror got her the names of those to be invited for the next week she put on her walking suit hat and gloves her engraved card case called for her carriage and sallied forth to make calls with the determination of a wellington planning a campaign a set of morning calls for the least important afternoon calls for the most with tea reserved for the best target she loathed making calls if there was a more useless waste of time she had yet to find it normally this would not have involved the list of calls but normally she would have had weeks or months for her little child ghosts to whisper in the ear of the intended victim and persuade said victim that she could not possibly go but that dear cordelia would provide the perfect substitute the allimportant matter of the guest list or in this case lists were arranged very carefully at these parties when guests were not accompanied by their respective spouses an equal number of gentlemen and ladies must be arranged when single ladies were required they had to be above reproach in all ways she certainly qualified on that score no one had ever breathed a single word of scandal about her she had never encouraged anything but the most restrained and polite of male attentions her pedigree was exceptional her acquaintances wide and all of the best society and she was in public neither too educated nor too ignorant she made the ideal guest she knew when to keep her mouth shut when to amuse and what topics were safe your son and your husband were safe from her attentions she could be relied upon to be seated next to a boring old man and appear fascinated to play whatever game of cards you required a partner for to shoot adequately if you wanted women along at a shoot and to not complain if you didnt she could not sit a horse but she could help amuse her fellow females when the hunters went out she had no sense of humor but that was scarcely obligatory in a mere female she could play badminton croquette lawn tennis and lawn bowls without complaint she had no history of attempting to curry favor after careful weighing and measuring which was the point of all that exercise going from town home to town home she knew which of the rest of her friends was the likeliest provider of the invitation she found her quarry a plain and uninteresting cousin of the host who was being invited merely to make up the rest of the party she paid a call on the cousin who was a timid thing and not inclined to make a fussand really did not want to go to this party anyway when she was done the cousin was feeling really very ill and not inclined to go off to a strange house in the country away from all her creature comforts though london might be warm in the summer it at least had the benefit of containing all that was familiar and a few close friends who were just as plain and uninteresting as the cousin herself she could spend her week in her usual round of pursuits or go off to the country to be bored and unhappy and probably looked down upon and here was a substitute sighing wistfully and saying that she was tired of both london and her own thamesside house and longed for the tranquillity of true country life for a week or so cordelia watched with satisfaction in her ice mirror how the cousin sat down that very afternoon to write regrets and a suggestion and cordelias little ghosts stirred uneasily until she picked just one to do her bidding and whisper encouragement into the ear of the host as soon as he got that letter they were not happy about being sent out now not after the way in which peggoty had been sent out and had not returned she considered sending the new one and rejected the idea picking instead a scraggly little boy who had been very reliable in the past while not precisely fearless he was certainly not as fearful as some of them with that particular task completed she sat back in her crystal chair there was no reason to leave the workroom just now and every reason to stay not the least of which was that the temperature here was that of a brisk lateautumn day with frost on the ground and the temperature of her parlor indeed of the rest of the townhouse was considerably higher ah now you understand that voice again she looked up from contemplating her hands and saw that the surface of the entire table was frozen over creating a mirror an inch thick in which she could only see a pair of enormous iceblue eyes blue as the light in the heart of a glacier the eyes stared at her in amusement now you understand i wish to hold this place for myself and my kind i wish to bring winter forever to this island of yours that actually startled her because she had never guessed that at all why she asked it as visions of a frozen london came and went in her extra mirror the visions actually did not look particularly unpleasant actually the thames was frozen solid and being used by a few hardy souls as a highway snow drifted up against most buildings as high as the second story then froze hard so that people had to either tunnel their way out or come and go through the windows there were remarkably few people about now that might have been because it was so difficult to get around in the arctic landscape but cordelia didnt think that was the case no not when so few chimneys were smoking not when there was no sign that any one was coming or going at the houses of parliament it certainly looked as if london had been abandoned and then an image of hyde park and someone driving through it in a sleigh a sleigh drawn not by horses but in the finnish fashion by reindeer clever that horses were illsuited for running on snow and ice a closer lookit was david alderscroft in the back being driven by a servant muffled to the eyes in furs but something told cordelia that it was her living in that body not the original owner better and better when i hold this island through you you will need no longer fear discovery you can collect your own circle of elemental masters to serve us you will be the kingor queen if you so choose to revert to a female bodyin all but name eventually as the years pass you will become the monarch have we a bargain there is always a price she said aloud what is it your heart will be mine she was startled for a moment surely the creature did not mean you will never again feel passion of any sort that will be mine no pleasure no anger no love nor hate nor grief nor joy for a moment she was incredulous this was all what she asked mockingly are you not going to require my soul it only laughed your heart will do done she said without hesitation we will rule the boreal kingdom of britain together it laughed so let it be written it said in the ancient words of sealing so let it be done cordelia realized within an hour of her arrival that her original plan was not going to work david had brought his valet with him and the man slept in a room attached to davids own that was a complication she had not foreseen although she had brought her own maid with her she had intended to drug the girl to avoid an unnecessary expenditure of magic energies which would be at a premium in the height of summer there was no way that she would be able to also drug davids man and even if she could her room lay in the other wing of the place to return her dead body to her room shein davids bodywould have to carry a lifeless corpse from one end of the building to the other not feasible as she smiled and occasionally murmured pleasantries over tea her mind was abuzz with activity there had to be a way to make this work david seemed rather surprised to see her when he joined the party for dinner but a serene smile seemed to reassure him and he nodded to her from his place nearer the head of the table than herself she acknowledged the nod then went back to her conversation with an elderly duke it was surprisingly interesting actually the man had spent his active years as the ambassador to the court of the king of sweden and she was able to ask him a great many questions about life in extremely frigid climes he in his turn seemed pleased and surprised that she had an interest in such things after dinner some of the ladies of the party took a turn in the gardens which had been illuminated for the purposes with chinese lanterns and torches she took the opportunity to view the grounds which she had been told had been specially designed to be particularly attractive at night there were many sorts of nightblooming plants here and paths that were broad with turf as smooth and soft as a carpet there were tall hedges that divided the garden into a series of roofless rooms and as she strolled with three other ladies it began to dawn on her that she had found the perfect place for her plot she could slip out into the garden under the cover of the darkness then she could call him here to some secluded spot she could plant the suggestion in his mind via one of her little ghostly servants that he was too warm to sleep and was coming out into the garden to have a solitary turn and perhaps a smoke no one would ever see them meet if anyone saw him or spoke to him it was unlikely that anyone would connect david alderscroft with the lifeless body of his mentor who would be found the next day in fact she would make it appear that she had gone out for a similar stroll had sat down to rest and simplydied the hardest part would be subduing him without drugs for obviously she was not going to be able to slip any such thing into him in a strange household she would have to call upon other powers there were spells to bring sleep and while they were wildly expensive in terms of the power needed it wasnt as if she was going to require that power later or if she did her ally could probably supply it unless she smiled of course instead of relying on her ghosts she could tell him simply that she had uncovered some magical threat to him out here and had come to warn and aid him obviously they could not meet within the walls of a strangers home for this she would have him come to the garden and join her for spellwork once he had submitted to her as the mentor she could do whatever she wanted with him simple as the best plans always were he would not even worry at first as the breath of the ice wurms wreathed him about he was used to it after all and by the time he realized that this was not the usual cold spellwork it would be too late he had snubbed the normal fire elementals for so long that they would never come to his aid if he called themand the ice elementals answered to her she smiled and began to stroll the gardens looking in earnest for the most secluded spot not tonight of course but soon soon there was nothing like seeing a plan finally come to fruition and the fruit when she plucked it would be sweet indeed at last she found what she judged to be perfect far enough from the buildings that it might as well be invisible with tall hedges on two sides and a secluded bench there were no lanterns or fairy lights in this part of the garden either but the bench was overarched by a trellis of nightblooming jasmine which made it just the spot for a lady to sit and enjoy the evening in fact she tried it out for a moment and was satisfied do not be too satisfied the cold voice in her mind was accompanied by the bite of frost from a spot on the path just in front of her there was a column of mist there faintly glowing and a suggestion of eyes at the top of it you are in enemy territory and they will stop you if you are not prepared what enemy she demanded sharply if you are wise you will find a way to accomplish this on your own ground not in any timely fashion she replied in tones as cold as the mist the longer i delay the likelier it is that alderscroft will manage to drift away from me he grows independent and this is making me uneasy and there is no way to accomplish this thing either in his home or mine without scandal if a column of mist could shrug this thing did then you will need my help the ice creature said we will begin with your child ghosts summon them now she was about to protest that this was not a simple thing when a chill of warning made her think better of it she had thought that she was in control of this situation the cold collected voice in her mind and the power behind it gave her the first intimation she might have been mistaken it would frighten the children making them useless for her purposes but she didnt think that was going to matter to the ice lord as she was now calling him in her mind i cannot do this at this moment she said simply i must summon them by means of the things i have in my room she never traveled without a needle case a roll of small felt pockets each of which held a small labeled sample of hair fetch it and return the voice commanded curtly time is of the essence the tenor of the voice raised the hair on the back of her neck and she began to realize that she might have made a very profound error it was however too late to correct that error now the best she could do would be to ride out the storm that she herself had set in motion that she would survive this storm was not an issue she knew that she would the creature needed her but she needed now to be on the watch for ways in which she could turn it to her advantage carefully avoiding the other ladies she slipped silently into her room and retrieved what she needed as she passed the billiard room it was clear that the political discussion was still in full swing by the haze of tobacco smoke and the rumble of male voices and she felt anger at that anger that the women were excluded without a single thought but this was not the time nor the place she slipped back out into the dark gardens with their softly glowing colored lanterns and paused to listen to the female counterpart to the male conversation highpitched artificially cadenced nonsense punctuated by the occasional polite titter that made her angry too the amount that could be accomplished if these women would not allow themselves to be made into powerless ornaments well they were fools and their men with them most of the earths population was as foolish and as useless fit only to take orders and serve serve cordelia of course the england that she ruled would be structured accordingly but for now she must summon her ghosts and see what the creature did with them she did not doubt that there was danger to her plans here even if she could not see it the creature had not failed her before and it clearly had a strong incentive not only to tell the truth but to keep her safeguarded she would not however make the mistake of expecting that condition to last the next morning she was amused to overhear the gardeners bemoaning the patch of blight that had appeared overnight in a remote part of the garden it was not blight of course but the direct result of the ice lords work with the child ghosts the gardeners were scrambling to replace the patch of turf and the plants to trim back the frostkilled branches of bushes the children now stood as arcane sentries guarding the house and grounds not only from immaterial threat but from anyone with any sort of power elemental or psychical they might not be able to stop all intruders but they could certainly delay and damage even the most powerful and they would give a warning they were no longer vague little sketches of children either the ice lord had transformed them utterly into feral fierce creatures exuding menace it would take a brave person indeed to dare to go past them and a powerful one to be willing to try taking them on it wasnt that they were strong individuallyit was that they were now vicious as weasels and would swarm anybody who tried to take one on after she had gone back to the manor and engaged in some pointless gossip with the other ladies before retiring she had made a point of enforcing slumber tonight was going to be difficult enough without fatigue the day had dawned unseasonably cool and continued that way which she considered either a good omen or an evidence that the ice lord was already exerting his power she actually thought it vanishingly unlikely for it to be the latter the ice lord had made it quite clear that the bulk of the action was to be in her hands that he had interfered at all in the case of the ghosts was something he had done with great reluctance there was someone or something out there that he considered to be a great hazard to them and to their enterprise so the unseasonably cool weather was just a coincidence but one she could take advantage of she rose and her maid dressed her while she thought long and hard about what her next step would be but the opportunity to speak privately with david came sooner than she had thought we must talk he said under his breath as he passed her on the stairs she going down to breakfast he returning from it now is as good a time as any she replied i am not so enamored of grilled tomatoes that i cannot take the time to speak with my pupil when he looks so distressed let us take a turn in the gardens here of course was where she overheard the lamentations of the gardeners and smiled to herself i am not sure where to begin he said at last i encountered aa nature spirit here it threatened me uncommon but not unheard of she observed clearly though this was no common spirit no he said grimly and proceeded to describe his encounter in minute detail while she grew more surprised by the moment there was only one creature she could think of with that sort of power and the fact that it had threatened to interfere now made her understand why the ice lord had taken direct action her first thought was that the spiritclearly one of the greater fey those who had been in their time worshipped as godshad somehow deduced her plan and the ice lords if that was the case a few puny wraiths were not going to stop him but then she realized that all of the threats had been aimed toward david and the warning specifically pointed at this part of the country there had been an implication that the spirit did not care what happened in london so long as no ice magic was brought here so it didnt know just because a creature was very powerful it did not follow that it was omniscient and even if it had the capability to read the future it did not follow that it would the greater fey in particular had curious holes in their thinking they tended to be flighty they had difficulty in concentrating on any one thing for too long no matter how important something was there was always the possibility that once it was out of immediate sight it would also be out of mind chances were the creature had already forgotten about david and by the time it realized that they were working ice magic it would be too late nor would it occur to the fey that there could be more to it than just cordelias plan but this fed directly into her plot you were right to be concerned she said earnestly this is a dangerous creature capricious and unpredictable i must safeguard you from it his lips thinned as he frowned simply tell me what to do he replied once again showing an annoying independence i can handle this myself i should think under normal circumstances yes she replied but these safeguards are against the greater fey and must be placed externally even if i told you how to place themwhich i will of courseyou would only be able to place them on someone else the subject must be unconscious in order for the protections to be invoked or the initial disorientation as one is suddenly able to see the fey realms is far too painful she congratulated herself gleefully at that stroke brilliant now she could do whatever she liked with him with absolute impunity he would never even question what she was doing because he already had had the experience of what happened when one first was able to see the creatures and energies of elemental magic it was generally very disorienting and sometimes distressing children who were born into nonmagical families sometimes went mad or believed they were doing so he had no idea whether or not being able to see the fey would be worse than that although in fact the fey realms did not exist and the fey were simply masters of all the elements when can we do this he asked eagerly as she regarded him with grave eyes tonight would not be too soon she said soberly and if you meet me here in the garden i will find a secluded place where we can work undisturbed isabelle was just finishing her correspondence when the sound of a familiar footstep made her raise her head and swivel swiftly in her chair just in time to have frederick stoop over her and kiss her passionately his arms including both her and the ladderback of her chair which was probably the only reason why he wasnt crushing her into his chest not that she would have minded being crushed into his chest as always she closed her eyes and allowed herself a moment when all she thought of felt knew was him the moment of being completely with him in love surrounded by love engulfed by love as always it was better than it had been the last time she had never been more sure of him never been more sure that no matter how things changed the two of them would see that they changed in a way that only brought them closer being together in that way that stole her breath and stopped her heart and held them both in timeless time the moment passed as such moments always did leaving behind echoes that created their own kind of song inside her she felt him stand straight and opened her eyes smiling he looked down at her chuckling his eyes crinkling at the corners once again we scandalize the servants she laughed i did not expect you until tomorrow he grinned and shrugged doomsday dainwrite sent me off with a half holiday he replied and his face took on the mournful expression of a bloodhound contemplating an empty food dish you need to go to your wife he said in sepulchral tones terrible things are about to happen and she will need you isabelle laughed at that because the head of the firm called doomsday even by his own wife who he predicted would leave him drown catch fire be struck by lightning or die of some plague virtually on a daily basis had never ever been right in his predictions of disaster and mayhem the only times disaster had befallen the firm or some person in it doomsday had been completely silent on the subject and had been taken as much by surprise as anyone else well it is not as if you have not earned a half holiday and more she replied taking his hand in hers and holding it against her cheek for a moment then letting it go and so have you we are having tea on the terrace away from the children and then we are going for a walk on the grounds you and i and no one else and we are going to talk of nothing but commonplaces he bestowed a look on her that told her he was accepting no arguments but then she was not inclined to give him one by dinnertime all was back to normal except that she felt as rejuvenated by the afternoon as if she had spent a week at the seaside her good humor spread among the children for once there were no quarrels no outbursts of temper scarcely even a raised voice when there was contention over the last jam tart that pirate of a raven neville was on his best behavior and sarahs parrot grey did not even indulge herself in her own favorite bit of mischief of sorting through the bits in her cup and dropping what she didnt care to eat on the floor the children went off to baths and bed with scarcely a moment of fuss the youngest now at the escape from the bath and run through the halls naked shrieking stage for once did not indulge themselves it was the perfect ending to a perfect day until as the oldest were settled into their beds and isabelle finished the rounds of good night hugs she and frederick stepped out onto the terrace and the perfect day shattered one moment they were holding hands gazing at the stars and listening to the nightingales and the occasional call of an owl the next they were clutching each other halfdeafened by the thunderclap halfblinded by the lightning bolt that had delivered robin goodfellow to the foot of the terrace a very angry robin goodfellow who was nothing like the merry lad who had strutted his way across their improvised stage playing himself with gusto and glee no this was a tall and terrible creature dressed head to toe in black features inhumanly sharp and feral with a face full of wrath and a sword in his hand woe be unto ye son of adam and daughter of eve he cried in a voice that echoed hollowly your friend would not heed my warning nor thine eves daughter and he and his leman seek to unleash that which has no place here and with another bolt of fire and explosion of thunder he was gone but a cold angry wind sprang up in his wake sending storm clouds racing from east to west plastering isabelles gown to her legs what frederick began having to shout to make himself heard over the tempest but isabelle had no doubts alderscroft she shouted back david alderscroft isinvoking something i dont know what but but we need to put a stop to it frederick shouted back and as one they turned to find nan and sarah behind them birds crouched down on their shoulders against the windand behind them agansing karamjit and selim the girls both wore expressions of fierce determination and faintly glowing auras that looked incongruous on two youngsters dressed in schoolgirl pinafores isabelles entire nature went into revolt at the sight of the children whatever needed confronting they had no place there the three men were overlaid with their aspects of warriors of the light agansing in the garb of the gurkha enormous kukri at his belt karamjit in the tunic and turban and bearing the sword of the sikh fighter and selim also in turban and tunic but with a spear to karamjits curved sword the avalanche has begun memsab agansing said eyes glinting it is too late to make a choice among what will fall the children summoned us they in their turn were summoned isabelle looked down at the girls and her heart sank agansing was right as often as doomsday was wrong nan was dead asleep one moment and wide awake in the next she woke with the absolute certainty that something was horribly wrong it was like the same feeling shed had back in berkeley square though different in that the threat was not directed at her or at sarah but a threat there was a deadly one and she had to meet it she glanced up at nevilles perch above her bed to see the raven looking down at her she felt him in her head calling something felt that something waking up she leaped out of bed to find sarah also scrambling up wot is it she asked feeling shaky and scared but also another part of her galvanized and energized andeager dont know sarah replied pulling her dress over her head but its bad grey cried every feather sticking out so she looked like a gray pinecone bad bad bad that was all she had time for when the whole building shook beneath a cannonade of thunder and it was as if some uncanny telegraph connected them for the same information flashed into both their minds robin cried sarah and puck shouted nan at the same time while neville called alarm and grey uttered a highpitched growling shriek hes angry sarah added her face white in the light of the candle nan lit hes moren that she said grimly hes gone for killin difficult as it was to imagine friendly funny robin goodfellow prepared to kill something she had no doubt in her mind at all that this was what he was prepared to do and she also had no doubt in her mind that it was her job to prevent it if she could and not just for the sake of the potential victim either oh nan sarah turned round eyes on her if he does that nan nodded she knew and knew that somehow the knowledge came through neville that if robin goodfellow the guardian of logres was to spill human blood he would be banished from the isle for all time and if that happenedmuch if not all of the magic would go with him she sensed a future stretching out from that moment bleak and gray and joyless and shuddered around them the other children startled out of sleep by the thunder were calling out the babies crying the ayahs were busy calming them and no one paid any attention as nan and sarah with neville and grey clutching their shoulders slipped out and downstairs no one that is until they ran right into agansing karamjit and selim a wave of dismay swept through nan as she winced back sure that she and sarah were going to be rounded up and sent back upstairs but instead agansing held up his hand and peered at them that was when nan realized there was a kind of ghostly glowing other version of agansing superimposed on the everyday fellow we will need these fellow warriors my brothers he said solemnly karamjit peered at them and nodded selim sighed with resignation i bow to your superior experience brother selim said reluctantly but i cannot like it they are too young younger than they have taken up arms and they have unique weapons none of us can wield agansing replied and turned to nan we go to join sahib and memsab we are needed yessir she said feeling oddly as if she ought to be saluting all of them moved swiftly in a group to the doors leading onto the terrace the two girls having to trot to keep up a vicious wind howled around the windows and in lightning flashes from outside it was obvious there was a storm ragingwind but no rain as yet they emerged onto the terrace and into the icy teeth of the wind just as sahib and memsab turned the avalanche has begun memsab agansing said eyes glinting it is too late to make a choice among what will fall the children summoned us they in their turn were summoned we summoned them for a moment nan was aghast at the lie but thenthen something told her it was not a lie but the truth somehow she and sarah had summoned the men or at least agansing she didnt know how but that other presence within her smiled grimly she felt it smile felt it tell her how it had summoned a fellow warrior with a mental trumpet call to arms the wind had begun to die although eerily silent lightning still raged in the clouds above them it is david alderscroft memsab was saying i dont know what he is trying to do but robin goodfellow warned him off doing so and i tried to echo that warning he she left whatever she was going to say unsaid and merely shrugged the gesture more eloquent than words of what she thought about men who refused to listen to sound advice then we have to stop him selim replied immediately by force if need be theres more nor that nan piped up urged by that silent presence within her that felt strangely like some kind of version of herself only older stronger tougher ifn robin hurts a mortal somthin bad appens e gets banished memsabs eyes grew wide in the light from the lightning oh she said ohthat would be not only the end to magic in the isle but it would open the door to a great many things that would make life very uncomfortable for the rest of us sahib said grimly with the guardian at the gate gone run memsab said suiting her actions to her words as she picked up her skirts in both hands and fled down the terrace like a racing deer run they followed her she ran like that girl in the greek myth nan had just readatalanta that was her name or something like nan snatched neville down off her shoulder and cradled him in her arms as sarah did the same with grey the birds would never have been able to stay on their shoulders while they ran it was a good thing memsab was wearing a white summer dress they were able to follow her flitting along the paths of the estate like a ghost with sahib like a shadow right beside her after a little nan realized where they were going the door in the hedge that the arrogant man had ridden through and that was where and when it all came together the man that had nearly ridden them down and the man that memsab was angry at and the man who was about to unleash all hell on them with his foolishness were all the same man and his name was david alderscroft sarah was glad that she and nan were used to playing hard she would never have believed that a grownup could run like that memsab had hiked her skirts clean up over her knees and her legs flashed through the grass in a way that should have scandalized anyone who saw it it was just a good thing that memsab never did wear the kind of dresses people called fashionable in fact sarah was not entirely sure memsab ever wore corsets either shed never have been able to run in anything fashionable sahib put on a limping burst of speed and got to the door in the hedge ahead of memsab and wrenched it open they all caught up to her and piled through the door and and they all stopped dead in their tracks sarah felt a tingle and knew that this was her moment at the same time as grey said urgently go now she shoved through the adults and saw what it was that had them paralyzed there was a crowd ofcreatureslined up on the bridle path standing as a barrier between them and wherever it was that memsab was leading them they werent physical they might have been the ghosts of children once they werent now they glowed a leprous white and where their eyes should have been there were only empty holes with a dull red gleam to them as if old dying embers lay at the bottom their unnaturally long fingers were crooked into vicious claws and in place of fingernails they had talons their mouths were agape showing feral pointed teeth and a craving for fear and pain emanated from them in a way calculated to make any sane person turn and flee except except they were the spirits of children still and under all that they were lost alone afraid and that was what sarah must reach she put grey on her shoulder and felt the parrot spread her wings as if giving her shelter sarah sahib began but memsab shushed him give her backing my brothers she said instead and sarah felt a steady warm glow building behind her a warmth of love and support as nan pushed through also and came to stand beside her she cast a glance aside nannan was a warrior the transformation was complete instead of the little girl in the pinafore what stood beside sarah was a wild creature out of an old celtic saga a glowing golden fighting maiden in a short red wool tunic with a short bronze sword and a slight smile on her face that was just the least little bit disturbing in its enthusiasm i see what needs be done sister nan said with no trace of her usual accent this is old magic and i know it well i shall sever the soul from the rider so you can set the spirits free and with no more warning than that she leaped at the line of waiting creatures then leaped in among them and began to dance that was all that sarah could call it the creatures swarmed her but seemed unable to touch her with neville making vicious stabs at weirdly transparent faces battering them with his wings nan danced among them feinting leaping whirling never staying in any one place for long until strike the sword licked out and there was a cry and something with tattered wings and a terrible face separated from the seething mob as the spirit of a small child faded and frightened dropped out of it come sarah called holding out her arms to it casting her heart toward it it fled to her and as it neared with a cry grey stood on her tiptoes and spread her wings wide and a bright light surrounded them both the child ghost flung itself at them touched the lightand vanished the thing that had separated from it uttered a scream of mingled rage and fear and popped like a soap bubble just as nan made another of those lightning strikes and severed another rider from its victim sarah lost track of what was going on it took all of her strength and concentration to help grey keep opening that door to the beyond and persuade the children to pass through it but eventually grey settled down on her shoulder again shook herself and uttered a soft tired sigh the light around them faded and she blinked to see that the golden warrior was gone and there was only nan standing on the path with neville at her feet looking disheveled and tiredbut triumphant but there was no time for congratulations there was a cold ominous glow beyond the trees and the clouds were swirling in a whirl over the spot lightning firing almost continuously from them run memsab called again and they ran david alderscroft was beginning to feel misgivings about all this it didnt feel right he couldnt put his finger on why it just didnt maybe it was the strange storm that had sprung up wind clouds and more lightning than he had ever seen before but no rain maybe it was the oddly eager light in cordelias eyes maybe it was an uneasy feeling that he did not know nearly enough about what she was going to door said she was going to do or that he sensed an invisible icy presence lingering somewhere nearby it was not one of the ice wurms he was used to using it was a lotlarger and it was able to conceal itself from him almost entirely why would it want to do that the longer he stood here in the lightninglit garden watching cordelia set out her preparations the more his instincts were overriding his control from nagging doubt to insisting from insisting to screaming they were telling him that despite all appearances this was a bad idea that he should leave except that his instincts had told him this sort of nonsense before he was more than instinct he was a rational thinking man and all this fear could be the work of that very nature spirit that cordelia meant to protect him against and yetthe spirit had been very specific it had warned him against practicing his ice magics here and no more or actually it had warned him against practicing them against the countryside as if there was any reason why he would do that so why was cordelia so intent on protecting him from it it wasnt as if he had any reason to practice any magic at all in this place and the creature hadnt done anything worse than frighten him as he stood there uncertainly with a tempest overhead and growing misgivings in his heart the solitude of that corner of the garden was broken not once but twice and in that moment everything changed a bolt of lightning struck the ground to the east of where he and cordelia stood blinding and deafening him for a moment and when he could see again he felt himself go rigid it was the nature spirit again butdifferent very different it was taller its features were sharper and it was dressed head to toe in black surrounded by a coruscating rainbow of all powers it stared at him and cordelia in a dark rage that was when the thing that david had only sensed until this moment made itself visible to the west of where he and cordelia stood ormore visible there was something about whatever the entity was that made him struggle without success to keep his eyes on the spot where it stood and he couldnt look directly at the thing at all his eyes and his mind slid around the edges of it without being able to concentrate on it and thenseven people strode into the garden as if they had every right to be there two of them he did not know but both were clearly foreign probably from some part of india one he recognized as the servant that had let him into frederick hartons home and school the fourth was frederick harton himself and fifth and sixth were the two little girls he had nearly run down and the seventh the seventh was isabelle cordelia drew herself up in surprise well she said i confess i had not expected you to turn up here isnt it rather late in the day to be playing the rejected lover isabelle ignored her the lightning made for a poor illumination source washing out all colors and it occurred to david then that she looked like a marble monument her hair had come down and tumbled in wild profusion down her back david she called her voice trembling a little you do not want to be here oh indeed cordelia replied her own voice utterly coldly polite and why would that be i wonder surely you are not going to claim that i have some nefarious designs upon him simple logic would show that if indeed i had wanted something of his power and position i would have had it long ago isabelle ignored the jab and concentrated on david you need to ask yourself why it was so needful that you be here now in the middle of the night alone this woman is not your friend and you are cordelia did not laugh this sort of flummery was all very well when you were a girl isabelle but it illsuits a grown woman who should have better selfcontrol and a more realistic view of life isabelle continued to ignore her david when has she offered you so much as a single moment of honest friendship he paused there was something stirring inside him at her question what do you mean he asked cautiously ordinary friendship isabelle persisted spending time in one anothers company not because you were expecting some sort of gain but merely because you enjoy spending time there with him friendship david could remember having friends he could recall hours spent playing parlor games or having discussions on anything and everything long into the night he remembered dimly the pleasure he had gotten from it when had he stopped doing that what nonsense cordelias eyes glinted this foolishness is for children adults have no such need begone a rumble of thunder followed the word but overhead the storm was dying and the nature spirit was listening intently i am not one of your familiar spirits to be banished with a word cordelia isabelle said sharply david you cannot go through life in isolation seeing others as objects to be manipulated and used and watching for the same behavior in others and that was exactly what his life had become he saw it in a stunning moment of clarity he had not done a single thing he truly enjoyed in the last year nor spent a single moment in the company of someone he would have sought out on his own what had his life turned into there are more important and more lasting things than power and position david isabelle continued power is ephemeral and can be taken away position is just as ephemeral but no one can take love and friendship you can lose them by your own actions or lack of them or by neglect but they cannot be taken away the clouds parted overhead and bright moonlight shone down on them the spirit moved closer head tilted to one side she glanced at her companions as she said that and they moved closer to her her husband put one hand on her shoulder and in another moment of clarity david saw what he had not seen before these people were not masters pupils and servants they were also friends and what of his friends he recalled their names and faces clearly and they were no longer in his circle he had told himself he had outgrown them but that was not the truth the truth was he had thrust them away or ignored them because cordelia had told him that his precious time was too valuable to waste in their company and so they had stopped calling on him stopped issuing him invitations and he turned from friends to those who were politically valuable his life had become an unending round of work he no longer even read things that were not in some way related to his ambitions he looked back over the past several years and saw nothing but empty hours gray and uninteresting he looked ahead to the future and tried to imagine what life would be like if he achieved those ambitions surely it would be worth the cost but he realized with a sinking spirit and a feeling of nausea that it would only be more of the same more empty pleasureless years punctuated by a few hours of fame which would only bring him to the attentions of people who were just like him who had ambitions of their own and hoped to maneuver him to get something if he married it would be to a woman who brought him more connections perhaps more wealth who would spend as little time as possible in his company she would be too busy exercising her own ambitions to become a notable hostess in the most exclusive of sets even if she felt some dim stirrings of affection she would have no time for anything other than bearing the heir and a spare required of her and furthering her own social climb what was the last moment of simple pleasure you remember having david isabelle asked quietly something you enjoyed for its own sake with a plummeting heart he realized that the only simple moment of pleasure he had experienced in the last several weeks was sitting down to dinner in his club and enjoying a wellcooked meal weeks he had gone weeks with the only memorable moment being a meal cordelia glanced sharply at all of them and must have sensed that she was losing him enough she barked but he was too deep in despair at his situation now to pay any attention to the author of his misery he looked at isabelle who had one hand resting affectionately on the shoulders of each of the childrenat her husband whose very posture proclaimed that he would quite cheerfully and publicly take her into his arms for a loving embrace at any moment and know it would be returned with equal fervor he looked at the three servants whose protective posture said that they would lay down their lives for these friends these children were not even isabelles by birth and yet he could see they loved her unreservedly if he had children of his own they would grow up in the company of nannies and nursemaids tutors and governesses they would be sent away to school return home only for a few days at a time and over the course of twenty years if he was in their presence for a grand total of six weeks worth of time it would be amazing they would call him pater and they would respect him but they would not love him and when he died he would go to his grave with their dutiful attendance and concealed pleasure that he was gone and they could now enjoy his wealth and property unfettered by any rules or constraints of that stranger who had been their father the hartons were surrounded by servants who loved and protected them he was surrounded by servants who probably resented and definitely cheated him frederick had a wife who so clearly adored him that nothing made her unhappy except to be separated from him he lived in a lonely empty house a condition that would not change even if he took a wife of his own i would not exchange a single moment of my life for all of your wealth david isabelle told him as cordelia seethed your power cannot buy me peace your position cannot bring me friendship your estates cannot give me hope and your wealth cannot purchase love her voice took on tones of remote pity what you have is worth nothing to me and this is what cordelia has brought you to bleak black despair settled over him like a blanket if he could have gotten himself past the shame of it he would have wept by now he was a cold heartless ruthless creature he had lost the friends he had once had and no longer knew how to make new ones and as for love he had driven it away he stared at isabelle numbly wanting to howl his grief to the moon the little girl with the parrot looked up at him solemnly and paced forward until she stood a mere foot from him and she held out her hand ill be your friend mister alderscroft she said soberly cause sometimes the reason you are friends with someone is that they need one something broke inside himor perhaps it was better to say that something melted tears burned in his eyes as he took the childs hand they overflowed and trickled down his cheeks the child tugged on his hand and drew him to stand beside her friends cordelias cheeks flamed and she made a summoning gesture you flout me at your peril she exclaimed you they have the protection of robin goodfellow sorceress said the earth spirit coming to stand on the other side of isabelle the fey do not take sides in mortal quarrelsbut i am a law unto myself and i say they are under my protectionand have my friendship undeterred cordelia voiced the words of power to bring her creatures to her but david with a little shock of surprise that he still recalled the words called upon the allies of his true element of fire to come to his aid after the way he had shunned them he would not have been surprised that they did not answer but they did a rain a stream a river of salamanders greater and lesser of imps and lyons and firebirds and even a phoenix all came crowding about him at his summons as if they had only been waiting for this moment they stood shoulder to shoulder in a compact group of solidarity surrounded by creatures of fire and at last the nearinvisible ice lord spoke you have failed woman it said you are mine in the blink of an eye it somehow surrounded her and before she had a chance to scream or cry out they were both gone epilogue david alderscroft surveyed his quarters with melancholy satisfaction he had closed and sold his town house and moved into rooms at his club men in general were not so exacting of the requirements of friendship as women were some weeks and months of careful tending and he would soon be living among men who considered themselves his friend and at that point he would begin renewing his acquaintance with those old friends he had thrust aside they would take some more careful cultivation but eventually he thought he could win them over again and he would never make the mistake of losing them twice but there was no point in keeping up his town house because he knew deep inside that he would never need it for he would never marry he had rejected love once unlike friendship that sort of chance never came again in the moment that his heart had thawed it had also broken and it was his own damned fault still in the midst of heartbreakthere were the little compensations he glanced affectionately at the pasteboard square in his hand dear uncle david it said please come to the school this weekend we want to show you the new ponies and take you riding on the paths we have been cutting and we have decided to make september th nans official birthday there will be cake and ice creams love sarah davids old estate was no longer empty and hollow it rang with the happy voices of childrenthe children of elemental mages the children of the talented and gifted and the children of expatriates it was now the home to the harton school and he trusted would provide a harvest of fine young men and women for decades to come it was a good legacy and he planned to create a second as well his circle would work not only for the protection of mages and masters but for the protection of all of england so that another creature like the ice lord could never slip onto the island without someone noticing good legacies both of them he set down sarahs invitation picked up a pen and began to write out his acceptance when a second piece of paper fluttered to the ground without his prompting a salamander manifested darted to the floor and retrieved it returning it to the desk only slightly scorched isabelles note attached to fredericks accepting an honorary chair in the london circle as spokesman for the talented and gifted in response to his addendum that he was sorry he could not invite her but that as the club was exclusively male dear david if i wanted to prance around infancy dress i would join the order of the golden dawn their robes are just as ridiculous and they serve a better tea affectionately isabelle the salamanders danced as the room rang with laughter
