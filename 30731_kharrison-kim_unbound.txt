unbound by kim harrison jeaniene frost vicki pettersson jocelynn drake and melissa marr ley line drifter kim harrison the dim gloom was heavy in the lower level of jenkss stump only the high ceiling of the cavernous great room still holding the fading haze of the setting sun working by the glow of his dragonflylike wings jenks hovered in the wide archway leading to the storerooms feet dangling and shoulders aching as he smoothed a nick from the lintel the smell of last years garden drifted up past him musty dandelion fluff dried jasmine blossoms and the last of the sweet clover used for their beds matalina was a traditionalist and didnt like the foam hed cut from a sofa hed found at the curb last fall the rasping of his lathe against the living oak only accentuated the absence of his kids the quiet was both odd and comforting after a winter spent in his humansize partners church shifting his lower wings to push the glowing silver pixy dust upward to light his work jenks ran a hand across the wood to gauge the new decorative curve a slow smile spread across his face tinks panties shell never know he whispered pleased the gouge his daughter had made while chasing her brother was now rubbed out all that was needed was to smooth it and his beautiful and ohsoclever wife would never know or at least shed never say anything satisfied jenks tilted his wings and darted to his tools he wouldve asked his daughter to fix the archway but it took cold metal and at five jolivia didnt yet have the finesse to handle toxic metal spilling more dust to light his wellused tools he chose an emery board swiped from rachels bathroom late march he thought as he returned to his work the sparse sawdust mixing with his own pixy dust as he worked in the silence and chill late march and they still hadnt moved back into the garden from rachels desk on loan for the winter the days were warm enough and the nights would be fine with the main hearth lit cincinnatis pixies were long out of hibernation and if they didnt move into the garden soon someone might try to claim it just yesterday his kids had chased off three fairy scouts lurking about the far graveyard wall breath held against the oak dust jenks wondered how many children he would lose this fall to romance and how it would affect the gardens security not much now with only eight children nearing the age of leaving next year though eleven more would join them with no newlings to replace them a burst of anxious motion from his wings lit a larger circle to show the winterabandoned cushions about the main central hearth but it wasnt until a sudden commotion at the groundfloor tunnel entrance that he spilled enough dust to light the edges to show the shelves cupboards and hooks built right into the living walls of the stump if theres no snapped wings or bones sticking out i dont want to hear about it he shouted his mood brightening as he recognized his childrens voices papa papa jerrimatt one of his youngest sons shouted in excitement as he darted in trailing silver dust we caught an intruder at the street wall he wouldnt leave even when we scared him he said he wanted to talk to you hes a poacher i bet and i saw him first jenks rose alarmed you didnt kill him did you naww the suddenly dejected boy said as he tossed his blond hair in a credible mimicry of his dad i know the rules he had red on exhaling jenks let his feet touch the ground as in a noisy mob jack jhem jumoke and jixy pushed a fifth pixy wingstumbling into the room he was on the fence jixy said roughly shoving the stranger again to make his wings hum and she touched her wooden sword ready to smack him if he made to fly she was the eldest in the group and she took her seniority seriously he was looking at our flower beds jumoke added the darkhaired pixys scowl made him look fiercer than usual adding to his unusual dark coloring and he was lurking jack exclaimed if there was trouble jack would be in it the five were on sentry detail this evening and jenks set the emery board aside eyeing his own sword of pixy steel nearby he would rather have it on his hip but this was his home damn it he shouldnt need to wear it inside yet here he was with a strange pixy in his main room jerrimatt all of three years old was flitting like a firefly on brimstone reaching up jenks caught his foot and dragged him down he is wearing red jenks reminded him glad they hadnt drawn blood from the hapless pixy wideeyed and scared he gets passage he doesnt want passage jerrimatt protested and jixy nodded he was just sitting there he says he wants to talk to you plotting jixy added suspiciously hiding behind a color of truce hes pixy trash she threatened to smack him stopping only when jenks sent his wings clattering in disapproval the intruder stood with his feet meekly on the floor his wings closed against his back and glancing uneasily at jumoke his red hat of truce was in his hands fingers going around and around the brim i wasnt plotting he said indignantly i have my own garden again his gaze landed on jumoke in question and jenks felt a prick of anger then why are you looking at ours jhem demanded oblivious to the intruders prejudice against jumokes dark hair and eyes but when jhem went to push him jenks buzzed a warning again eyes down jhem dropped back his children were wonderful but it was hard to teach restraint when quick swordpoint justice was the only reason they survived at a loss jenks extended a hand to the ruffled pixy as his children watched sullenly the pixy buck before him looked about twelve or thirteen old enough to be on his own and trying to start a family married by the clean and repaired state of his clothes he was healthy and wellwinged though they were now blue with the lack of circulation and pressed against his back in submission the unfamiliar sword in jumokes grip led jenks to believe the intruders claim to having a garden was likely not an exaggeration even if it was fairy steel not pixy the young buck wasnt poaching so what did he want jenkss own suspicions rose why are you here he asked his focus sliding again to his own sword set carelessly next to his tools and whats your name vincet the pixy said immediately his eyes roving over the sunset gray ceiling you live in a castle he breathed as his wings rose slightly where is everyone vincet jenks thought wary even as he straightened with pride at vincets words concerning his home a sixletter name and out on his own with cold steel pixies born early into a family had short names those born later the longest vincet was the fifth brood of newlings in his family to survive to naming that he had a blade and a long name to his credit meant that his birth clan was strong it was the children born late in a pixys life that suffered the most when their parents died and the clan fell apart most children with names longer than eight letters never made it jerrimatt thoughjenkss smile grew fond as he looked at the blond youngster scowling fiercely at vincet jerrimatt his birth brother and both his birth sisters would survive matalina was stronger now that she wasnt having children anymore one or two more seasons and all her children would survive her it was what she prayed for not knowing why he trusted vincet jenks gestured for his children to relax and they began shoving one another the earths chill soaked into jenks now that he wasnt moving and he wished hed started a fire i heard you investigate things vincet blurted his wings lifting slightly as the kids ringing him drifted a few paces back im not poaching i need your help you want rachel or ivy jenks rose up to show him the way into the church rachel is out he said glad now he hadnt accompanied her on her shopping trip as she searched for some obscure text her demonic teacher wanted shed be in the everafter tomorrow for her weekly teaching stint with the demon and of course shed waited until the last moment to find the book but ivy is here no vincet exclaimed his wings blurring but his feet solidly on the pokerchip floor rightfully worried about jenkss kids i want your help not some lunkers i dont have anything theyd want and i pay my debts theyll tell me to move and i cant i want you his kids stopped their incessant shoving and jenkss feet touched the cold floor a job he thought excitement zinging through him for me alone will you help me vincet asked the dust from him turning a clear silver as he regained his courage and his wings shivered to try and warm himself my newlings are in danger my wife my three children i dont dare move now its too late well lose the newlings maybe the children too theres nowhere to go newlings jenks thought his focus blurring a newborn pixys life was so chancy that they werent given names or considered children until they proved able to survive to bury a newling wasnt considered as bad as burying a child though that was a lie he and matalina had lost their entire birthing the year they moved into the church and matalina hadnt had any more since thanks to his wish for sterility it had probably extended matties life but he missed the soft sounds newlings made and the pleasure he took in thinking up names as they grasped his finger and demanded another day of life newlings hell they were children every one precious jenkss gaze landed squarely on vincet assessing him thirteen with a lifetime of responsibility on him already jenkss own short span had never bothered hima fast childhood giving way to grief and heartacheuntil hed seen the other side the long adolescence and even longer life of the lunkers around them it was so unfair hed listen and if he was listening then he should probably make vincet feel at home as rachel did when people knocked on her door afraid and helpless a flush of uncertainty made his wings hum were entertaining he told his kids with a firmness hed dredged up from somewhere and they looked at one another wings drooping and at a loss pixies didnt tolerate another on their land unless marriage was being discussed much less invite him into their diggings smiling jenks gestured for vincet to sit on the wintermusty cushions trying to remember what hed seen rachel do when interviewing clients um give me his sword and get me a pot of honey he said and jerrimatt gasped hhoney the youngster stammered and jenks took the woodenhandled blade from jhan the fairy steel was evidence of a past battle won probably before vincet had left home tinks burned her cookies go jenks exclaimed waving at them vincet wants my help i dont think hes going to run me through give your dad an ounce of credit will you his cursing was familiar and knowing everything was okay they dove for the main tunnel chattering like mad i brought you all up he shouted after them conscious of vincet watching him you dont think i know a guest from a thief he added but they were gone the sound of their wings and fast speech fading as they vanished up the tunnel it grew darker as their dust settled and went out chilled jenks vibrated his wings for both warmth and light making a huff jenks handed the pixy his sword thinking hed never done anything like that before vincet took it seeming as unsure as jenks was asking for help was in neither of their traditions change came hard to pixies when adherence to rigid customs was what kept them alive but for jenks change had always been the curse that kept him going jenks darted to a second smaller hearth at the outskirts of the room for the box that held kindling insurance wouldnt allow a fire inside the church and the kit had never made it inside and if im interviewing a client he thought worried he might not make a good impression it should be by more than the glow of my dust the interview should be given the honor of the main hearth in the center of the room vincet slid his sword away his wings shivering for warmth as he looked at the ceilings um you want to sit down jenks said again as he returned with the kindling and vincet gingerly lowered himself to the edge of the cushion beside the dark fire pit though never starting outright war poaching was a plague upon pixy society even being used to bending the rules jenks felt a territorial surge when vincets eyes scanned the dim room i heard you lived in a castle of oak vincet said clearly in awe where is everyone watching him jenks struck the rocks together whispering the words to honor the pixies who first stole a live flame and to ask for a prosperous season matalina should be at his side as he started the seasons first flame and he felt a pang of worry wondering if it was wrong to do this without her right now were living in the church he said as an ember caught the charred linen glowing as he added bits of fluff were going to move out this week i hope vincets wings stilled you live inside withlunkers smiling jenks began placing small sticks with an instinctive shift of the muscles at the base of his wings he modified the dust he was laying down to make it more flammable it caught immediately and stray bits floated up like motes of stars for the winter so we dont have to hibernate ive seen snow he said proudly it burns almost and turns your fingers blue perhaps i could turn one of the storage rooms into an office he thought as he set the first of the larger sticks on the flames and rose from his knees but the thought of matalinas eyes pained as strangers violated their home repeatedly made him wince she was a grand woman saying nothing when his fairydusted schemes burned in his brain better to ask rachel to bury a flowerpot upside down in the garden beside the gate at the edge of the property hang a sign out or something if he was going to help cincinnatis pixies he should be prepared i need your help vincet said again and jenkss dust rivaled the firelight we dont hire ourselves out for territory disputes jenks said not knowing what else the pixy buck could want id not ask vincet said clearly affronted as his wings slipped a yellow dust if i cant hold a piece of ground i dont deserve to garden it my claim is strong my wife and i have land three terrified children from last year and six newlings i had seven yesterday though the young pixys voice was even his smooth childlike face clenched in heartache seeing his pain jenks settled back impressed that this was his second season as a father and he had managed to raise three children already it had taken him and matalina two seasons to get their first newlings past the winter and no newlings at all had survived that third winter im sorry he said food is hard at this time of year vincet had his head bowed mourning its not the food we have enough and both noel and i would gladly go hungry to feed our children its the statue his head came up and jenks felt a stab of concern at vincets haunted expression youve got to help meyou work with a witch its magic its driving my daughter mad in her sleep and last night when i kept her awake it killed one of my newlings jenkss wings angled to catch the heat from the fire and a sudden surge of warmth drove out the chill that had taken him a statue leaning forward jenks wished he had a clipboard or a pencil like ivy always had when she interviewed clients he didnt know what to say but a pen always made ivy look like she knew what she was doing a statue he prompted and vincet bobbed his head his blond hair going everywhere thats how we got the garden he said his words faster now that jenks was listening its in a park the flower beds abandoned no sign of pixy or fairy we didnt know why last year we held a spot of ground in the hills but lunkers cut it down built a house and didnt put in any flowers or trees to replace what they destroyed i barely got my family out alive when the dozers came noelthats my wifewas near her time she couldnt fly much the park was empty we didnt know the ground was cursed i thought it was goddesssent and now my childrenthe newlingstheyre dying in their sleep burning up jenks crossed his knees trying to look unaffected by vincets outburst but in reality he was worried rachel always got as much information as she could before saying yes or no he didnt know what difference it made but he asked what park are you in vincet licked his lips i dont know ive not heard anyone say the name of the place yet ill take you there its by a long set of steps in the middle of a grassy place it was perfect we took the flower beds dug out a small room under the roots of a dogwood noel brought to life seven newlings we were even thinking of naming them then vi my daughter began sleepflying frowning jenks shivered his wings for some light as he sat across the fire from him sleepflying shell outgrow it one of my sons spent a summer waking up in the garden more than his bed jenks smiled there was always some question if jumoke had been sleepflying or simply looking for solitude his middlebrood son endured a lot of goodnatured ribbing from his elder siblings due to his brown hair and hazel eyes rare to the point of shame among pixies vincet made a rude huff the dust from his wings turning black did your son scream in pain as his wings smoldered while he beat at a statue did his aura become sickly and pale my daughter isnt sleepflying shes being attacked i cant wake her up until the moon passes its zenith even if i bend her wing backward its been happening every night now that the moon is nearly full vincets face went riven with grief and his head dropped last night i kept her awake and the statue attacked a newling noel held him as he died unable to breathe he was screaming so it was the young pixys wings drooped and he wiped his eyes black dust slipping from his fingers when the tear dried i couldnt wake him we tried and tried but he just kept screaming as his wings turned to powder and his dust burned inside him horrified jenks shifted on his cushion not knowing what to say vincets child had burned alive vincet met his eyes begging without saying a word noel is afraid to let the newlings sleep he whispered his hands wringing and his wings still as he sat on jenkss wintermusty cushion my children are terrified of the dark a pixy shouldnt be afraid of the dark its where we belong under the sun and moon jenkss paternal instincts tugged on him vincet wasnt much older than jaxhis eldest now on his own if he hadnt seen vincets fear he would have said the pixy buck was duststruck taking a stick as thick as his arm jenks knelt to put it on the fire dusting it heavily to help it catch i dont see how a statue can cause children to go wandering he said hesitantly much less set their dust on fire are you sure thats the cause maybe its a mold or a fungus vincets dust turned a muddy shade of red as it pooled about his boots its not a mold or fungus he exclaimed and jenks eyed his sword its the statue nothing grows on it its cursed and why would her aura shift like that something is in her jenkss wings hummed as he drew back from the hearth making a statue come to life to torment pixies didnt sound like witch magic but there were other things that hadnt come out of the closet when the pixies vampires and witches hadthings that would cause humans to raze the forests and plow the abandoned smaller towns into dust if they knew but a statue and why would a statue want to destroy itself unlesssomething was trapped in it have you felt anything he asked and vincet glanced at the dark tunnel behind him no he shifted uncomfortably looking at his sword neither has noel ive nothing to give you but my sword but id gladly hand it over to you if youll help us im lost i can defend my land from fairies hummers crows and rats but i cant see what is killing my children please jenks ive come such a long way will you help me embarrassed jenks looked at the young mans sword as vincet held it out to him his face riven with helplessness i wont take another mans steel jenks said gruffly and the young pixy went terrified i have nothing else he said the tip of the sword falling to rest on his knees now i wouldnt say that jenks said and vincets wings filled the room with the sound of a thousand bees and the glow of the sun you have two hands can you make a dragonfly hut out of a flowerpot vincets hope turned to disgust ill not take charity he said standing up with his sword in a tight grip and im not stupid you have a castle and a large family you can make a dragonfly hut yourself no jenks said standing up after him i want an office on the edge of the property on the street side of the wall that divides the garden from the road can you build me that under the lilac and paint me a sign if i give you the letters for it its not garden work and i cant ask my children to make me an office my wife would pluck my wings vincet hesitated his eyes shut in a slow blink and when they opened hope shone again i can do that smiling jenks wondered if jax had made half as honorable a man the dustcaked idiot had run off poorly trained with a thief jenkss last words to him had been harsh and it bothered him for once a child left the garden he was gone forever usually but jenkss kids were changing that tradition too ill take a look jenks said me and my partner bis he added in a sudden thought rachel never went on a run without backup he should take someone too if i can help you then youll build me an office out of a flowerpot looking up at him vincet nodded relief a golden dust slipping from him thank you he said sliding his sword away with a firm intent can you come now jenks looked askance at the ceiling to estimate the light the sun was down by the looks of it and bis would be awake absolutely but ah i have to let my wife know where im going vincet sighed knowingly and together they flew up the short passage to the sun leaving the fire to go out by itself pixy situations inquire here jenks thought as he guided vincet to the garden wall to sit with jumoke while he talked with matalina what harm could ever come of that hands on his hips to maintain his balance jenks shifted his wing angle to keep his position as the night wind gusted against him before him the distant evening traffic was a background hum to the loud tvs radios and phone conversations beating on his ears in the dark coming from the brightly lit townhouses across the street behind him were the soft sounds of a wooded park the noise from the nearby city was almost intolerable but the small garden space with its two statues and profusion of flowers in the middle of the city was worth the noise pollution the barrage was likely reduced to low thumps and rumbles underground where vincet had begun to make a home for his young family his middle was empty and as he waited for vincet to return from telling noel they were back jenks fumbled in a waist pack for a sticky wad of nectar honey and peanut butter his human partners were clueless but if he didnt eat every few hours hed suffer what rachel and ivy didnt know wouldnt hurt them thats the statue eh he said when vincet rejoined him and they both came to rest on the back of a nearby bench it was across the sidewalk from vincets flower beds and staying off the greenery made both of them happiereven if he had been invited and was wearing his red bandanna like a belt he hesitated and then thinking it might be required as part of his new helping role he offered vincet a sweetball hed never given food to anyone outside his family before it felt odd and vincet blinked at him clearly shocked at the offer no thank you he said looking confused um yes thats the statue vincet pointed at the closest statue and jenks slipped the second sweetball away it wont attack until the moon is higher vincet added more at ease now that the food was put away wings shivering he glanced up at the moon a day shy of full it attacks at midnight not the lunkers clocked midnight but the real midmoon when its at its zenith jenkss attention dropped to the twin statues spaced about ten feet apart surrounded by new annuals and low shrubs both had a greek look about them with a classic beauty of smooth lines and draping robes the older statue was black in places from pollution making it almost more beautiful carved ringlets of hair pulled back and braided framed a younglooking face almost innocent in her expression her stone robes did little to hide her admittedly shapely legs from her thighs down there was a flaccid water sack on her belt and her fingers were wrapped about the butt of a sword pushing into the pedestal at her toe the second statue was of a young man with smooth almost feminine features an empty ankle sheath was on one bare leg not covered by his stone robe he was lithe thin with a hint of wild threat in his chiseled expression the sign between them framed by newly planted honeysmelling alyssum said that both statues had been donated by the kalamack foundation to commemorate cincinnati gaining city status in but only the statue of the woman looked old the other was a pearly white as if brandnew or freshly scrubbed maybe a distant argument over burned rice became audible from over the grass between the garden and the nearby townhouses tinks tampons humans were noisy it was as if they didnt have a place in the natural order anymore so they made as much noise as they could to prove they were alive his garden and graveyard stretching an entire block within the suburbs now made his by human law and a deed was a blessing hed come to take for granted rachel and ivy never seemed to make much noise course they slept a lot and ivy was a vampire if living she never made much noise to begin with did you clean it he asked vincet and the young pixy shook his head looking scared no it was like that when we got here vi wakes as if in a trance mindless as she hits the base of the statue until the burning brings her down then she screams until the moon shifts from the top of the sky and the statue lets her go jenks scratched the base of his wings puzzled though he didnt move from the back of the bench his wings sent a glitter of dust over them holy crap he had to pee again vincet pulled his frightened gaze from the white stone glinting in the light of a nearby streetlamp id fight if i could id die defending my children if i could see it is it a ghost maybe pulling his hands from his hips jenks crossed his arms it was a bad habit hed gotten from rachel and he immediately put his fists back on his hips where they belonged a sudden noise in the trees above them caught them unawares and while jenks remained standing on the back of the bench vincet darted away clearly surprised it was bis returning from his circuit of the park under jenkss direction jenks was used to giving orders but not while on a run and he nervously hoped he was doing this right with a soft hush of sliding leather and the scent of iron the catsize gargoyle landed on the back of the bench his long claws scrabbling for purchase bis could cling to a vertical slab of stone with no problem slip through a crack a bat would balk at but trying to balance on the thin back of the slatted bench was more than he could manage with an ungraceful hop he landed on the concrete sidewalk between the bench and the statues nothing larger than an opossum near here the gray smoothskinned kid said his ears pricked to make the white fur lining them stick out he had another tuft on the tip of his lionlike tail but apart from that his pebbly patterned skin was smooth able to change color to match what was around him and creep jenks out he had a serious face that looked something like a pugs shoved in and ugly but jenkss kids loved him and his cat rex was enamored of the churchs newest renter jenks sighed once the feline found out bis could kick out the btus when he wanted to adoration was a foregone conclusion bis was too young to be on his own and after having been kicked off the basilica for spitting on people hed found his way to the church slipping jenkss sentry lines like a ghost bis slept all day like a proverbial stone and he paid his rent by watching the grounds during the four hours around midnight when jenks preferred to sleep he ate pigeons feathers and all jenks was working on changing that at least the feathers part he was working on getting bis to wear some clothes too not that anything showed but if bis was wearing something jenks might catch him sneaking around on the ceiling as it was all he ever saw was claw marks thanks bis jenks said standing straighter and trying to look like he was in charge you grew up around stone whats your take on the statue is it haunted it might have been a jest if anyone else had said it but both of them knew there were such things as ghosts rachels latest catastrophe pierce was proof of that but he had been completely unnoticed when bound to his tombstone only when it had cracked had pierce escaped to harass them get a body become demonsnagged confuse rachel into a lovehate relationship something was wrong with the girl but now that he thought about it maybe thats why vincets daughter was trying to break the statue tinks a disney whore not another ghost the gargoyle flicked his whiplike tail in a shrug his powerful haunches bunched and vincet darted back with a flash of pixy dust when bis landed atop the statue in question his skin lightening to match the marble perfectly looking like part of the statue itself he scraped a claw down a fold of chiseled hair bis brought it to his nose sniffing then tasting highquality granite he said his voice both high and rumbling from argentina it was first worked hundreds of years ago but its only been here for a hundred and twenty impressed jenks raised his eyebrows you got all that from tasting it smirking to show his black teeth the kid pointed a claw to a second sign just the highquality part theres a plaque vincet sighed and jenkss wings went red wheezing his version of laugher the gargoyle hopped to the spot of light on the sidewalk seriously something is wrong both statues are on the ley line running through the park no one puts two statues on a ley lines it pins it down and weird stuff happens theres a line jenks asked seeing vincet looking understandably lost where bis pointed at nothing jenks could see cocking his ugly bald head first one way then the other as he focused on the flower beds lines dont move but they shift like the tide under the moonunless theyre pinned down something is absorbing energy from the lineright between the statues where its not moving its the statue vincet said glancing at the shadowed hole beside the dogwood tree where his family lived it comes alive when the moon is high and the pull is the strongest its possessing my daughter i dont think its the statue jenks murmured hands on his hips again i think its something trapped in it puzzled he stared at nothing his partner rachel was a witch she could see ley lines pull energy off them and use it to do magic bis could see ley lines too which made jenks doubly glad hed brought bis with him you can see it huh jenks asked its more like hear it bis said his big red eyes blinking apologetically its almost time vincet said clearly scared as he glanced up at the nearly full moon with his fingers on the hilt of his sword see as soon as the moon hits that branch it will attack vi jenks i cant move my family well lose the newlings it will break noels heart thats why were here he said putting a hand on vincets shoulder thinking it felt odd to give comfort to a pixy not of his kin the pixy buck looked too young for this much grief his smooth features creased in a pain that most lunkers didnt feel until they were thirty or forty but pixies lived only twenty years if they were lucky i wont let any of your children die tonight he added bis cleared his throat as he scraped his claws the sidewalk silently pointing out the danger in making promises that he couldnt guarantee vincets wings drooped and jenks took his hand from his shoulder maybe i should go to sleep jenks said softly if you kept all your children awake it would have no choice but to attack me too late bis made a shuffling hop to land on the benchs seat wings spread slightly to look ominous the resonance of the line just shifted sweet mother of tink vincet whispered wings flashing red as he looked at his front door its coming i have to wake them wait jenks flew after him and caught his arm their wings almost tangled and vincet yanked out of his grip theyll die he said angrily wake the newlings jenkss hand dropped to the butt of his sword let the children sleep im sorry but theyll survive ill protect vi as if she was my own vincet looked torn not wanting to trust another man with his childrens lives panicked he turned to a secluded knoll and the freshly turned earth of his newlings grave still glowing faintly from the dust of tears i cant vincet i have fiftyfour kids jenks coaxed i can keep your child alive you asked me to help i have to talk to whatever is trapped in that statue please bring her to me hesitating vincets wings hummed like a thousand bees in the dark i promise jenks said only now understanding why rachel made stupid vows she knew she might not be able to keep let me help you vincets wings turned a sickly blue i have no choice he said and trailing a gray sparkle of dust to light the dewwet plants he flew to his home and disappeared under the earth watching him jenks started to swear with oneword sentences what if he couldnt do this he was a stupidass to have promised that he was as bad as rachel angry he fingered the butt of his sword and glared at the statue bis edged closer his eyes never leaving the cold stone glinting in the moon and lamplight what if im making a mistake jenks asked you arent the gargoyle said then stiffened his glowing eyes widening as he pointed a knobby finger at the statue look at that holy crap what is it doing jenks exclaimed the heartache of a childs death gone as the moonlight seeping through the branches brushed the statue seeming to make it glow no he thought as a gust of wind pushed him back the stone really was glowing like it had a second skin it wasnt the moonlight are you seeing what im seeing jenks said dropping to land beside bis on the bench yeah the kid sounded scared somethings trapped in that stone and its still alive jenks thats not a ghost this isnt right look ive got goose bumps not looking at biss gray proffered arm jenks muttered yeah me too across the street three tvs exploded into the same laugh track the glow about the statue deepened becoming darker less like a moonbeam and more like a shadow it stretched pulling away to maintain the same shape as the statue looking like a soul trying to slip free fewmets bis barked and with a ping of energy jenks felt press against his wings the shadow separated from the statue and vanished did you see that did you freaking see that bis yelled wingtips shaking its gone jenks said unable to stop a shudder the bench shook as bis hopped to the sidewalk and tucked under the slatted wood not gone loose he said from underneath worrying jenks even more hells bells i can hear it it sounds like bird feathers sliding against each other or scales no tree branches and bones uneasy jenks slipped through the slats of the bench to alight beside bis on the sidewalk where the heat of the day still lingered watching the same empty air that the gargoyle was staring at a thin lament rose from the small hummock of vincets home the sound hit jenks and twisted and he wasnt surprised when the glow about the door brightened and in a glittering yellow pixy dust vincet emerged with a small child in his arms she was in a white nightgown her fair hair down and tousled two wideeyed children clung to the door a matronly silhouette beside them crying and unable to leave the newlings the memory of the past nights torment was on vincet when he joined them under the bench its vi he said griefstricken please you said youd help jenks awkwardly took another mans child feeling how light she was stifling a shudder when the girls unnatural silvertinted aura hit him a piercing wail came from her throat too anguished to be uttered by someone so young biss ears pinned to his skull and jenks shifted his grip binding her swinging arms and tightening his hold on her please make it stop vincet said touching his daughters face to wipe her dusty tears though it went against his instincts jenks brought the girl to his shoulder like a switch the childs wailing shifted to an eerie silence bis hissed and backed up the scent of iron sifting over them as his claws scraped the sidewalk until he found the earth jenks shivered not knowing what hed find he pulled the child from his shoulder and held her at arms length at the shift of her weight the child opened her eyes they were black with silvery pupilslike the sky and the moonand her weirdass aura trees whispered vi clearly not vi at all her voice was wispy like wind in branches this cold stone is killing me bis hissed as he clung to a tree like a misshapen squirrel black teeth bared and tail switching vincet stood helpless wings drooped and silent tears falling from him to dry into a black glittery dust he reached out and vi screamed wildly i have to get out jenks held her with her bare feet dangling it wasnt vincets daughter speaking under the hatred streaming from vis eyes was a pinched brow and a fevered panting whatever gripped vi was drawing the ley line through her thats why she burned something is wrong with it bis hissed half hidden by the tree the statue is sucking up the line like its feeding off it and i can hear it going right into her who are you jenks whispered the young girls eyes rolled to the moon free me rhenoranian she begged it i beg you have i not suffered enough rhenoranian jenkss wings blurred into motion it sounded like a demons name his hands holding vi were warm from her heat and he gently set her down catching her shoulders as she swayed oblivious to him what are you he asked changing his demand as he knelt before her youre hurting the girl maybe i can help but youre hurting vi vis eyes tore from the moon as if seeing him for the first time you can hear me she whispered as her wings smoldered limp against her back eyes focusing on jenks vincet and bis vi seemed to shake herself gracious rhenoranian you are wise and forgiving jenks rocked backward when vi flung herself at him her little arms encircling his knees bis hissed at the sudden movement and even vincet dropped back please help me she babbled her long hair tangled as she gazed up at jenks ill do anything you ask im trapped in that statuea moontouched nymph put me there jealous of my attentions to her sisters rhenoranian sent you i know he did ive waited so long break the statue quick before she comes back shes going to come back please vi begged vincet watched wideeyed as jenks disentangled himself pushing her off him and making her stand up his hands warmed where they touched her shoulders and he jerked away youre burning the child he said stop and maybe i can help anger flashed in the girls face then vanished theres no time break the statue you are killing my daughter vincet shouted you already killed my son vis eyes went wide taking a deep breath she glanced at the second statue of the woman his jailer probably and likely dead and gone nymphs had vanished during the industrial revolution long before the turn brought down by pollution im sorry she panted but the edges of vis wings were starting to smolder i didnt know i was hurting anyone ii cant help it its rhenoranians blood it keeps me alive but it burns ive been burning forever rhenoranians blood did he mean the ley line behind them bis hissed jenks he questioned i dont like this its eating the line thats wrong like three different ways of course its wrong thats why it burns vi shouted then went silent frustrated break the statue and let me out and ill never bother the child again eyes narrowing in suspicion jenks clattered his wings in acknowledgment to bis it sounded almost like a threat let it out or else but the line energy running through vi was making her tremble and the higher the moon got the worse it became soon she would be screaming in pain if vincet was right and his chance to talk to it would be gone tell me what you are he said grasping her wrist and bring her attention to him but when vi looked at him jenks let go not liking what lay in the depths of her eyes im sylvan a dryad vi said the nymph imprisoned me unfairly punishing me for my attentions to her sisters she believes shes a goddess completely touched but the demons didnt stop her why do you hesitate break my statue let me out jenks blinked surprised a dryad in a city between him and the statue bis dropped to the grass clearly amazed as well youre supposed to live in trees jenks said what are you doing in a statue twitching in pain the child looked at bis then back to jenks assessing almost i told you the nymph put me there shes touched in the head but i survived i learned to live on the energy right from a ley line instead of that filtered from a living tree though every moment i exist as if burning in hell itself i can survive in dead stone i beg you break my statue free me vis eyes went to her father with no recognition i promise ill leave you pixies in peace forgive me for the agony upon the child i cannot help it still jenks hesitated as he looked at vi the hope in her flushed face too deep for her years something wasnt right jenks pinned his wings when the wind gusted he looked up the scent of honey and gold tickling a memory hed never had vis eyes widened too late she shrieked darting to vincet she kicked his shin the pixy yelped dropping his sword to grasp his leg even as jenks flung himself into the air vi snatched the sword up running not flying to the statue her nightclothes furled behind her like a ghost and screaming she swung the blade at the stone with a ping the fairy steel broke using the broken hilt like a dagger she beat at it trying to chip the stone away jenks bis shouted and jenks turned bewildered but not alarmed until he saw what the gargoyle was pointing at a robed barefoot woman stood in the middle of the sidewalk heartshaped face aghast as she stared at the hush of cars at the edge of the park lungs heaving as if in pain she put a hand to her chest and looked at the distant buildings their lights twinkling brighter than the stars a sword was in her grip and she appeared exactly like the second statue even down to the braid her black ringlets were arranged in shining in the light as if oiled and her aura was shiny its her bis shouted bringing the womans gaze to them who dares defile my sacred grove to free sylvan she intoned robe furling as she gestured to bis is it you her arm dropped and she peered at him in the dark what are you she asked a new demon dog come into the light let me go shrieked vi struggling now in vincets arms let me go jenks darted to help vincet and still she fought them her skin red and hot to the touch at his nod bis awkwardly went to stand in the middle of the sidewalk between them im a gargoyle not a dog he said fidgeting like the teenager he was who are you the woman spun a slow circle dismissing him someone tried to free sylvan woke me from my rest did you see who it was honorableahgargoyle it was me jenks said grunting when vis foot escaped his grip and kicked him whats it to you turning to vincet he screwed his face up i gotta go talk to her can you hold her alone vincet nodded and together they got the girl facedown on the manicured grass as she howled looking miserable the young father sat on her wincing as her screams grew violent satisfied jenks rose up into the air to the womans level frowning when he saw her amusement in her steely eyes they were silver like the moon and just as warm a pixy she said laughing leave my sacred grove little sprite return to it and you will die your children will die i will hunt you down and destroy the very earth you ever walked upon go fists on his hips jenks sifted a red dust that made it all the way to the sidewalk sprite did you just call me a sprite little miss shiny aura what did you do eat a roll of tinfoil claws scraping bis edged closer his whitetufted ears pinned to his head in submission jenks he hissed not taking his eyes off the woman we should go shes doing something weird with the line but jenks flitted almost to her nose she smelled like violet sunshine and the gold pin holding her robe shut sparkled did you just threaten me little prissy pants he shot out her nostrils flared and her hand gripped her sword tighter you mock me i am daryl and you are warned jenks snickered his own hand on the butt of his sword i think if you think im going to fly away and let you keep some helpless dryad forever imprisoned burning in a ley line you got your toga too tight babe mouth open she put a hand to her chest youyou defy me she said wheezing slightly clearly not doing well do you know who i am glancing at bis who was silently looking up at him pleading with him to be nice he said you look asthmatic is what you look like forget your inhaler at the temple i am daryl she stated then coughed goddess of the woods ive learned of steel and leather to defend my sisters and you arewarned turning away she struggled to breathe see shes touched vi yelled from under vincet struggling the little girl got an arm free go crying to your demon daryl youre a concubine a minor nymph with delusions of goddesshood jenkss eyes widened as the womans coughing suddenly ceased head turning to the base of sylvans statue she straightened a murderous look was on her and jenks felt a moment of panic get out of that pixy sylvan she intoned now straining the little girl gestured rudely ay gamisou she yelled defiantly jenks had no idea what she had said but he filed it away for future use when the woman staggered back clearly appalled jenks bis whispered from under him lets go i promised to help jenks said fascinated at the color the woman was turning in her outrage and im not going to leave sylvan stuck in a statue by some nymph daryls attention flicked to jenks and bis then back to vi i will not allow you to hurt another sylvan she said loudly gesturing bis reached up wings spread as he half jumped to snag jenks from the air and pull him down biss warmth hit him as jenks cowered in his hand while a wave of nothing he could see passed over them pressing against his wings and driving the blood out his wings collapsed for an instant then rebounded on his next heartbeat vi screamed the sound reaching deep into jenks and driving him to wiggle from biss fingers his head poked free and he saw vincet spring into the air with his daughter her dust had taken on a deathly shade of black bursting into a whitehot glow as it fell from her again vis scream tore the silence of the night as daryl clenched her fist her face savage with bloodlust shes killing her vincet shouted terrified jenks shes killing my daughter get her away from the line the gargoyle cried out as he stood his ground i can see the energy flowing into her you have to get vi out of the line jenkss lips parted cursing himself as a fool he darted to vincet snatching the painracked child to him and throwing himself straight up the line the entire garden was in the line between the statues get her far enough away and the connection would break vi fought him as his ears popped painfully thumping her fists into his chest and squirming until she suddenly went terrifyingly limp vi jenks shouted scrambling to catch her as she threatened to slip from him a good forty feet up her skin was hot and her face was pale in the glow of his own dust but a profound peace was on her face and as he held her far above the dark city fear struck him deep the silver tint to her aura was gone vi he whispered jiggling her as the night cocooned them vi wake up its over oh god had he failed her was she dying killed by his own shortsightedness another mans child dead in his arms because of his failing vis lips parted sucking in air like it was water her eyes flashed open green and full of terror in the light of the moon tink save you youre okay he whispered his eyes filling with tears she was herself sylvan was no longer in her thoughts that terror of a woman no longer burned her with a frightened whimper vi threw herself at him her thin arms cold as they wrapped around his neck dont let him hurt me she begged as she cried her little body shaking please dont let the statue hurt me anymore a clear healthy glow enveloped them as jenks held her close his hand against the back of her head as he whispered it was over that she was okay and he was taking her to her papa he promised her that the statue wouldnt hurt her again and that uncle jenks would take care of everything foolish promises but he couldnt stop himself uncle jenks he thought wondering why the term had fallen into his mind but feeling it was right but below them daryl waited on the dark sidewalk and jenkswas pissed jaw clenching he descended more slowly than he wanted in order to give her younger ears a chance to adjust vincet met them halfway down his wings clattering and dusting in fear until he saw vis tears with a cry of joy the grateful man took his daughter vis sobs only strengthened his resolve get your family to ground and stay there jenks said grimly i can help vincet said even as vi clung desperately to him i know you can ill take the field you take the hearth he said falling back on the battle practices of driving off invading fairies one always stayed in earth to defend the hearthto the end if it came to that vincet looked as if he was going to protest then probably remembering his sword was broken at the base of the statue he nodded darting away with vi to vanish beneath the dogwood free and anger burning in his wings jenks drew his sword and dropped to where bis was clinging to sylvans statue hissing at daryl as she stood in a spot of light with a satisfied smile what the hell is wrong with you jenks shouted darting to a stop inches from the woman to make her jerk back you could have killed her shes only a year old daryls thin eyebrows rose a pixy she said haughtily then stifled a cough take your complaint to what demon will listen to you sylvan is in that statue and there he will stay ill take my complaint to you jenks shouted poking his sword at her nose the woman shrieked robes furling as she swung her fist to miss him completely you cut me you filthy little mouse jenks darted back only to dive in again to slice another cut under her eye im letting sylvan go if only to piss you off you look like a sorority sister in hell week with that discount sheet around you what is that a onefifty thread count my threeyearold can weave better than that clasping a hand over her eye the woman shrieked her voice echoing in the darkness ill destroy you for that she cried spinning to keep jenks in front of her jenks bis said loudly half hiding behind sylvans statue maybe we should leave the goddess alone goddess jenks pulled up a safe eight feet into the air his sword glinted red in the lamplight and his wings hummed cocky he dropped back down shes no goddess shes a whiny little girl angry at the womans lack of respect jenks slashed at her robes with each word uh jenks bis warbled his creased face bunched in worry as she screeched get out of here jenks yelled at her like she was a stray dog go find a museum or something thats where you belong tell them jenks sent you panting the woman came to a halt staring up at him her face was red and determination was equally mixed with anger a car door slammed in the distance someone had heard her and was coming across the wide expanse of lawn oblivious the woman jumped straight up at him with a fierce yell holy crap jenks exclaimed darting up but the woman had sprung to her statue scattering bis and using it to make another leap for him whoa lady chill out jenks shouted as he darted to the nearby tree immediately he realized his mistake when daryl leapt into the branches following him i am a goddess she screamed her sword thunking into the branches as he dodged her you will die pixy your name will be forgotten anyone who aligns themselves with sylvan is a shade still walking maybe he went too far jenks wondered as her blade got closer with each swing but before he could retreat his wings unexpectedly froze he had a glimpse of daryl blowing at him with her lips pursed and then he plummeted falling through the leaves to the cement below no jenks exclaimed as the smacking of leaves against his back ceased and he dropped into free fall a yelp escaped him when long thin gray fingers caught him pulling him closer to the ashy scent of iron and dry stone above daryl scrambled to reach the ground bis jenks said dazed as he looked up to the gargoyles red eyes good god we have to get out of here yeah thats what ive been telling you bis said dryly in the distance the sound of car doors slamming and the revving of an engine told him whoever it was was now leaving bis landed again on sylvans statue shaking in fear carefully testing his wings jenks took to the air daryl was again on the sidewalk her steely eyes watching them both in evaluation you okay bis said as his claws scratched the statues forehead yeah he said stretching his shoulders and wondering if there was a remaining stiffness we have to get this bitch away from the garden before she hurts someone how bis was trembling his eyes wide and whirling grinning jenks rose farther up into the air ill get her to follow me he said to the gargoyle then turned to the woman hey bright eyes whats your problem with sylvan did the dude bump uglies with one of your girlfriends jenks shifted his hips back and forth to make sure she knew what he was talking about and daryls eyes narrowed with no warning she came at him silently her robes furling in the wind from her passage adrenaline pushing him jenks darted into the green field leading her away the city was nearby hed get her among the buildings then ditch her the cops would pick her up for disturbing the peace inderland security would love bringing in a thoughttobeextinct species of inderlander with a goddess complex but that was their job laughing jenks sped across the grass dark and black with the night a ripple of wind shifted under his wings and he looked down an eerie keening dove down upon him and in a surge of panic he found himself tossed in a sudden whirlwind his sense of direction vanished tumbling the wind beat at him almost a living force bending his wings and tearing his breath from his lungs starved for air and out of control he fell out of the sky and slammed into the ground the wind collapsed on him bringing him to his knees eyes shut he held his wings to his back one hand gripping his sword the other clenched upon the grass to keep him from spinning away just as suddenly as it came upon him the wind broke into a thousand pieces of shrill voice and vanished dazed he looked up still kneeling daryl was standing over him her silver eyes gleaming like a cats in the dark wheezing from the pollution she raised her foot you are rude and you will die oh shit jenks whispered a dark gray streak slammed into her chest and stumbling daryl fell back bis jenks exclaimed as the gargoyle swung back around plucking him from the ground and holding him close tink loves a duck youre a great backup you cant fly bis said breathlessly youre too light lets get out of here kay jenks said grateful but feeling somewhat sheepish this was the kind of spot he was always getting rachel out of he didnt like being carried but if the woman could whistle up the wind then hed be better off with bis the moon had shifted and vincet and his family would be okay for another day if the garden was sacred daryl wouldnt be likely to tear it apart behind them came an infuriated shriek and jenks cringed when the roar of the wind came again wiggling he inched himself up to look over biss shoulder not liking the dips and swerves bis was putting into his flight squinting he looked behind him expecting to see a frustrated women standing alone but the grass was empty satisfaction filled him until he saw the black boiling cloud bearing down on them rolling over the grass to leave it untouched holy shit he exclaimed seeing a tiny white figure at the center bis shes flying the freaky bitch is flying biss smooth wing beats faltered glancing back he gulped shes riding a ley line jenks i dont know how shes doing it or what she is pointing at them with her sword the woman clenched her teeth and grinned clearly eager for battle her oiled ringlets lay flat and her robe plastered to her like a second skin the chugging of heavy air reverberated off the nearby buildings but the trees were utterly still go shrilled jenks smacking biss shoulder go to ground the heat off the street was a wave as they left the park town homes gave way to buildings flashing past and reduced to blurs cars were moments of light and noise and still she came on leaving the sound of horns and folding metal in her wake glass shattered and jenks hunched into biss protection a new terror filling him as he realized that to take to the air now would be his death biss flight grew sickeningly erratic among the buildings and jenks looked behind him they werent going to make it down he screamed voice lost in the shrieking wind go to ground bis twisting wildly bis brought his wings in close diving for a gutter drain ohhhhh noooo jenks exclaimed ducking his head wings back winging furiously in the sudden dark bis hit the wall with a grunt sliding down to land in a sludge of water and goo putrid muck splashed up coating jenks in cold shaking his head he lay on bis and tried to figure out what happened im in a hole he realized his pulse hammering hard enough to shake him im alive above him the wind shrieked sounding like a woman screaming in battle bis shifted underneath him and jenks put a finger to his own lips when the gargoyles eyes opened together they listened to the destruction as glass shattered and heavy things hit the earth slowly the roaring wind faded to leave the frightened calls of people and the growing sounds of sirens shaking bis began to wheeze in laugher holy pigeon poop that was close he said sitting up slowly until jenks took to the air jenkss flash of anger at biss mirth dissolved as he realized they were okay and they would both live to see the sun rise watch this ill get her to follow me bis he said shaking his wings until a sludgy dust spilled from him to light the hole bis stood shindeep in the muck his skin shifting toward pink as he upped his body temp appreciating the warmth jenks moved to his shoulder and tried to wipe the muck off his clothes matalina wouldnt be happy and he enviously watched the mud dry and flake off bis think shes gone bis asked as he gazed up to the rectangle of brighter dark jenks darted to the opening and the fresher air to hover with his head in the opening hands on his hips he whistled long and low she tore up the street he said loudly looking up at the broken streetlights powers out cops are coming lets get out of here the scrabbling of claws made him shiver and he made the quick flight to the sidewalk when bis slid out like an octopus bis shook his wings and sniffed at his armpits then turned black to remain unnoticed the sirens were coming closer seeming to pull the distraught people together frowning bis somberly clicked his nails in a rhythm that jenks recognized as mozart as he took in the tossed cars and broken windows fingers shaking jenks wedged a sweetball out of his belt pack and sucked on it replenishing his sugar level before he started to burn muscle do you think all nymphs were like that jenks asked glad the muck hadnt gotten to his snack beats me with a push of his wings bis was airborne jenks joined him shifting to fly above him where they could still talk the night air felt heavy and warm unusually muggy as they flew straight down the street and to the park only a small section of the city was without power and it looked like the park was untouched maybe we should check on vincet jenks said and the gargoyle sighed turning back to the cooler grass to check but jenks was already thinking about tomorrow he had promised to help vincet and he wouldeven if it was a dryad trapped in a statue by a warrior nymph he had to help these people and he had to do so before midnight tomorrow even from inside the desk jenks could hear cincinnati waking up across the river under the faint radio playing three houses down the deep thumps of distant industry were like a heartbeat only pixies and fairies could hear the hum of a thousand cars reminded him of the beehive hed tormented when he was a child and living in the wild stretches between the surviving cities it wasnt a bad life living in the cityif you could find food worried he sat in his favorite chair thinking as his family lived life around him the doll furniture he reclined in had been purchased last year at a yard sale for a nickel but after stripping it down reupholstering it with spider silk and stuffing it with down from the cottonwood at the corner he thought it was nicer than anything hed seen in any store rachel had taken him in nicer than trent kalamacks furniture even distant he rubbed his thumb over the ivy pattern that matalina had woven into the fabric she was a master at her craft especially now a faint sifting of dust slipped from him to puddle under the chair but his glow was almost lost in the shaft of light slipping in through the crack of the rolltop desk the massive oak desk with its nooks and crannies had been their home for the winter but after matalina had perched herself on the steeple last night to wait for his return shed breathed in the season and decided it was time to move so move they did the voices of his daughters raised in chatter were hardly noticed as was the bawdy poem four of his elder sons were shouting as they cheerfully grabbed the corners of the long table made of popsicle sticks and headed for the toonarrow crack matalinas voice rose in direction and the rolltop rose just enough it wasnt until matalina sent the rest of them out to scout for a nest of wasps to steal sentries from that it grew quiet all his children had lived through the winter it was a day of celebration but the weight of responsibility was on him responsibility wasnt new to him but he was surprised to feel itseeing as it was coming from an unexpected source hed always felt bad for pixies not as well off as he but that was as far as it had ever gone a part of him wanted to tell vincet that he chose badly and hed have to move newlings or not but vi clinging helplessly to him had gone through jenks like fire and the smell of the newlings on vincet kept him sitting where he was thinking jax had been his first newling hed managed to keep alive through the winter jih his eldest daughter had survived in matalinas arms that same season scarcely nine years old jih had moved across the street alone to start a garden and jax left to follow in his fathers footsteps by partnering with a thief instead of devoting himself to a family and the earth jenks had never wanted more than to tend a spot of ground but four years ago forced by a late spring and suffering newlings hed shamefully taken a parttime job as backup for inderland security finding that he not only enjoyed it but was good at it working for the man had eventually evolved into a partnership with rachel and ivy and now he was on the streets more than in the garden turning his back on his first independent job wasnt going to happen blowing up the statue wouldnt be the hard partit would be getting around daryl to do it a nymph and a dryad he thought sourly as he sucked on a sweetball in the quiet why couldnt it be something he knew something about nymphs had vanished during the industrial revolution and the dryads had been decimated by deforestation shortly after that there was even a conspiracy theory that the dryads had been responsible for the plague that had wiped out a big chunk of humanity forty years ago if so it had sort of worked the forests were returning and eightyyearold trees were again becoming common nymphs though were still missing sleeping maybe and what about daryl anyway a deluded nymph sylvan had said a goddess daryl claimed there were no gods or goddesses never had been but there were documented histories of inderlanders taking advantage of humans posing as deities he frowned her eyes were downright creepy and he hadnt liked demons being mentioned either jenks started jerking when his chair moved the breeze of four pairs of dragonfly wings blew the red dust of surprise from him and he looked up to find four of his boys trying to move his chair with him in it they were all grinning at him looking alike despite jumokes dark hair and eyes in matching pants and tunics that matalina had stitched enough matalina called out in a mock anger her feet in a shaft of light a dusting rag in her hands and a flush to her cheeks leave your papa alone theres the girls things to be moved if you need something to do sorry papa jack said cheerfully dropping his corner to make the chair thump jenkss feet flew up and his wing bent back under him didnt see you there dust a little jaul said tangling his wings with jacks and jack dusted heavily shifting as he pushed him away the fairies will think youre dead he finished sneezing come and carry you away jumoke added his wings lower in pitch than everyone elses it made him different along with his dusky coloring and jenks worried not liking how vincet had looked at him as if he were ill or deformed jake just grinned his wings glittering as he hovered in the background apart from jumoke they were the eldest in the garden now as freshfaced and innocent as they should be strong and able to use a sword to kill an intruder twice their size he loved them but it was likely this would be the last spring theyd help the family move jack especially would probably find wanderlust on him this fall and leave go do what your mother said he grumped grabbing four sweetballs from the bowl beside him and throwing them to each boy in turn and keep your sugar level up youre no good to me laid flat out in a field thanks papa they chorused cheeks bulging it kept them quiet too matalina came closer smiling fondly as she shooed them out go on after the girls room find the big pots and fill them check for cracks im soaking spider sacks tomorrow for the silk theyve been in the cool room all winter if were not careful were going to have a hatching im not going to make your clothes out of moonbeams you know naked in the garden is okay with me jumoke mumbled and matalina swatted him out remember what happened the last year jaul said his words muffled from the sweetball as they headed for opening webs everywhere jack said laughing yeah well youre the one that moved the sacks into the sun jumoke said and they were gone the dust from them settling in a glowing puddle to slowly fade how else was i going to win the bet as to when they were going to hatch came faintly from outside the desk and jenks chuckled it had been an unholy mess slowly their voices vanished and jenks watched matalinas expression gauging her mood as she smiled wings stilling she walked across the varnished oak wood to settle next to him their wings tangling as she snuggled in against him slowly their mingling dust shifted to the same contented gold i cant wait to get back into the garden she said gazing at the pile of laundry across the room ill admit i dont like moving day but ill not set myself to sleep like that again with the fear of guessing who might not wake up with me in the spring reaching to the bowl she deftly twisted a sweetball into two parts and handed him half youre quiet whats got your updraft cold this morning nothing setting his half of the sweet back in the bowl he draped his arm over her shoulder moving his thumb gently against her arm remembering the smell of the newlings he dropped his gaze to her flat belly not swelling with life for more than a year now his wish for sterility might have extended her lifebut had it also made her last years empty setting her sweetball aside as well matalina shifted from him pulling out of his reach to sit facing him is it the pixy that you and bis went into cincinnati to help im proud of you for that the children enjoy watching the garden when youre gone they feel important and theyll be all the more prepared when theyve a garden of their own a garden of their own he thought his children were leaving vincets children were so young his entire adult life was before him mattie do you ever wish for newlings he asked her eyes fell from his and her breath seemed to catch as she stared at the piles of clothes fear struck jenks at her silence and he sat up to take her hands in his tinks tears im sorry he blurted i thought you didnt want any more you saidwe talked about it smiling to look even more beautiful matalina placed a fingertip to his lips hush she breathed leaning her head forward to touch his as her finger dropped away jenks love of course i miss newlings every time jrixibell or any of the last children do something for the first time i think that ill never see the joy of that discovery on another childs face but i dont want any more children who wont survive a day after me worried he shifted closer his hands tightening on hers mattie about that he started but she shook her head and the dust falling from her took on a red tinge no she said firmly weve been over this i wont take that curse so i can have another twenty years of life im going to step from the wheel happy when i reach the end knowing all my children will survive my passing no other pixy woman can say that its a gift jenks and i thank you for it beautiful and smiling she leaned forward to kiss him but he would have none of it anger joining his frustration he pulled away why wont she even listen ever since hed taken that curse to get lunkersize for a week his flagging endurance had returned full force it had fixed his mangled foot and erased the fairy steel scar that had pained him during thunderstorms it was as if he was brandnew and mattie wasnt mattie please he began but as every other time she smiled and shook her head i love my life i love you and if you keep buzzing me about it im going to put fairy scales in your nectar now tell me how youre going to help the vincet family he took a breath and she raised her eyebrows daring him jenkss shoulders slumped and his wings stilled to lie submissively against his back later hed convince her later pixies died only in the fall or winter he had all summer i need to destroy a statue he said seeing the clean wood around him and imagining the dirt walls vincet was living between then remembering the flower boxes he and mattie had raised most of their children among he was lucky but the harder he worked the luckier he got oh good she said distantly i know how you like to blow things up his mood eased and he shifted her closer to feel her warmth pixies had known how to make explosives long before anyone else all it took was a little time in the kitchen and a hell of a lot of nitrogen he thought by tonight he added bringing himself back to the present to help free a dryad really eyeing him suspiciously matalina popped her half of the sweetball into her mouth i ought ay were cut own in the great deforestation of the eighteen hundreds ave they emigrated in from europe i dont know he admitted but this one is trapped in a statue existing on energy right off a ley line instead of sipping it filtered from a tree hes been slipping into vincets childrens minds when they sleep trying to get them to break his statue he wasnt going to tell her the dryad had accidentally killed one it was too awful to think about matalina stood rising on a burst of energy to dust the ceiling a cityliving dryad she murmured cleaning wood that would lay unseen for months if rachel continued her pattern and avoided her desk even after they vacated it tink loves a duck what will they think of next jenks reclined to see if he could see up her dress blowing it up isnt the problem see theres this nymph he said smiling when he caught a glimpse of a slim thigh she looked down at him her disbelief clear seeing where his eyes were she twitched her skirt and shifted eyes scrunched in delight even as she huffed in annoyance a nymph i thought they were extinct maybe theyre just hiding he said this one said something about waking up she was having a hard time breathing through the pollution until she came after us flitting to the opening in the desk matalina shook her rag with a crack hmmm shes got this goddesswarrior vibe he said when matalina returned to the ceiling mattie the woman is scary i think if i get the dryad free the nymph will follow him and leave vincet in peace again matalina made that same doubtfilled sound not looking at him as she dusted freeing the dryad is the only way i can help vincet jenks said not knowing if matalina was unsure about sylvan or the nymph hes only been on his own for a year and he has three children and passel of newlings hes done so well matalina turned at the almost jealous tone in his words the pride and love in her expression obvious you were nine love when you found me she said as she dropped to him her wings a clear silver as they hummed coming from the country with burrs in your hair and not even a scrap of red to call your own dont compare yourself to vincet he smiled but stillit took me two years to be able to provide enough for jax and jih to survive he said reaching up to take her hand and draw her to him his wife sat beside him perched on the very edge of the couch with her hands holding his times were harder im proud of you jenks none has done better none jenks scanned the nearly empty desk the sounds of his children playing filtering in over the radio talking about the freak tornado that had hit the outskirts of cincinnati last night not wanting to accept her words he pulled her to sit on his lap tugging her close and resting his chin on her shoulder and breathing in the clean smell of her hair he could have done better he could have given up the garden and gone to work for the is years sooner but he hadnt known you need to help this family she said interrupting his thoughts i dont understand why you do some of the things you do but thisthis i understand i cant do it alone he said grimacing as he remembered daryl controlling the wind taking the very element he lived in and turning it against him wasnt bis a help she asked sounding bewildered jenks started not realizing what his words had sounded like he was the perfect backup he said his words slow as he remembered almost being squished and then biss frantic flight in the streets hes no fighter but he yanked my butt out of the fire twice smiling jenks thought he couldnt count how many times hed done the same for rachel id ask rachel to help he said but she wont be home until tomorrow still on his lap matalina reached for jenkss half of sweetball and put it in his mouth then ask ivy she said as he shifted it around shell help you ivy he said his voice muffled its my job not hers collapsing against him in irritation matalina huffed the vampire is always asking you to help her she said severely i dont begrudge it its your job but dont be so slowwinged that you wont ask for help in return it would be more stupid than a fairys third birthday party for vincet to lose a newling because you were too proud to ask ivy to be a distraction jenks thought about that lifting matalina to a more comfortable position on his lap you think i should ask her he asked matalina shifted to give him a moot look ill ask her he said feeling the beginnings of excitement and maybe have jumoke come out with me too the boy needs something other than his good looks matalina made a small sound of agreement knowing as much as he did that his dark hair and eyes would make finding a wife almost impossible grinning jenks pushed them both into the air she squealed as their wings clattered together and a real smile carefree and delighted was on her as he spun her to him hanging midair in the closed rolltop desk ill teach jumoke a trade so he has something to bring to the marriage pot beside cold pixy steel and a smart mind he said delighting in her smile i can teach him everything i know it wont be like jax ill make sure he knows why hes doing it not just how and with ivy distracting the nymph ill blow up the dryads statue i already know how to make the explosive i just need a whopping big amount of it matalina pulled from him holding his hands for a moment as she looked at him in pride go save them jenks ill be in the garden when you get back bring me a good story jenks drew her close their dust and wings mingling as he kissed her soundly thank you love he said you always make things seem so simple i dont know what id do without you youll get along just fine she whispered but he was gone already having zipped through the crack in the rolltop desk smile fading matalina looked over the empty desk picking up the discarded fabric she followed him out the shouts of his kids came loud through the churchs kitchen window their highpitched voices clear in the moistureheavy air as they played hideandseek in the early dark the boys especially had been glad to get out of the desk and into their admittedly morecrampedthanatrollsarmpit quarters in the oak stump more cramped but vastly more suited to a winged person smaller than a barbie doll a parental smile threatened jenkss attempt at a businesslike attitude as he stood on the spigot before the window and cleared his throat jumokes apprenticeship had begun and jenks was trying to impress on him the sensitivity needed in mixing up some pixy pow it wouldnt be napalm which pixies had first used to get rid of weedsthen fairies when it was discovered to their delight that it would go boom under the right conditions and it wouldnt be c c or any other human explosive it would be something completely different thanks to the dual properties of stability and ignition that pixy dust contained thats it papa jumoke said doubtfully as he penciled in the last of the ingredients on one of ivys sticky notes unlike most of cincinnatis pixies jenkss family could read it was a skill jenks taught himself shortly after reaching the city then used it to claim a section of worthless land before the proposed flower boxes existing on a set of blueprints went in thats it he said gazing at his sons hair it looked especially dark in the fluorescent light for the first time he saw it as perhaps an asset it wouldnt catch the sun as his own hair did a decided advantage in sneaking around perhaps jumoke was the reigning hideandseek champion for a reason bis newly awake and doing his sullen gargoyle thing atop the fridge rustled his wings in disbelief there is no way that soap fertilizer lighter fluid and pixy dust is going to blow that statue up its solid rock wanna bet a weeks worth of sentry duty jenks asked i use it all the time a pixy handful will blow surveillance lines and fry motherboards qed were just going to need a lot more rising up he eyed the rack of spelling equipment hanging over the center island counter can you get that pot down for me jumoke made a small noise and biss pebbly gray skin went black rachels spell pot the gargoyle squeaked in apparent fear hands on his hips jenks hummed his wings faster the little one yes jumoke go see if you can find ivys lighter fluid out by the grill we need more propellant than we have dust the young pixy darted out into the hallway and jenks frowned at the worried tint to his sons aura now tinks titties he could use rachels spelling equipment the woman wouldnt mind hell shed never even know ears pinned to his ugly skull bis hopped the short distance from the fridge to the center island counter jumping up with his wings spread to pluck the small copper pot it would hold about a cup of liquid and was rachels favoritesize spell pot she had two of them can i have the other one too please jenks said dryly and the kids tail wrapped around his feet his ears going flatter i cant touch anything but copper he complained and if i use the plastic ones theyll smell funny will you grow a pair and get the bowl he said darting upward and smacking it to make it ping dont blame me if rachel yells at you for using her spell pots bis muttered as he plucked it from the overhead rack and set it rocking next to the first the draft from his wings blew jenks back when bis hopped to ivys chair at the big farmhouse kitchen table pulling first the phone book then vixens guide to gathering guys and gals down and onto the seat the guide was the larger of the two dont blame me if ivy dewings you for using her computer jenks shot back as bis settled onto the stack of books and shook the mouse to wake the computer up one day he was going to get caught and then thered be tink to pay tugging a bowl to the middle of the counter jenks felt a moment of guilt rachel will never know whats the problem here bis looked up from the keyboard his thin fingers were curved so his nails touched the keys and he snapped off ivys password without looking you didnt ask her yeah like you said prettyplease for ivys password he said and bis flushed dark black smug jenks pulled the recipe closer and wondered how he was going to size up the amounts ill polish the stinkin bowls when im done he muttered and bis smirked im not afraid of rachel he said hands on his hips and im not afraid of ivy they both jumped at the hum of dragonfly wings but it was jumoke its metal he said his expression going confused when he saw the panicked look on their faces what did i do i thought you were your mother jenks said and jumokes wings turned a bright red as he drifted backward giggling it didnt seem right to be teaching a sixyearold how to make explosives the giggling didnt help but now was the time to start teaching him not two weeks before he left the garden like he had jax there was a moral philosophy that went along with the power a pixy could wield and he wouldnt make the same mistake with jumoke as he had with jax bis stood stretching his wings until the tips touched over his head ill help he said and the two flew out into the hall and then the back living room the cat door squeaked and jenks sighed glancing at the clock hed already called ivy but she wouldnt be home for a couple more hours the three of them would have to make a whopping amount of explosive before she got home he didnt want ivy to know he could make this stuff word would get out and then inderland security would start drafting them into service pixies liked where they were on the fringes and ignoredmostly jenks drifted down until his feet hit the polished stainless steel harmless through his boots the squeak of the cat door brought him back to reality and he pretended to be estimating the depth of the bowl when bis and jumoke flew in with the reek of petroleum because their horns dont work bis said get it because their horns dont work the thunk of the tin can hitting the counter was loud and jenkss hair shifted in the gust from biss wings jumoke what do you think a cup jenks asked measuring the bowl off at his shoulder and pacing around the perimeter i dont get it jumoke said and after landing inside one of the bowls he added a cup and a third to the brim you know their horns the gargoyle reached up and touched the tiny nubs where his would be when he grew up bis i dont get it jumoke said clearly embarrassed dad whats next jenks smiled pleased a cup and a third jumoke had it right jenks looked up to find bis and jumoke watching him eagerly teaching an adolescent pixy and teenage gargoyle how to make explosives might not be such a good idea but hell hed learned when he was five mmmm ivory soap he said ivy has a stash of it in rachels bathroom under the sink jumoke finished already in the air got it bis was a moment behind his windnoisy takeoff making the bowls rock just one bottle ought to do it jenks shouted after them were blowing up a statue not a bridge the turn take it they were far too eager to learn this when the sound of their rummaging became muffled he braced himself against the copper bowl and pushed it to the can of lighter fluid taking to the air he tapped the can with his sword point moving down until he heard a sound he liked marking the spot with his eyes he darted back aimed his sword and flew at it with a stifled yell for strength he jammed his sword into the canister the hard pixy steel went right through his elder children had fairy steel taken from invaders testing their strength jenkss blade was stronger and the thin sheet of metal was nothing grinning as he imagined it was an invading fairy he had just pierced jenks put his foot on can for support and pulled the sword out darting back to avoid the sudden stream flowing out and arching into the bowljust as he had planned wiping his sword on the rag over the sink jenks listened to the changing sound to estimate how full the bowl was getting little splashes spotted the counter and he dropped to the floor slipping into the cupboards by way of the open space at the footboard it was a weird world of wooden supports and domesticity behind the cupboards and using his arms as much as his wings he maneuvered himself to the kitchens catchall drawer vaulting into the shallow space jenks hunched over vibrating his wings to create some light as he moved to the front dodging dead batteries and mangled twist ties until he found the spool of plumbers putty the trip out was faster and eyeing bis and jumoke standing on the counter and panicking about the rising level of lighter fluid he expertly plugged the hole more than one way to empty a can he said vertigo taking him when the flow stopped and the fumes hit him hard dont get too close jumoke i swear this is the worst part it stinks like a fairys funeral pyre the boy said plugging his nose and backing up standing on the counter beside his son bis looked huge there was a bottle of soap in his grip and the gargoyle easily wedged the top open jenks could have done it but it would have been a lot harder how much bis asked poised to squirt it out still reeling jenks covered his eyes now streaming a silver dust as his tears hit the air and tuned dry put it in the empty bowl ill say when rachels spell bowl bis said hesitating its soap jenks barked rubbing his eyes and staggering until jumoke grabbed his shoulder holy crap it was nasty stuff until it all got mixed together the squirt bottle made a rude sound as it emptied and feeling better jenks peeked over the edge to see how much they had thats good he said and bis capped the bottle by smacking the tip on the counter jumoke see the proportion to the lighter fluid now all we need is the nitrogen and the pixy dust lots of nitrogen to make the boom intense fertilizer jumoke said in the shed he asked and when jenks nodded jumoke rose up ill check in an instant he was gone glancing out the nightdarkened window jenks watched jumokes arrowstraight path the sifting dust falling to make a gold shadow of where hed been his siblings called out for him to join them but jumoke never even looked pleased jenks turned to find bis trying to get the fridge open by wedging a long claw between the seals it felt good to be teaching someone his skills tink knew that jax had been a disappointment but jumoke was genuinely interested he already knew how to read leaning against the bowl of soap jenks scratched the base of his wings watching bis hang from a fridge shelf with one hand and pull out a tinfoilcovered leftover with the other his claws scrabbled on the linoleum when he dropped and jenks wasnt surprised when bis shook the leftover lasagna into the trash under the sink and ate the tinfoil instead the rasping sound of teeth on metal made him shudder black dust sifted from him and seeing it bis shrugged crawling back up onto his elevated seat before ivys computer a gargoyle doesnt live on pigeon alone he said and jenks winced pushing off into the air jenks rose into the hanging utensils for his own snack there was a pouch of sweets for the kids in the smallest ladle rachel never used it opening it he popped one of the nectar and pollen balls into his mouth then grabbed another for jumoke the kid had a lot to learn about maintaining his sugar level unless he was snacking in the garden how long did it take to look through the shed anyway angling his wings jenks dropped to the dark windowsill and pocketed the second sweet hands on his hips he stared out into the dark garden and watched the bands of colored light sift from the oak tree jumoke wasnt among them the individual trails of dust slipping down were as pixyspecific as voices and he knew them all thered been no new patterns to learn in years no more newlings he thought more melancholy than he thought hed be hed done it to save matties life and it had seemed to have worked a healthy pixy woman gave birth to more sons than daughters by almost two to one the size of the brood too was telling which was why only two children were born that first season none the next then eight eleven ten twelvethen sevenfour of them girls that was the year he panicked going to work for inderland security matalina had borne only three children the year hed met rachel two of them girls none had survived to naming his wish for sterility had saved her life another birth of newlings might have killed her what he hadnt anticipated was with the absence of newlings both he and matalina had time to spare on other things hed gone from side jobs to a fulltime career outside the garden gaining enough money to buy the church and the security that went with it matalina had been able to help their eldest daughter take land before taking a spouse something that only pixy bucks traditionally managed not to mention matalina pursuing her desire to learn how to read and then teaching the rest of the childrenall impossible if caring for a set of newlings children were precious each one a hope for the future how could they be detrimental frowning jenks tried to figure it out failing perhaps he wasnt old enough yet because it didnt make sense to him maybe mattie could help him she was the smart one as soon he got her to take the tinkdamned curse hed rest easier theyd live in the garden for another twenty years then watching their children grow take their places the sharp taps of bis on the keyboard stopped and the gargoyle ruffled his wings listen to this he said his high gravelly voice pulling jenkss attention from the window dryads declined with the deforestation and many ghosts have been blamed on them as they learned to live in statues placed on ley lines jenks flitted close thinking he looked nothing like ivy kind of like pixies adapting to city gardens humans learn to live with them or die trying bis blinked his red eyes at him weve always lived with humans i cant imagine living in the woods what would i eat iron ore and sparrows ignoring his sarcasm jenks moved closer to the screen now that he thought about it gargoyles were dependent on people the picture of the dryad on the monitor was his size and he tapped it look at that it looks like the statues in the park doesnt it he turned starting when he found bis unexpectedly inches from him holy crap didnt the kid breathe yeah bis said softly not noticing he had jumped trying to cover his surprise jenks walked across the keyboard to the down arrow scrolling for the rest of the article because they declined before the turn he read aloud proud that he could little is written about them without the trappings of fairy tale but its commonly accepted that they live as long as the tree they frequent does perhaps even hundreds of years though generally thought of as meek and gentle grimm has placed them several times in the position of wildly savage chuckling jenks put his hands on his hips yeah he said as jumoke flew in trailing a disappointed green dust and the freak had kids shoving witches into ovens too scraping his wings for his sons attention he tossed jumoke the pollen ball catching it his son tucked it away saying its not there i think rachel used it crap on toast jenks swore using one of rachels favorites but pleased that jumoke had indeed been tapping off his sugar level the kid had a head on his shoulders she did i remember now she put it around the azaleas this spring frustrated he rose up as his wing speed increased i hate it when people use stuff and dont replace it how am i supposed to make a bomb without nitrogen bis brought up a seriouslooking black screen and started deleting evidence of web sites and searches how about mothballs he asked and jenks laughed youve been watching tv again no mothballs and pixy dust dont mix besides that would make something more like napalm and we want inward destruction not outward devastation vincet wouldnt thank me for destroying his garden jenks frowned ammonia maybe but ivy didnt keep that on hand like she did the soap and lighter fluid we want a nice simple pop and for that we want fertilizer how much jenks looked at bis as he pushed back from the table wondering what ivy would say if she knew the gargoyle had been using her computer silent jenks pointed to a bowl hanging from the overhead rack biss pushedin face smiled as he flew to the rack his wings sending the loose papers on the table flying jumoke took flight yelling that bis was as dumb as a downdraft but jenks squinted through it not moving as the gargoyle dropped to the counter with the larger bowl weve got lots of nitrogen at the basilica bis said grinning at him through the settling papers ill ask my dad about nymphs and dryads too alarmed jenks clattered his wings hey this is a run not a job he called and bis hesitated flipping in midair to cling to the archway to the hall with the bowl dangling from a hind foot you cant steal it from the gardener shed bis made his wheezing laugh looking evil as he hung upside down with the white tuft of his tail twitching no problem they cant give this stuff away thirty minutes instead of dropping to fly out he slithered up to the hall ceiling going nearly invisible as he shifted his skin tone to match the shadows only the glint of the copper bowl gave him away that and the faint scrabbling of claws jenks would be really worried about the scratches on the ceiling if he didnt know where they came from the ceiling the walls the window ledgeshe had to get bis to start wearing some clothes a bandanna or something stifling a shudder jenks turned back to jumoke seeing him pale and wideeyed it gives me the creeps when he does that skin thing the small pixy said and jenks nodded me too but we need to figure out how to mix this stuff up in one batch before he comes back or well be here all night i know vincets going to keep his kids up and sylvan might burn another one of his newlings and carefully he added when jumoke tipped the bowl with the lighter fluid to look in it the last thing i need is ivy coming home and finding fire trucks at the curb shed have hairy canaries coming out her ah ear at his shoulder peering in at the lighter fluid jumoke shook his head women that one word jerked jenkss attention up and his own smile grew to match jumokes pride filled him jax hadnt been like this he wasnt making a mistake teaching jumoke his skills this was going to work and his son would have a unique talent one that would help him find a wife and then all his children could have their happyeverafter jenks clapped him across the shoulders cant live with them cant die without them he said beaming with pride this was not a mistake not a mistake at all pigeon poop vincet exclaimed aghast as he hovered with his three children clustered behind him clearly frightened of the sight of ivy reclining on the nearby bench youre going to save my family with pigeon poop pigeon poop jenks affirmed concentrating on the silvery goop in the bowl bis was holding steady the moon was up making it easy to see vincets horror as he dug his hand into the softly glowing mess taking another oozing wad back to the statue he slapped it onto the smooth stone with the rest that and pixy dust he said cheerfully trying not to think about it as he wiped his hands off on a fold of stone hed never be able to handle a mixture of lighter fluid soap and nitrogen like this without the pixy dust to act as a stabilizer it was the dust that made it go boom so spectacularly too thats disgusting vincet said softly and bis holding the bowl rolled his eyes tell me about it the gargoyle said his voice was stoic but jenks could tell he was almost laughing the white tufts of fur in his ears were trembling ivy too smirked the living vampire had driven them out here on her cyclebis on the gas tank and grinning into the air like a dogbut now she looked bored lying back on the bench with her knees bent to gaze up into the branches of the tree it was obvious that shed been at someone earier tonight her color was high her motions edging into a vampirequick speed and her obvious languorous sultriness which she tried to hide from rachel poured from the slightly asianlooking woman in a flood of release even vincet had noticed wisely not saying anything when the leatherclad woman had strode up to daryls statue hip cocked as she pronounced she could take the nymphif she had the brass to show up right now though ivy looked more inclined to seduce the next being on two legs she encountered not fight them her long straight hair falling almost to the cement as she lay on the bench and a sated smile on her placid face no wonder ivy satisfied her blood urges during rachels weekly absences seeing ivy like this might blow everything to hell an emotionally constipated ivy was a safe ivy this would go faster if someone would help me jenks said eyeing the goop remaining when he flew down for another handful in a smooth motion ivy sat up and swung her boots to the cement to stand im going to do a perimeter she said heels silent on the sidewalk as she headed out and dont put that bowl in my cycle bag got it she shouted over her shoulder jumoke landed atop biss head and fell into widefooted stance that would allow him the best balance if the wind should gust mom made me promise not to touch it the kid said clearly proud of his new red belt im holding the bowl bis said quickly eyes darting vincet took his daughters hand pretending he needed to watch her chicken shits jenks muttered scooping out a handful and throwing it at the statue it hit with a splat and ivy somewhere in the dark gasped swearing at him at that bis grinned to look like a nightmare pigeon shits he said cheerfully and jenks smeared another glowing handful on sylvans statues nose the chiseled face looked as if it could see him and knew what he was doing its not that bad jenks muttered but his nose was wrinkling at the stink it seemed to be sticking to him even if the modified plastique wasnt his gaze dropped to rachels bowl glinting in the lamplight and his wings hummed faster ivy wouldnt tell rachel would she hovering backward he looked over his work almost putting his hands on his hips before stopping at the last moment if hed done it right itd shatter at the base and out toward the walkway sylvan would be free jenkss gaze shifted to the small opening under the dogwood that was vincets home it was too close for his liking jumoke jenks said tersely and the young pixy rose on a glittering column of sparkles set down a layer of flammable dust on the plastique i have to get this crap off of me you bet dad he said enthusiastically zipping to the statue jenks had put a heavy layer of dust in the mix already but a top dusting would flash it all into flame faster than any petroleum product made from dead dinosaur bis was stretching his neck to get away from the smell holding the bowl and being more dramatic than jrixibell pretending to have a sore wing so she wouldnt have to eat her pollen hed used only about half of what he had made maybe he should blow both statues up that would piss off daryl you got a problem jenks asked and bis shook his head breath held no bis said his thick lips barely moving you done with this for now he said and bis shoved the bowl under the bench then scuttled to the middle of the sidewalk gasping dramatically when he stopped in the puddle of lamplight frowning jenks wiped his hands off on his red bandanna then wondered what he was going to do with it he couldnt put the symbolic flag of good intent back around his waist not only did it stink but taking it back to matalina to wash wasnt an option glancing at vincet he dropped it into the bowl if vincet had a problem with it he could just suck tinks toes just off the sidewalk beside sylvans statue vincet was on one knee trying to get his kids to go inside the triplets were clearly unhappy about being told to go to ground vincet was just as reluctant to leave jenks alone to take them there even now he was eyeing the bow and quiver that jenks had brought with him to ignite the explosive give me a break jenks thought dryly like hed take the mans garden frowning he reached for his bow peeking from the small bag beside the dungfilled copper pot vincet stiffened when jenks put the quiver over his shoulders and strung the bow maybe he shouldnt have gotten rid of his red bandanna go inside vincet said tersely to his children but they only clung to him tighter papa im scared vi said her eyes riveted to the crapsmeared statue irritation flashed over vincet and taking her hands the young father faked a smile for his eldest and only daughter go wait with your mother so jenks can fix this he said i cant leave another man alone in my garden with a bow vi even jenks it isnt right but uncle jenks wont touch the flowers she whined papa please come with us dont let the ghost out please smiling jenks gestured for jumoke who was bored and flying up and down like a yoyo they had time before the moon hit its zenith point daryl wouldnt appear until sylvan did and hopefully the statue would be demolished before then jenks had to give jumoke something to do that darting up and down was irritating come here he said as he brought out from the bag a pot the size of two fists i want you to hold on to the coal pot he said handing it to the excited pixy got it he said wings clattering and jenks reached up snagging his foot when he started to flit away keep it lit jumoke he said yanking him back down so hard jumoke lost his balance and had to scramble to find it again give it sips of air nothing more if it goes out from too much or too little air im going to have to ask ivy for a light and that would be embarrassing uh guys bis interrupted claws scraping as he slid to a stop beside them just a minute bis jenks said turning back to jumoke when i ask take the top off okay not before the coal wont last long given full air his voice was severe but jumoke was holding the small pot with the right amount of care now and jenks was satisfied go wait with your mother vincet shouted across the way and his two boys darted away to leave a heavy dust trail but vivi didnt look so good jenks bis said clawed feet shifting but jenkss attention was riveted to vi her dust didnt look right and as he watched her eyes rolled back and her wings collapsed and her aurawent silver shit vi vincet shouted scooping up the girl as she fell into convulsions the dryads taking her he exclaimed eyes wide in horror as he held his daughter she wasnt even asleep blow it up blow it up now sorry bis said ears pinned as he looked sheepish i tried to tell you feeling betrayed jenks looked at the moon it wasnt anywhere near its zenith reaching behind him he fumbled for one of his arrows tied with dandelion fluff at the tip wings clattering he turned to jumoke finding himgone what the hell he stammered rising up to scan the area but there wasnt a single twinkle of dust anywhere he was gone jumoke vincet flew to him with vi in his arms his wings clattering and desperation falling from him like the dust he was shedding hes hurting her vincet shouted vis skin red and her dust whitehot blow it up free him i cant jumoke has the firepot jenks hovered poised and scanning bis waited on the sidewalk tail lashing but jumoke was gone ivy was gone by the dogwood noel was a faint glow gathering the two boys and pulling them underground they were safe where the hell is jumoke jumoke jenks shouted exasperated and bis took to the air with two heavy wing beats to find him they didnt have time for this but as jenks started off in the other direction he jerked to a halt in midair something smelled like honey and sunwarmed gold tinks dildo the warrior woman was back you will not echoed a vehement voice off the nearby townhouses and there she was standing on the sidewalk beside her statue her bare feet spread wide and her robes shifting her expression was frantic and upon seeing the bow in his hands she flung her hand out look out bis shouted leaping for him a blast of honeysmelling air hit them tumbling into the air jenks felt his heart pound but he fought with his instinct folding his wings against him and tightening into a ball as he flew out of control holy crap he was heading right for the trees gotcha came biss faint exhalation and the wind shifted as the gargoyle caught him pulling him close jenkss eyes opened to see the world dip and swoop in biss other hand were vincet and vi vincet looked terrified but vis expression held a shocking amount of hatred it was sylvan thats why daryl had appeared the stupid dryad couldnt he have waited a few more minutes with a sharp drop and a wrench that hurt jenkss neck bis dropped to the ground beside the sidewalk next to a large rock the wind died daryl was coughing with her hand to her chest shaking as she tried to catch her breath in the pollutionstained air jenks unwedged himself from biss grip and flitted down to feel small beside him taking to the air was too chancy and he could hit the statue from here why didnt you shoot it vincet yelled at him angry as he struggled with vi they too firmly on the earth where the hell is jumoke jenks thought still not sure what end was up yet i warned you daryl wheezed pulling herself straight again she wiped her mouth then hesitated shocked at the sheen of blood glinting in the lamplight gathering her resolve she hid it shouting you will die before i allow sylvan to perpetrate his abuse on another youre a whiny little nymph vi shouted as she struggled to be free the gods are dead and actors play their rules youre alone give up the worlds too ugly for your kind thats the trouble with you dryads you talk too much daryl said eyes narrowed she raised her sword the nearby light flickered and went out the one behind it went black too and like dominos the townhouses across the park went dark a distant chorus of complaint rose joined by the beeping of smoke detectors bis shifted his wings his back to the rock i got a bad feeling about this he squeaked hey golden girl ivy shouted from behind them and jenks rose up wings flashing red when he saw the silver dusting of jumoke with her pick on someone your own size she added as she strode forward boots clacking aggressively dad jumoke exclaimed as he darted to him where have you been jenks shouted his relief coming out as anger we cant blow up the statue without that pot jumokes wings drooped as he landed beside him pot hugged to his middle im sorry i was getting ivy i saw daryl and i just the boys face screwed up im sorry dad i shouldnt have left blow it up vincet exclaimed jerking when vi got her arm free and smacked his face he caught her wrist and sylvan howled the whitehot dust spilling from vi was turning the moss black burned let me out she said her childlike voice sounding wrong before that bitch stops you ivys in the way jenks said tightly giving both jumoke and vincet a look to stay grounded jenks darted after her coming to a halt at her shoulder as his partner stopped eight feet back from daryl the spicy scent of vampire spun through him seeming to shift his own dust a darker tint ivy was pissed hell even her aura was sparkling seeing them together daryl dropped her sword flushed as she looked at ivys tight clothes and anger youre aligned with the pixy who are you a goddess ooo ooo jenks said looping the bow over his shoulder so he could have both hands free for his own sword ive heard this one before just say yes ivy ivy was eyeing daryl with the same evaluation worse she said softly and jenks shuddered im heir to madness vessel of perversion your nightmare should you cross me daryls chin lifted trembling indeed we might be sisters then for im the same ivy hunched slightly eyeing the woman almost hungrily you hurt my friends a long hand went out beckoning her lips drew back in a horrible smile and she let her small but sharp canines show can you hurt me the nymph blinked as the moonlight hit them then she tightened her sword grip the air seemed to hesitate and when biss nails scraped ivy jerked jumping at her jenks shot straight up yelling get her away from the statue so i can blow it up you cant daryl cried out moving impossibly fast as she dodged out of ivys attack her sword was swinging toward ivys back and jenks yelled a warning ivy dropped daryls sword point missed but just rolling backward ivy tried to knock daryl down but the nymph jumped straight up ivy was standing when she landed and the two women hesitated looking at each other in surprise and what might be respect blow it up jenks ivy called out ill get out of the way jenkss mouth dropped open holy shit ivy didnt know if she could take her or not darting back to the rock for protection he sheathed his sword and pulled an arrow from his quiver everyone get behind the rock he shouted jumoke the firepot leathery wings shaking bis scrambled behind the rock vincet fought his child as he dragged her to safety the freedomhungry dryad screaming vi was only a year old her tiny body couldnt take this she was dusting heavily glowing like a demon as the energy of the ley line ran through her vincets own tears turned to dust as he fought to keep her from attacking darylbut he looked up at jenks with hope here dad jumoke shouted taking off the lid the scraping of the lid was loud and jenks buried the tip of the arrow in it immediately the wad of dandelion fluff ignited matalina was the real archer he thought as he took aim and the arrow arched away fortunately all he had do to was hit the statue fire in the hold he shouted everyone down no daryl screamed stretching her hand out a flash of wind came at him and he went tumbling backward but a pained cry echoed and the force immediately died when he found air again under his wings his arrow was lost and the statue untouched daryl was writhing on the cement downed by ivy in the instant the nymph lost her concentration ivy herself looked winded holding her arm where the nymphs sword had scored on her rhenoranian help me daryl said coughing as she got to her knees undeterred expression pinched ivy strode forward but daryl groaned kneeling as she shoved the air at her with both hands watch out bis cried as ivy was flung back to land in the flower bed beside sylvans statue as if having been pulled by a string frustrated jenks lowered his next arrow not yet lit let me be your strength rhenoranian daryl said staggering to her feet let me be your vessel she turned to jenks and his wings went cold let me be your vengeance worried jenks darted up then down he couldnt see the ley line she was pulling on but the force of it made his wings tingle daryl pointed at him with a new confidence and then ivys scream echoed against the dark windows across the street motions blurring the battle began again twelve feet up jenks watched useless bow in hand and knowing he wouldnt be able to shoot until ivy downed the nymph daryl kept pushing ivy back to the statue moving faster than seemed possible daryl ducked ivys crescent kick only to fall when ivy continued the spin and knocked her feet out from under her the nymph hit the ground coughing ivy jumped into the air elbow poised and clearly ready to slam it into daryls throat as she fell to hit the dirt beside her daryl saw it coming and pulled her sword up to protect her throat ivy screamed knowing she couldnt move enough to avoid being cut the blade nicked daryls face too upon impact but it protected her throat ivy was hurt more the small success seemed to galvanize the nymph who staggered to her feet when ivy rolled away holding her numb elbow swinging her blade in a wide arc she waitedgrimacing like a mad thing ivy rushed her plowing her foot right into her solar plexus between the gaps of the blade daryl bent and ivy lashed out with a front kick snapping the nymphs head back and still the woman wouldnt go down falling back as she tried to find her breath now jenks ivy called out and jenks dropped down to the rock and the firepot one hand to her middle daryl groaned staggering to a stand help me rhenoranian she screamed shaking hand outstretched the wind came from everywhere the black roared it beat at the trees jenks tumbled fighting it stop ivy shouted and when jenks squinted he saw she had yanked the nymph up and was pinning her to the tree across from her statue stop or i will fucking kill you let me go or i will pierce your liver the nymph said her teeth gritted oh shit jenks whispered seeing the glint of metal at ivys side screaming down from the hills the wind circled them like wolves a small spot of stillness grew surrounded by a wall of gray and black fury the lights of cincinnati vanished as if behind water even the everpresent thumps of industry were gone overpowered by the chugging of the wind but here in daryls sacred grove the moon shone down in perfect stillness jenks glanced to jumoke peeping up from behind the rock as the torn leaves drifted down gesturing for him to stay vi had stopped struggling her breath rasped like oven air and her wings were starting to smolder by the acrid smell now pinching his nose ivy still pinned daryl to the tree her arm against her throat one in white one in black one in silk the other in leather both unmoving apart from their lungs heaving slowly jenks started to drop toward the firepot why do you stand against me daryl whispered its honor that gives your limbs the strength to best me she took a careful breath it glows in you and you hurt from it ivy flinched when daryl touched her jaw im not hurt she said quickly sylvan went against the gods law the nymph was saying her cracked lip starting to bleed taught himself to exist in cold stone then used the knowledge not to live but to kill for enjoyment why do you free him i dont understand she lies vi shouted elbowing vincet shes touched break the statue now sylvan was in jail not imprisoned by a jealous lover jenks hesitated his wings going cold as vincet struggled to hold her wildly struggling body had they had almost let him free a murderer the demons imprisoned him in stone daryl said her fingers opening the knife dropped to the grass and ivy flinched his heart remains as cold even now when the fire of the demons blood burns through him i begged for the honor to guard him as it was my sisters he murdered i fought for the right learned to kill to be heartless only to fail here when it counts if you free sylvan kill me as well for im too cowardly to live when honorable people give such filth freedom around them the wind died to let the clamor from the townhouses and city beat upon them once more the lights were on again and people were talking loudly youre not a coward ivy said softly and daryls eyes met hers widening at something only the nymph could see abruptly ivy let go of her and stepped back frightened holding her arms to herself she looked for jenks now hovering right over the rock jumoke below him with the firepot we need to reassess this she said whitefaced no vi exclaimed exploding into motion and hitting her father right between the legs ooooh jenks said with a wince then yelped when she scrambled up the rock as if she didnt have wings snatching his bow and yanking an arrow from his quiver jumoke bis shouted as the little girl jumped at the boy screaming wildly jenkss son took to the air frightened but she crashed right into him the coal pot hit the grass the lid popped off and coals scattered flashing orange with the new breath of air screaming in victory vi ran for them burying the tip of an arrow against one it flared to life even as she pulled the bow back arrow notched get her jenks shouted as he tackled her about the knees he hit her hard and they slid across the grass his arms scraping taking a breath he looked up to see the flaming arrow was arching true to its target drop he shouted trying to cover vi from the coming blast panic iced his wings as he saw jumoke still hovering in midair shocked into immobility hed never reach him in time then bis raised his hand cupping it before him the night turned white and orange and an explosion pulsed against his ears and echoed up through the ground into him hunching down jenks tried to bury himself in the grass feeling the blast push the blood from his wings for an instant jumoke fell to the ground in front of him why didnt you drop jenks shouted his own voice sounding muffled from his stunned ears as he got off vi and went to his son bewildered on the ground jumoke are you okay panicking he pulled his son up frantic he felt jumokes face then ran his hands down his wings looking for tears jumoke yelped wiggling to get out from under jenkss hands oh that was everlastingly cool the boy said grinning from under his dark hair jenks smacked his shoulder in relief he was okay whats wrong with you he shouted glad his hearing was coming back i told you to drop biss thick skin on his brow was furrowed in worry but jenks didnt think it was from the cut he was looking at on the back of his hand in the distance a car alarm was going off um jenks he said in question a quick glance told him vincet was okay vi was in his arms looking stunned but herself sylvan no longer possessed her which meant he was probably free great just freaking great he only wanted to help and he freed a murderer rachel and ivy were not going to be happy ivy alarmed jenks darted up chunks of marble the size of apples and melons littered the sidewalk a few pieces were embedded in the tree that ivy had pinned daryl against and the scent of cracked rock pervaded vincets home and daryls statue looked untouched but no ivy no daryl either ivy jenks shouted realizing he was about to fall from exhaustion damn it hed let his sugar drop immediately he found a sweetball in his pocket and sucked on it the sugar hit him fast and his wings sped up across the street people were starting to come out of their homes aiming flashlights at the park they had to get out of here ivy he shouted again you okay bis poked his head up from behind the rock his ears pricked as he looked at the tree and jenks wasnt surprised when daryl stumbled out from behind it ivy levered herself up from the ground having found a dip to take shelter in they both picked their way carefully to the sidewalk taking in the damage with a numb acceptance hes free daryl whispered her smooth features bunching in distress a crack of noise made them all jump it was the snap of breaking stone and the sharp sound echoed off the town homes across the street as they watched a huge slab of broken rock slid from sylvans statue falling to crush the flowers i didnt do it papa jumoke exclaimed eyes wide as he darted close it wasnt me it was me a new voice said sly and wispy startled jenks turned in the air even as daryl caught her breath only to start coughing ivy held her back from attacking him but her lips were pressed in anger a thin figure was standing in the moonlight his feet on the moss beside the dogwood tree it looked like sylvans statue moving as if it might be hurt the shadowy figure edged out into the moonlight drawing back as one bare foot touched the concrete it was sylvan it had to be you lied to me jenks said loosening his sword im free the dryad exclaimed and he leaped lightly onto the concrete exuberant as his robes furled the glow of vincets dust was a sickly yellow as he hovered beside jenks his broken sword in hand the dryad probably didnt know it but it was a real threat is vi okay jenks asked and vincet nodded but i fear we have let loose a demon you are trash sylvan daryl shouted sagging in ivys arms as she wheezed i will not rest until you are dead sylvan stopped his twirling looking at jenks as if seeing him for the first time the dryad smiled his gaze alighting briefly on vincet jumoke and finally bis all fronting him daryl is a crazy bitch he said softly pulling himself to a dignified stance i didnt lie glancing at the people coming across the park from the town homes he added almost as an afterthought not much anyway now ivy shouted springing into action jenks darted forward sword in hand no wait bis exclaimed but ivy was already pinwheeling to a stop the spot of air where sylvan had been was gone where did he go ivy asked turning back to them bis shook himself resettling his wings as he looked at the people coming closer into the line he said clearly unnerved his ears were pinned and his tail was lashed about his feet he shouldnt be able to do that he added meeting jenkss gaze daryl slumped on the bench to look totally undignified and out of character its why he was imprisoned in stone she said pushing a chip of his statue off to clatter on the cement now ill never find him jenks stifled a shiver as he met ivys eyes tinks contractual hell hed made a big mistake lets get out of here he said we can worry about sylvan later right behind you bis flew to their satchel ducking behind daryls robes and coming out with it and the grimy dented bowl a bobbing flashlight across the grass caught his eyes and they glowed red seeing it someone called out more lights angled their way jenks im taking daryl to the hospital ivy said can you get home from here okay jenks looked at daryl struggling to breathe and he nodded see you there daryl was complaining she wasnt going to go to the butchers and leechers when vincet dropped down to him thank you jenks he said his expression solemn in the dim light you saved my family wincing jenks looked to vincets front door where his wife and sons were silhouetted in the warm glow of a fire youre welcome i dont think sylvan will be back tomorrow vincet said shaking his hand ill come tomorrow thank you i cant ever do enough jenks managed a smile as he thought of vi shed be fine now just be nice to some pixy buck who needs it he said and build me an office vincets head was bobbing as he drifted back but it was clear he wanted to return to his home yes anything tomorrow tomorrow jenks agreed then darted up when a flashlight found him bathing him in a bright white light sorry about the mess he shouted vincet went one way ivy and daryl another and in an instant even their dust was gone he waited until he heard the soft sound of ivys muffled engine before he turned his back on the demolished grove and rose higher like a switch the sounds of chaos went faint and the air turned chill an uncomfortable mix of success and failure took him and as jenks quickly caught up to jumoke and the slowerflying gargoyle winging his way back across the ohio river he had a bad feeling that this was far from over hands on his hips jenks hovered a good five inches above the damp moss newly transplanted from somewhere half across the hollows he gazed in satisfaction at the freshly scrubbed upsidedown flowerpot buried halfway into the soft soil the sun was high but here under the shelter of an overgrown lilac it was cool it had taken almost a week working the four hours before the sun rose but vincet had finally called his office done while jenkss children watched vincet had chipped out a door in the upsidedown flowerpot built a hearth and laid a circle of stone that said welcome in pixy culture seeds had been planted from vincets own stash and jenks wasnt sure how he felt about another man putting plants into his own soil how was he to know what was going to come up watching vincet had been a good lesson to his own kids who up to now had only seen their parents work and when jenks rubbed his wings together to signal the allclear his children swarmed down in a wave of silk and noise the babble grew high and he fled darting to where matalina was on the wall with jrixibell again refusing to eat her pollen having stuffed herself with nectar he hadnt a clue where she was getting it the little girl probably had a stash of flowers somewhere that even her mother didnt know about go the woman relented as the little girl whined her wings down in a pitiful display but youre going to eat twice as much tonight thank you mama she chimed out and jenks watched for birds until she reached her brothers and sisters already buzzing in and out of his new office happy jenks settled himself beside matalina thinking she was beautiful out here in the dappled sun she handed him a sweetball and he took it pulling her close to make her giggle id rather have you he said stealing a kiss jenks she fussed clearly liking the attention im pleased it ended well a flash of guilt darkened his wings yeah as long as sylvan doesnt come back and rachel doesnt find out he said gaze going to his kids as they doused jumoke in pollen from an early dandelion temporally turning him blond until he shook himself youre such the worrier matalina teased let the future take care of itself vincets family is safe and jumoke is considering a career outside the garden im proud of you he turned to her his guilt easing you think it will be okay he said and she leaned in putting her arms around his neck and her forehead against his im sure of it that dryad is long gone no need to worry jenks sighed feeling a knot untying but stillhow do you like the office he asked trying to change the subject ill get a little bell and they can ring it i dont think anyone will come anyway matalina smiled as a shaft of light found her face theyll come jenks just you wait the sound of one of their children wailing drifted to them and together they sighed not today though jenks said giving her a kiss before he took to the air his hands leaving hers reluctantly today i belong entirely to you and happy he rose up scanning his garden assessing in an instant what had happened and darting down to make things right it was what he did it was what he always did and it was what he would always do reckoning jeaniene frost prologue february new orleans eric swallowed the last of his beer and then set the empty bottle on the sidewalk not my fault there isnt a trash can nearby he thought ignoring the glare the tour guide gave him the brunette off to his right didnt seem to mind she smiled at him in a way that made him glad hed blown off his buddies to take this stupid haunted tour in front of us is the lalaurie house the guide went on gesturing to the big gray structure on the corner of royal street this is reputedly one of the most haunted places in the french quarter here in the mideighteen hundreds an untold number of slaves were tortured and murdered by dr louis lalaurie and his wife delphine eric sidled closer to the hot brunette who didnt seem to be paying any more attention to the guide than he was she was thin the way he liked em and though her tits werent big she had great legs and a nice ass her face was pretty too now that he noticed hey im eric s your name he asked fighting back his slur smile look interested where are your friends she asked she had an accent that sounded french and it was a weird question but she smiled when she said it her eyes raking over him in a way that woke his cock up theyre at pat obriens eric said with a vague wave the guide was glaring at him more pointedly now going on about the lalauries medical experiments on their slaves and other weird gross shit he didnt want to listen to you wanna grab a drink the brunette came closer until she was right next to him and her nipples practically brushed his chest im in the mood for more than a drink arent you oh yeah he had definite liftoff in his pants baby like you wouldnt believe eric glanced around to find a few people staring at him okay hed said that a little loud ive got a room at the dauphine he tried again softer we could go there my place is closer she interrupted him taking his hand firm grip too come with me she led him down the street weaving past people and throwing those fuckme smiles over her shoulder at him every so often eric was excited hed been here three days and hadnt gotten laid yet it was about time he got some strange on this trip the girl took him down an alley walking just as quickly as before even though he had a hard time seeing where they were going he tripped on somethinga bottle probablybut she just tugged on his arm at the same moment keeping him upright hey he grinned nice reflexes she muttered something he didnt understand and not just because he was drunk is that french eric asked her dark hair swung as she glanced back at him oui yes cool she led him up a fire escape at the end of the alley opened an unlocked door at the landing and propelled him inside the lights were off wherever they were but this must be her place she locked it behind him and then her smile grew wider i am going to eat you she said in a sexy accented purr that made him even harder eric grabbed her squeezing that beautiful ass while he kissed her she opened her mouth letting his tongue explore inside while he ground himself against her rubbers in my back pocket eric reminded himself a chick this easy might have something she put her arms around his neck holding on to him like she was desperate for it eric fumbled with the front of his pants right here right now worked for him too hed gotten his pants unzipped and his hands up her short skirt when she clamped down on his tongue with her teeth and yanked her head back eric screamed staring in horror at the blood around her mouth when she smiled at him again his tongue throbbed like it was on fire crazy bitch he tried to say but it came out sounding like aaazy itch blood was still pouring from his tongue and when he felt the tip of itthere wasnt one anymore you fucking whore eric spat not caring if she understood the garbled words or not his fist came upand then he was falling end over end until he reached the bottom with a thud that made his head feel like it had split for a stunned second eric lay there stairs it occurred to him bitch pushed me down a flight of stairs he felt the first stirrings of fear mixing with his anger a light flicked on in the room and eric jerked blinking for a minute at the brightness before the images focused there was a tall thin man standing over a mannequin he looked like he was assembling it since its leg was on the ground next to the man and its arm was in two pieces farther away then the mannequins head turned its eyes blinked mouth opened eric screamed trying to scramble to his feet but a scalding pain in his leg prevented him the tall man ignored erics screams and frantic attempts to back away as he gave an inquiring glance up the stairs mon amour i was getting worried the girl appeared at the top of the stairs why no one knows were here eric managed to stand agony shot up his leg even though he had most of his weight on the other one dont either of you fuckin touch me he gasped looking around for something anything to use to fight them off the girl smiled as she came down the stairs with his blood still around her mouth it looked more like a hideous leer touch you mon cher i already told youi am going to eat you bones didnt spare a glance around as he strode rapidly up the streets of the french quarter scents assailed him countless perfumes body odor from all manners of hygiene food cookingor rotting in the trash centuries of decadence had given the quarter a unique permanent stench no vampire could completely ignore a close second to the cacophony of scents was sound music laughter shouts and conversations compounded into a constant white noise as he rounded a corner bones wondered again why marie had summoned him he didnt have to come he wasnt under her line so he owed her no loyalty but when the queen of new orleans called bones answered for starters he respected marie and he reckoned his head wouldnt enjoy sitting atop his shoulders much longer if he snubbed her though chances were what marie wanted would involve bones killing someone he had just rounded another corner when instinct told him he was being watched he jerked to the sideand felt searing pain slam into his back in the next instant bones whirled knocking people over to dart into the nearest door with his back safely to a wall and the only entrance in clear view bones looked down at his chest an arrow protruded its broad head hooked on three sides where it had punched through his chest the shaft was still sticking out of his back he touched the bloodied tip and swore silver two inches lower and it would have gone through his heart ending his life the permanent way hey buddy someone called out you okay capital bones bit off he looked around and realized hed stumbled into a bar the patrons were goggling at his chest he paused long enough to pull the arrow out of his chest before ducking out the door moving at a speed that would have been only a blur to the onlookers at the bar he wasnt concerned with them however his attention was focused on finding whoever had fired that custommade arrow from the angle it skewered him it had been fired from above one vertical jump had him on the bars roof crouching again while his gaze scanned the nearby structures nothing bones ran along the tops of the buildings for two blocks until he felt certain that he was standing where the shooter had been there was a faint residual energy in the air that confirmed what bones already suspected whoever fired that arrow wasnt human he took another moment to survey the rooftops but there was no one to be seen he or she was fast it had been less than a minute from shot fired to bones standing where the wouldbe killer had crouched no amateur this and whoever this was had been alerted quickly to boness presence in the quarter hed arrived only last night bones gave a mental shrug as he jumped down to the street warier now to stay within clusters of people but not forgoing his appointment hed already died once it tended to take the edge off fearing it afterward bones waited outside the wroughtiron gate of st louis cemetery his back was to a post and hed been eyeing the rooftops ready to spring at the slightest hint of movement ghosts bathed the cemetery and its surrounding streets like spectral cobwebs bones ignored them though they could to be as noisy and bothersome as the tourists new orleans quarter was the last place for anyone to rest in peace be it the living or the dead it wasnt five minutes before a gigantic man walked toward him his aura announced him as a ghoul though he looked nothing like hollywoods interpretation of one no he had smooth brown skin a bald head and a barrellike chest the very picture of health and vitality except his walk which had a noticeable awkwardness that was at odds with the normal graceful gait of the undead bones the man greeted him it had been decades but bones remembered his name jelani he nodded i am here to see majestic at her request jelani swept out a hand follow me moonlight glowed off jelanis black gloves their shape too perfect and too stiff prosthetics both his legs below the knees were missing too bones didnt know how jelani had lost his arms and legs but he knew it had happened before jelani became a ghoul the only thing that didnt grow back after being cut off from a vampire or a ghoul was his head but what he didnt know was why they were moving away from the cemetery instead of inside its gates youre not lost are you mate bones asked with cool geniality hed had meetings with marie before and they were only ever held in the cemeterys underbelly right below where her empty grave was marie laveau had nothing if not a sense of irony jelani half turned but didnt slow his stilted pace if you fear to follow me then by all means walk away a snort escaped bones as he stopped trying to shame me into stupidity not bloody likely half an hour ago someone made a very credible attempt to kill me and now you want me to meet majestic somewhere aside from her normal place tell me why or i will walk away and then you can explain to her why you felt it beneath you to prevent that jelani paused his face still in profile majestic is not here she bid me to speak in her stead boness brows rose marie was notorious for handling requests threats or punishments herself but shed sent her lackey jelani to meet with him it made him even more curious to discover what this was about right then bones said after you jelani led him to lafittes blacksmith house the oldest bar in the quarter bones ordered a whiskey neat the ghoul didnt order anything his gaze kept flickering around either waiting for something or from nerves bones moved his hand to rest almost casually near his pockets he had several silver knives lining his trousers and sleeves in case of vampiric trouble though nothing but decapitation would kill a ghoul marie bones prodded him majestic jelani corrected at once bones resisted the urge to roll his eyes the formalities are over so do pry the stick out of your arse instead he said what does she want from me jelani reached in his jacket his movement was slowed by his stiff plastic hands so bones didnt feel the caution he normally would have at the gesture then jelani pulled out a manila envelope bones took it slipped the photos out discreetly taking only a moment to flick his gaze over them and the pages underneath then he slid them back in their envelope and gave a hard flat stare to the man opposite him what makes you think theyre even still alive theres been hardly a whisper about the pair of them for half a century jelanis eyes were dark brown almost the same color as boness and his stare was equally hard they are alive and they are in the city because of some blood and bits of body parts found in an apartment bones asked dismissively any human could be responsible for the same its them jelanis tone was emphatic theyre repeating what they did forty years ago majestic was overseas then too and they came here just before mardi gras by ash wednesday fifteen people had disappeared now once again the queen is away and theyve returned bones considered him either jelani was a very good liar or he believed what he was saying that didnt make it true however i need more proof than missing tourists during maries absence why didnt i hear that they returned to new orleans back then as you claim its not like such news wouldnt have made the rounds mate jelani was also careful not to say their names i smelled them both times he replied not bothering to correct bones calling her marie again majestic wants you to handle this quietly once its done she will take the credit for their punishment so it will not seem that shes twice let murderers hunting in her city escape during her absence bones tapped his chin it wouldnt be an easy job the lalauries were infamous in both human and undead history louis was rumored to be around four hundred years old and a powerful ghoul delphine was not quite two hundred but what she lacked in louiss age she made up for in viciousness one hundred thousand pounds bones said it was a steep enough price that marie wouldnt feel she owed him a favor but low enough that shed also know it was a friends rate in truth he might have done the job for nothing the lalauries were as nasty a pair as some of the other sods bones had shriveled for free jelani didnt even blink if you finish the job by ash wednesday the money is yours that gave him just over a week bones finished his whiskey no time to dawdle then youll give me full run of the city he said setting his glass down and youll stay out of my way unless directed do we have an accord jelani gave him a thin smile we do the townhouse smelled of death blood urine and random police officers in that order bones grunted as he knelt next to one of the reddishbrown stains on the floor with the stench from all the different coppers in here im amazed you could even decipher the lalauries scent jelani stayed at the top of the stairs not venturing down to the first floor they werent only down there they slept in the bed up herejelani pointed to a room down the halland sat on the couch herewith a stiff finger at what bones supposed was the family room bones inhaled deeply making a mental catalog of the scents then he leaped up the stairs in one bound noticing jelanis inadvertent flinch as he watched right no need to remind the fellow of what he couldnt do anymore the bed and the sofa you say bones asked changing to walk with the slowness he used when around humans the sofa faced the telly with a view out the balcony to the left of it bones went over to it and inhaled again noting the differencesand the similaritiesfrom the smells downstairs the owner of the flat the girl has her body been found elsewhere jelani gave him a slight smile what makes you think this wasnt the boys place bones shot jelani an annoyed look theres a feminine scent all over this flat this wasnt where the boy lived though its mostly his blood on the first floor theres a picture of the girl in her bedroom jelanis voice was neutral as if they were discussing the weather shes beautiful i imagine shes still alive for now bones stared at jelani all his instincts told him that the ghoul was hiding something bones wondered if hed known the girl jelani was acting as if none of this affected him but his scent was of fearand hatred if hed been emotionally attached to the flats owner that would make sense or he could just be frightened of what would happen if bones was unable to kill the lalauries by the time marie returned since marie had left him in charge it would be considered jelanis failure as well youve never told me how you know delphine and louiss scent to recognize it bones stated something flashed across jelanis face before it became smooth as dark glass again i was married in the eighteen sixties jelani replied she was a slave in the st francisville house which happened to be where the lalauries fled after they left the quarter while i was fighting in the union army delphine and louis tortured and ate my wife i arrived too late to save her but ill never forget their scent bones didnt blink your arms and legs amputated after the battle of new market heights they told me it was a miracle i survived at all majestic changed me afterward at my request i wanted to live long enough to one day see the lalauries die jelanis expression was pure defiance now as if he expected bones to berate him for changing into a ghoul solely for revenge i was turned into a vampire against my will bones replied evenly brassed me off for a good long while then i got over it cant change how we ended up as we are so why bother fretting over it if youre looking for judgment look elsewhere jelani seemed surprised i hadnt heard that about you he murmured bones let out a short laugh why would you its not the sort of tale to be bandying about is it dont you hate your sire for that i did for years bones had hated ian for turning him into a vampire but ian hadnt done it to be malicioushed done it out of a twisted sort of gratitude if not for bones sharing his meager food ian would have died on that long voyage from london to the new south wales penal colonies where they first met as prisoners but bones wasnt about to share that with jelani no need to air those particulars to a ghoul he barely knew i dont hate him anymore was all bones said you have a house in the city jelani noted changing the subject will you be staying there bones shrugged not after tonight you can ring my cell if you need me ill send word when its finished jelani smiled and it was cold dont underestimate them delphine took the boy during an evening walking tour of the quarter he was seen leaving with a darkhaired girl right after the tour had stopped at her former mansion has a sick sense of humor does she bones thought sardonically their old home was about the last place hed expect to find the lalauries hunting but it told bones quite a bit they were arrogant which was good arrogance and a sense of invincibility were two large points in his favor toward killing them how many ghouls and vampires live in the city bones asked jelani mulled it for a moment year round a few hundred at mardi gras that number doubles easily humans arent the only ones to enjoy the citys festival bugger which was why it was an ideal time of year for the lalauries to hunt of course the abundance of people alive and undead made them blend that much more into a crowd of course it would make bones blend too he felt confident he could catch them what he wasnt certain about was how many people they might kill before he did ill ring you when its finished bones repeated to jelani and walked out of the bloodsoaked townhouse the afternoon sun glinted off the countless beads people wore around their necks the streets werent completely clogged yet more people would venture out once it got dark it amused bones that a vampire could be about at this time of day yet some humans let their excesses from the night before trap them in bed until dusk boness only concession to being out in daylight was to wear shades and sunscreen he wouldnt burst into flames if the sun touched his bare skin as the movies so comically claimed still an hour in the sun for a vampire was akin to all day at the beach for an albino hed heal almost instantly but there was no sense using his strength over something as trivial as a sunburn hed already walked the length of the quarter and back noting the differences since the last time hed been herethree years ago no it was four because hed celebrated the new millennium here blimey the years were blinking by it had been well over a decade since hed set foot in london once i kill the lalauries and finish tracking down hennessey and the other miserable blokes hes involved with im going home bones decided its been too long im even sounding more like a yank than an englishman these days only a couple blocks down was the lalauries old house even in daylight there were shadows shifting around it residual ghosts any sentient spooks whod died there stayed away from the place not that bones blamed them at night the house positively crawled with old despairing energy from its gruesome past it was no accident that the house had changed hands so many times over the past hundred and seventy years it was now empty and for sale again as well humans might not be able to see the residual manifestations but they could sense them on some deep level and delphine lalaurie at least seemed drawn to the house as well why else would she pluck one of her victims right in front of it during a tour was the irony just amusing to her or did she still after all this time miss her old home was that why the lalauries kept returning to the quarter despite the danger of maries wrath bones came closer to the house the strong smell of chemicals wafted to him from a store to his right salon he diagnosed then glanced at his reflection his hair had been brown for quite some time since someone was obviously hunting him it wouldnt hurt to alter his appearance he entered the parlor not surprised to find a few people waiting every business in the quarter enjoyed a boost from mardi gras except perhaps church services he put his name on the list took a seat and waited forty minutes later he was brought back by the hairdresser hi there whatll it be she asked in a friendly way color trim and wash if you please bones replied you english have the loveliest accents she laughed makes everything you say sound so proper after she washed his hair she led him to her cubicle bones read her name on her beauticians certificate and gave a snort of amusement rebecca dewinter was that an intentional reference she looked at him in surprise yeah my parents loved that book youre the first person whos tied my name to it not many people are big readers of the older classics bones stifled his next snort because telling her that he still considered rebecca to be new fiction would require too much explanation i go by becca though she added giving his head a last toweling so what are we doing with color today what shade hadnt he done recently make it blond she blinked at him in the mirror really platinum the whole lot of it her hand was still in his hair absently fingering his curls bones met her eyes in the mirror she turned away quickly and threw let me just mix the color over her shoulder a smile tugged his mouth he had no false modesty about his looks theyd been his trade in the seventeen hundreds when he was human and survived by selling his body to women since then theyd ensured that he didnt spend many nights alone but by his choice not for need of coin anymore and at times hed used his looks when he was hunting lethal feminine prey theyd been a useful tool but bones placed far more importance on maintaining his wits and strength becca came back and applied the color to his hair bones chatted with her learning that shed worked here for a couple of years lived just outside the quarter andinterestingly enoughhad been closing up the night eric greenville was murdered such a shame becca continued i cant tell you how many times ive seen those tour groups by our window while the guides talk about that old house they cant stand on their corner since thats private property so they hang out in front here how awful for someone to be robbed and murdered by a person he met on one of those is that what the papers say happened bones asked though he already knew the answer she shrugged yeah weird stuff always happens during mardi gras that might be true but bones was more interested in how becca might have caught a glimpse of delphine lalaurie that night whether she realized it or not hed intended to track down the tour guide from that evening for the same reason but that person would be much more recognizable to delphine becca was anonymous she could be right useful and judging from her scentand the lingering looks she snuck his wayshe wouldnt be averse to spending more time with him im in town on business bones said casually leaving soon after mardi gras ends but i wondered if youd fancy having dinner with me hed been watching her in the mirror as he asked her eyes widened then she broke out into a smile um sure that would be nice she was quite pretty shoulderlength brown hair with blond highlights a nice full mouthand arseand she looked well into her twenties so not a novice when it came to dating infinitely biteable bones decided with a speculative gaze are you free tonight she glanced away funny how many otherwise confident women shied under a direct look yeah i get off in an hour but you know id want to go home and change smashing ill pick you up at your house round eight bones stated giving her his charming smile it worked well enough she didnt argue as it were when he left the salon his hair was champagne blond he had beccas address in hand and a far different plan for tonight than hed started out with you might turn out to be my homing beacon for delphine bones thought giving becca a peck on the cheek while promising to pick her up later or at the very least well both have dinner tonight becca ordered a salad for her entrée bones used to the baffling tendencies of women on first dates to pretend they didnt eat said nothing he just ordered the large prime rib with three sides and cajoled becca into eating half his food aside from being thinner than he preferred becca could also use the extra iron from the red meat since bones intended to lower her blood count by a pint before the evening was finished after dinner they walked along the streets of the quarter bones gave becca his coat since her short dress with spaghetti straps did little to keep out the chill around them the crowds were getting livelier as alcohol mixed with the veil of darkness and the primal vibe of the city urged people to lose their normal inhibitions the hum of energy and excitement coming from the writhing banquet of humanity brought out the undead in force as well bones under the pretext of joining in the festivities bought masks for himself and becca his hid half his face but hers was a silly little thing with feathers that covered only the area around her eyes with his aura of power carefully in check new hair color mask and persona of being just another blood drinker strolling with his future meal bones was as disguised as he could be somewhere in this seething mass of people the lalauries could be hunting choosing their next victim time for becca to assist him bones drew her a few feet into the next alley they came across even above the raucous noise around them he could hear her heartbeat speed up as he leaned down instead of kissing her however bones brought his face close to hers letting green spill out of his eyes while he spoke low and resonantly remember the girl becca the darkhaired one you saw that night walking with the murdered boy can you see her face in your mind again bones knew she could determining that becca had seen delphine with eric was the first thing hed done when he arrived at her house earlier a few flashes of his eyes some help regressing her to that evening and bones was sure becca had gotten a clear view of the female ghoul now to focus becca on delphines image so shed recognize her on the spot if she saw her again becca nodded transfixed by his gaze bones caressed her cheek if you see her again youll tell me at once if im not with you youll ring me straightaway but you will not go anywhere with her ever ever becca echoed you wont remember this conversation either youll only remember to act as ive told you if you see her and no matter the circumstances you wont notice my eyes being anything but brown or my teeth being anything but normal right another nod right good bones smiled the emerald light left his eyes once free of their entrapping glow becca blinked her awareness returning her gaze flicked to his mouth and she licked her lips bones closed the few inches between them settling his mouth over hers in a firm leisurely kiss she tasted of wine and prime rib and beneath that was her own taste sweet like crushed flowers a scraping sound from above made bones yank to the side with a curse someone was up there in the next moment pain seared his back just a few inches below his heart as bones spun around he spotted a redheaded vampire perched on the roof on the other side of the alley ralmiel bones muttered recognizing him he jerked away in the next split second before another arrow was fired off this time it landed in the building instead of his flesh allo mon ami the vampire called out genially stand still so i can kill you oh my god becca gasped go into the parade now bones ordered her shoving her in that direction another arrow came at him striking him in the arm hed extended to push becca safely away bones yanked the arrow out spun to avoid another one and propelled himself straight up in the air since he was in the alley most bystanders wouldnt see him and the ones who did would be too drunk to remember it clearly anyhow ralmiel gave an infuriating chuckle as he sprinted away leaping over the roofs in gravitydefying strides bones chased him drawing several knives from his sleeves he flung them at the vampires back but only one landed and not in his heart bloke was fast you cannot catch me mon ami ralmiel laughed darting across the next roof onto the steeple of st louis cathedral too right i can bones growled crossing the same distance in an aerial leap he reached inside his sleeves grasped two more knives and rocketed them at the vampire the knives landed in ralmiels chest but hed jerked back in a lifesaving microsecond that meant the difference between them piercing his heart and burying less harmfully into his sternum sacre bleu ralmiel swore yanking them out and tossing them off the roof then he smiled at bones close though non bones reached in his sleeves againand came up empty right hed given his coat to becca and it held the rest of his knives ralmiel aimed his crossbow then gave a snort as he saw that he too was out of silver normally it takes no more than four arrows mon ami i wasnt expecting you to be so quick well have to continue this another time bones jumped onto the churchs roof we can settle this without weapons come on mate afraid to only use your hands in a death match ralmiel had an odd grin i think i will let you live tonight and kill you tomorrow or the next day i get paid the same either way bones let out a short laugh decided to take one of the many contracts out on me did you after i kill you mate ill be curious to see what your corpse is worth ralmiel sketched a bow squeezing something in his hand i think not then he vanished in front of boness eyes bones stared at the spot where ralmiel had been what kind of trick was this since they were in new orleans the heart of magic and voodoo perhaps it was a sort of spell the few other times bones had run across ralmiel he damn sure didnt have the power to dematerialize on his own bones didnt figure hed hide such an ability either though that begged the question of why marie would allow ralmiel a known hit man in her city to hunt the hitter shed hired if bones was dead then he couldnt take care of her problem with the lalauries could he hed have to inform jelani of this perhaps marie wasnt aware of ralmiels presence but now to find becca and erase from her mind all the things shed just witnessed the next day bones went out of the quarter to a shop titled the swamp rat noting with amusement the layer of ground brick sprinkled across the threshold of the door it was a voodoo defense barrier supposedly capable of keeping out anyone who meant the shop owner ill pity it didnt work against people who didnt believe in voodoo or vampires as soon as he stepped inside bones flipped the open sign to closed and locked the door behind him a wizened little man behind the counter glanced up blinkedand then of all things tried to run bones was across the room and over the counter in less time than it took the elderly shop owner to clear his seat he chuckled as the man let out a spate of creole that cursed bones his parentage and several of his ancestors remember jeanpierre i speak creole so anything you say can and will be held against you and all that rot debil jeanpierre said in english with a hiss i oped id seen the last of you years ago now mate youll hurt my feelings dont know why you take such an aversion to me your grandfather and i got along splendidly and i know im glad to still find you here jeanpierres eyes flicked around the shop but it was empty of anyone but bones and himself no surprise there the wares he had on his shelves were ugly shoddy tshirts and other miscellaneous gimmicky items all in questionable condition and priced higher than most of his competitors but jeanpierres real business was voodoo the shops along the quarter were for the tourists or the uneducated jeanpierre supplied genuine ingredients for the practiced discerning buyer and his family had been in the business since almost the inception of the city he was someone who knew many of the citys darkest secrets and because jeanpierre had inherited the family trait of being immune to vampire mind control bones couldnt just use his gaze to glare information out of him mores the pity now then what did i want to ask you about ah yes redheaded bloke who goes by the name ralmiel vampire round my height and has the most amazing new trick of disappearing into thin air what do you know of him from the expression on jeanpierres face he did know something about ralmiel but he didnt want to share the information bones didnt lose a fraction of his smile need me to bash you about a bit before you answer no trouble at all just let me know which bone youd like broken first and ill get to it straightaway debils jeanpierre hissed nothin but grave walkers the both of you cept even the earth don want you bones waved a hand yes right were all wretched blokes forsaken by god and mother nature herself now get on with it bones really had no desire to start beating on the little man that would take too long redheaded debil he come round every so often jeanpierre said spitting out the words he have fetishes made for him use magic vampires are forbidden from using magic its one of the few laws cain laid down for his people im surprised ralmiel uses it so blatantly jeanpierres mouth curled cain god should have killed him for murdering abel not made him into a vampire as punishment instead as for ralmiel those who see im use magic dont live long enough to tell about it i think that would keep word from spreading true enough but a few people had to know aside from jeanpierre this magic ralmiel uses who makes it don know bones gave jeanpierre a measured stare i wont enjoy it but ill either beat the answer out of you or ill take you with me and keep feeding off your no doubt dreadfultasting blood until you tire of being my snack and you tell me then hope she curdles your blood to dust jeanpierre spat but gave bones a name and her location you ring me if you see ralmiel again bones instructed jeanpierre writing his number on the back of one of the sloganed coasters for sale on the counter this one had a tagline of it wont lick itself quite true that and dont make me end my long friendly association with your family by doing something foolish bones added letting green flash in his eyes as he handed him the coaster jeanpierre took it i dont cross debils too much bad juju afterward bones just nodded as he left quite true that as well it was boness fourth day in the city when another murder was discovered as before bones went to the scene to see what if anything he could use from it to track the lalauries jelani spoke with the detective assigned to the case from their muted conversation bones picked up that the detective thought jelani was an associate of one of the citys biggest donors and that bones was a private investigator bones made jelani empty out the flat before he went inside ignoring the rubbish the detective sputtered about him contaminating the scene hed leave the scene a sight less muddled than those blokes once alone he walked through the flat breathing deeply every few moments same male and female scent from the other flat spent less time here though and made a grand mess of things in their haste those blood spatters are from an arterial spray arced wide enough that the girl would have been running when they tore open her throat not the same girl they finished off in the kitchen though shes the poor lass who owned the other flat and she didnt have any legs left to run on the boy was watching his bloods fresher than theirs and the stench from his fear is smeared all over both rooms from the shallowness of his wounds he was likely still alive when they ate his arms bones felt the shift in the air right before ralmiel appeared behind him he spun his knife flashing out but the other vampire wasnt pointing any weapons at him this time no ralmiel was staring almost sadly around the carnage of the room mon dieu he breathed then gave a censuring glance at the knife in boness hand put that away theres been enough death in this room oui under normal circumstances bones would have disagreed and then proceeded to stab the hell out of ralmiel but the scents sight and aura of despairing horror in the flat also made him loath to add to it bones lowered his knife but didnt let it out of his hand he wasnt so affected that hed lost his wits why are you here if not to attempt to kill me again ralmiel walked around the room inhaling just as frequently as bones had he held another small dark satchel in his grip ah yes that would be ralmiels voodoo version of a teleporter this was not done by human hands it is one thing to kill such as you or iralmiels dismissive wave encompassed their mutual lack of worthbut these are innocents it is not right bones almost rolled his eyes a hitter with a conscience if ralmiel wasnt out to kill him hed buy him a drink and they could talk shop you didnt hear about the other murders you should pay more attention mate i heard about the last one but didnt know our kind was responsible new orleans is my city it has its darkness but not like this you know whos doing this bones met the other mans green gaze yeah i do ralmiel waited bones said nothing else finally ralmiel gave bones an assessing glance but you are here to kill them non you are not too bright if you think marie will thank you afterward for stealing her vengeance bones shrugged im doing it regardless call it a slow business week ralmiel laughed but it had a harsh edge tell me who is behind this so when i kill you you can go to your rest knowing i will prevent it from happening again you have my word thanks ever so but ill take my chances bones replied green glittering in his eyes ralmiel didnt know it but those magic pouches of his were numbered bones had paid a visit to georgette yesterday the maker of ralmiels fancy exits and had persuaded her to switch the ingredients for ralmiels new batch it barely required any threatening at all georgette knew using magic was against vampire law and as the provider of the product she was guilty by association once ralmiel ran out of the real fetishes bones would have him right where he wanted him forced to fightand die ralmiel bowed as you wish then he squeezed his pouch and vanished from where hed been standing bones looked at the empty spot and smiled two more down mate i suspect your genie impersonation will soon be coming to an end becca chewed her lower lip youre quiet tonight bones glanced up sorry luv im just a bit preoccupied she pushed her plate back at least three dates later shed quit pretending that a bowl of lettuce was all she wanted for a meal problems with your client becca thought he was a consultant for a corporation looking to save finances by downsizing its nonessential employee positions it was close to the truth in a twisted sort of way something like that the real problem was bones still wasnt any closer to finding the lalauries they didnt appear to have their own residence but just moved from flat to flat of the people they murdered and despite his walking becca up and down every street in the quarter the past three nights shed caught no glimpse of delphine lalaurie bones had come across several ghouls on those jaunts but they were having a bit of harmless fun not looking to savage the first person thick enough to follow them inside a building becca reached out touching his hand do you know where youre going to be next after this job and ah will you be leaving right away when its done he knew what she was really asking him ill be leaving straightaway when im finished my work takes me all over the world and leaves precious little time for anything else im not what youre looking for becca hurt flashed on her face for a moment quickly masked behind a false smile sounds exciting does it in point of fact it can be bloody lonely you know becca said as the silence stretched id understand if you just want to drop me home after dinner no bones said at once softening his tone when she blinked at how emphatic he sounded im sorry ive been a right glum fellow but i do want to spend more time with you tonight if youre willing he almost hoped shed say she wasnt if the circumstances werent so dire bones would drop becca at her house and compel her not to set foot in the city until this was over but he couldnt stand over the next freshly chewed body and know he might have been able to prevent it bones couldnt sniff them out not with the river of humanity thronging the streets but he could have becca give a good look at any female ghoul he found one of these times it would be delphine id really like to spend more time with you while im here bones said giving becca a smile filled with possibilities she smiled back her scent of unease melting away from her id like that too rotten bastard you are bones thought he didnt let any of that show on his face however instead he signaled for the check power raised the hairs on the back of his neck bones turned muttering a curse when he spied a familiar face headed their way excuse me he ground out to becca rising allo ralmiel called out sliding into the seat opposite boness he gave a charming smile to becca who might you be ma belle chérie no one that concerns you bones said curtly beccas mouth dropped ralmiel looked offended as if you would need to protect such a lovely flower from me my business is with you mon ami not with people who happen to be around you ralmiel didnt have a reputation for harming innocent bystanders but bones wasnt pleased at becca being exposed to him this whole situation was putting her at more risk than hed intended hed have to change his plans for tomorrow night but first things first bones sat down keeping his hands close to the silver knives in his coat is everything okay becca asked glancing back and forth between them quite bones replied not letting his eyes stray from ralmiels my friend just forgot his manners interrupting our dinner i was going to wait for you outside ralmiel said settling back in his chair expansively but when i saw your chér amie i decided to conclude our business tomorrow after i learn more about la belle here i dont like being spoken about as if im not even here becca said with a sharp glare at ralmiel the waiter came with the check bones dropped several bills onto it without counting them not tearing his attention from ralmiel for a fraction longer than needed join us outside bones asked with an arched brow ralmiel nodded of course becca got her purse still giving them wary glances do you two need a minute alone to talk no bones thought coolly but id like a minute alone to kill him he picked up his whiskey glass noting with satisfaction that it was near full and rose from the table were fine luv be finished up shortly bones and ralmiel kept their attention on each others every move as they walked outside the tension was thick enough to slice almost casually bones took a sip of his whiskey next to them a group of smokers waited to get into the restaurant whats your plan mate bones asked going to skulk after me and wait for your best chance ralmiel smirked non mon ami im going to follow her home and then skulk around after you becca gasped bones just smiled i think not then he flung his whiskey on ralmiel using the lighter from the smoker nearest him to send ralmiel up in flames ralmiel screamed swatting at the fire that covered the front of him several bystanders yelled as well bones didnt wait to admire his handiwork he yanked becca with him through the crowd ignoring her horrified sputtering once he found an alley he propelled himself up in the night covering both of them with his coat less chance of being noticed since his coat was black against the nights sky ralmiel wouldnt be following anyone not in his condition beccas scream at being airborne was cut off by bones clapping a hand over her mouth he didnt bother with the rooftops this time but flew over the quarter and beyond he glanced back a few times but there was no flying form chasing him it would be too much to hope that ralmiel hadnt managed to douse the fire and was dead but at least now he wouldnt know where becca lived she kicked and squirmed the entire way making terrified grunting sounds against his hand when they reached her neighborhood bones glanced around saw no one loitering about and set them on the ground by her front door shh youre fine becca he said lasering her with his gaze i drove you home after dinner and nothing out of the ordinary happened she smiled at him the fear melting away on her face thanks for a lovely evening she said bones sighed again regretting the necessity of using her when this is over he promised her silently youre getting a large donation in your bank account its the bloody least i can do no luv thank you he replied brushing his lips across hers hed intended it to be only a brief kiss but she opened her mouth and twined her tongue with his the scent of desire wafting from her bones kissed her with more intensity letting his hands slide to her waist she gasped and then groaned when his hips rubbed against hers money isnt all i can give her bones reflected becca didnt want him to leave her at her door tonight her heartbeat and scent were screaming that to him she pulled away long enough to whisper come inside again it was the least he could do the float rounded the first street corner to the clamor of cheers it was a mockup of an opera stage with a faux upper balcony and a piano in the forefront becca barely recognizable in curled wig theater makeup and a long victorian dress beamed at the crowd seated at the piano bones ran his hands over the keys while the floats speakers blared out the familiar score from phantom of the opera more cheers came from the streets onlookers especially when bones stood up and bowed he wore a black tuxedo with that trademark halfface mask obscuring his features and a dark wig on his head the other actors on the float mimed a musical rehearsal as bones stalked toward becca with the exaggerated seductivenessand menaceof the phantom it hadnt been hard to switch himself and becca with the original couple for this float just a few flashes from his eyes and those people were happily drinking rum instead of playing christine and the phantom none of the other actors argued either there were days when it was good to be a vampire perched as she was on the fake balcony of the float becca had a birdseye view of the people up and down the streets this parade went all through the quarter and in their costumes even ralmiel would be hardpressed to recognize either of them becca was as anonymous as bones could make her having no idea that subconsciously she was scanning faces in the crowd looking for delphine after lipsynching a snippet from music of the night with becca bones jumped down and walked around the outside of the float this kept beccas attention where it should be away from him and on the faces upturned at her if that deviated from the scheduled act for the float so be it it was only three days until fat tuesday soon the lalauries would finish their murderous scavenging and leave the city there were more important things at stake than following a parade script it was after eleven at night which meant the crowds were at their peak the parade was halfway down bourbon street when becca suddenly stopped waving and flinging beads her eyes took on a glazed look as the directive bones had instilled in her a week ago kicked in and bore results the woman from that night there she is becca didnt even seem to be aware that shed spoken bones swung his gaze in the direction becca was staring cursing the crush of people around him there was a sea of faces half of them female and every third of those with dark hair he jumped up to where becca was muttering show me becca ignored everything around her fixated on the directive bones had compelled in her before find the woman from that night with a stiff gesture she pointed into the crowd bones searched the faces ahead of them looking for that faint telltale luminance of undead flesh a woman about ten meters ahead turned around her hair was black and curly her smile was wide and her beautiful features were set off by pale perfect skin delphine delphine noticed him too at first her eyes flicked over him disinterestedly but then she paused narrowed her gaze and turned around and began walking away stay here bones ordered becca reaching inside his coat to pull out a large curved knife the crowd gasped thinking it was part of the act he ignored them as he jumped down roughly shoving people out of his path her dark head slipped below the crowd as she ducked and vanished from his sight bones increased his pace almost throwing people to the side soon the police would notice the disturbance but he didnt care his attention was focused on one goal dont let delphine escape he glimpsed her again darting quickly through people with her head lowered delphine glanced over her shoulder and their eyes met once more she smiled lovely and evil then she punched the person closest to her and ran bones gave up pretending to be human he chased after delphine with all his supernatural speed in the next moment he was upon the young man delphine had struck the man was on his knees blood pouring out between hands clutched to his stomach shed punched him hard enough to tear right through the blokes guts it was a mortal injuryunless bones stopped to save him he made his decision in an instant and kept going it was worth the sacrifice of one innocent victim to save countless others delphine had underestimated her hunter by thinking this would secure her escape another burst of speed brought him closer delphine was fast but he was quicker savage anticipation coursed through him his hand clenched on his knife almost there just as bones was nearly upon her an arrow ripped through his chest bringing an explosion of pain he roared as he tore it out plowing through people well below eye level to make his heart a far harder target ralmiel hed kill the sod for his wretched timing another arrow landed in his back missing his heart again but showing ralmiel hadnt given up the silver burned yet bones didnt slow to pull it out he couldnt risk losing delphine pain be damned every person he jostled by in the crowd felt like he was giving the arrow a good twist however bones gritted his teeth and continued on cursing the people in his way the blaring music the bloody beads the myriad smells that made delphine impossible to track by scent and the cajun hitter determined to mount him on his trophy wall bones caught another arrow to the neck skewering him clean through and spinning him around in rage blast it all ralmiel would get lucky with one of his shots soon and bones couldnt kill delphine if he was dead himself he took his knife and hacked the front of the arrow off then ripped it out of his throat fiery pain throbbed for a moment until the wound healed bones kept moving zigzagging until he reached the side of a building and then shot straight up once on the roof he tore his mask off his gaze was sizzling emerald as he sought out his target ralmiel was on the roof across the street over the maison bourbon sign the cajun didnt smile or crack any jokes this time he fitted another arrow in his crossbow and fired bones whirled to the left leaving the arrow to sail past him then whirled again when another rapidly fired and another sod this bones thought he folded one arm across his chest and then vaulted at ralmiel his other hand holding the curving knife ralmiel fired off two more arrows but they landed in boness arm not his heart then ralmiel jumped back but too slow one hard slash cleaved the crossbow in two another swipe split open ralmiels chest the blade was steel not silver since bones had intended it for decapitating a ghoul instead of killing a vampire still the wound was deep ralmiel floundered trying unsuccessfully to wrest away bones held on to him and raised the knife again this one takes off your head bones thought grimly swinging the blade and that kills everything doesnt it but the knife swept through thin air instead bones snarled in frustration his knees hitting the roof as the vampire under him disappeared he spun around just in case the blighter was about to reappear behind him with silver at the ready but there was nothing cold fury filled bones he hacked off the end of the arrow still piercing his back then yanked that through as well ignoring the starburst of pain it caused either ralmiel would soon run out of magic pouches or georgette had decided not to switch the ingredients in them hed deal with that later though first he had to try to find delphine again and god help ralmiel if he interfered one more time bones darted along the quarters roofs for more than an hour using the higher vantage point to better see the faces of the people below no sign of delphine he cursed himself for not simply flying over the heads of the crowd to get to her before but hiding the secret of his species was so ingrained in him that his first instinct had been to follow her on foot it would have been sufficient too if not for ralmiel bloody bastard but now bones knew what she looked like beccas part in this could finally be over bones would try scouring the quarter again tomorrow and hope like blazes delphine hadnt been scared out of the city bones left the quarter and went to his hotel at the outskirts of city doubling back several times to make sure he wasnt being followed with all his backtracking the sun was almost ready to rise by the time he made it inside his room he stripped off his clothes and sat on the bed eyeing his laptop better check now for any important messages sleep could wait a bit longer bones logged onto his email quickly reading through his messages bloody hell bones swore when he got to the last one what was the ghoul up to that afternoon bones opened the side door to his townhouse to let jelani in he went through the foyer listening to the clicks from jelanis plastic and metal legs as he followed bones stopped in the townhouses inner courtyard it was beautiful with a large fountain in the middle surrounded by flowers planted specifically to bloom even in winter very nice jelani complimented looking around bones was silent jelani waited for a few minutes but then impatience got the better of him you said you had some news the ghoul prompted bones gave him a thin smile i do indeed about you then bones crossed the distance and grabbed jelani holding the bigger man several feet off the ground this is your only chance to tell me the truth lie to me and ill kill you right here ever since i arrived ive had ralmiel after me with no fear of maries reprisal for it strange that then your story didnt check out did you think id just take your word and not do my own investigation theres no record of the lalauries ever being at the st francisville house so they couldnt have murdered your wife there what kind of game are you playing jelani didnt bother to struggle his false arms and legs left him as helpless against bones as if hed been human i was the lalauries slave he spat both me and my wife were purchased from them shortly after they moved to the quarter the stories of what they did to their slaves arent even half the truth my wife and i tried to run away they caught us and tortured me cut off my arms and legs and ate them in front of me but that wasnt the worst of it jelani looked away the scent of pure torment wafted off him but bones didnt loosen his grip go on delphine changed me into a ghoul jelani continued his voice trembling with remembrance then she kept me chained inside that hellish attic for days until i was mad from hunger she finally brought my wife up chaining her too so she couldnt run away that night i killed my wife i killed my wife and ate her bones let him down jelani staggered for a moment on his prosthetic legs until he found his balance when he did he shoved bones back im sorry mate bones said quietly but you know it wasnt your fault its their crime not yours jelani gave a bitter snort oh i know theyre guilty for her death but every time i go to sleep i can still hear her screaming in my dreams over a hundred years later i can still hear it jelani met boness gaze squarely i want it to end i want all of it to end bones let out a slow sigh marie has no idea the lalauries are even here does she thats why ralmiel is so brazenly after me he has no fear of repercussions from her when delphine and louis were hunting in the city decades ago majestic told me not to act until she was back she didnt want anyone knowing for fear that news of it would weaken her power but the lalauries got away before majestic returned this time i couldnt risk letting them get away again so i lied to you when i brought you here bones ran a hand through his hair in frustration marie will kill you for this but you must already know that the big mans shoulders slumped you cant know what its like living among our kind crippled this way majestic has made it bearable but once the lalauries are dead i want to die too my only hope is that majestic is kind enough to make death my punishment for my betrayal instead of casting me off without her protection boness gaze traveled once more over the stumps that made up jelanis arms and legs jelani couldnt wield a knife in defense of his life or in defense of maries which was the expectation of any member in an undead line he couldnt even walk if someone were to sweep those prosthetics out from under himand that would be the first thing any hostile vampire or ghoul would do looking at it coldly all jelani had to offer majestic in return for her protection was his loyalty and hed just burned that by going behind her back over the lalauries even if marie sympathized with why he did it shed still have no choice except to kill him for it not if she didnt want to be regarded as a weak leader and if bones was being practical now that he knew none of this had been sanctioned by marie hed leave the city tonight then once jelanis deeds were revealed bones could truthfully claim ignorance of the mans betrayal but if he didnt any further actions he took would be held up to judgment by the queen of the city bones was a trespasser hunting on maries grounds without her permission he knew she wouldnt look kindly on that furthermore while he was here he was providing a damn fine target of himself to ralmiel since he couldnt very well hide and hunt at the same time in the same small area though neither could the lalauries not for much longer as it were there was only one choice wasnt there bones stared at jelani not letting any emotion show on his face i dont believe ill see you again mate but ill promise you thisyoull have your vengeance jelani gave him a tight smile it wont just be my vengeance it will be shared by my wife and everyone else who died at their hands bones walked away not replying to that death he could give yes but at the moment he wished he could give hope too even though there was none for jelani and perhaps none for himself either bones walked up the street to beccas salon hed tried her cell earlier but she didnt answer she was probably annoyed with him for what shed think was his disappearing last night or she was busy with customers and hadnt been able to get to her phone either way he thought a gesture was in order so hed picked up a dozen roses on his way and just in case ralmiel was on a roof sighting down a crossbow on him bones was wearing a kevlar vest underneath his shirt and coat let ralmiel try to shoot an arrow through that the next time that scurvy bugger pulled a houdini and popped up bones intended to separate his head from his shoulders if he could kill delphine and louis at the same time hed consider it a capital evening bones was a few shops down from the salon when he smelled it he inhaled just to make sure then quickened his pace running the short distance to the salon and flinging open the door the girl behind the counter looked up in surprise bones ignored her stalking through the salon and yanking open every closed door much to the consternation of a customer getting a massage in the back room beccas not here the girl called out bones stalked over letting the roses drop to the floor as he grabbed her when did she leave was she alone hey not so rough she protested bones let her go and asked very precisely where is becca she called in sick or she had her new roommate come in earlier to say that becca wasnt working today but when you showed up to tell you to come over for dinner so i guess becca cant be that sick even though he already knew he had to confirm it this girl what did she look like shrug black curly hair thin about my age had an accent i think it was french bones walked to the door the girl continued to call after him tell becca shes in trouble with our manager its mardi gras we cant afford for her to just decide to take a day off delphine hadnt just run off last night no shed doubled back and found becca first once outside bones inhaled again deeply even with the scent of countless people trampling through the air he could still smell delphine it was if shed deliberately rubbed against the side of the shop to make sure he smelled her bones walked across the street to stare up at the lalauries old mansion then he went to the gate and took in another long breath shed been here too again the trail was so strong it had to be deliberate delphines scent hadnt been on it before the many other times bones had walked past this house and now he could hear a heartbeat inside the normally empty mansion becca come over for dinner delphine had said and she was making sure bones knew where dinner would be held a bitter smile twisted his mouth no delphine im not making it that easy for you ghouls are stronger during the day while vampires are weaker ill wait till after nightfall to accept your invitation its not as if you have any intention of letting becca go free once i arrive anyway you murdering bitch bones turned on heel and walked away wondering if delphine or louis was watching him it was past nine when bones came back his coat was lined with several knives both steel and silver no telling whether delphine and louis might have vampiric help with them so best to have all bases covered he was still wearing the kevlar vest underneath his shirt even though it would slightly hinder his movements still its benefit outweighed its liability bones stared at the lalauries old house even with all the noise around him from partiers enjoying the last few days of mardi gras if he concentrated bones could still faintly make out the heartbeat inside the house true that heartbeat might not be beccas but she might yet be alive now for the last addition to his ensemble bones turned and walked into the reveling crowd pulling out the first few people his hands laid on dragging them from the thick of the merrymakers and hitting them with his gaze the alcohol theyd consumed helped with that since none of them could claim exceptional mental willpower at the moment bones didnt care if anyone looking on bothered to wonder why his eyes were glowing green let them think it was a special effect from the phantom of the opera mask he had on if they bothered to ponder it at all after giving the three bespelled people their instructions bones went back into the crowd and pulled out another three repeating the process and then another three then another until he had more than a dozen obedient bystanders finally bones walked back down the street to stand on the corner in front of the house the shadows around it were darker now throbbing with the memory of suppressed rage from centuries ago it was almost as if those shadows knew their former tormenters had returned bones took off his mask then rolled his head around on his shoulders now he told the waiting men and women at his back and vaulted up into the air below him they began walking to the front of the house and hurling things at it beer bottles their shoes their masks whatever they could get into their hands they flung it windows broke on the first and second floors the sound drowned out by the yells and hollers from the people they didnt go within a dozen feet of the house though no they stayed just far enough away so that anyone who wanted to stop them would have to come out and get them drawing out delphine or louis wasnt the point the racket they made while they smashed up the house was hidden behind the chimney on a nearby roof bones waited for his chance when two windows smashed simultaneously bones sprang forward streamlining his body and diving through the second floor windows bones rolled as soon as he hit the floor staying low and searching the room careful not to let any green shine from his eyes he wasnt going to make it easier for them to find him if theyd determined the noise theyd just heard was him instead of more objects being hurled through the windows the room was empty of all but furniture bones inhaled trying to track becca by scent and then swore the room stank of embalming fluid a noxious scent that masked damn near everything else clever bastards he thought that was all right he could still pick up the heartbeat as a beacon though now that he was inside it sounded like there were two heartbeats both in opposite directions from each other he chose the one that sounded stronger since becca was their most recent victim it made sense that the other fainter heartbeat belonged to someone the lalauries had acquired before her while bones felt pity for that unknown person becca was his primary concern he crept forward in a low crouch the lights were off not that ghouls needed illumination to see there was no sound inside except for those heartbeats his own stealthy movements and the occasional smash from whatever item was still being flung at the windows yet bones could feel the energy in the house delphine and louis were here waiting whatever trap theyd set had been sprung as soon as bones entered the house now all he could do was see it through to the end everyones got to die one day bones mused with grim determination come on you sods lets see if youve got what it takes to make today my day bones edged down the hallway toward the sound of the heartbeat careful to watch for any hint of an imminent attack so far he didnt see anyone but all his internal alarms were ringing the trap would be where becca was true but he couldnt just abandon her after all it was his fault delphine took her in the first place the heartbeat was coming from the room at the end of the hall four menacing open doorways stood between him and it bones pulled two knives from his coat one steel one silver he gripped one in each hand as he kept low and moved forward come out come out wherever you are everything in him tensed as he crept up to the first door his nerve endings anticipating a sudden slice of pain from a knife or other weapon bones sprang into the room braced to counter an assaultbut there was nothing just more furniture with dust covers over them and that noxious embalming odor that neutered his ability to track anything by scent one down three to go bones repeated the same routine with the next door this time he was hit in the face by a spiderweb but nothing more threatening than that the third room was empty as was the fourth room but the fourth room had blood in it a lot of blood bones knelt by one of the wide pooling spots giving it a deep sniff even above the chemical fumes in the room he knew it was beccas blood which meant the pieces of bones tossed almost casually in the corner were hers as well he rose the swell of killing anger in him making him calmer not crazed bones approached the last room with the heartbeat just as slowly and cautiously as he had the others if the lalauries had thought the grisly display of their leftovers would have him dashing in with reckless abandon to save her they were wrong this room was empty of furniture except for one long dark coffin where the heartbeat came from bones waited before entering his senses tuned for any nuance of noise or movement nothing then again a ghoul didnt breathe and could hold as still as a statue if need be delphine and louis could both be in there waiting for him bones dove into the room rolling immediately to counter any frontal assault the blades gripped in his hands seeking flesh to bury themselves into nothing not even a whisper except for that steady heartbeat the closet in the room had no doors so no one was hiding in there and unless delphine or louis had acquired ralmiels dematerializing trick they werent in this room he approached the coffin taking in another deep breath there was the scent of the embalming fluid beccas blood and something else metallic though too faint to decipher over the stink of the chemicals muffled noises consisting of mmph mmphh interspersed with ragged breathing from inside the coffin someone was alive in there gagged from the sounds of it bones ran his hand along the coffins lid this was too easy was delphine in there with becca waiting to thrust silver in his heart as soon as bones lifted the lid if she was shed soon find out the futility of that he cracked the lid heard a faint clickand then flung himself away the instant before the blast silver fragments from the specialized bomb were embedded all over the back of him so were the body parts of whichever unfortunate soul had been in that coffin only boness kevlar vest kept the ragged silver pieces from shredding his heart for a stunned moment he lay on the ground mentally calculating his injuries then delphine and louis burst into the room swinging away with silver knives bones staggered to his feet wincing at the pain in his legs where chunks of flesh had been torn off by the bomb his head was both ringing and throbbing some silver must have embedded in his skull he whirled making the stab louis aimed for his heart slice into his shoulder instead but it was a mistake since the blade pieced deeply into his skin when it would have only bounced off the kevlar on his chest bones shook his head to clear it mentally lashing himself quit being stupid or you wont have long to regret it hed lost the knives in his hands during the explosion bones received two more deep swipes before he could secure a blade and attack back louis lalaurie was quick dodging the blade and kicking bones in the thigh where a particularly large piece of silver was still lodged it cost him a step as he spun again to avoid delphines attack from behind her knife cleaved into his upper arm instead of through his neck it bit deep though almost severing the limb delphine was strong and she wasnt fighting like a novice she slashed at him while louis attacked from the front all the silver in his flesh was using up his strength as his body automatically attempted to heal itselfand heal the new injuries that were being inflicted one after the other delphine and louis forced him back causing him to almost trip over a piece of rubble his left arm hanging by a few ligaments took a few seconds to repair itself but those seconds were costly bones couldnt use the arm to fight and louis and delphine were pressing their advantage more silver hacked at him until every inch of his body felt like was burning and his blood spattered the ground around them weakening him further sensing victory was close delphine leaped onto his back savagely tearing at him with both her teeth and her knives bones couldnt dislodge her and keep louis at bay he couldnt even get more of his knives since delphine had managed to rip his coat off in her rabid attack he couldnt reach the ones strapped to his legs either without louis taking his head off as soon as bones bent down louis smiled feral and satisfied as an upward swipe bit deep into boness gut making him hunch instinctively at the blast of agony delphine redoubled her efforts and focused on hacking at his neck realizing she couldnt penetrate the kevlar on his back or chest a blur in the corner of the room made bones drop down on one knee louis let out a triumphant laugh but bones wasnt kneeling in defeat it was because hed seen what louis with his back turned and his attention fixated on bones hadnt noticed delphine saw it too she started to scream even as bones sprang back slamming both of them against the wall behind himwhile a long curved blade arced its way through louis lalauries neck louiss head turned to the right and kept going it rolled off his shoulders even as he slumped forward a dark viscous hole facing bones where his head used to be ralmiel held a redsmeared blade behind him delphine screamed again in a piercing wail of rage and grief bones didnt hesitate he reached into his boots and pulled out the two oblong canisters they contained ripping the tops off and stabbing them into her chest the twin flares erupted lighting her clothes on fire as they burned her from the inside out bones held on to them pitilessly pushing them deeper a ghouls body didnt have enough blood in it to put them out delphines screams became frenzied her legs and arms scissoring madly as she tried to escape bones pinned her to the floor ignoring the licking flames on him as she continued to burn hed fed well before tonight he wouldnt burn as easily the fire spread through delphines body splitting and blackening her skin faster than she could heal something savage in bones made him want to prolong this to keep shoving flares into delphine and burning her until there was nothing left but ash except there wasnt time sirens wailed getting louder the police would be there soon that bomb though relatively small hadnt gone unnoticed bones pulled a long blade from his boot letting delphine see the gleam of the metal as he held it above her then bones cut deeply through delphines neck feeling little satisfaction as her head rolled across the floor to stop at louiss decapitated corpse after all the evil the two had committed it was too quick and merciful an end for them but jelani at last you have your vengeance ralmiel walked over to him and held out a hand bones after a pause took it and let the other vampire pull him to his feet arent you supposed to be trying to kill me ralmiel didnt smile he glanced at the ceiling and shook his head i came in by way of the attic and saw her she doesnt have much time becca bones ran out of the room following the sound of the other fainter heartbeat the explosion actually helped in this regard the chunk it blew out of the hallway revealed a metal staircase inside the walls beccas heartbeat sounding louder in there bones pulled back some of the drywall to slip through then raced up the narrow stairs he flung back the hatch at the top of the stairs that opened into a small boxshaped room on top of the houses roof becca was lying on a bench boness face twisted as one glance revealed the extent of her abuse he knelt beside her turning her head so she could see him she was awake though in her state that was a curse instead of a blessing bones stared at her letting the power in his eyes capture her mind in her condition it took a few moments he waited murmuring its all right luv youre safe now until the horror and terror left her gaze and she quit trying to move or talk she couldnt do either though her lips were sewn together with what looked like fishing line and her arms and legs were gone the only reason she was still alive was that louisor delphinehad used some of their own blood to seal the gaping wounds left where her limbs used to be what used to be her arms and legs were now hideously smooth stumps bones closed his eyes he could save beccas lifeby taking it she wouldnt survive the transition if he tried to turn into a vampire but he could make her a ghoul all it required was her drinking some of his blood before she died and that wouldnt be long she was very near death as it was he thought of jelani of the ghouls admitted pain over trying to live as someone who would always be helpless compared to even the weakest of their kind and becca didnt know there was another world that existed on the fringe of hers how could bones condemn her to wake up trapped in that body changed into something she didnt even know existed a slow sigh came out of him then he forced himself to smile his gaze brightened while he harnessed all his energy into making becca believe everything he was about to tell her its all right bones said again stroking her face youre safe becca and theres no pain anymore youre not injured youre not even here youre in a beautiful field flowers all around you can you see them becca she nodded her features slipping into relaxed planes that were completely at odds with the ragged stitches around her mouth youre warm and youre lying on the ground looking up at the skylook at it becca see how blue it is her stare became more fixed bones leaned forward his mouth settling on her throat her pulse was so faint he could barely feel it against his lips sleep now becca bones whispered and bit deeply into her neck ralmiel met him at the front of the salon where becca worked from there they had a clear view of the police swarming over the lalauries old house and the bomb unit being called in blokes didnt want to chance that anything else might explode in the place not that bones could blame them after a few minutes of silence bones turned to ralmiel why did you come there tonight ralmiel shrugged jelani offered to pay me double the highest bounty on your corpse if i let you live instead so i thought to help you kill the scum fouling my city it was easy to know where you were mon ami once the house went boom bones couldnt contain his snort mate ive got some bad news for you jelanis skint broke and marie hasnt authorized any of what hes done the past several days so dont expect her to reimburse you either ralmiel stared at him theres no money fraid not he lied to me i will kill him ralmiel said in outrage pulling a pouch from his pocket and squeezing it nothing happened ralmiel looked down in surprise then squeezed again and again a slow smile spread across boness face having some difficulty are you understanding bloomed on ralmiels face you found georgette he murmured never underestimate your opponent bones replied you know youre not to be trifling with magic and if anything happens to georgette for coming to her senses and refusing to participate in your crimes again ill be forced to make them public ralmiel said nothing for a long moment bones waited wondering if now that ralmiel knew he wouldnt be collecting any quid for letting bones live hed dare to take him on in a fair fight without the chance of one of his magic escapes finally a faint smile creased ralmiels mouth non mon ami that time is past money is not everything oui one day perhaps you might assist me bones inclined his head i hope youre not lying i rather like you but if i ever see you on the other side of a silver weapon again ill shrivel you ralmiel shrugged understood then he nodded at the mass of people in the street thirsty another snort escaped bones did he want to plunge into that crowd and glut himself on the throats of nameless countless people whod never know theyd been bitten by the time he was done with them no he wanted to take becca to his townhouse clean her body up and then bury her in his courtyard so no more indignities could be committed upon her but he couldnt do that beccas family had the right to bury her not him the best thing bones could do was leave becca where she was the police would do their investigation tie it into the other murders and perhaps decide they had a copycat killer whod taken his obsession with the lalauries dark history too far since delphine and louiss bodies in death would have regressed back to their true ages the police might reckon they were old victims unearthed in that hidden room from the bombing theyd never realize they were looking at the killers themselves so in truth he had nothing to do but throw himself into the crowd that had no idea of the horrors committed just a block away besides marie might just try to make this his last mardi gras the scale of her retribution had yet to be determined eat and drink for tomorrow we die bones thought sardonically he swept out a hand to ralmiel lead the way mate underneath the cemetery the air was damp and cool with a heavy scent of mildew almost an inch of water stood on the ground these tunnels never got completely dry no matter how hard the pumps worked a single candle broke the darkness illuminating the face of the woman who sat in the only chair in the room jelani knelt in front of her which hadnt been an easy task considering his prosthetic legs but now his huge frame was in a posture of submission and resignation hed just confessed his crimes and was waiting for his sentence and after him bones was next looking down at him marie laveaus expression was blank hiding whatever thoughts were swirling in her mind after several tense minutes she stood you betrayed me her voice was as smooth as her skin making guessing her age difficult yes majestic jelani murmured power blasted out from her frame as her temper slipped bones didnt react but he felt like the air had just become littered with invisible razors slicing into his skin you are not sorry despite her anger electrifying the air when jelani raised his head he was smiling no my queen i am not christ bones thought intending to go out with a bang are you something flickered across maries face too quickly for bones to decipher if it was pity or rage good if you are to die for something then you shouldnt regret what it was her arm flashed out so fast that jelanis smile never had a chance to slip it was still on his face when his head rolled off his shoulders and his body slumped forward marie didnt move out of the way even though jelanis slowly oozing neck was now pressed against the hem of her skirt that long curved blade was still in her hand as her gaze met boness what about you are you sorry bones thought about the question and not just because he knew his life might hinge on his answer im sorry i didnt kill the lalauries sooner he said at last holding maries stare without flinching sorry an innocent girl met a horrible end because i involved her sorry for the bloke at your feet who felt revenge was worth more than his life but if what youre asking me is would i do it all over again to stop delphine and louisthe answer is yes and im not sorry about that marie tapped the knife against her leg bones glanced at it and then back to her dark eyes if you want my head i wont kneel for you to take it he thought coolly youre not my sire and i didnt betray you so youll have to fight for it with a knowing look marie wiggled the knife do you think i need this to kill you do you think i need any weapon at all she dropped the knife and stepped around jelanis body the air around her changed it thickened with power becoming icy despairing and angry a faint keening noise seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once you know what happens when a voodoo queen becomes undead marie asked her voice echoed like multiple people were somehow speaking through her vocal cords my ties to the otherworld were strengthened those consigned to the grave filled me with their power listen to them roar marie opened her mouth and there was a roar ragefilled and eerie enough to make bones shiver dark swirls appeared around her as if her shadow had multiplied those swirls moved to curl around bones stroking him with freezing malevolent hungry hands his strength seemed to melt out of him with their touch while the memory of his death so long ago flashed in his mind he felt the same way he did then cold weak succumbing to that inevitable slide into nothingness then the power around marie faded that unearthly keening stopped the shadows curled back into her and in a rush the strength returned to boness body marie watched him a small brittle smile on her mouth i wish you would have lied to me then i could have justified killing you bones recovered enough to shrug you already knew the truth lying would only have insulted us both she studied him again her expression giving nothing away you are banned from new orleans for five years she finally stated if you violate this ban i will kill you if you speak of these events to anyone i will kill you as far as what everyone else will know i contracted you to take care of the lalauries while i was out of town and jelani was killed by them in defense of his city furthermore you owe a debt to me equivalent to the value of a life since im letting you keep yours bones didnt argue maries assertion that she could kill him her display of power moments ago made it plain that there were things about new orleanss queen that few people knewor lived to tell all things considered bones was getting a slap on the wrist then again it was also in maries best interest to leave bones alive to back up her version of events as for jelani at least marie was giving him an honorable legacy there were worse things to die for than securing a longdenied revenge sooner or later everyone died it just took death longer to catch up to those it had already visited like vampires and ghouls done bones said marie dropped her gaze to look at the dead man near her feet get out her voice sounded huskier she knelt by jelanis withering frame to stroke his shoulder even though shed killed him her grief was clear that sort of ruthlessness combined with her level of power made marie truly frightening if meting out jelanis death had meant nothing to her bones wouldnt have found her chilling but even though it had hurt her to kill jelani that hadnt stopped her from doing it yes best be going quickly bones left without looking back his flight out of the city was already booked by tonight hed be on his way to ohio searching out the undead accountant hed been tracking before he got involved in this mess this was over but it was time for the next hunt dark matters vicki pettersson for dennis stephenson a wonderful father grandfather and man prologue it was a normal moment and barely worth note which of course was what made it so noteworthy but after weeks and a barrage of demands and pleas jj would finally be allowed to wave sparklers and an american flag and cheer until his throat burned and when darkness blanketed the sky fountains of color so amazing and loud and powerful would rip it open dulling even the las vegas strip visible in the distance for a child born reared and hidden in an underground lair it was an absolute dream come true so that was why a family of superheroes were having a simple picnic on a grassy hillside blanketedge to blanketedge with the mortals theyd been born to defend born and sworn to deflect and protect his father would say in a booming baritone that made his mother throw back her head and laugh jj would steal glances at themat the giant man with honeycolored eyes identical to his own and his mother with her quiet strength and noble lineageand wonder if he had what it took to do that to make them proud he didnt know in a world that honored women he was not yet a grown man but he was the strongest fiveyearold he knew and all the kids in the sanctuary said his high jumpalready ten feetwas better than most of the girls a born leader hed overheard the new soothsayer tekla claim of him and while he wasnt sure what he was supposed to be leadinga parade like the one theyd seen earlier today maybe a band like the one with the drums thatd rumbled down the street hed liked the sound of it so while his parents sipped from plastic cups making small talk with the mortals gathered on the highest green of the sandstone golf course jj waved a rope hed found lying in the asphalt parking lot and pretended it was his mothers barbed whip he would inherit the conduit when it was time and hed wield it as deftly as she did unfurling it in the air to strike at fleeing shadows and their vicious canine wardens jj became so entrenched in these imaginary battles that he had threaded two bunkers and a green by the time the first rocket shot into the sky amid the distant laughter and clapping of the hillside audience he froze under that pulsing sky the rope slipping from his palms he felt the same sort of wonder as when his father blocked a thirtyfoot dunk in skyball or when his mother made a concrete wall appear out of nowhere with the mere flick of her wrist who knew mortals were capable of something both beautiful and explosive each detonated flare thrummed inside his chest like a second irregular heartbeat he jolted when his fathers hand dropped to his shoulder at some point as light had carved whorls into the sky theyd found him this is what were preserving for everyone else his father told him his characteristic passion making each word sharp every person has a right to the small things you see the little happinesses after all those are the ones that make life most worth living its what were fighting for he touched his wifes hand as he said it and jj saw that it was good cotton candy and popcorn and sticky fingers and a slightly sick stomach when it was all over jj only realized hed fallen asleep when he felt himself being lifted then settled again in the car theyd borrowed for the occasion outside of their troops sanctuary his parents were believed to be too hardstrapped to afford their own vehicle they took the bus when posing as mortals but most often they ran with a speed that would make a cheetah envious and this was jjs dream as they drove back to the hotel where theyd spend the night before returning to their subterranean lair at dawnhe was outrunning a big cat legs wheeling so fast that the beast eventually slowed and bowed to him as the superior athlete jj climbed atop the animal his right as the competitions victor and was carried at breakneck speed along the neonslicked streets whizzing past the giant hotels his parents had pointed out to him hours before he startled awake when the cat reared suddenly though they would tell him later that the animals awful cry was really the screeching of brakes he opened his eyes to see his mothers face eyes fierce and burning into his but it was her lighted chest that riveted him normally dormant beneath her skin her glyph was fired warning of danger and her right hand curled tightly around her whip stay she said and then she was gone on the floor his father snapped and like the sparklers jj had waved only hours before he too was only a bright trail for the eye to follow in the night jjs heart thrummed inside his small frame chest tight as if his arien glyph wished to burst to life as well danger screamed some primal voice inside him flee but his father had said to stay on the floor it will be even safer beneath the car he didnt know why hed listen to some unfamiliar voice over his own fathers but if he was outside he could see his parents and as long as he could see them hed be okay of course even as he clambered over the front seat even before the first battle cry ripped the hot velvet skyprobably even before hed been tossed from the back of the dream cheetahhe knew they were at war these were shadows rotted sulphur and smoke pooled in the night sky stinging his eyes just as in his ward mothers bedtime stories still he blinked away the burn searching for his parents along the rocky desert vista every outcropping a bumpy threat inching forward beneath the cars chassis he settled in time to see his mothers whip unfurl barbed tips sparking off the light from her chest which also threw her drawn porcelain features into stark relief she was feral the shadow she fought was a charred skeleton mama the word squeaked from him his strong mother his laughing and vibrant mother couldnt be injured by that demon tears welled and he blinked them awaykeep them in sight so he saw when the shadows head swiveled his way no his mother screamed and she ignored the extended arc of her whip as she reversed flipping her wrist to shove the metal grip into the living skeletons teeth bone shattered beneath the force and jjand his crywas forgotten another light appeared zigzagging like an overgrown firefly defying bulk to outmaneuver his opponent his fathers limbs whirled breaking skin and bone with studded gloves sending more noxious fumes spilling into the air the two shadows fell at nearly the same time and jjs parents sidestepped backtoback breathing hard studying their surroundings how his mother asked voice low later his father reached behind with one bloodied fist to squeeze her free hand lets get jay to safety jj nearly opened his mouth to cheerhis brave parents his strong parents had done it again but his mother jerked her head her reply a near growl we need to know now why because there might be others suddenly there were so many circling so fast the smoke became a black tornado and jj quickly lost count though outnumbered his parents continued to guard each other backs and fingertips touching searching for a way out just before the first cry sounded his mother shot a look back at the car a smile touched her lips briefly before she let it fall then she fought and then she died and somewhere more mortals set the sky alight burning the heavens for pleasure even as his parents death cries carved whorls into the air the shadows didnt linger the deaths of two senior agents of light would soon be noted the kill spots as obvious as the constellations above for those who knew how to read them so jj squeezed from beneath the car as soon as the last shadow disappeared and rushed to his parents there was barely anything recognizable at all it was as if the shadows were so blighted in spirit and form that they wished to render the light the same solange ma sola come back jjs head jerked up un instant mama i want a souvenir to mark my first the girls words died in her throat when she saw him her gaze skittered like beetles to his hands braced on the broken things he loved she wasnt much older than he maybe eight but with a darkness about herone thatd called her back in search of a memento she had watched as her troop ambushed and murdered his family jj realized with a sniff studying for her future position as a shadow agent a tear coursed over his cheek and she winced as if it repulsed her she frowned then opened her mouth to reveal his existence he held tight to what was left of his parents while another tear fell solange came the voice again causing the girl to jolt solange licked her lips their eyes remained fastened on each other finally nothing here mama so allez our enemies will soon be here we dont wish to be trapped within their radius leave the cadeau and the cleanup for them laughter accompanied her retreat and sapped jjs remaining strength he collapsed between what used to be his family and stared blindly up at the molten scarred celebratory sky solange sola ma sola he mumbled her names over and over he memorized them he wondered why she hadnt killed him and sobbingeven once he was lifted into the arms of his troop leaderhe wished she had the bar was a college hangout hardly more than a steel ceiling and a concrete floor the socalled band had just finished their final set and was now taking their payment from the tap jj let his head hang forward as warren called for another round and the bartender whod only dubiously allowed the last one frowned options flitted over his face like words on a teleprompter he could be fined if they left this bar and suffered injury under the influence of the whiskey hed served but on the up side they wouldnt come back even in a rundown midtown las vegas bar where transience was an accepted part of life a guy who smelled like a bum and one who looked like a pissedoff linebacker were undesirable so he hedged his bets and brought them the bottle jj offered up a lopsided smile it was the vegas way once served his troop leader finally came around to the subject hed spent the last half hour inching up on that my son was a close one no jj thought tapping the glass and throwing back his head it had been even closer than that trapped in that steel plane thousands of feet above the ground jj had been forced to consider something rare at least in relation to himself death in fact hed never been so sure of anything in his life as the commuter flight the shadows had hijacked flew toward the base flanked by fighter jets screams tearing through the air what most surprised him was the voice the one he trusted and had named his intuition had sighed its acceptance finally jj knew warren expected some bland agreement but his overriding thought was just buy me another shot man then his troop leader surprised him by squaring on him fully its hard living in the past hard to even call it your past if youve never put it behind you jj peered into his shot glass this thing still empty warren motioned took the bottle from the bartenders hands and started pouring it himself youve broken even so far but thats just treading water and today proved it because today for the first time in the three years hed been a fullfledged agent of light jj had almost lost obviously hed experienced death before one couldnt live long in an underworld of heroes and demons and not be touched by it and he told warren that now without words using only a shrug and a jerk of his head to throw back another shot god but the whiskey was goodsharp and warm and lingering in his belly as if his glyph glowed there it made him feel alive deaths not important warren said in reply i know holding out his glass jj accidentally caught his reflection across the bar eyes spent face sunken on his wide frame his normally tan skin sallow like campfire dust mingling with sand he was built like his dad though even wider and taller and stockier his sheer size had drawn such unwanted attention that the troops physicianmagician micah had whittled down his frame once already but the pain of even that minor transformation was like mainlining mercury in the hours before he healed it was as if hed been skinned alive then stitched back together tighter even now if he thought about it too much he could imagine himself bursting at the seams jj refused any additional reduction after that and warren hadnt pressed looking at his bleached militarycut hair through the smoked mirror he wondered idly if he should shave it to the skull would that whittle him down even more could walking through the world with less friction smooth out the journey death also isnt meaningful not even a violent one warren continued impervious to jjs thoughts of journeys and friction its what you tell yourself about death thats critical thoughts shape actions and actions expose your state of mind shit jj jerked the bottle from warrens hand because if he had to listen to a lecture about the past and death and the detonated fate hed narrowly avoided he wasnt going to do it sober unfortunately it took a lot for a superhero to get truly shitfaced a fact jj currently lamented so is this the speech where you tell me my parents didnt die because of me that there was nothing i could do at the time and that i need to put it behind me because i swear ive heard that one somewhere before and it was bullshit besides what more do you want from me he continued before warren could answer i do the best i can at all times you cant tell me i dont i wouldnt but your level best is different than your potential best i dont know what the hell that means his voice was too sharp his body too rigid dial it back jj told himself even while downing another glass boy the more you drank the smoother this shit got it means the heroes of your past should fortify the present youre engaged in old battles son so in answer to your question thats what i want for the first time in your life look forward not back what happened tonight should show you what a gift the future really is jj licked his lips slowly knowing exactly what sort of gifts his future held things like metaphorically throwing himself in front of oncoming trains to save countless others most of whom had gotten themselves into bad situations through faulty logic poor planning or pure stupidity in fact the majority of the mortal population was spoiled and ungrateful and continued to piss away the life he fought for them to have he also didnt say hed give a limb just to be able to work a regular joes ninetofive and to come home to nothing more complicated than a pair of squabbling kids and a lukewarm meal instead i have to beware if i go on something as simple as a fucking picnic warren misread his silence dont you care anymore jay dont you still believe you can make a difference son jj snorted sure he cared he had no problem helping othershe knew no other life than thatbut lately itd occurred to him that making a difference meant having to always put his own needs and desires second or in a city of two million was it dead last warren dropped a hand on his shoulder i think youre burned out son maybe jj conceded rolling his glass between his palms though ive never heard of an agent burning out after only three years some superhero its been three years since your metamorphosis warren said referring to that critical moment when a troop member turned from mere initiate into a fullfledged agent of light youve been fighting for over twenty their eyes met but neither man spoke his parents deaths were long ago and remembered from different vantage points but horror and sadness still plagued both of them look warren said i think you should take some time off go fishing get laid fucking shave for gods sake im fineand stubble looks good on the trading cards warren didnt laugh youre cold im calm jj corrected his voice was low but his glance was sharp warren wasnt intimidated well we need you committed if were going to acquire our priceless little package before the shadows do understand jj wanted to say he understood his own life was passing him by unlived while he toiled in service to some pampered elite but he was already talking too loud and his eyes were probably pinwheeling from the adrenaline still trailing through his system he could sit here and argue with warren or he could agree with the man and get on with drinking so he nodded his head hoped he looked contrite and waited for his leader to leave when warren didafter an order disguised as a warning to go home and sleep it offjj glanced up at the television where a local station was reporting on the latest antics of some vapid society sisters a blond whod just shown her physical talents to half the western world in some mens magazine he used to read for the articles and her sisterher darkeyed unsmiling oppositewho had no reason that he could see to look so pissed off he downed the rest of his whiskey and held up a hand for another bottle and then in a roundabout fashion the package warren had mentioned appeared on the screen jj squinted at the image of one tonya dane a psychic whod appeared on a local morning show the previous week to predict an earthquake on this side of the sierra nevadas that alone wouldnt have been cause for worry or even note not among his kind but the prediction had come true which was why the footage continued its loop on the tube what they kept cutting was danes leadin prediction the appearance of the kairos a powerful woman who would tip the metaphysical scales in favor of whatever sidelight or shadowshe chose to endorse mortals having no idea what that meant dismissed it as nonsense but those words had been long coveted in his world previously the kairos had been buried in mythology but danes prediction brought that epoch to an end and now both sides were searching for her in earnest unfortunately dane had since disappeared without even a tarot card to point them her way the bartendermustached built and apparently uninterested in parapsychologyflipped the station he caught jjs gaze through the mirror and quirked a brow you watching that nah bro flip it jj shakily brought his shot glass to his lips muttered into it heres to free will and all that shit ill drink to that it was a testament to his drunkenness that he didnt sense the womans approach he turned and she was just thereslimlimbed doeeyed with a cascade of raven black hair she quirked a brow at the bottle in his hand clearly accustomed to getting what she wanted jj didnt mind though she smelled good have a name jj or just jay he didnt bother lying unlike his glass fingertips hers appeared printed like any mortals and again she smelled like a dream you yes she licked cherry lips coming on strong out of the gate one way or another jj seemed destined for a headon collision tonight besides he thought letting his eyes travel the length of her body warren had said to take some time off that your convertible outside she asked his focus sharpened marginally howd you know anyone else in here look like they can manage that ride besides mustangs are my favorite though i usually prefer a darkhaired man driving it really so he leaned forward into her space testing angling in further she met him halfway you willing to overlook that glaring fault and go for a little ride if i wanted a little ride she said pointedly id be talking to the guy over there he laughed throaty and loud surprising himself then threw down some bills draping his arm over her slim shoulders he turned her toward the door come he said already sure she would she did love the car she purred when he revved the engine laughed when the tires bit into the curb and stood in her bucket seat hands gripping the windshield as speed and desert airpregnant with a summer stormplayed havoc with her hair bolting up charleston he left the false cheer of las vegas behind driving so fast it was like he was burying them in the night he jerked the wheel right before spring mountain ranch the turnoff coming more quickly than he remembered though the view from the asphalt top was as spectacular as alwaysand theirs alone wild burros and rattlers regularly canvassed the dusty range but as the first bolts of lightning pinged off the desert floor all that flashed back at them were joshua trees sagebrush and the red sandstone range framing the basin jj killed the engine and for a moment they were both silent enjoying the beginnings of a storm that would turn the dry washes into rivers sure to flood the valley then the woman rose straddling the windshield in one liquid motion skirt rising to her hips she challenged him with a downward glance as her bare foot carelessly crushed a wiper i love a good desert monsoon she said and licked her lips as the sky cracked open jj moved so fast she was pinned to the glass before the first raindrop fell his hands were in her windwhipped hair his mouth eating her laughter he had to remind himself to be careful with hershe was mortal and more fragile than his kindbut her hunger was spiced and it fueled him it was probably just the drink but with his eyes closed his mouth open and his body spread atop hers he felt pieces of him shifting inside as if loosening from tethered moorings suddenly unbound when jj finally opened his eyes he was surprised to find their positions reversed he was pinned to the hood her clothing pushed aside his jeans half down his thighs she lowered herself over him a private smile revealed in a sharp crack of splintered light but when her hips began pistoning above him he forgot even to be surprised he decided later that despite her aggressiveness she was a closet romantic why else wait until the storm had heightened and they were both about to climax to pull out the weapon the need for symbolism coupled with raw power obviously motivated herhim too which was why he happened to open his eyes in that moment wanting to watch her rainstreaked face as she cried out into the wild night instead he saw her wide dark eyes hard with intent and the honed edge of a tomahawk barreling toward his chest jj barely pulled his palms from her waist in time to counteract the lethal blow but once itd been deflected adrenaline lent the sobriety needed to disarm her he flipped crushing her against the car she so loved her slim frame denting the pristine hood the glyph on her chest began to smoke guess i dont have to be so gentle after all he said and made a second deeper dent the impact didnt stop her throaty laughter satisfy a girls curiosity before she dies is this a final request he growled forearm across her neck at least youll finish off something tonight besides your life you mean he dug a nail into the flesh of her fingertip and felt a false print pop off he sucked in a deep breath but still couldnt scent anything of her shadowy nature shed covered it with a synthetic then it was easy enough to do she smiled weakly when did you get the tattoo on your right shoulder shed seen the yinyang symbol the word desire was etched out in the shaded side the other held fear i was nineteen he saw no harm in answering now and now youre twentyeight she relaxed beneath him as his brow furrowed all her strength sinking inward he remained on guard jj she teased in a threadbare croak ive known you since you were five he froze above her all the shifting inside of him ceasing reversing and you are he asked voice as hard solange she said simply lightning cracked over his shoulder as memories moved through his skull solange sola ma sola youve lost your accent second generation french she shrugged easily like they didnt have a past and she still had a future easy when youre raised here have you waited twentythree years to kill me her tongue darted out wetting her bottom lip ive waited to see why i didnt they looked at each other and jj inexplicably lessened the pressure then he caught himself and picked up her conduit the tomahawk the heft was eerily unfamiliar he lifted it above his head she gave him a slight smile for being able to do what she hadnt im sorry again it threw him aboutmy parents she nodded again he raised a brow so sorry you were going to kill me he felt her forearm flex before her fingertips trailed up his arm playing just below his tattoo i was going to put you out of your misery dont do me any more favors solange but as her fingertips continued to play on his skin he lowered her weapon warrens words revisited him as he stared into the cocoa depths of the womans eyes deaths not importantnot even a violent one thoughts were crucial hed said actions exposed ones state of mind after a few more moments of staring and still living solange lifted slightly and ground her pelvis into his still half clothed and surprisingly half hard he swallowed met her gazeand slid easily back into her warmth ah so even superheroes she whispered in rhythm crave the illicit her hot breath sent chills down his arm and you crave he asked somehow knowing he was giving it to her he pushed deeper not much she waited until she was coming again breathing the answer into his mouth mere relevance why dont i kill her why despite being natural enemies did jj instead lie with solange on the dented hood of his car until the full of the high desert storm had passed maybe it was because she too had been born into this life of battling sidesgood versus evil light and shadowand she recognized or was at least willing to admit that perfection and compulsiveness and vigilance would get them only so far they could both act like model agents but if either so much as breathed in the wrong direction the same gruesome death theyd watched his parents endure would readily be theirs normally his mind shied from that memory but with his enemys head on his shoulder he admitted that thats what happened when a person gave himself over entirely to the lifestyle it was why he was burned out and why he resented the mortals hed sworn to protect he found the thought of continuing to exist for the mere good of someone else unbearable but if i had something for myself something that was mine alone what do you recall solange asked him the heat in her voice threaded soft jj gazed up at the black metal sky not the battle that was sure that was muddied with the confusion of a fiveyearolds mind a swirl of color and sound melding into a singular cry of pain when he thought back to the night his parents died he didnt even remember the red carnage or not much anyway yet he could clearly envision his parents touching hands holding to each other until the very last theyd died because of himbut theyd lived because of each other it was my fault he finally said in lieu of his truest thought which was ill never have that i wanted to see the fireworks they were permitted to take me from the sanctuary because no one could stand to listen to me whine any longer so we were on the golf course out in the open because of meand i think we were tracked because of me too he knew now eyes following the tail of the receding storm that his emotions had been high a young boys excitement even stronger than the fireworks staining the sky your joy was like tingling warm taffy solange confirmed turning her head so she was staring directly into his eyes it was the sweetest thing id ever sensed jj swallowed hard she broke eye contact first nestled closer and looked back to the nowclear sky stars so bright they looked scoured he could snap her neck in one swift jerk i follow the constellations she said suddenly as if the words and her voice were at odds never someone elses orders not even my own whim so in a way the sky is a map of my mind nobody else knows that she tilted her head up to his exposing her neck like a dare he bent kissed its hollow and found it salty and slightly sharp when she spoke again her voice thrummed against his lips so if you know what constellation im tracing you can connect the dots and predict my next move what constellation are you on now she gave him a look like he was crazy jj laughed liking the way she could surprise him fine then tell me this are you on an upswing or down she shook her head lifting to lean on an elbow youre missing the point the stars arent whats important theyre just pivot points to send you off in a new direction its the space between them thats relevant everything that can actually be seenthe stars you meis less than four percent of whats out there the rest isdark because its invisible she shook her head because its unknown she sat up turning suddenly so both elbows were propped on his chest her weight entirely atop his though he felt little of it you know most people think everything they do is so important they sweat the small stufftraffic jams and spilled milkand get pissed off if things dont come off exactly as planned most go their entire lives without realizing plans dont matter one bit jj knew they were at the mercy of something much bigger and he often thought more uncaring than that the greatest mysterieslife love lossare destined to remain a dark matter she jerked her chin at the crystalline sky we dont even know what were looking at right now he dropped a kiss atop her damp perversely refreshing cynical head its the universe no she nestled closer and pointed at the sky thats a violent evolving panorama of births and deaths just like us the universe she said pointing to the spot hed just kissed is in here which was the same shit warren had been telling him earlier which was the same shit he thought sighing that he already knew except for one thing he tapped his head which means you think that ninetysix percent of what is up here is dark matter exactly linking her slim arms behind her head solange smiled and chaos reigns it was hard to argue against people being predisposed to chaos jj thought as he hauled a skinny mortal from a seedy downtown strip club the idiot had been about to challenge a shadow over a woman who called herself destiny yeah jj thought posing as a bouncer destiny was really worth getting your head ripped literally from your shoulders maybe its why you guys need protection in the first place he mumbled what the man asked his tone matching his terrified face i said you should take a serious look at the way you spend your free time look at you man the scrawny redhead jerked down his shirt after jj threw him against the wall like you have any right to judge score one point for the village idiot jj thought because as much as the comparison rubbed for the first time he was indulging his darker side too and enjoying it still he had a job to do and was finding a perverse joy in that again as well he reentered the club and headed back to the vip room to give the lone shadow a real taste of destiny i dont think the kairos will be found entertaining a late night stag party jj said parting the curtains of the private room and dropping into the seat nearest the door but thats just me the shadow a small but stocky man who was all but lost between two manufactured breasts froze he swallowed hard dark eyes darting the glyph on his chest beginning to smoke but he otherwise didnt move when he saw that jj was alone visually measuring the distance between them as being great enough he tried to play it cool cant be too thorough though can you he said smiling as he ran a hand down destinys thigh no you cant and jj unfurled his whip with a crack destiny screamed even though shed been a whole four inches away from the nearest barb and began tottering from the room on lucite heels jj caught her in one arm pulling her close to his chest as he yanked snapping her johns neck by the time warren arrived destiny was resting in a dark corner the shadow appeared passed out on the velvet sofa and the rooms security tapes were in jjs pockets who warren asked eyes assessing jj for injury jj smiled handing the tapes over shadow pisces where he jerked his head back at the club warren motioned and a cleanup crew emerged from the night like ninja warriors slipping inside the back door the corpse would be gone in five minutes the kill spotwith the shadows death and jjs claim to itwould remain forever warren clapped him on the back a wide grin splitting the furrows of his craggy face nice to have you back son on the side of light the side of might jj finished for him though pleased with the nights work he wasnt sure solange would feel the same he arrived at their meeting spot a motel off the i sure she wouldnt come if she did it would only be to end their affair in fact she might even break their unspoken truce by bringing her troop with her instead she met him wearing silk and garters and holding a glass of champagne id have been worried she murmured as he closed in on her if youd wrapped that thing around one of the girls instead of the guy the morbid humor stoked their lovemaking like rocket fuel jj stroked her hair remembering how it trailed behind her as shed fled gregor he thought of her tomahawk whirring through the air and it was all he could do not to laugh into her mouth how could he explain the rush of knowing this dark lethal beauty was his who would believe that he fought hard and well and heroically to return to that wry promising smile coming together with solange was very simply like riding a cyclone that was wonderful sola said after their final collapse sending him a look that would have sucked the air from his chest were any left but the next time you save me from being cornered by the scorpio of light ill kill you she was referring to a small skirmish two days earlier hed been sure she hadnt noticed tucking a strand of hair behind the delicate shell of her earlobe he said i know sweetheart i wouldnt stop any of my allies from slaying you he hummed his understanding against her lips and youll kill me as well she pulled back but said it like she was asking for a date he shrugged dropping his eyes if youd like its not about what i like she said biting off the last word she forced him to look at her its about authenticity we need to be as honest in that as we are in all else otherwise this means nothing in that case he said licking at her skin ill wrap my whip around your middle let the barbs bite into your organs and rip it free before you even make a sound he kissed her lightly and she sighed into his opened mouth youre such a romantic jj swallowed her wicked laugh and met the lift of her hips find the kairos yet she asked licking at the hollow of his neck he kissed the top of her head stop fishing she put on a pout like you dont care what were up to honey if your side had our worlds weapon of mass destruction i wouldnt be lying here now and a part of him was careful to keep this in mind even when he was notched deep inside her you guys have no idea where the kairos is knowing she was beaten she curled up back to his chest leaving jj to wonder if she wasnt merely a gorgeous exciting and yes dangerous pet project proof that even someone raised by people dedicated to chaos and destruction could choose the right thing if only provided the opportunity perhaps he thought stroking her hair if they had someone to believe they were good playing savior was no basis for a relationship but as his actions werent being reported in either the shadow manuals or the light he didnt worry too much disguised as comic books and consumed by mortal minds these manuals were as important for what they omitted as for the battles they recorded perhaps his deeds werent being shown because he was getting through to sola he chose to believe the universe knew she needed anonymity if she was to continue working her way toward good after all his side would try to stop him if they knew what he was doing and hers would kill her outright thus he decided the universe itself was upholding their right to chooseto choose each other or to choose to walk awayand to do it without interference from those who wouldnt know of the affair unless they saw it with their own eyes that was a natural law and therefore an obvious sign to jj that sola was wrong and he was right so he held out hope she would soon realize this even while unable to fathom such a reversal in his own moral code the great irony his involvement with her hadnt lessened his desire to save the world but strengthened it so how could it be wrong besides his hearts longing was a small private matter he wished only to love whom he wanted to be with whom he chose but she was right about one thing why should he be the only one not getting what he wanted why should every small pleasure be sacrificed to duty if he was going to die in the same gruesome fashion as his parentsa risk he took every time he stepped from his sanctuarythen he should be allowed to take joy where he could so when she woke and turned to him in the middle of the night asking yet again why he bothered fighting her kind he smiled against her side i need to he said simply im a superhero youre a man she said her throaty voice soft as smoke her hand resting on the tattoo that was both shadow and light i have what you need yes for some reason he needed her too and for some other reason she was willing to be his need dont get it solas eyes were on jj as he leaned from the bed to check his cell warren i have to youre putting work ahead of me her bottom lip swollen from his kisses would be sticking out ahead of the competition yes he smiled as he angled back but she turned away snorting he putting a hand over the receiver in case warren came on the line dont even try it solange threw the sheets from her body backside swaying as she made her way to the bathroom a few seconds later water began running into the tub yes he said tone altering at warrens voice his leader had begun calling jj first whether it was to assist with recon stakeout or especially attack how ironic that he had sola to thank for it ive found her jj stood you havent but he began pulling on his jeans onehanded where right where shes supposed to be warren laughed and it wasnt his maniacal spiral though it couldnt be called tame either she wasnt in hiding or kidnapped by the shadows or even in jail over a traffic violation she went to fucking maui but now shes back maui jj rolled his eyes tonya dane predicted his worlds savior and then went surfing where are you the motel on fremont ill be right there jj flipped the phone shut and slid it into his pocket getting to tonya first was a huge coup that womans mindmortal but a psychicswas a big red arrow on a map that with luck could lead directly to the kairos solange was soaking in the tub slim and shining legs propped against the faucet dark tendrils pressed against the damp curve of her long neck jj smiled reflexively when he saw her but she didnt even look up off to play angel of mercy she wrinkled her little nose and sourly truncated his reply i dont understand why you bother saving those who wont lift a finger to save themselves given his recent burnout jj was surprised to find himself arguing we allow freedom of choice from your influence we dont interfere unless theres an outright victimization we simply counteract your machinations so the mortal population remains autonomous shadows cant influence those who arent already predisposed to chaos she answered as quickly all you do is delay the inevitable we grant a person time and space to make a better choice you waste your life to better the future of those who are undeserving everyone is deserving of a chance he answered simply hand to her cheek she mimicked the movement i told you youre a romantic you are too she pulled away at that the lips he loved to lick pursed in a tight bow uhuh i live for myself i put my life above all others it will always be that way mark my word and is that written in the stars you know the answer to that it was written between them go she lifted a leg in the air soaping one tight calf her mouth still thinned in a pout he wanted to say he was sorry that she knew how duty called and all that but it wouldnt deter sola from a mood she was determined to be in and it was also untrue he wasnt sorry because the moment she got wind that the soothsayer was back in town she and her entire troop would swoop down upon her as well right now he ignored solas combative words by lifting her from the water and pulling her to him she squealed though he could tell she was delighted how could one of the softest things hed ever touched also be one of the hardest people hed ever known you wont be far behind he reminded her circling his hands on her bare hips she shrugged one slim wet shoulder like she didnt care but beckoned him forward after another moment lifting to her toes as he curled about her she tucked her hands into the back pockets of his jeans wetting the front of him with her warm body her tongue darting gently to meet his lips he opened to her but she didnt deepen the kiss just pulled back to stare up into his eyes the fingertips of her left hand rising to circle the tattoo that lay beneath his tshirt be careful out there he reached around to cup her ass lifted her slightly and deepened the kiss himself her response was fired and seconds flipped into minutes find me again tonight that soon surprise lightened her voice they usually waited at least a day between meetings he smiled im hard now ill be here jj was still smiling as he let himself out into the morning light behind him was an enemy mistress who made him feel bold oddly heroic and shockingly alive in front of him was a mortal seer who might or might not know the identity of his worlds savior he tried not to think of himself as being caught between them he still wanted it all warren had tonya dane stashed away at a dilapidated motel on fremont street which while not a safe zone was a good enough place to hide as long as emotions didnt run high when shadows lurked nearby there were a number of hideyholes and nondescript locales used this way by both sides of the zodiac safe zoneslike master comics where the troop manuals were created and displayedwere desired but rare but today jj had to quell the laughter that threatened to bubble out of him when he entered the lazy dayz motel to find a superhero masquerading as a bum getting his palm read by a woman who looked like a cross between a country music star and a stripper tonya dane stared up at jj when he entered blinking a good halfdozen times as she took in his short blond cut the skin as naturally dark as her enforced tan and his overall size when she finished her frosted smokers mouth pursed obviously another one of yall jj glanced at warren who sheepishly withdrew his hand its okay she knows everything shes agreed to a full memory cleanse as soon as were finished we were just passing the time until you arrived tonya reached over bright pink nails digging into warrens weatherbeaten hands remember what i said she still loves you shes showing it in the only way she knows how warren cleared his throat and rose the others should be here shortly that distracted jj from tonyas words others i decided to bring in the rest of the troop after we talked ms dane here says that different people bring out nuance in her readings even if related to the same subject time is more fluid than this world believes even future relations can be read in the present so shed be able to read connections between them and the kairosif there were to be any i figured there was no harm in introducing her to the others as shell give up the memory anyway itll give tekla a rare opportunity to talk shop with someone who shares her talent but on the mortal side he smiled at tonya shes our troops seer i know tonya said eliciting a truncated snort from jj he sobered when her sharp eyes found him again we can start with you start what with me the readings and she held out her hand for his palm wait jj turned back to warren to find humor threading the mans mouth i thought we were questioning her not the other way around he didnt think a mortal seer could rival their worlds psychic in skill but with a secret life and his lovers touch so recently on his skin it was best to stay away from seers altogetherwhich was why teklas impending appearance was so disturbing hed been avoiding her as well warren sobered just give it a try you may have a residual connection with the kairos jj wanted to ask how it could be residual if it hadnt happened yet but knew better from his sessions with tekla ask one innocent question and youd get a weeklong lecture on the intricacies of quantum physics he had long since learned to keep quiet still he remained skeptical of dane i dont know jj began but warren was done jay please i know its not much to go on but we need every available advantage okay he clenched his jaw but nodded sure tonya reached for his hand as soon as he settled across from her its better if i touch you its better if you dont i dont like to be touched she reached out anyway her cool fingers as fragile as a sparrows foot in his tensile palm he couldnt help but compare her touch to solas though undeniably female his loves form was merely a streamlined version of his own as if tendons and veins bone and muscle were all concretefilled tonya in contrast was air her tone though gave her weight youre a singularly driven man which isnt rare of your kind but youve a compulsiveness that drives you harder farther and deeper you fight where others will stop which was when she stopped her body jolting slightly for a moment he thought she was going to pull away but then her voice deepened the cadence altered in many ways and for many years you will be the perfect superhero so much for her preternatural abilities he thought starting to draw away hed already screwed that up thank you her airy fingers constricted catching his again you harbor a strong sense of duty but entertain a private restlessness your gift a talent with your hands steadies you and helps you to live more in the moment but it doesnt entirely quiet the internal dissension jj sat straighter warier now but intrigued he was the troops weaponeer had been even prior to metamorphosis into a full agent and was responsible for making the conduits that could kill agents something mortal weapons could not do you have a tragic past not unusual for one dealing in evil matters but yours has shaped you in a strange way you are attracted to things you fear and desire to understand them you have friends youre well liked but the one who will know you best is drawn in by your fallibility warren stiffened at that though he remained turned away pushing aside the curtain to look out the window tonya spoke faster as if rushing through the words could lessen their impact saving all of mankind isnt enough to motivate you it needs to be personal you strip away a persons labels and see the individual its very admirable its very dangerous said warren who always saw things in terms of black and white yes jj agreed immediately knowing too well how his leader felt cohesiveness was desired the good of the whole came first the troop was more important than the individual can be tonya said knowing none of this but you desire a deeper involvement you want to feel more people their ability to choose thats enough jj jerked away her pseudostrength giving way to his will none of this is useful in finding the kairos but her voice continued to rasp from between those frosted lips this will allow you to see her she is a mystery to you a dark matter the greatest mysteries are destined to remain a dark matter dane wasnt talking about the kairos he suddenly realized she was speaking of solange you will know she is meant for you before she does no more jj shot from his chair heading straight to the door he needed air you will recognize her immediately later he said thinking shut up shut up shut up there is no later not for you not even for me she said tone darkening as jj threw open the door there is only now jj froze because now half a dozen shadow agents fanned across the parking lot in a reverse chevron solange at the tip she had her tomahawk in one hand his cell phone in the other her chest was smoking she looked through him as if shed never seen him before as if hed never lived inside her he probably shouldnt have been surprised but the betrayal cracked his heart shed used their private time their time of truceand hed stupidly begun to believe their loveto gain data for the shadow side hope youre living in the moment right now warren commented suddenly beside him because these next few are going to be doozies when jj saw sola standing there his first impulse was to smile you see the individual luckily his instinct was stronger because he dove sideways just as the tomahawk appeared in front of his face death inscribed on the blade whirring head over handle it sliced air then there was a sick wet thud as it found another bodily home jj shifted to find tonya dane reclined in her chair frosted lips rounded in surprise the tomahawk buried in her skull the crevasse between skin and gray matter literally split her in two the glyph on jjs chest kicked to life matching warrens whod dived to the other side of the doorway as the phalanx of shadows moved closer jj reached into his pocket and withdrew his whip unfurling it as he pivoted its length licked out and wrapped around tonyas chair leg trapping her body to it as he yanked whipping both to warrens side his leader withdrew the tomahawk quickly with a murmured apology and jj jerked his weapon again this time spinning the chair like a top the barbed tips in the strip of leather releasing ready now for a shadow obligingly they continued their advance jj didnt aim for solange warren possessing her conduit would do that turning a persons own weapon against him was like turning his body inside out it was personal destructive and gave the bearer of the death an additional measure of power instead jj centered his weight flicked his wrist and sent the barbed whip on a snapping journey around the doorframe he felt the tug of flesh as it connected and jerked back like he was flyfishing instead pulling a man ashore once the shadow was blocking the doorway jj pulled his whip free ripping the mans life with it warren and jj then used the dead bulk to push their way into freedom using his tattered trench as a defensive shieldjj had made the armored coat himselfwarren covered the rear deflecting projectiles solanges tomahawk still fisted tight jjs whip danced warren planted his boots into solar plexuses and stomachs both screamed their battle criesand a part of jj continued to search for sola look out the shadow dropped from above warren drew the trench over them and jj swept the ground with his whip one hand braced on asphalt even so he felt death smiling at himthere were too many enemies from too many directionsand all because he had trusted solange the full weight of the descending shadow crushed his shoulders he braced but it didnt move even while other shadows yelled warnings into the night warren whipped the shielding trench from their heads and jj circled his whip readying for the next attack but the voices raining around them were familiar and he recognized the mace lodged in the chest of the shadow at his feet as gregors an ally arriving in response to warrens call the troop had surprised the attacking shadows and managed to inflict casualties of their own because solange hadnt known about them jj thought once the remaining shadow agents had fled he stood breathing hard whip hanging at his side and surveyed the lot warrens phone call which solange had somehow taped or bugged or replayed had mentioned only the two of them locked in a room with the woman who could deliver them the kairos but now that woman and link was dead and they were left to clean up the mess and solange had disappeared again the perfect superheroattracted to things you fearit needs to be personal tonya danes final prediction always his first waking thought jolted jj awake again he cursed as he rubbed a hand over his moist face down his neck and over his bare chest that prediction along with his minds betraying dreamsthe touch of solas flesh on his the taste of her tongue in his mouth the scent of her lingering on his skin the sound of her soft moans in his earswas why hed become an insomniac in the past three months and he supposed that was why hed accidentally dozed off here in the lush comfort of the valhalla hotels turkishstyle hammam it was a warm and misty wet sauna with walls and floors of swirling mosaic tiles in relaxing blues and the perfect place for jj to study the citys partiersthough that was hard to do he thought wryly if his eyes were shut pushing himself to an upright position he took a long drag from the ice water at his side and looked around the hammam boasted a heated gold slab in the great rooms center occupied on this day by three blonds in minute bikinisincluding one woman who looked marginally familiar from his corner which was both bench and booth jj watched as a cluster of suitors eager to impress flexed and bulged around them determining that none of the mortals were either risky or at risk he breathed in the scents of eucalyptus and soft mint and squinted up at the recessed lighting it was so obscured in the wet haze that it almost resembled the night sky the blonds soon left resulting in the exodus of most of the rooms occupants but not before the middle girl the one who looked familiar shot him a smile sweeter than hed expect attached to that body he realized belatedly that it was the socialite hed seen burning up the airwaves months ago he recalled hearing shed been keeping a low profile since but imagined that could be true only if she refrained from stepping outside altogether when the hammam doors swung shut behind her the swirling wet haze closed ranks jj shut his eyes if you think this is relaxing you should try the thermal detox hed imagined her voice so many timesscreaming begging pleading for mercythat for a moment it felt like a daydream sparked by the misty environs but when he opened his eyes she was there reclined sideways on the smooth thick center slab steamslick from head to thigh white bikini glaring against her tanned smooth curves her dark hair swung down to reveal her slim shoulders only her eyes were indistinguishable dark in their sockets like they were missing altogether it would be so much easier on me he said before he knew it if youd give me something to beat against he was a warrior and needed a fight all this passive aggression was somehow exhausting i know she whispered letting her hand trail down her thigh are you going to ambush me again rather hard when i dont know where youll be she said voice wry youve done a good job of covering your tracks jay ive been waiting at this spa for weeks because hed changed up every habit he had hed stopped drinking moved house and even sold his mustang took a fiscal beating on it because of the dents in the hood too you must be getting wrinkly one corner of her mouth twitched its the hot new place in vegas i knew youd have to come here eventually so as to protect mortals from each other and themselves keep the balance so all had a fair choice between virtue and vice scent out the shadow to exact his revenge but he hadnt done such a good job of that had he he must have some sort of sensory blind spot where she was concerned just like the emotional one that had allowed her to aim a tomahawk at his skull while he never saw it coming and now that she was in front of him all he was doing was staring you tried to kill me after we made love too after we said whatever we learned while together was offlimits i was merely following the constellations she shrugged orion and let me guess you hit the dark matter she shook her head the apex i was on a downswing this time he didnt think her explanation cute he stood crossing the room in full strides to loom over her so your decision to take my life was random life is random jj solange was suddenly on her feet too standing in the middle of the slab like a pissedoff sacrifice the stars and skies are the only things that make sense dont you see theyre impermeable theyre forever the light gets all the attention but the dark matter is the glue of our universe would you quit with all the dark matter shit theyre just words someone used to describe something unknown thats all fuck her eyes followed the way he rubbed his hands over his head and he stopped she huffed people like to label things they dont understand like light and shadow like love his turn to huff youre going to talk to me of love she lifted her chin dont look so outraged you enjoyed our time together remember ive seen the way you look at me when youre buried deep you like it i dont like you but you love me he didnt say anything and theres your tell youre actually quite incapable of a lie jj moral pinnings arent weaknesses sure they are they make you predictable he thought about that took a step forward you love me too her turn to fall silent now but she didnt move back it means you can changeif you choose to and the thought fueled the first flush of excitement hed felt in months how sick was that no she ultimately whispered her dark eyes were buried into his as she looked up i no more want to be you than you want to be me you forgot that even though i warned you so what now youre warning me again solange wrapped her arms around his neck jj let her why the hell did he let her what do you want he finally said voice muffled against her neck i already told you that he thought back brows furrowing then shook his head there was too much emotion marring his thoughts when it came to her like static over a phone line it kept the real message from getting through the first night she prompted in the desert storm on the hood of your car hed asked her what she wanted then relevance i cant give that to you her fingers trailed along his back blindly found his tattoo do you know the meaning of the word quintessence it means typical she pulled back offended he pulled her tight again and held her there for a moment it felt like shed struggle but then she relaxed her hipbones playing just beneath his and then she pulled him down so they were seated across from each other legs intertwined on the warmed marble it means pure a highly concentrated and most perfect embodiment of a substance you know what the basic elements are right he rolled his eyes air fire earth and water as an aries jj was a fire sign solange was pisces a water sign maybe that was their problem and shes a shadow agent so think about it quintessence the fifth essence or element the pythagoreans called it ether they claimed it flew upward at creation to comprise the stars jj furrowed his brows another piece in the puzzle that was her obsession with the constellationsbut it still made no sense to him she smiled softly you jj are the perfect embodiment of light i smelled it all those years ago a mixture both warm and sweet oh now he saw and you are quintessential shadow right never swayed unchanging you tell me scent me again though an agents every sense was heightened their noses were perhaps the most keen enemies were easiest to scent when emotions were high an evolutionary gift but jj didnt need to sniff to know solange his olfactory nerve had memorized her unique blend of heat and spice and thats what he said you sure she asked tilting her head he hesitated then tentatively sniffed at the air lifted his chin sniffed again you smelldifferent her scent had turned not soured but altered her spice had softened the biting hooks melting into peppered waves as if buried in something as heavy and sweet as melted caramel she wants relevance and in a matriarchal society such as theirs the best way to achieve that was to mother a child of legacy one of both shadow and lightthe kairos oh my god but the soothsayer said shes already here in this city she is solange placed a hand on her belly inside of me and has been from that first night under the stars a child of shadow and light a baby who would be mothered by a shadow but his baby her name will be lola she will be the kairos then the glossy door burst open and cool air rushed in the man framed in the doorway wore a ratty trench and smelled like soured sweat he had no place in an upscale spa but jj knew hed moved so fast the reception staff hadnt seen him solas glyph smoked to life and jjs glyph burst with light though whether it was in response to her or warren he didnt know step back jj he did it automatically used to obeying his leader oh she said turning her face up to his tears brimmed in her eyes and jj realized then what it looked like touché he reached forward grip tightening on her arm no she didnt fight and she didnt look away as warren advanced your emotion is up son didnt i warn you about that how long have you been following me jj asked him as if solangehis enemy and loverwasnt right there since tonya dane told me you needed following he halted in front of them looking with distaste at solange eyes taking her in like she was a snake so youre it like she was a thing an intangible trash to be discarded next to warren she looked tiny no jj said before his leader could act wait i dont think so but as warren stepped forward arms reaching to snap solas slim neck the strangest thing happened jjs fist shot out slowmo and of its own accord and warrens head snapped back so fast it hadnt righted itself before he hit the ground jj didnt even feel his fist lower it was as if hed blinked and reality shifted and he now existed on an entirely different plane shaking he looked down at his leader splayed on the heated slab what had he done this was warren as close to a father figure as hed ever had and the leader of the agents of light his troop his family i should have killed you he told sola who hadnt moved that first night i should have slain you with your tomahawk and walked off with the power and prestige that would provide and i you solange said lightly he glanced up to find her eyeing warren speculatively the visual that slid through his minda bronzed bikiniclad warrior carving bodies with a tomahawkwouldve been laughable were there anything funny about the situation yet all solange did was swallow hard and leveled her gaze at jj so what are you going to do now it wasnt worry that had her asking but confidenceand perhaps curiosity she didnt believe hed kill her while she was pregnant and she was right shadows were not innocents and innocents were never shadowsbut this was his child and she will be light so if he really thought he could make a difference in the world a superhero in deed as well as name and if he really believed that a shadow could changedespite her obsession with the universes dark spacesthen this was the time to prove it no he thought not prove it make it happen because solange wanted to believe as well three times now shed come to kill him and hadnt she could have disappeared had this baby on her own and raised it as shadow without his knowing but she was here now she had chosen him she had chosen goodness and he needed to do the same solange smirked as if reading that thought but the expression dropped as soon as he reached forward throwing her over his shoulder in one swift motion what are you doing she started to struggle he held tight finishing what i started that night a union between thema contractual one to accompany the physical one growing in solas wombwas the best way to show her it could work their baby wouldnt just be their worlds highest power the kairos she would possess the best of them she would represent the purest essence of a balance between their two sides quintessenceand choice and solange was his that was his foremost thought as he bent his head and placed his mouth to hers sealing them forever the female minister with her shock of purple hair clapped along with the two showgirls flanking her from the previous hours vegas package wedding since solange wasnt exactly sentimental the feather and crystalencrusted women were also their witnesses for the tenminute ceremony when they finally pulled away there wasnt a dry eye in the house obviously this changes everything he said afterward shoving a stacked fork of pancakes into his mouth though he didnt clarify if he meant the wedding the baby or the way theyd both betrayed their troops they were at a pancake house both ravenous and wildeyed with what theyd doneand what had yet to be done we cant keep all of it out of the manuals she said primly cutting her own food creating the perfect bite identities are one thing and even a relationship can be hidden anything short of outandout treason will remain concealed until we show our hand but this is different its too big but what wasnt jj thought as she spoke walking down the street was a big thing if there happened to be a drunk driver heading your way throwing an innocent smile at a stranger was big if she later became your lover everything was big but then he thought watching sola with her furrowed brow everything was small too and the small things often mattered most still she was right things were omitted from the manuals because for knowledge to be useful it had to be earned same as for mortals but not all of this would be left out and ultimately it might be better if it was revealed anyway because that would mean theyd gotten away we must either part ways he said wiping his mouth which is not going to happen or disappear difficult but not impossible she interjected in some cases rogues blended with humanity for years harder once the baby comes he pointed out as rogue agents theyd both be disavowed which meant theyd be driven from the city or killed not the most ideal circumstances under which to raise their child or we change our appearances entirely even if the manuals showed them doing that and they probably would the drawings wouldnt depict their new identities universal checks and balances were still in play but sola had stopped chewing midbite a wistful expression blanketing her face as she stared at him what you you she said again giving it a lovers inflection as her eyes gained a sheen i just wish i could see you he frowned you mean i mean before this she indicated the length of his body with a nod of her head her sigh spiced with regret it smelled like her him and his child its not much different just bigger he reached over to squeeze her hand besides you did once as a child she said dismissively before squeezing back but who did that child become what would you have looked like if youd been allowed to remain entirely you its still me sola im in here what does it matter whats on the outside because i want to make love to you i want you buried inside of me not a facsimile not a mask hiding you from me as if im just another person in this world im your wife now and our child will have your features id like to be able to recognize them in her thats all her sentiment touched him and he bent to place his forehead to hers im sorry i dont know how to do that she bit her lip fought back her tears and nodded glancing at her plate she pushed at her food with her fork before stilling then she looked up again tilted her head and narrowed her eyes her tears fell squeezed out by the considering look what well i mightthere may actually be a way butno too risky what is it no i cant ask it of you not now after youve done so much lets just move forward okay please sola just tell me if i cant be heroic for my own wife who can i act for it surprised a laugh from her but it took a minute more of convincing when she finally told him he sat back in his chair mind spinning she was right it was dangerous it was also taboo each side of the zodiac possessed a human ally called a changeling a child young enough to still believe in comic book heroes and epic causes their job was to protect an agent from his or her enemies when within a safe zone and not just the agent but the agents identity as well when the changelings willed it they could mold their aura around an agents form to hide the persons current identity by revealing the original despite this ability the kids were truly mortal as soon as they reached puberty the willingness to believe in comics and superheroes waned they lost their powers practically overnight and put the zodiac world behind them as they would a toy train their posts and duties were then passed on to another asking a changeling to perform this function outside a safe zone was taboo because it was also dangerous an agent could survive injury by a mortal weapon but if the agent was attacked while wearing a changelings aura the child would still suffer mortal damage there was also the issue of securing the changelings earthly body when an agent was using the aura the childs was immobilized as fragile as an egg until the aura was returned that emptied mortal body couldnt survive beyond twelve hours all these considerations raced through jjs mind as he studied sola what ultimately settled it was putting himself in her position if she were clothed in a fleshly disguise wouldnt he want to see his true love beneath the way her body moved below his how her face looked when focused solely on him besides despite the warnings a changeling had never been harmed before the warnings were just that like notices on the back of poison only dangerous if it fell into the wrong hands and only once right he asked though he wasnt really talking to her it would be enough she said simply and that was it she didnt want to hurt anyone she only wanted him and this would be her sole opportunity to see whom she was giving up her entire world for well as long as were living dangerously he said and a small jolt at the illicitthe same dark desire sola had known lived in him from the beginningthrilled through him as they kissed sealing the decision it was jjs responsibility to acquire the changeling but sola set the stage she chose a penthouse downtown one with an oldschool feel but newcity glamour in the bedroom shed created a cocoon of pillows to shelter the fragile shell the changeling would become once jj borrowed his aura their room he assumed was up the winding staircase she descended when jj and the boy arrived im going to put on something a little more comfortable sola whispered her body twining with his already smelling of wet heat i suggest you do the same she ascended the staircase like a wisp of smoke and jj smiled after her until the kid ricky finally cleared his throat he was watching solange with narrowed eyes but he trusted jj enough to follow right come with me once inside the bedroom they wasted little time the kid reminded him that it was imperative to return his aura within twelve hours then making it look easy shrugged off his aura as simply as hed remove his clothes his body elongated into a shimmering outline of jjs thinning to a fingers width to achieve the same height the transformation reflected in the mirror across from them the boys glimmering form deepened to opaqueness so that his features disappeared now jjs could appear through him what are you doing jj watching all this as though from a distance immediately dismissed the voice he was being transparent thats what he was doing being truly seen perhaps for the first time since solange had looked at him across the distance of his parents broken bodies how appropriate that it was she who would see him again now not as an enemy or superhero just him and her and the child theyd created between them he stepped forward through the elongated form and felt the aura mold to him like wet gauze healing and cool he avoided looking in the mirror as he made sure the boys now lifeless body was safely cradled on the bed before heading upstairs he wanted his wife to be the first to see him the first in years she killed in black silk though the staircase surprisingly led to a rooftop terrace that mirrored an outdoor bedroom with the sky spread above and downtown vegas winking below he marveled only at her it was a tossup as to what possessed a deeper sheen her hair or the chemise or perhaps jj thought it was her eyes fixed on him as she handed him a glass of champagne then clinked her glass to his to quintessence she said softly to relevance he added which made her smile she lifted to her toes mouth open and inviting on his jj moved to deepen the kiss but she pulled back and held him at arms length studying the man who was really her husband jj shifted under her stare well he finally asked sipping nervously at his glass as her eyes trailed him from head to toe he felt vulnerable small beneath the night sky they both loved though he knew the stars were there they were unreadable from the city and he had a sudden flash of being suspended amid all that dark matter not knowing if he was on an upswing or a down what are you doing his inner voice again more urgently but his eyes had already slid to solas smooth legs as she poured more champagne the black silk rounding out her behind cutting low on her back to reveal the ridges and muscles and strength he so loved he caught his reflection in the oval floor mirror and startled at the sight but he was only sizing himself up in relation to her and in his eyesscotchcolored the same as alwaysthey were a perfect fit and thats what she commented on shell have your eyes he lifted her kissing her neck as he dropped her to the center of the bed also draped in black so only her limbs shone in the ambient light her lips and eyes were dewy and so was her body as his mouth trailed downward she was his drug he decided as he grew dizzier with her taste and scent and sight her moans echoed like a shifting wind as he lingered at her thighs her desire driving his need champagne poured over her torso and he licked it clean on the way back up to her mouth where he entered her dividing her twice she spread her limbs like a fivetipped star encouraging him to mirror her with her hands and hips he did and she sucked and sucked at him like she was trying to pull his soul loose and bury it inside her already dizzy he actually became breathless but her need was relentless she wouldnt stop and he couldnt stop it his eyes winged widesent another wave of dizziness through his headand found she was already watching him he tried to pull away the strong arms he loved tightened and her heels hooked around his she sucked harder the wine more dizziness as the realization coursed through his body and into his loins too late now he couldnt help it he came she tookhis seed his breath and he realized as he finally passed out the changelings aura from his bodyall in a small inaudible pop his last thought before all faded to black the small things mattered the most he searched god did he search and as he didstumbling across the highway racing down stinking alleyways and canvassing all the places he knew solange had once beenthe scales fell from his eyes solange had convinced him to gain the changelings aura knowing full well the boy as one who championed the light would never trust her it made sense that she hadnt tried the same with the shadow changeling that would compromise their side angering her leader and it was obvious nowas it should have been all alongthat she was still very much a shadow what jj couldnt understand was what she needed with the aura anyway by the time the twelvehour window was almost up and he still hadnt found solange and the aura she was hiding beneath he knew hed never know the answer to that question he returned to the penthouse determined that the boy whod trusted him so completely wouldnt die alone yet he did die jj entered the bedroom where ricky lay instantly shocked at how tiny he looked curled into the fetal position hands tucked prayerfully beneath his chin his head was bent low as if braced for a blow he was so small every person has a right to the small things his fathers words burst through his mind like the monsoon that had raged on the night all this had begun surely it was only his own guilt rearing but it seemed the completion of the thought coincided exactly with the boys final mortal moment the slight quiver that overtook the small body was as unnatural as if it were made of rousing snakes and jj shuddered swearing he could hear a rattlers shake the little happinesses the quiver strengthened into a quake and the cells comprising rickys skin began separating looking pixilated at first some sinking while others slipped and scattered across the ridges and angles of the young body before dropping to the cotton bedding jjs gut twisted and his hard exhalation scattered those loosened cells into a fine coating of dust those are the ones that make life most worth living the boy settled more firmly burrowing into his final resting place as his sandy insides softened and he even looked peaceful before his small smile and his lips too fell away jj refused to avert his eyes as the freckles dropped the eyelashes fell he saw the spiky hair flatten dissolve and leave behind a powdery skull jjs unblinking stare was obscured only when he began to cry and he eventually realized between convulsing openeyed sobs that his wet sorrow was melding with the boyshaped dune he could literally build a castle with his tears it made him cry harder its what were fighting for came his fathers last late reminder when and how had jj forgotten to fight the shell of rickys body was now totally depleted drained as if dehydrated lacking life force instead of water from somewhere in the suite a clock chimed off the last of the twelvehour mark and jj reached out to touch a small hand to say goodbye in one moment there was a child in the next dust mounded the bedding a handful finely ground as beach sand in jjs fist an innocent a child dead because of him and jj did bow his head now unable to form thought or words but sending up a prayer of emotion into the universe hoping someone something somewhere understood the regret squeezing his chest the sorrow burning in his gut and the hopelessness that made him want to lie down too and embrace a dusty death weeping openly not even trying to hide the scent of his shame and sorrow and misery jj didnt turn at the soft sound behind him unguarded emotions were easy for his kind to pick up kneeling bedside he bowed his head and welcomed blessed death but the enemy hed drawn back to him had something else in mind jj turned his tearstreaked face and found warrens unsurprised gaze locked hard on his tonya danes predictionthe one warren hadnt wanted to believe and had been trying to preventhad finally come true his troop leader put it together quickly eyes slipping mournfully to the mound of dust on the bed as he inhaled to take in both the boy and solange on jjs skin you should kill me jj said flatly still kneeling yes warrens reply was if possible even flatter at the very least exile no jjs mind stumbled over the unacceptable thought i dont want to live i dont want i dont care what you want warren remained still so enraged he was all but quivering from now on you want what i want and that is jj said it casually but inside he was braced against the idea of living he glanced at the plateglass window but a dive from the penthouse balcony wouldnt be enough to kill him warren clearly intuiting his thoughts moved between him and the window i take responsibility for this he surprised jj by saying i made a mistake i allowed you too much autonomy and granted you a position with too much power i favored you because of your childhood your parents their deaths when you wanted the position of weapons master i allowed that now something did spark inside jj because im the best warren nearly snapped back but closed his eyes instead his head and shoulders drooping but i should have had someone apprenticing with you i just never thought you wouldi should have thought jj didnt bother saying he was sorry an apology meant nothing in the wake of an innocents death besides warren was admitting he would exile or kill jj if the troop didnt need him so badly and one thing that could be counted on by warren he always acted in the best interest of the troop when warren lifted his head again the fatigue was gone and that hard truth was branded in his gaze you will give yourself over entirely to me he said voice harder than jj had ever heard it because living with the knowledge of what hed done would be harder than dying over it youll tell no one about your wifehe spit the wordor the changeling youll do what i say no questions asked no argument no explanation okay jj finally agreed head bowed fingers dusty that wasnt a request warrens voice regained its strength and rhythm as he strode forward jj nodded staring at the floor and then ill find her ill make this right youll do no such thing warren said jerking jj to his feet their faces were so close their noses nearly touched shes poison to you boy besides do you think you deserve any sort of happy ending after what youve done no he didnt no happilyeverafterincluding revenge she wont find you either well change your identity in full this time micah will make you over into something new something better someone who wont make this kind of mistake again jj recalled the fiery pain following his last surgery and the ghost of his old bulk trying to squeeze from beneath his current flesh but he only stared at warren mutely before nodding again youre no longer your mothers son not jj or jayor jaden jacks not his mothers son not his fathers either warren was stripping him of that connection and past but in a way it was a relief he had failed them too solange wont ever find you well make it so that even your own troop members wont remember you itll be as if you never existed jj did step back now unable to keep his mouth from falling open would warren really do that he knew micah could erase the memories of mortals rewire their minds so that new pasts defined their futures it was especially useful if one had happened upon an event or object derived from their hidden world but could warren really convince micah to alter the troops collective memory itd be a huge undertakingnot just rewiring the minds of the twelve senior star signs but the ward mothers whod helped raise jj in their underground sanctuary and the flexible minds of the initiates toothe children of the next generation who so looked up to him now would warren do that he looked at his troop leaders gazelevel again and cool yes he would none of them would have a choice in the matter and most wouldnt even question it if they ever read about jj in the back issues of the manual of light it would be like reading about someone else entirely and it made jj wonder had warren ever done this before but hed be alone in his wonder jj realized that would be his punishment to remember what hed done to know the failure forever and to live among his peers as a fraud so it was almost as harsh as a death sentence jj nodded yet again you will take the appearance and job i determine for you you will return to the sanctuary every night without fail and you will log your activities for me down to the last detail yes he replied woodenly he no longer cared where his needs and desires ranked in his own life in fact it would be a relief to follow orders and let someone else do the thinking for a while he would give his life over in service to mortals and hed do it wholeheartedlyor at least with what was left of it after solanges betrayal warren continued voice thick with everything he wasnt allowing himself to sayand do you will be the exemplary superhero in every way if i even suspect youre faltering ill kill you myself jj nodded numbly then warren punched him so hard he fell into the sea of pillows a cloud of dust rose around him and he coughed tasting loss and death and a dry guilt that smothered any burning desire to fight warren didnt want his numb acquiescence he realized not when there was so much dust im not doing this for you warren hissed pointing a finger at jj tears rolling down his cheeks as he said it this is for your parents and what they meant to me and what they sacrificed for us all i wont forget again ever though his parents were gone he would live for them as theyd once lived for each other and hed learn to listen again to his intuition the inner voice hed muted while reaching for his own selfish dreams reaching until solange had snagged his palm and pulled him into all this dust his answers his sorrowed scent seemed to mollify warren his leader turned to the bedroom window trench billowing at his ankles and looked out at the city he was charged to protect you may choose your own name jj stood and joined warren at the window hunter warren looked at him sharply hunter he repeated sending back the steely gaze warren wanted the perfect embodiment of a superhero so thats who hed be the purest predator in the city the most concentrated essence of good he thought looking up at the sky the quintessential hunter because somewhere out there was a woman with a thing for darkhaired men a preference for mustangs and a need for relevance she took action based on the constellations her deeds steered by the dark matter in between and she did it with his daughter his lola in her belly and a child hunter decided rubbing faintly dusty fingers together was a damn good reason to continue the fight the dead the damned and the forgotten jocelynn drake a body was waiting for me at the morgue that wasnt the type of message i was expecting to receive when i awoke at sunset but there was no avoiding it my voice mail contained a semipolite message from archibald deacon savannahs coroner informing me that a nightwalker had just been delivered to his morgue the message was followed by one from homicide detective daniel crowley also informing me of the waiting corpse a final message was from the now frantic coroner who wanted me to deal with the corpse immediately unfortunately there was nothing i could do until the sun had finally set beneath the horizon allowing night to reclaim the world the private examination room was in the basement of the morgue away from the main room that held the majority of the dead it was one of the few buildings in savannah with a basement given the citys high water table and it came at a great cost due to moments like these i had been more than willing to make the contribution to the city the cinderblock walls had been covered with a thick coat of white paint that had begun to yellow with age a handful of narrow windows lined the walls more than six feet above the floor the glass had been painted black to deter any inquisitive people who happened to wander too close a windowunit air conditioner sputtered and coughed randomly from its perch at the far end of the room spewing forth a semisteady stream of cool air i looked up from the coroners report to watch knox as he leaned over the body of the dead nightwalker his lips were curled in disgust revealing faint flashes of fang the opposite wall from where i stood was covered with a stainless steel refrigeration unit for corpses there were only four doors that opened to slideout drawers a larger unit was in the main examination room on the first floor are you sure there were no other wounds on the body besides the main two i inquired turning my attention from the disgruntled nightwalker to the coroner who hovered close by archibald was a short round man who stood on stubby little legs his dark brown hair was thinning leaving the top of his skull nearly exposed archie as i preferred to call him had been the coroner for savannah and the surrounding counties for nearly twenty years and we had known each other for almost as long mira he snapped his bushy grayishbrown brows bunched together over his large bulbous nose half the body was destroyed how could i possibly answer such a question can you at least tell me if the body was burned before or after he was beheaded after replied a new voice archibald jumped at the unexpected appearance of detective daniel crowley but i didnt flinch i had sensed him walking through the building toward our location in the basement how do you know i asked looking over at daniel as i closed the file folder that held a copy of the coroners report it was the real copy one that would never be officially filed with the police department archibald would create a second version that would carefully omit any questionable details like the elongated canines the sensitivity to sunlight and any kind of genetic abnormalities he was already aware of i talked to some of the guys who were first on the scene daniel continued closing the door behind him when they found the body one of the officers opened some curtains to let light in and the body started being reduced to ash like a slowburning ember they saw him burn knox demanded in a harsh tone daniel took a hesitant step backward and looked over at me again knox and daniel had never worked together in fact i was the only nightwalker in contact with daniel and archie but it was time for that to change if knox was going to aid me with managing my domain he needed to know the humans i was in contact with however the corpse was unnerving knox more than i had expected and the nightwalker was losing some of the cool unshakable logic that i had come to depend on him for this unexpected rough edge couldnt be seen by these trusted humans nodding once to daniel i dropped the folder on a nearby desk and slipped my hands into the front pockets of my worn jeans the relaxed stance helped to ease some of the tension from daniels shoulders it was weird they said daniel ran his fingers through his sweaty hair causing large chunks to stand on end there was no fire but they said it was like the body was burning no one commented that it was the sunlight they thought the killer might have doused the body with a chemical in an effort to destroy the evidence ive got a couple things i can put in the report that could potentially work as an explanation archie interjected write down the names of the cops knox ordered we may need to adjust their memories again daniel looked at me frowning i nodded slightly approving the request while inwardly i wished i could smack knox on the back of the head pushing off the wall i pulled my hands out of my pockets and stretched my arms over my head extending my entire body into a long straight line excellent anything else i should know i was still trying to fully wake upi hadnt expected to find myself at the morgue first thing in the evening especially without even time to shower the call came in at around nine am anonymous male caller from a prepaid cell phone daniel replied the killer daniel shrugged acknowledging the possibility thats about three hours after sunrise knox muttered in a low voice he took a few steps away from the corpse brushing his hands against his pants even though he had never actually touched the body plenty of time to get in and get out after he was unconscious for the day were still trying to dig up which cell tower was used to see if the person was still in town at the time daniel said his frown deepened as he watched knox start pacing between the stainless steel table and a wheeled cart loaded with different sharp instruments anything at the house i inquired dragging the detectives keen attention back to me no we didnt find anything of interest i watched daniel from under the brim of my baseball cap the fluorescent lights in the morgue tended to give my pale skin an inhuman pearlescent sheen it was why both knox and i were dressed in longsleeve shirts and baseball caps despite the fact that it was still above eighty degrees outside knox and i will check it out tonight do you know who did this daniel asked sweat stains stretched from under his arms and lined his collar his tie had been loosened and he looked oddly out of sorts without a cigarette in one hand it was still early in his shift but it looked like he had already been through hell he must have either come in early after hearing about the strange murder or hadnt gone to bed yet from the previous night ive got some guesses well take care of this get some rest mira i cant just walk away if theres a murderer within the city i need to track this bastard down and stop him before he kills someone else thats my job a smile lifted my lips daniel didnt see the halfburned remains as some bloodsucker that got what it deserved he saw him as a person who had his life unjustly ended and believed that the rest of the population humans nightwalkers and all the others needed to be protected from the murderer i was doubtful many humans would be so openminded i appreciate that daniel i said stepping away from the wall to stand between the corpse and archibald and daniel and normally i would let you get your man but this time its a nightwalker thats been killed youre not equipped to handle this problem knox and i will handle it we wont allow the killer to endanger the citizens of savannah what about the body we cantpeople are going to want tests run and archie started turning my smile into a smug grin ill sign the paperwork indicating that his sister dropped by and demanded that the body be cremated immediately for religious reasons you will then declare that the tests are inaccurate due to a contaminated sample the cause of death is obvious and well identify and dispose of the body before we leave your jobs are nearly done gentlemen the plans flowed forth easily as if i did this every other night but the fact was it was rare that i had to deal with the death of a nightwalker most of the time it would turn out to be a lycanthrope or a warlock that was a very heavy magic user as keeper of this domain i was the first and last line of defense for all the supernatural races when it came to protecting our secret both men hesitated but daniel finally muttered something under his breath before walking out of the room his hands shoved into the pockets of his trousers archibald said nothing as he waddled over to the desk and pulled out the necessary forms his white lab coat fluttered behind him nearly dragging the ground he marked xs where he needed me to fill out information and sign spreading the paperwork out on the desk he left knox and me to the corpse now that we were alone i pulled off the bluetinted sunglasses i had been wearing and hooked them over the top button of my shirt that could have gone better i wanted to snarl in frustration knox paced away from the corpse his arms crossed over his chest theyre unnerved by what we are it cant be helped bullshit they were unnerved by your behavior ive seen you easily sway anything with nice breasts and a tight ass what happened here maybe its because those men lacked the aforementioned items he commented dryly making me want to throw something at his head well you better learn to widen your scope because theyre not going anywhere and we need their assistance you need them and theyll be far more helpful if theyre not worried about you grabbing a snack if you want i can go tweak their memories he offered i waved my hand at him stopping any movement toward the door no dont go messing with their memories you need their trust and you dont get that if youre mucking around in their brains theyll never know ill know knox nodded removing his dark sunglasses so that i could look into his brown eyes ill do better next time thank you i murmured as i stepped up to the body it was highly unusual for knox to be so gruff and harsh when dealing with humans his nature was very ingratiating and his dark handsome looks tended to win over the reluctant his maker had the same manner because of his uncharacteristic behavior i was beginning to worry that knox had been wellacquainted with the victim looking down at the steel tray my eyes skimmed over the badly burned face the skin was blackened and the eyes were now gone as if they had melted in their sockets sending the fluid down in to the back of the skull it looked like he might have had shortcut brown hair but the condition of the head wasnt the disturbing part it was the fact that it was no longer attached to the body it was likely that that was the killing blow but the murderer could have removed his heart first and then his head the nightwalkers chest cavity had been ripped open and the heart cut out using some kind of serrated blade that had torn the edges of the flesh into ugly shreds at least it was likely that the victim had felt no pain it appeared that it all happened during the daylight hours meaning that the vampire had been dead to the world im assuming that you recognize who this is i said my own mood growing more sour and anxious as i continued to examine the corpse i vaguely knew all the nightwalkers within my domain there were more here than in most cities this size but then i maintained a tight control over my domain it afforded those that lived here more of a sense of security and peace than what many cities could offer however during the past few years i had begun to withdraw from my own kind no longer wanting to be faced with them i didnt want to hear their thoughts in the night or feel their cool presence as i moved silently through the city searching for my next meal knox had taken over much of the nighttonight management of course that simply required him making regular appearances at all the nightwalker hot spots his name was bryce knox leaned his back against the refrigeration unit his arms crossed over his chest his shoulders were stiff and his normally neutral expression was twisted into a frown with my hands braced on the table before me i looked up at my companion whats your problem did you know him well a faint shrug briefly lifted his narrow shoulders i knew him but not well then what has got you so on edge he was executed he hissed waving one hand at the severed head his head was cut off and his heart removed he was executed during the day when he was defenseless how are you not unnerved by this he was possibly killed during the day i corrected trying to keep both of us calm and rational we wont know for sure until we check his house the truth was that i was unnerved and more than a little concerned if bryce had been killed at night it was highly likely that the murderer was another nightwalker and then my only reason for tracking down the murderer would be punishment for allowing the humans to catch wind of it and threatening our secret however if bryce had been killed during the day we had a bigger problem but we had to tackle one thing at a time and a panicked knox would do me no good how old was he i demanded attempting to refocus knoxs attention less than two centuries how long has he been in my domain about a decade maybe a little more was he involved in anything recently that i should be aware of changes in allegiance was he a part of a family knox pushed away from the wall and stood shoving one hand through his sandy blond hair iim not sure concentrate i murmured looking over bryce for any identifying marks some families were known for branding their members we couldnt be tattooed because we always healed but we could retain some scars if we were low on blood and were unable to heal properly the process was generally painful and ugly but then most families were painful ugly affairs i didnt find anything on bryce but i wasnt surprised most of his body was either singed or blackened from its exposure to the sun hes a part of the ravana family i believe he came to savannah alone and immediately got sucked into justins clan knox replied his voice grew steadier the longer he spoke as if he were finally detaching himself from the gruesome death of the nightwalker that lay before him nightwalker flocks were like high school cliques each with its own set of rules and bizarre tastes a low steady hiss escaped me as i turned this new bit of information over in my brain i had been hoping that he wasnt a member of one of few families that existed within my domain but of them all justin ravanas clan was the most undesirable cruel and vicious justin was one of the oldest within my territory and had been practically raised by the coven i hadnt thought much of his petition to live in my domain decades ago but i had regretted agreeing ever since justin specialized in brutality torture and control no one that entered into his family ever escaped it alive when bryce was away from his family he tended to associate mostly with fledglings knox continued during the past few years ive seen him mainly with this small group of nightwalkers mostly females all less than a century old not exactly the best list of suspects youve got for me i stood pulling away from my examination of the corpse a group of fledglings its possible that it was justin but its not his style to hand off the murder to someone else who could do it during the day hed want to be part of it justin would have taken the time to handle it personally over a series of weeks if possible what youve never seen a fledgling kill another nightwalker knox scoffed the comment finally caused some of the tension to roll off of his shoulders ive seen the remains of plenty of fledgling kills but ive never known of any fledgling that could accomplish the feat during the day and ive never known a fledgling to kill a nightwalker in this style really fledglings have a style a preferred method of murder he mocked dont we all i batted my eyes at him we all know your preferred method fire starter knox said shoving his hands into the pockets of his worn jeans he leaned against the cooler careful to keep his eyes on me and not on the corpse what about fledglings i guess i have something in common with them fire is their preferred method its fast effective and relatively easy of course ive seen just as many fledglings go up in flames with their intended victim because they werent careful so youre saying one of the fledglings that knew bryce didnt kill him he suggested earning him a grin i didnt say that its possible but unlikely particularly if he was killed during the day i wasnt willing to say out loud who i thought had killed brycewe were both on edge enough an easy silence settled between us as i contemplated our dead friend and his potential attacker knox stood nearby ready to offer up information he was careful to look anywhere but at the halfburned beheaded corpse did you ever do this with my maker knox softly asked fiddling with his sunglasses what look at corpses with valerio i asked my brow furrowed at the unexpected question all the time it was how we spent most of our nights ha ha he said rolling his eyes at my sarcasm i can imagine how you spent most of your nights but you know what i mean he said you and he investigated strange things for the coven back when you were in europe a smile drifted across my lips before i could stop it i had too many good memories of valerio but that didnt mean i was willing to share some were too embarrassing or too gruesome and others were simply too private my time with valerio wasnt always filled with happy memories and i was frequently horrified by some of the things we did but i would never trade the moments i had with knoxs maker yes valerio and i frequently looked into a strange death or a corpse that needed our unique attention to keep the secret protected during that time we never found a fledgling that could kill during the day i smiled at my companion for lightening the mood and shook my head how had valerio ever stood to part with this child i was becoming far too attached to him is there anything else i should know about our dead friend i asked resting my hands on the edge of the stainless steel table next to bryce the only other thing i can think of is that about six months ago he petitioned you to allow him to bring over his lover knox added my head snapped up at this bit of information im assuming that i said no you denied the request knox confirmed his brow furrowed slightly as he turned over my sudden interest you think she had something to do with this im hoping such a thing is impossible since her memory was wiped i said in a hard cold voice it was did our headless friend tell you that or did you check for yourself i checked there were no memories of bryce or nightwalkers in her brain he replied biting down on my lower lip i stared down at the blackened remains of bryce still wondering if his wouldbe fledgling had found a way to murder him because he had refused to make her into a nightwalker though equally unlikely there were still a number of ways she might have been involved in bryces death is she a magic user the woman knoxs perpetually even dry tone jumped several octaves i dont think so if she is she may have been able to hide her memories from you knoxs whole body stiffened at my comment while his expression went completely blank do you honestly think valerio didnt show me how to pick apart the mind of a magic user he demanded in a brittle voice a ghost of a smile flitted across my face at valerios name on his tongue would it have occurred to you that she might be i countered but quickly waved my hand at him i dont doubt your ability and i think its highly unlikely the woman is a magic user however i find it strange that six months ago he was denied the right to make a vampire and now hes dead using a very human form of execution could have been a nightwalker knox suggested putting his sunglasses back on again maybe i whispered had justin not approved of bryces request to create a fledgling and decided to act against the nightwalker in some fashion the time issue still needed to be confirmed we wont know until we get to bryces place we of course you think i would leave you out of the fun of ransacking a murdered vampires lair for clues as to his killer not a chance my outrageous teasing left a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth besides there will be plenty of time for you to track down the woman and anyone known to associate with bryce i continued crushing the smile before it could actually form youre too kind mira knox sneered he took a step backward as i placed bryces head on his stomach i then picked up the dead nightwalker and carried him over to the oven setting the nightwalker inside i closed the door and summoned up my powers within seconds the body was consumed with flames hotter than any that could be produced by the crematorium the remains were reduced to ash bryce was no more as i looked up at knox a cold grin stretched across my lips you have no idea how kind i can be i was the fire starter scourge of our people the protector of our secret kindness was all relative a crunch of gravel was my only warning as we walked across the parking lot of the morgue to my car i hadnt scanned the area for other nightwalkers this was my domain and no one would dare to attack me in my own domain i was wrong pain exploded in my ribs just before my body slammed into the side panel of a dark blue station wagon denting the metal and breaking two of my ribs with a snarl my head snapped up to see who attacked me knox was squared off against a darkhaired nightwalker in leather pants and a black tshirt other than his porcelain white skin he looked as if he was a part of the night itself stand down knox i ordered pushing back to my feet my body protested the movement as my ribs attempted to mend mira knox paused in his circling of the other nightwalker but his brown eyes still glowed he was ready to attack if i said the word this is my fight i stated taking a step toward the nightwalker its been a long time bishop i dont remember inviting you into my domain the nightwalker smiled but had yet to take his gaze off knox bishop was nearly five centuries old and a very skilled fighter making him one of the most valued servants of macaire the coven elder wouldnt dispatch bishop without a very good reason as an emissary of macaire i go where i wish he announced he sidestepped to his left so that he could look at both me and knox at the same time unfortunately knox still stood between us bishop might be here on business with me but he would have no qualms over ripping through knox just for the fun of it knox go inside and see if there is anything else that archie needs to complete his paperwork i commanded but knox didnt move if anything he seemed to sidle slightly in front of me not a chance im not leaving you out here alone with this guy knox said no wonder im here your people wont even listen to you bishop mocked straightening from his defensive stance go knox i know him we have some business to settle i said pushing the words past clenched teeth normally knoxs loyalty and readiness to protect me at all times would be flattering but not now not in front of a member of the covens court knox hesitated a moment before finally edging around bishop and heading back into the morgue where he would make sure that no one came out to the parking lot while bishop and i discussed whatever business had brought him into my domain we both waited until we heard the door to the morgue slam shut before we were in motion my nails raked across his chest tearing his shirt and leaving four ragged cuts across his skin he backhanded me throwing me into the side of another car pain spread across my face leaving me with the feeling that he had broken my cheekbone with a growl i pushed away from the car and launched myself at him ducking his swinging fists i landed a punch to his gut that broke a rib or two before he managed to grab my throat with his right hand he squeezed effectively closing off my airway i didnt need to breathe but from this position he could quickly rip my head off ending this contest i grinned at him my eyes glowing an eerie shade of purple as in nightshade around us a circle of fire sprang up from the ground closing in so that there was barely a foot of open space between us and the crackling flames bishop pulled me close to him so that the tip of my nose touched his there was no escaping his hard black gaze there was no light no glow of power just a black empty pit as if his power were bottomless do it mira bishop whispered incinerate me i swear youll awaken tomorrow night back in the hands of the coven in venice and this time jabari will not be there to save you a shiver ran through me at his cold words the coven was the ruling body of the nightwalker nation and it was an ugly place of pain and nightmares it was a place i had escaped centuries ago and rarely visited particularly since jabari one of the four elders had gone missing bishops grip on my throat loosened slightly so i could talk what do you want i asked in a ragged whisper besides the opportunity to rip your head off he asked with a dark grin that revealed his perfect white fangs im here to make sure that you clean up the mess that is currently your domain what mess i demanded i reached up and dug my nails into his large hand trying to get him to release my throat youre joking right he said dropping me weve heard from people within your domain there is no order here thats a lie there has been an increase in daylight coalitionrelated deaths within the new world recently he continued to list its not my job to police all of the new world i quickly countered and now you have a fresh death found by the humans from what ive heard it looks like another coalition kill can you not even protect your own im looking into the matter i growled i had nothing that i could say about bryces death i didnt know the why behind it all just yet but i would with time im here to make sure that you clean up this mess and deal with the nightwalkers within your domain bishop said taking a step closer to me as i stepped backward with a thought the flames were gone and the parking lot was plunged back into darkness other than the matter with the fresh body theres no mess here the coven doesnt believe that to be true you mean macaire doesnt believe it whos been talking to him now that would be telling he said a fresh grin lifting his thin lips convince me that you have everything under control here and i will leave along with everyone else that i brought with me fail and youll be coming back to venice with me a fresh stab of fear shot through me seeming to pierce down to the bone and it was nearly a minute before i could speak again what do you want me to do i found myself asking in a shaky voice i wouldnt go back to the coven i couldnt the place was a nightmare of death and endless screams that echoed through your brain even in your sleep catch the killer settle the chaos within your domain he said making it sound so simple and for him it was he was simply waiting around for an excuse to drag me back to venice that was his job fine i reluctantly agreed just stay out of my way this is still my domain and i will handle this mess as you wish he said with a slight bow of his head with a parting grin mocking me one last time bishop strolled out of the parking lot heading back for the main street i sat down on the ground against one of the cars i had crashed into earlier resting my elbows on my bent knees i dropped my head into my hands damn it a flunky of the coven was dangling a sword just above my neck simply waiting for an excuse to chop my head off my hands were trembling and my stomach was twisting into knots as i sat there mentally listing every nightwalker i knew of within my territory who could it be that was talking to the coven someone was betraying me betraying my trust and my protection knoxi called out mentally for my companion less than a minute later he was kneeling at my side he rested his hand on the back of my head while the other was on my knee what happened are you all right who was that someone from the coven were being watched we need to clean up this mess quickly before it becomes an even bigger problem how did they find out so fast about bryce he was killed this morning i dont think bishop is here because of bryce i think the timing just ended up being convenient for whoever has the covens ear i said lifting my head so that i could look at knox we need to get going were officially running short on time according to daniels information bryce was found in a house out past bonaventure cemetery not far from wilmington island knox and i jumped into my little silver bmw z and zipped out of the city like a mercury tear sliding down a clowns cheek the convertible top was down and we shoved our baseball caps in the center console area between our seats so we could enjoy the feel of the warm summer air rubbing against our faces and tangling our hair the night was alive pulsing and squirming demanding to be noticed yet it wasnt the fact that bryce had been murdered that had us both unnerved it was the fact that someone had contacted the police regarding the corpse potentially looking to expose us it was the fact that the body had been found in the middle of the living room no nightwalker was stupid enough to sleep out in the open even when in the safety of his own lair it was the way bryce had been killedby the old mythological methods head and heart removed the whole thing stank of the daylight coalition and yet i felt confident that no branch members resided within my domain the daylight coalition was an allhuman organization that believed in the existence of vampires and other supernatural creatures they saw it as their duty to hunt us all down their aim wasnt too good however considering they had killed as many humans as they had nightwalkers the rest of the human world thought they were a bunch of crackpots who had watched van helsing one too many times i tended to agree i downshifted the car into second as i turned onto bryces street the houses were spaced relatively far apart with large yards filled with massive honeysuckle bushes and white jasmine the air was thick with the rich scent of flowers and damp earth across the street from the twostory redbrick house i parked the car and turned off the engine using my powers i briefly scanned the region there were only a few nightwalkers in the area and one of them was bishop i suspected he was going to be my shadow until this little investigation was finally concluded another was standing just at the end of the block her name was heather and she was also a member of the ravana family word traveled fast among telepaths without my needing to say a word most of the city nightwalkers knew that a vampire had been murdered in general they were willing to give me a wide berth so i could investigate the matter but i had been expecting someone from the ravana family bryces death was their business i hesitated my right hand still clutching the key in the ignition something felt off we sat in the car waiting for the brunette to finally reach us she stood in the street a few feet away from where i sat in the car she looked lost and afraid with her right hand gripping her left elbow do you know if he had anyone else staying with him in the house i asked no one on a permanent basis she said shaking her head sending her long brown hair down around her face i think he had nightwalkers that stayed for brief periods of time here and there but nothing permanent i was willing to guess that bryce was one of the few within the ravana family that was permitted to keep a residence outside the main family home justin believed in spreading out his clan throughout the city so that his influence could be felt everywhere older trusted members were allowed their own homes as long as they checked in on a regular basis this wasnt an original idea within the nightwalker world just rare i listened into the thoughts of all the humans with a oneblock radius but they were all consumed with their own problemsbills sickness doubt no one was thinking of the body that was taken out of the lonely redbrick house even all the lycanthropes had left this section of the city i had a feeling i had barrett rainer alpha of the savannah pack to thank for the extra space sitting in the car for another minute we all stared across the street at the dark house the feeling of foreboding was irrational i was unnerved by the way bryce was killed and i was afraid of what i would find inside we were all completely helpless during the daylight hours unable to awaken unable to defend ourselves that was our greatest fearto go to sleep one morning and not awaken the next night lets get this done i announced gruffly jerking the key from the ignition with a soft jingle we both alighted from the tiny car and crossed the street in silence there was only the sound of the wind rustling the leaves in the trees and a distant wind chime singing a forlorn melody the air was still hot and heavy even after nightfall why would someone kill bryce heather softly asked walking a couple steps behind me who and why are the questions were trying to answer i said a bit irritably stopping short i spun around on my right heel to face the young fledgling why did justin send you here heihe said i was to help you in any way i could bryce was part of the family justin cares about us she replied in an almost mechanical manner i snorted and turned back toward the house she had been sent to spy on me and report back to justin you go in through the back and search the second floor i said looking over at knox as we walked up the sidewalk and past a pair of stone urns overflowing with what appeared to be a fuchsia plant ill go in through the front door and search the first floor anything in particular im looking for i paused with my foot on the bottom step leading up to the front porch the wooden board was warped from age and covered in peeling white paint that crunched under my running shoe were looking for any sign of a struggle also look for bryces daylight chamber was he taken out of there or did he actually fall asleep out in the open in the living room knox stared at me for a second his blond brows bunched together over his nose you think the killer knew exactly where to find him maybe we wont know until we get in there and look around what should i do heather asked go with knox help him but stay out of his way heather quickly nodded her arms wrapped around her middle as she moved to follow after the other nightwalker i mounted the warped stairs to the front porch watching knox out of the corner of my eye as he circled around the porch and headed toward the back door a mechanical whir caught my attention drawing my gaze toward the ceiling above the door the tiny red light on the remote video camera blinked once the world around me exploded i flew backward through the air and bounced once before finally landing on my back in the yard bricks chunks of flaming wood and other bits of debris followed me crashing to the ground and on top of me my head throbbed and there was an annoying ringing in my ears a hundred different pains radiated through my body groaning i rolled over onto my side to find most of the house in the yard with me while what remained on the foundation was engulfed in flames so much for our investigation reaching out with my powers i searched for knox he was still alive but his thoughts were consumed with terror he was on fire pushing to my feet i ran as fast as my protesting body would allow my vision blurred as i ran around the side of the house blood flowing into my left eye from a gash on my forehead i found knox rolling on the ground struggling to put out the fire on his right arm and on his pant legs panic overwhelmed him with a wave of my hand the fire immediately went out but he continued to roll kneeling next to him i grabbed his shoulders and forced him to sit up fire im burning please stop it help knox babbled desperately still trying to pat his legs the fires out i shouted at him giving him a hard shake the nightwalker blinked a couple times before his gaze focused on me his whole body was trembling and tears had begun to streak down his cut bloody face some distant part of me could understand his fears most nightwalkers burned so easily like dry kindling and the moment knox had caught fire he was sure that he was dead and maybe he would have been if i hadnt been here to control the fire youre going to be okay i murmured relaxing my hold on his shoulders my stomach twisted at the feeling of him shaking violently in my hands knox nodded his head slowly and looked down at the palms of his hands they were blistered and burned from where he had tried to beat the fire out it could be worse i announced drawing his gaze up to my face the fire could have started at your crotch youre sick he snapped he scowled at me which was better than the terror that had gripped him earlier what happened a bomb no kidding i mean what set it off that was the real question i wagged my eyebrows at him once before pushing to my feet wheres heather i asked as i helped knox rise as well we found her lying dead a few feet away from where knox had landed a brick from the house had crushed the back of her skull splattering her brains there was no recovering from such a wound in our world she was gone so quickly and only because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time this was not going to go over well with justin first a member of his family is murdered by some unknown killer then a second member is killed while kindly helping me in the investigation if i had any sense i would have sent her away but as a member of the ravana family she had a right to be there as well the cry of a fire engine off in the distance seeped into my thoughts it was getting closer we needed to get out of here before too large of a crowd gatheredwed have to alter the memories of a handful of humans as it was picking up heather i tossed her into the fire that was growing in the remains of the house she would be incinerated along with the rest of the evidence of bryces existence and any evidence related to his killer with knox hobbling along beside me i increased the fire eating away at the remains of the house once we were in the street if i wasnt going to be able to get into the house then no one would by the time the fire department got this fire out there would be nothing left but hot ash we were speeding back to the city when knox started speaking again however his brain wasnt totally functioning yet i dont understand he muttered why destroy the evidence after the police had gone through the place during the day that wasnt the purpose of the explosion what do you mean you think it was a coincidence that the place blew up when we just happened to be there i laughed you think someone was trying to kill us knox twisted in his seat sending his blond hair flying in wild disarray in the wind i was beginning to think that someone was trying to kill me first the coven flunkys arrival and now the explosion just as i was entering the house the timing was too perfect there was a camera on the front porch i explained keeping my theory to myself for now no reason to upset knox just yet the same person that killed bryce knew someone would be by to investigate i think this person was waiting for someone that didnt look like a cop and for the murderer i fit the bill i didnt look like a police officer in my blue jeans and black buttonup shirt but then there was enough otherness in my lavender eyes and ultra pale skin to make some people wonder if i was even human but i didnt sense anyonei mean i scanned the area and no one wanted us dead it could have been done by remote allowing the person to be miles away and now he knows youre associated with bryce if he knew bryce was a nightwalker hes going to assume youre yeah ive got a brandnew problem i grumbled it had now become even more imperative that i find bryces murderer this person had seen my face if the murderer knew bryce was a nightwalker i now fell under that same classification as a result anyone i associated with would now come under scrutiny i slowed the car to a stop at a red light we were just outside of town driving along the savannah river headed toward the riverfront district i think a member of the daylight coalition killed bryce and tried to kill us tonight because of how he was killed as well as the timing and the call to the police regardless of the reasons for killing bryce no nightwalker would risk a human discovering the corpse someone knew he was a nightwalker and wanted proof to get out to the rest of the world this murder was done during the daylight hours when bryce wouldnt have been able to fight back then why not a shapeshifter they can walk around during the day knox argued drumming his fingers on the armrest i doubted he actually believed it but he was doing his job and playing devils advocate a lycan would have the opportunity but the risk of exposure is too great no matter how pissed you are we all know not to reveal our secret to another human if the lycan was discovered not only would his life be forfeit but theres a good chance that the whole pack would be destroyed i shifted the car into first and pushed on the accelerator as the light changed to green youre right that it is a possibility just not a very strong one i conceded ill check in with barrett and see if he knows anything about bryce or if the nightwalker was known to associate with any shifter at the same time i want you to check among the nightwalkers i want to know who he associated with you think someone tipped off the coalition maybe anything else yeah whats the name of the girl bryce wanted to change katie hixson shes about thirtytwo years old medium height slim with short blond hair and blue eyes knox listed succinctly do you know her address no im afraid i dont i downshifted the car as i pulled over to the side of the road just outside the dark room a nightclub in that catered only to nightwalkers and lycanthropes a long line had already begun to stretch outside the bar as a mix of shifters and nightwalkers hoped to get in tonight it was one of the few places you were likely to run into the nightwalker you were looking for thats okay daniel can locate her for me you start digging around in bryces past call me if you find anything interesting knox nodded once and slowly got out of the car by the expression that flashed across his face each motion was painful after closing the door he leaned forward on it wincing as it cut into his wounded hands im sorry about the morgue and how iperformed at the house i let it go knox this job takes some getting used to im not valerio i was quick to cut him off i didnt want his apologies particularly out in the open where any nightwalker might be able to hear him we needed a strong front or there would be the chaos bishop was so confident was everywhere within my domain just get to work ill be in contact mira you realize that if the daylight coalition is behind this there is a very good chance a member now has your photograph knox grimly pointed out well i guess were going to have to get this bastard because im not moving i said with a smirk get to work the thought chilled me to the shreds of my soul i had lived more than six hundred years and had never come close to exposing what i was to the world at large but now it was a very real threat that my identity was in jeopardy at the very least i would become the main target for all of the daylight coalition as i drove off heading to a quieter part of the city i pushed the speaker button on my steering wheel and said daniels name into the open air the bluetooth connection to my cell phone quickly dialed the number im a little busy right now daniels voice growled from the speakers of my car i have no doubt you are but i need your help i said pulling into a dark parking lot i have a lead in the case we discussed but i need you to track her down for me names katie hixson slim build with blond hair and blue eyes daniel finished in a suddenly weary voice you know her i was stunned what were the odds that daniel knew this nightwalker wannabe yeah do you know where i can find her yeah im with her now shes dead mira a dozen profanities tumbled past my lips filling the air it was a good thing that the residents of savannah didnt know seventeenth century italian curses or i might have blushed are you sure shes dead it was a stupid question but i couldnt afford for katie to be dead sure i had planned to kill her if she had anything to do with bryces murder but that was only after i had managed to extract some information from her stillliving brain i know dead mira daniel snarled her neck has been broken and shes been drained of blood she looks like a gray raisin shes dead i pounded the steering wheel once with my fist and swallowed a fresh round of curses this was not how my night was supposed to go i had hoped to have this whole mess settled before sunrise but i was beginning to have serious doubts bishop was going to serve my head up on a silver platter to the coven if i continued at this rate that was assuming the daylight coalition didnt get ahold of me first where did you find her i bit out trying to rein in my temper my hands had begun to tremble and it felt as if my throat was starting to close up in fear i wouldnt let the coven take me at home her neighbor called she got concerned when she saw the front door left open the scrape of daniels shoes on concrete could be heard in the background it sounded like he was pacing outside the one place he could get a little privacy at a murder investigation a wild guess but the neighbor didnt see anything not a thing not even sure when ms hixson got home has archie arrived yet hes on his way tell him to stall if necessary i want to look at the body before you move it whats the address daniel gave me quick directions as i shifted back into first and drove out of the dark parking lot once i found the right street the house would be easy to identify it would be the one surrounded by flashing cop cars and decorated in yellow tape like a giant christmas tree i flew through the gears zipping across town as fast as i could katies house was just on the outskirts of the city on the opposite end from where bryces nighttime lair was located while bryces death had annoyed me katies obvious murder had caused a knot of worry to start growing in my stomach had someone else known about her involvement with bryce and killed her in fear that she knew something or saw something or maybe someone thought she was responsible for bryces untimely demise and had murdered her in revenge yet all these concerns and speculation were pushed to back of my mind as i parked my car at the end of the block from katies house i had briefly hoped it would be in a questionable part of town so her death could be pawned off as a flash of random violence in a violent neighborhood unfortunately katie had owned a house in a quiet familyoriented part of town with its neighborhood watches window boxes and decorative flags celebrating the upcoming start of summer not the type of place a body was supposed to be found drained and broken popping the trunk i walked around to the back of the car and pulled out a black blazer i quickly tucked my shirt into my jeans and pulled on the jacket i briefly tried to straighten my hair and wipe away some of the blood that covered the side of my face without seeing a mirror i knew i looked like i had been dragged through hell yet part of convincing a human that we were something other than what we really were was giving them a good reason to believe us and right now i needed to be able to convince the cops milling around this crime scene that i was just another detective with my shoulders back and my head up i walked down the street and past the threshold of the house pausing long enough to wipe my feet on the brown and black welcome mat as i passed each police officer detective and forensic investigator i mentally pushed the image of my being another detective into their brains it took a little extra push because my jeans were torn and dirty there was also dried blood on my temple and along the side of my face from where my scalp had been cut by flying debris at bryces house the process was tiring and the strain was already causing my head to throb along with all the other aches in my body there were close to a dozen people in the area not counting the neighbors that were standing in their front yards with looks of horror stretched across their faces normally i wouldnt dare to come into a crime scene littered with so many people but three people were dead in less than twentyfour hours and i was beginning to fear that the body count was going to continue to rise if i didnt find the killer soon my people didnt need to be drawn into the spotlight by some psychopathic loose cannon in the living room i found daniel standing on the fringe of the group huddled around the body sprawled on the floor his lips were drawn into a frown causing deep lines to crease his face an unlit cigarette dangled from his fingertips waiting for him to finally step outside again so he could light it the room was a cheery affair in pale orange with a darker orange acting as an accent the sofa and chair were covered in white linen and surrounded a honeywood coffee table pictures of flowers in black metal frames lined the walls katie lay on the floor with her arms folded over her chest it was strange there was no look of strain on her face no fear from what i could see there were no bruises scratches or signs that she had fought for her life it looked as if someone had lovingly laid her on the ground after he or she was done with the distasteful task of killing the young woman but daniel was right her head lay at a slightly odd angle and broken bone poked and stretched the skin her neck had been completely snapped not the easiest of feats and it was very likely that it had been done by a nightwalker her skin was also a stomachturning shade of gray that sagged and hung loose on her body someone had drained her of all her blood but i didnt know of any nightwalker that could do such a thing in a single feeding and this whole thing felt too neat for several nightwalkers to be involved forced entry i murmured as i came to stand next to daniel we both watched as one of the investigators snapped a series of pictures of the body and the rest of the room no daniel said pulling the cigarette box from his pants pocket he returned the loose cigarette back to the box and put the box in his pocket again it looks like ms hixson let the murderer in theres no sign of struggle she probably had no idea she was in danger katie probably knew her attacker she let the person in when he or she arrived and when she turned her back on her attacker the murderer snapped her neck with no pain and little fuss i frowned i just couldnt figure out who the killer was or why katie was killed shortly after bryce maybe they werent necessarily related daniel finally looked over at me and nearly stumbled a step backward i hadnt bothered to adjust his perception of me there was no need and i had enough on my plate already you look like shit he whispered trying to avoid drawing the attention of the others so kind of you to say so i muttered trouble at the house its not there anymore daniel sighed as he rubbed his eyes and the bridge of his nose did you cause that i wouldnt look like this if i did i grumbled same killer he whispered i shook my head slowly frowning no i knew without a doubt that a nightwalker had killed katie while a human had been responsible for bryces death linked ii dont know i admitted wishing i didnt have to shaking my head i left daniels side and approached the corpse i knelt down ignoring the strange looks i was receiving and bent over to sniff the body before i could get my face close to her i picked up the overwhelming scent of perfume it was everywhere on katies clothes her hair her skin whoever had touched her was smart enough to douse himself or herself in perfume so i couldnt pick up the individual scent only a lycanthrope might have a strong enough sense of smell to pick it out but there was a good chance that he wouldnt recognize the scent of the nightwalker otherwise katies body did not yet reek of death and decay she had been dead for less than two hours her neighbor had just missed walking in on the murder the one thing i was sure of was the fact that katie had been killed by a nightwalker and the murder had occurred shortly after sunset by someone the woman had possibly known katies death was too neat and tidy and there was a lingering feeling of mercy and compassion this was done by someone who knew her pushing back to my feet i walked back over to daniel keeping my back to the rest of the room tell archie to call me if anything interesting turns up you think something will he mocked me we were looking at a woman that had been killed by the breaking of her neck and then drained of her blood but there wasnt a drop on the pale tan carpet like no puncture marks on an exsanguinated corpse i offered when i was kneeling next to katie i noticed no puncture marks on her neck or in the interior of her arms it was possible they were somewhere else on her body but it was unlikely it was more likely the nightwalker had healed the wound out of habit yeah hell find something interesting you might want to also check the bathtub some of the blood might have been sent down the drain ill be in contact i quickly left the house and headed back to my car this wasnt good i had a third dead body and this one was caused by a nightwalker the peace in my domain was crumbling around me and the worse it got the better the chance of humans discovering our secret popping the trunk of my car with my remote i tossed the blazer inside and pulled my shirt back out of my jeans the night was not going well and it was about to get worse i dont think doing a striptease in the middle of the street is going to convince me to allow you to slide on this mess youve got in your domain thats the third dead body tonight isnt it bishop asked from where he leaned up against a tree just a few paces from my car i hadnt noticed him there when i walked up because my mind was stuck on the problem at hand you realize that im being set up i snarled at him my temper getting worse as fear flooded my veins youre saying that all these people are being killed just to make you look bad so that youll be sent back to the coven bishop sarcastically said scratching his chin its a possibility damn it bishop i stomped over to where he stood leaning against the tree his arms folded over his large chest you know me you know what were capable of im being set up and its working snarling i took a swing at him but he was expecting it pushing off the tree he grabbed both of my wrists and pinned them over my head against the tree he pressed in close so that his face filled my field of vision i positively itched to put my knee in his groin but i waited to hear what he had to say its working mira someone probably does have it in for you and theyre successfully setting you up how many enemies could you possibly have here a few i admitted justin ravana instantly came to mind while he had never made any play to seize power of the domain from me he had always been a steady voice of unrest but in the end he kept to himself so i let him be would any of these enemies have a reason to kill this poor human one would i growled killing katie would be justins way of wiping out the last of bryces ties while potentially making me look bad in front of the coven justin was my next target and i was happy to take the fight to him frowning i stared at bishop for a moment trying to suppress my few memories of the nightwalker too many nights washed in blood and violence you know i can clean this up and get the territory back under control this is about macaire wanting me under his thumb in venice i said shifting slightly so that the tree bark wasnt biting into my back macaire had hated me since jabari had taken me under his wing five centuries ago with jabari now missing the ancient nightwalker now thought it was safe to make his move against me and if i didnt think of something fast it was going to work why does it have to be about only macaire bishop shifted his hands so that my wrists were held loosely in one of his large hands his left hand came down and moved some hair away from my face admit it mira we had fun in venice together you used to enjoy our games with the fledglings hell they feared you more than the entire coven you thrived on their fear why dont you just come home macaire will leave you alone if you listen to him i cant go back to that life ive outgrown it this is my home now i said leaning forward i brushed my lips across his cheek why cant you stay here i whispered youve been with the coven most of your life youve got to be growing weary of it stay here with me make this your new home and go from being a messenger for the coven to being a flunky for the fire starter not likely he said snidely no just live here be your own person bishop stared silently at me for a minute the skepticism clear on his face but i could also see the hope in his eyes the offer was appealing bishop had a lot of freedom due to his position within the court but not true freedomnot like what i was offering its tempting but not everyones master is as forgiving my leash is not quite as long as yours he said releasing my hands as he stepped away from me and it was true i didnt belong to jabari in the same way bishop belonged to macaire yet if jabari demanded i return to venice i would out of loyalty and a good dose of fear then all i ask is that you be fair about this i pleaded cupping his face with my hands give me a chance to fix this youre flailing temporarily i can fix this one more dead body not of your own making and youre going back with me bishop warned gently lowering my hands from his face i nodded pulling from his grip the offer still stands youre welcome here maybe someday but not now not like this i was done chasing my tail i was ready to take the fight to the one person who had the most to gain from my removal justin ravanas threestory brick house was located on a hill on the outskirts of the city its location not only allowed him to easily sense the approach of any nightwalker but he could watch them crawl up his hill like a supplicant coming to request a boon driving up the hill i realized that i had made a mistake in the handling of him i had thought that he would be content to rule over his family and for a time he had been but now he wanted to take all of savannah from me for him the easiest way to claim it would be through the coven i had little doubt that he had been the little bird chirping in the ear of macaire telling his lies so that i would be drawn back to venice and all her horrors my temper was barely caged when one of justins fledglings showed me to the main parlor where justin sat waiting for me the air in the house was thick with the scent of blood and fear muffled screams and heavy footsteps could be heard on wooden floors about me mira this is a surprise justin opened pushing slowly out of his cushioned highbacked chair as if he was reluctant to rise to his feet in my presence it shouldnt be bryce belonged to you didnt he and so did poor heather savannah has certainly become a dangerous place to live he said with a shake of his head im sure your fledglings would argue that it always has been a smile toyed with his lips as his eyes traveled over the length of me yes well one has to do what one must to keep the young ones in line and what did bryce do to deserve the death he received you think i had something to do with bryces death he gasped looking honestly surprised mira you know my methods again the same dark grin spread across his lean angular face reminding me so much of an animated skull if bryce had crossed me i would have taken care of the matter here in the privacy of my own home i would have kept the matter in the family so the fact that bryce had come to me looking to make his own fledgling didnt bother you i asked justin sat back down in the chair he had been seated in his sharp gaze drifting away from me to a spot on the floor his left hand curled into a fist on the arm of the chair but his voice was calm even when he spoke again i wasunaware of his request but bryce knew that i would not object to expanding the family i would have welcomed his fledgling maybe thats just it he didnt want this fledgling to be a part of the ravana family he possibly wanted something outside of your reach i said purposefully twisting the knife in his chest as i struggled to keep the smile off of my face then i would have killed him but again i would have done it my way here and slowly im afraid if you came here looking for bryces killer you have come to the wrong place unfortunately i believed him no thats not the only reason why im here i said with a smile i was about to comment on his recent trip to see the coven when a bloodcurdling scream rent the air effectively silencing me and wiping the smile from my face we both looked up at the ceiling i got flashes of a naked female chained to the brick wall in the attic being tortured by a lycanthrope and three other nightwalkers she was streaked with blood and her face was swollen to the point that she could barely see out of her puffy eyes one of her tormentors was projecting the fight for justins benefit since the master of the family was stuck dealing with me who a new fledgling that has elected to join the ravana family shes being broken in would you like to help no but its been so long since you took the time to appropriately break in a fledgling these young ones have no concept any longer of what it means to exist in our world they dont respect you as they should i want no part of your games i growled but you must my fledglings ask that you show them what you truly are capable of great fire starter there was no missing the sarcasm that was etched into every word he had spoken a knot twisted in my stomach and for the first time i fully scanned the house there were close to thirty nightwalkers in this house i had walked into a trap he had been waiting years to spring justin hadnt been building a family he had been building an army of fledglings for the sole purpose of killing me two sets of doors opened on the parlor as justin rose and walked over to stand near the wall next to a fire extinguisher a smug smile lifted his features at the same time more than a dozen nightwalkers rushed into the room there was no time for clear thought no room for delicacy each one of justins fledglings wanted to kill me i dodged fists and clawing nails as i quickly delivered as many blows as possible there was no time to punch into a chest and rip out a heart i could only try to knock out as many as possible i grabbed one snarling body and threw it into the crowd hoping to create a hole so that i could make a mad dash for the front door i needed to get out of this room and into a more open area but the crowd bounced back as quickly as it crumbled keeping me trapped in the confines of the congested parlor there were too many of them pain rippled through my body as fists connected with my vital organs and rained on my head and face i held my own until someone grabbed a chair and hit me in the back knocking me to my knees another kicked me under the chin throwing me to my back a cry escaped me as pain flashed through my body while i was down a large hulking nightwalker straddled me and raised his hand with the intent of plunging it into my chest time slowed down for that second and the world drifted away so that there was only that blond nightwalker with a look of triumph on his face fear brought a scream to my lips as he erupted into flames as i expected he was immediately hit with the white spray of the fire extinguisher but that didnt stop me i focused my powers burning him on the inside and out he howled rolling off me the nightwalker clawed at his chest until fire finally peeked through his blackened skin the other nightwalkers drew back but that didnt save them sitting up i directed my powers to all those around me burning them on the inside and out cooking them so thoroughly that justin and his little fire extinguisher couldnt save one of them chaos reigned in the house but it was my brand of chaos while i burned any nightwalker that i saw i also projected the images throughout all of savannah any nightwalker within range would see the bloodbath that was raging through the house i am the fire starter i am the keeper of this domain this was my answer to the chaos and the threats around me i thought i heard bishops laughter in my head as i doused the last of the flames and rose to my feet the room was filled with charred blackened bodies justin was in the far corner still holding the now empty fire extinguisher i smiled at him as i approached you were right i said grabbing a handful of his brown hair and slamming his head into the wall it has been way too long since i properly broke in a fledgling its a shame about your family though i think i destroyed most of them mira the ravana family is no more you will return to the coven and tell them that i have restored order here yyyes he agreed attempting to nod but he couldnt move his head within my grip and when i see you again i will kill you releasing him i stepped over the bodies of the dead and walked out to my car i didnt expect justin to go to the coven it worked to his benefit if they thought that the city was still a mess but that didnt matter now bishop had witnessed the cleansing nice job came bishops taunting voice in my head will that do i asked ready to have him out of my hair and back to the coven reporting the good news not quite you have no proof that you actually killed the murderer soon leaning against my car i pulled my cell phone from my back pocket my hands were shaking and my legs were weak beneath me threatening to buckle i hurt in a dozen different places and they all seemed to be healing too slowly for my liking hunger gnawed at me begging me to stop long enough to feed i had lost too much blood between the explosion at bryces house and this fight i needed to rest and heal but there simply wasnt time with bishop lurking around in my domain i had to press on despite my growing weakness i dialed barrett rainers number grateful that i finally had something work in my favor with the presence of the lycanthrope at the ravana house i now had the leverage i needed to call in a favor from the alpha for the savannah pack lycans were not supposed to take part in the torture of fledglings justin was correct in that it was part of our breakingin process and lycans were not supposed to be around to muddy up the waters when allegiance was on the line while i wouldnt necessarily refer to barrett as a friend we were on comfortable civil terms in general our contact was limited to the occasional checkin around the full moon and if there was some kind of problem having a good night barretts deep baritone filled my ear when he answered the call the grapevine in the supernatural realm was fast and farreaching i wasnt at all surprised that he knew about bryces murder and probably the explosion as well katies death would take longer to spread since she was human ive had better i growled pacing away from the rear of the car i have a favor to call in ive got problems of my own at the moment why do i owe you a favor i caught a lycan at ravanas taking part in the torture of a fledgling you know that its not permitted i left him alive for you to deal with but but i now owe you a favor he bit out i need you to get your boys out looking for someone for me a member of the daylight coalition theres at least one in town im willing to bet that hes behind bryces murder and the attempt on my life actually ive got someone here that might interest you barrett announced i could easily imagine the smug smile that spread across his hard angular face my feet skid to a halt in the gravelriddled street i stood with my back to ravanas house and faced the growing darkness what do you mean someone from the daylight coalition just walked into my restaurant and ordered dinner barrett owned and operated an italian restaurant downtown called bella luna which was somewhat ironic since his familys ancestry was mostly german apparently at some point a member of his family married an italian woman and she started the restaurant that has been handed down over the generations what did he flash his official daylight coalition membership card hoping to get a discount i didnt mean to be so snide but fear and frustration were eating away at me i was running out of time before bishop arrived to claim my hide hardly i can read his thoughts he sounded much calmer than me it was quiet where he was making me think that he had called from his office rather than standing over a potentially halfdead man if it was known that someone was from the coalition many of our kind would take it upon themselves to immediately cut short his life span neither side did anything to put a halt to these activities as long as no evidence was left behind it wasnt a pretty arrangement but it was get them before they got us besides the lycanthrope said his voice dropping a little closer to a growl for the first time since he had called we get them on occasion they pop into the bars restaurants and shops with any form of the word moon in the name i guess theyre hoping to catch us acting like animals so they can do the world a great service and put us down i paced back toward the car shoving one hand through my hair getting my fingers temporarily stuck my dirty bloodmatted hair was a knotted mess are you going to put him down or are you going to let me talk to him first i needed to know if our unexpected guest to the city of savannah had anything to do with bryces murder will he survive the interview it depends on his answers its doubtful then you can have him i clenched my teeth and swallowed my next snide comment i was determined to have this man regardless of what barretts wishes were two nightwalkers were dead a house had been blown up and a human was dead in connection to one of the dead nightwalkers and now i had some unknown daylight coalition schmuck wandering around in my territory he had to be connected to this mess in some way i just had to figure out how he fit in this puzzle how much longer do you think hell be at the restaurant i demanded as i reached into the front pocket of my jeans and pulled out the keys probably another thirty minutes at the most hes already ordered his dinner and it should be arriving within a couple minutes thats fine i can be there by then ill park behind the restaurant and follow him after he leaves i paused as i was about to jump in the car and looked up at ravanas house the fledgling was still in the attic chained to the wall for a moment i wondered if i should go up and free her but i quickly shook off the thought and got into the car if she couldnt find a way to free herself then she would never survive in my world back in the car i was flying across the city the restaurant was downtown not far from the dark room i planned on swinging by to get knox before arriving at the restaurant i didnt particularly need the backup but this was knoxs investigation and i had a feeling we would be able to get a lot out of this human if we could keep him alive long enough to pick his brain i have to get back knox announced as he fell into the passenger seat beside me gregor knew bryce and katie i had filled him in about katies death when i called to tell him i would pick him up he already knew about what happened at justins all the citys nightwalkers knew about that hopefully hell stay alive long enough to be questioned i said under my breath another body not yet but our luck hasnt been that good tonight i looked over my shoulder at the front entrance where a nightwalker bouncer by the name of adam stood glaring at the crowd his brown hair was cropped short on his head and his black tshirt was stretched over bulging muscles making him an impressive figure even if he hadnt been a nightwalker adam tell gregor that i want him to remain here when he arrives knox and i want to speak with him this message was conveyed with a brief touch of my mind to his yet no matter how brief i could still feel the flood of fear that shivered through him at my touch i tried to ignore it but there were times when it ate at me nonetheless i was trying to protect him and all of my kind but he feared me like most nightwalkers feared the coven and after what had happened at ravanas it was worse than usual i could feel a wave of fear crashing off all the nightwalkers that saw me outside the club turning my attention back to the road i let off the clutch and jumped out into the traffic we rushed down to the river cutting down and around one street after another as we drew closer to bella luna it took only a few minutes to reach the restaurant leaving me to settle the car in a shadowy area in the back where the deliveries were made do i scare you i asked without warning after sitting in silence for several minutes i beg your pardon knox turned in his seat and looked at me his lips twisting slightly as he was fighting to hold back a smile do i scare you it was harder to say the second time but i forced the words out scare me knox stared at me for a moment before a sigh finally escaped him he leaned his right elbow on the door and shoved his fingers through his dirty bloody blond hair he had taken the time to clean up slightly while at the club but he still looked ragged mira i feel like theres no right answer here slumping in my seat i relaxed my grip on the steering wheel letting my hand fall into my lap you know me knox i want the truth yes you scare me you know you do after the show of power at justins how could we all not fear you knox said in a sudden rush as if the words were stampeding from his chest youre the fire starter you can kill us all with a thought and even if you werent the fire starter youre still powerful enough to wipe the floor with any one of us so yes you scare me but i inserted prompting him to continue when he seemed to hesitate but i know valerio i spent more than two centuries with my maker youve known him for even longer i think youre more like him than you sometimes realize youre more emotional but you can be just as methodical whether anyone else realizes it theres a method to your madness like valerio youre about protecting the secret and being honorable as long as a nightwalker doesnt cross those two lines hes going to wake up the next sunset the others dont realize it do they i can feel it when i enter a room or when i touch their minds i can feel the shiver of fear the recoil when i get too close i feel trapped i dont want them to fear me yet the only way i can get their complete obedience is for them to fear me each word was forced out between my clenched teeth i was tired of being the outsider after more than six centuries of life i was tired of being the outsider within my own domain do you know what would make it easier for them to accept you i shifted in my seat slightly and looked over at my companion surprised that he was willing to offer me a suggestion what date another nightwalker i chuckled softly to myself and shook my head youre kidding right no im not ive been here awhile and ive never heard of you with another nightwalker i looked over at knox again stunned to find that he was absolutely serious about this ridiculous suggestion not a chance mira dating another nightwalker within your domain might convince them that youre not a heartless killing machine that there is something feeling about you mmmyour comments warm my cold dead heart i mocked this conversation was taking a turn that i wasnt expecting i turned the key in the ignition enough to get the clock radio to flash on we had been sitting there for only a couple of minutes damn it i had started this nightmare conversation im serious so what are you offering to be my boyfriend knox stared at me for a long time his eyes moving over my face i knew i looked like a mess all the wounds i had sustained while at bryces and justins had healed but i was still covered in my own blood along with dirt and a little of knoxs blood there was nothing attractive about me at this moment in time but it was more than that knox knew better than most who i was he knew of me before we had ever met his maker valerio and i had run together for a few centuries back in europe i had no doubt that valerio had told his fledgling more than a few entertaining tales of the old days beyond that knox had been brave enough to try to get to know me when he arrived in savannah unlike anyone else within my domain i felt like a rejection from knox would actually be a rejection of who i was not necessarily of the image i presented to those in my domain and in truth it had been a couple of centuries since i had last been involved in a serious romantic relationship the last one had ended badly and i wasnt entirely sure i wanted to put myself in that vulnerable position again certainly not when the peace of my domain was being threatened do you honestly want me to offer to be your boyfriend he finally asked i was saved from having to reply to his strange question when the heavy metal door leading into bella lunas kitchen exploded open banging against the brick wall of the building a large mass came flying out of the doorway and landed halfway across the back parking lot it rolled a few feet before stopping and groaning whoever it was was still alivefor now a series of low growls filled the darkness drawing my gaze back toward the restaurant three men stepped out of the restaurant their eyes glowing a frightening copperishred they were all dressed in black slacks and pristine white shirts the trio was followed by barrett who stood outlined by the light coming from the doorway his broad shoulders tapered to a narrow waist he was one hundred percent hard muscle and by the way he clenched his fists at his side seriously pissed did the guy try to leave without paying his check knox whispered below the bloodchilling growls no i murmured my concentration elsewhere i had already reached out to the creature to discover the mass was human he had pulled a knife on a female server in the restauranta female shapeshifter sifting briefly through the thoughts in his mind i discovered that his name was franklin thomas and he was from the daylight coalition shit i hissed this lump of blood and stupidity was the one i had come to fetch putting one sneaker on the soft leather seat i launched myself over the door of the convertible i had to get between the schmuck and the lycans before they tore him up my stomach knotted and i struggled to keep my voice firm and even you cant do this barrett im sorry but our agreement is off barrett replied in a low voice not at all sounding sorry he attacked erica threatened her damn it all to hell i didnt know most of the lycanthropes by name but i had made a point of learning the names of barretts immediate family erica was barretts younger sister of all the people the human could have picked he chose a blood member of the ruling family i was no longer sure i could delay his execution now barrett we both know that business comes before personal in our world i countered in a gentle yet firm voice with four lycans spread out before me i wasnt sure i could keep them all at bay the secret comes before personal vendettas ill not let you tie my hands like this barrett took a step closer to me and the other werewolves closed in as well the air seemed to shimmer with power they wouldnt bother to shift but they would call on whatever energy they had at their disposal to take me down and get to the human slowly walk over to the man and get him to his feet i directed knox telepathically i need your patience this man owes me answers he may have killed bryce and i think he attempted to kill knox and me earlier tonight no the sound was more of a snarl than actual english but i got the point and so did his compatriots they all thought i was going to kill the human because he potentially attacked me first it would be my right and barrett was pissed because his sisters slight would never be properly avenged but no i didnt plan on killing the human i had a much better idea in mind as the werewolves lurched forward i threw out my hands to my sides creating a semicircle of fire between me and the lycans it wouldnt stop them for long but i needed only a few seconds get him out of here i ordered knox ill catch up i heard the man groan once and then there was only the soft whisper of fabric knox had lifted up the human and run to a safer location i didnt need to tell him to be careful my main concern was the man doing something stupid to anger knox who could kill him before id had my chance to question the coalition flunky the moment i felt that knox was a few blocks away i lowered and extinguished the flames the lycanthropes didnt hesitate i narrowly dodged one fist flying toward my face and answered by slamming the heel of my palm into his solar plexus the air exploded from his lungs dropping him to his knees as he gasped for air balanced on the balls of my feet i spun to my left and ducked down as another charged i landed two blows and dodged one before i finally sent him flying across the parking lot the third stood back his body hunched over as he struggled to find a way to take me down when his two companions so quickly failed barrett also remained in the background his large hands clenched into fists he was still smart enough to know that if he attacked me it could cause an allout war between the shifters and the vampires in my domain for now this was just a little scuffle and i was simply defending myself i was shaky on my feet and there was a fine trembling in my fingers but the rest in the car had given me the strength i needed to face off against barrett if it came down to it i wont kill him barrett i called out my eyes locked on the one lycanthrope besides the alpha that was still standing i need answers and that man dead wont help me get those answers mira you can have him back when im done i promise are you serious the hardened edge had left his voicehe seemed surprised by my offer the change in tone was enough to get his people to give me a little more space dead serious leave us without another word the three werewolves filed out of the parking lot and back into the restaurant closing the door behind them the power that had flooded the small parking lot instantly left with the light breeze that blew through shifting the leaves in the nearby trees he tried to kill you barrett said once we were alone hes not the only one we didnt i knew what he was about to say and i cut him off hes not the only one whos tried to kill me tonight and he wont be the last theres always someone trying to kill me its the world we live in your world not mine barrett corrected i smiled at him as i walked over to my car ill contact you when im done with the human i said then drove off before he could say anything further whether barrett wanted to admit it or not we lived in the same world with rules that threatened to choke those that could not accept it i loved this world and its tight boundaries finding ways to manipulate the system we all lived in was one of the few things that still got the blood pumping in my veins so to speak i located knox at a warehouse a few blocks away from bella luna it seemed as if he was reluctant to stray too far considering i had been outnumbered by a group of angry lycanthropes but then knox still had a touching tendency to underestimate me after my car was properly stowed i joined him in the nearly empty warehouse with the daylight coalition member the darkhaired man paced the open area his eyes never straying long from knox as he looked for possible exit routes there are two doors on the ground floor and a third on the second floor that leads to the roof i announced as i soundlessly walked across the main floor i knew the warehouse because i owned it it was kept empty for meetings just like this one the overhead lights remained out but patches of light spilled through dirty windows into the gritty expanse filled with large crates and warped wooden pallets i stepped into a square of light and stayed there so franklin could see me clearly but you wont make it to any of those exits unless i want you to whyd you kidnap me he demanded in a harsh ugly voice his accent didnt contain any of the soft southern drawl that i had become accustomed to when dealing with humans he was from somewhere up north originally kidnap you i think you mean saved your sorry ass knox laughed deeply shoving his hands into the back pockets of his torn jeans as he leaned against the wall you threaten the sister of the owner of bella luna and you expect to walk out with your balls still attached very unlikely my friend im not your friend he raged taking one step closer to knox before backing off again i know what you are franklin shouted he paced toward me as if his courage had returned for a second before it left him and he paced away youre a vampire it was on the tip of my tongue to deny it but i let the comment pass if he was the one that blew up bryces house then he mostly likely saw me at the house seconds before it exploded and now i stood unharmed before him was there a better explanation than the fact that i was a nightwalker well none that would make any sense and youre a member of the daylight coalition i said with a light shrug of my shoulders he honestly seemed shocked by my sudden pronouncement he stumbled backward a couple steps and shook his head causing me to laugh you know about us but do you honestly think we wouldnt know about you i stopped laughing suddenly letting the silence overwhelm him before i started speaking again you kill nightwalkers this morning you killed one by the name of bryce at the edge of town he was tall slender with brown hair and freckles he looked like he was nineteen you killed him and made sure the body was left in a spot where the sunlight could reach it as i spoke i watched the memories playing back in his mind like a silent movie in a slightly broken jumble i saw franklin drag bryces unconscious body up from the basement with an enormous knife he sawed opened the nightwalkers chest and cut out the heart he then removed the head the whole time franklin was grinning as he was washed in bryces blood bryce had been asleep and completely helpless when the human struck just after sunrise nothing in heaven or earth could have wakened him some would argue that at least he felt no pain but he also had no chance to fight back no chance to fight for his right to exist i suppressed a shiver that bit at my muscles and ignored the ache in my fangs i couldnt kill this coldhearted monster i needed the answers he held he knew the why and the final who how did you find out about bryce i asked doing the best i could to swallow back my anger i cant imagine you found him on your own considering that youre not from around here i squatted like a toad among his memories waiting for the image of the person who had betrayed bryce yet i was momentarily distracted by the smile that blossomed on his face the scowl that twisted his features melted away and his eyes widened as a grin split his mouth i didnt know about him until one of your kind told me about him he proudly announced hoping to get a rise out of me but i didnt react i had already suspected that a nightwalker was somehow involved in this mess but hearing those ugly words fall from his lips didnt stop the flash of anger that ripped through me who i whispered why would i tell you in hopes of getting a quick merciful death i took two quick steps out of the light approaching my companion he lurched backward nearly stumbling in his awkward haste i smiled as his own smile faded you can tell me or i can pick it out of your mind besides why would you want to protect this nightwalker what do i care about some stupid fucking vamp she came to me bitching about being turned against her will and that she wanted me to kill the bastard that did it she was some blond bitch said her name was katie as he spoke i watched him mentally replay the moment when she had approached him at night in a lonely parking lot but something was off katie was not now nor was she ever a nightwalker and yet the image of the nightwalker was blurred so that i could only pick out the figures slight form and blond hair the person was definitely female but the face was unclear the nightwalker that spoke to him had tampered with his memory but had not done a very good job of it did you see i silently asked knox who was still watching from the other side of the room i never heard him move but i could feel that he was now closer to me than he had been only seconds earlier yes thats not katie she wasnt a nightwalker unless i saw the body shes not rising tomorrow night shes gone even if katie hadnt been drained of all her blood it was unlikely she would have been able to heal her broken neck in the process of being reborn in general the human had to be in working order if he or she was going to be brought over we could heal nearly any wound once we were nightwalkers but we all had to start off in good shape youve been lied to my friend i commented turning my attention back to the human it wasnt katie furthermore the nightwalker had lied about the reason for having bryce killed it was impossible to be made into a nightwalker against your will if you didnt want it you died and sometimes even if you did want it you died you had to fight death for your soul during the process and he wasnt the most congenial loser what the hell do i care a vampire is dead one less to prey on humans yes i hissed one less turning on my right heel i headed back toward the entrance of the warehouse with knox at my side i was done with the human between his uninformative answers and his damaged memories i had gotten from him all the information i was going to be able to get i was content to hand him over to barrett i had a bigger target in mind at this point while combing through franklins mind i had caught the address for a coalition safe house in atlanta and a second one in memphis tennessee id see to it that that information was put to good use the shot was like an explosion in the silence of the warehouse pain punctured my back to the right of my spine ripping through flesh and organs before exiting through my chest my whole body bowed and jerked forward i slid a couple inches on the tips of my toes before my knees gave out on me and i collapsed to the floor the bastard had missed my heart but the bullet cut through one of my lungs lucky for me i didnt need my lungs any longer and it wouldnt take long for the damage to repair itself knox knelt beside me one hand on my arm while i pressed a hand to my chest to stem the bleeding are you okay he demanded in a snarl he was simply waiting for me to say that i was okay before he launched himself at franklin you forgot to search him i bit out im sorry ii forgot ill take care of him now hes mine i replied in a low growl gripping knoxs arm i jumped to my feet and rushed across the warehouse to where the human stood attempting to unload the contents of his handgun into my body however all the bullets went wide there was no hitting me i was moving too fast a grim blur of color in the dimly lit warehouse he didnt know i was there until my hands closed around his throat and i threw him against one of the support beams by then his gun was clicking sadly out of bullets you have my undivided attention now i said leaning in close enough that my breath brushed against his ear is there something you wanted my chest pressed against his shirt soaking up some of my blood i pulled back just far enough that he could now see my fangs sending a shiver of fear through him my hands clenching his shirt trembled as i fought the urge to sink my teeth into his throat but it was more than just the need to drink in his blood the monster that lay deep within my chest roared to life demanding that i rip flesh and break bone i wanted to hear him scream in pain until the sound echoed through the empty warehouse i needed him drowning in pain instead of emitting the terrified little whimpers that escaped him now slowly i regained control of myself in my world i had the right to tear and rend and shred he attacked me first he tried to kill me at bryces and again here unfortunately i had other plans for this shivering sack of flesh that would serve me better than a moments joy in killing this bastard i thought so i said shoving him a little as i released his shirt again i turned and walked away knox accompanied me out of the warehouse his mouth opened the moment the steel door closed with a solid clang behind us we forgot to ask about the video camera knox said sliding to a stop in the gravel hell only lie about it wasting our time i said halting him before he could go back into the warehouse but if they have your picture im screwed i know screwed was an understatement if it got out that i was a nightwalker even as a joke the coven would have my head and heart on a platter before sunrise do we have anyone who might be able to hack into the coalition database hackers nightwalkers no but barrett has at least a pair perfect i pulled my cell phone out of my pocket and dialed barretts number hes at the warehouse but wont remain here for long hes all yours now i announced as soon as he picked up the line thank you barrett murmured in a low voice he was grateful but he wasnt particularly happy he owed me now and it sat heavy in his stomach you can track him by the scent of my blood i added twisting the knife barrett knew the only way my blood would get on franklin would be if he managed to wound me he now owed me a very big favor considering i had walked away from a very personal slight so that he could have his revenge and if there was one thing that all the other races had in common it was the fact that not one of us liked to be beholden to the other what do you need he said as if he were grinding the words up in his clenched teeth a favor he may have gotten me on film earlier i need all evidence of it erased files emails and possibly data removed from the coalition database do you have people who can handle it you know i do he replied his voice sounded a lot less gruff than earlier as favors went this one was fairly easy his people were potentially getting access to our enemys files while he was evening a score with me my fate is in your hands dont worry mira ill keep you off youtube smiling i shoved the phone into my pocket and pulled my keys out of my other pocket as we walked around the side of the building to where my car was parked opening the trunk i dug around in my little bag for a fresh shirt so did we learn anything of value tonight that a nightwalker was the one to contact franklin knox replied he was right a werewolf would never have been able to blur a persons memory like we saw and it was extremely unlikely that a warlock or witch would be able to find where bryce kept his daylight sanctuary however nightwalkers frequently shared that information when they allowed other nightwalkers to bed down with them during the day in rare moments of trust or when seeking to start a family whoever it was didnt know how to properly mask her appearance she vaguely looked like katie but it was very shaky as if the person was struggling to either hold the illusion or was unable to properly mend franklins memories a fledgling knox asked he sounded skeptical and i couldnt blame him possibly i quickly unbuttoned my shirt and looked down to find that the wound had completely healed but now there was a trail of drying blood running down into the waist of my jeans wiping off as much blood as possible i threw the shirt into my trunk to destroy later and pulled on a dark gray tshirt it could just be an older nightwalker that never had any proper training knox suggested a fledgling seems unlikely i agreed shutting the trunk of my car bryce didnt have any fledglings of his own and he should have been old enough to easily defend himself from any of the fledglings within the area which is maybe why a fledgling got the coalition to do the dirty work could a fledgling be so stupid she had to know that we would look into this and track her down i turned and leaned against the car for a minute my arms folded over my chest and maybe that was a part of her plan interjected a new voice i looked up in time to see bishop step from the shadows beside the wall of the warehouse maybe this fledglings goal is to kill you as well as this bryce person shes getting closer if thats the case knox added making me scowl at him dont make faces at the boy mira hes right bishop teased youve been nearly killed three times already tonight and youve yet to catch this schemer i can understand killing bryce for some reason related to our world and even the attempts on me its all involved with our world but why kill katie hixson all she wanted to do was to enter our world dont know knox said with a shrug of his shoulders he stood before me his hands shoved into his front pockets jealousy maybe the fledgling didnt want bryce bringing over katie or maybe she was jealous that he would rather spend time with katie than with another nightwalker it wasnt a new story a fledgling was hurt because a nightwalker fell for a human and wanted to turn him or her id seen it all play out like a shakespearean tragedyeveryone dead we need the answer to those questions only one place left to get them gregor the name escaped me in a low growl if there was one nightwalker i wouldnt mind seeing with his head and heart removed it was gregor he was a few centuries old and controlled a clique of nightwalkers that i found more than a little annoying for now i would have to put aside my distaste for him if bryce was known to travel with gregor on occasion then the nightwalker would be able to give me more information as to who might have had bryce killed and katie hixson drained gregor wasnt at the dark room adam quickly informed me upon arriving that when gregor discovered i was looking for him he left the dark room and asked that i meet him at the docks i could only guess that the nightwalker didnt want to be seen being questioned by me i could understand his hesitance but that didnt make me happy about it the docks was a nightclub near the riverfront that catered to the local goth scene with its dark smoky decor and nonstop industrial music blaring in the background it was one of my favorite places to spend an evening the clientele were content to just let me enjoy the music and the dancing it was a good place to hide when you were trying to avoid the world around you slipping ahead of the crowd that waited to get into the club i slapped a fifty on the counter per my usual noquestions policy with the management of the club they didnt ask to see my identification and didnt attempt to put one of those paper strips on my wrist indicating that i was over the age of twentyone i didnt come to this place to drink alcohol gregor sat alone at a table in a dark corner of the nightclub he wore a dark red kneelength jacket over a black shirt and black doublebreasted vest with large silver buttons a gold chain for his pocket watch hung from his vest pocket his whole attire screamed of victorian aristocracy making him appear to be horribly out of place in this bar filled with black leather silver chains and tattered lace regardless of the fact that gregor had actually survived the victorian era he was now part of the steampunk generation which was a somewhat distant cousin to the goth movement that refused to completely fade away while i doubted he believed in their mentality the steampunk generation did fit his taste in clothing mira its so good to see you again its been ages gregor said easily rising to his feet as we approached his table hmmyes not since you suggested that a number of nightwalkers go running with the shifters on a full moon how many fledglings did we lose that night six i said with a frown as i took a seat opposite him a grin spread across his face as he returned to his seat eight and four lycans were badly injured knox added from where he stood just behind my right shoulder there were only two chairs at the tiny table and i was surprised that he had chosen to stand behind me rather than pull over another chair but then knox was from the old world and had been raised by an old world nightwalker standing indicated that he was my assistant rather than my supposed equal sitting beside me but it was fun im sorry you missed out gregor continued nearly chuckling it seems i missed out on some other fun too i said preferring to finally switch the subject there was nothing i could do about gregors twisted sense of humor he had convinced a group of young nightwalkers to go running with some werewolves on the night of a full moon there was the inevitable scuffle and eight nightwalkers got shredded in the process as gregor knew would happen my concern was the four lycans that got hurt barrett had not been happy about it but then we both knew there was nothing we could do about it we had to give our people some room to make stupid mistakes so long as humans werent involved if youre referring to what happened to bryce i had nothing to do with his demise as im sure you know i heard that he was killed during the daylight hours gregor said sitting back in his chair the music shifted at the back of the nightclub where the dance floor was located moving to a heavy thumping beat that vibrated in my chest i would rather be dancing surrounded by smiling sweating humans caught up in the music than dealing with gregor and this entire mess for once i believe you i said with a frown i need to know who bryce hung out with particularly females someone killed him and katie hixson for the first time since we walked into the docks the smile that filled gregors face slipped away and he honestly looked confused i dont understand katie was murdered shortly after sunset it was a nightwalker knox interjected you knew katie i demanded drawing gregors stunned gaze from knox to me again yes bryce and the rest of his group brought her in to the dark room a few times she was a lovely young lady very polite and sweet not the usual goth livingdead nonsense that you see hanging on our kind as if we were their longlost messiah was there anyone jealous of bryce and katie anyone who might have wanted them both dead knox inquired bryce yes i can think of one person who would want bryce dead but not katie lauren was the one that introduced katie to bryce and the rest of his small group lauren had known katie while she was a human and had brought her into the fold as a human it could have been anyone within the group he hung with there were three females lauren bridgette and kari and then charles traveled with that flock on occasion but not so much within the past few years i was familiar with bridgette she was about fifty years old and had moved into the area with my permission more than twenty years ago however the other two i wasnt overly familiar with how old are lauren and kari kari is nearly thirty i believe she moved here with charles lauren is really freshfive or six years i think im not sure who her maker is shes never mentioned him and ive never seen her with anyone but bryce and the rest of his group are any of them a member of ravanas family kari and bridgette are i believe where can i find them i demanded drumming my fingernails on the sticky surface of the small circular table that separated us all three ladies are back at the dark room charles is thanks gregor i pushed to my feet i had heard enough i knew who had killed katie and set the daylight coalition on bryce mira you dont think it was one of those girls gregor demanded lurching awkwardly to his feet in his surprise theyre just fledglings they couldnt have stay here gregor you dont want anyone to know you ratted them out knox said earning a low snarl from the nightwalker i bit back a smile as i walked out of the nightclub and into the fresh air it wasnt much cooler than the uncomfortably warm nightclub knox was as irritated with gregor as i was the nightwalker seemed to parade himself around my domain as if he ran it he made sure that he was acquainted with everyone within the savannah area and made himself up to be more powerful than he really was however those within my domain that were more powerful and stronger including myself tended to ignore him since he was just an annoyance he also proved to be a valuable source of information on the rare occasion so we all let him be regardless of all his pomp he knew where the line was and he was very careful not to cross it dance on it spit on it and kick dirt on itsure but he didnt cross it so you know who the killer is knox said walking beside me as we headed back to the dark room yes and youre going to end her bloody reign for me i looked over at knox to find him smiling at me a faint glow touching his eyes as you wish i paused just off the entrance of the dark room beyond the two empty coat check rooms and looked over the club the main floor was lit almost entirely by candles in wall sconces and in hurricane lamps on the tables the walls were lined with booths that were cloaked in deep shadows that could be easily penetrated by our superior night vision thick burgundy curtains made of heavy velvet lined the entrance to each booth ensuring just a little more privacy for its occupants the music was a low hypnotic beat burrowing its way into the brains of the dancers as they swayed and moved with it the dark room was an alluring den of seduction and peace in a world that seemed to be passing with greater speed in here everything stopped for those few night hours and we were able to stop pretending to be something we were not of course it meant that we had to find a way to live in harmony with each other while within the confines of the bar but even that was a temporary arrangement as bryces death had proved it was nearly midnight and the place was busy the dance floor in the center of the main room was packed with writhing bodies and the booths were filled with others it seemed as if they majority of the lycanthrope and nightwalker population had showed up i hadnt planned to make this a performance for both races but then an audience had never deterred me when something important had to be accomplished and in this case it might prove to be useful tilting my head back toward my right where knox was standing behind my shoulder i asked do you know the group that he spoke of theyre in the booth at the far corner toward the right he replied in a low voice so that no one could hear us over the music that was pumped through the cool air do you seriously know who were looking for without a doubt im just not completely sure of the why at this point but i imagine well know before the night is out i descended the stairs down to the main floor and strolled back to the booth that knox had indicated lycans and vampires both skirted me as i passed through the crowded region everyone knew of bryces death by now everyone would suspect that i was looking for the killer and no one wanted to fall under my searching gaze the booth consisted of two long benches that ran parallel to each other with a low table in the middle it was easy to figure out which one of the three women that sat in the booth was lauren her short blond hair and petite figure made her a relatively close physical match to not only katie but also the image that i picked out of franklins mind she lifted her blue eyes when i blocked the entrance to the booth and she didnt at all look surprised to find me standing there with my fists on my hips so i guess its safe to say that franklin failed in his task she announced drawing some confused looks from her companions no he managed to kill bryce i corrected her bright pink lips twisted into a moue before she coolly corrected my wrong assumption he was supposed to kill you too her companions gasped and started to move as far from her within the booth as possible before encountering me i had wondered if she had worked alone or if any of her companions had helped but their utter shock and horror was easily picked out of their respective minds this plot was laurens alone i shrugged my slim shoulders frowning at her he nearly did but then ive survived worse why do it your life is forfeit for involving the daylight coalition for attempting to kill knox and me why kill bryce and katie because i wouldnt allow her to be reborn you stupid bitch she exploded all her rage suddenly rising to the surface to mar her beautiful face you think thats all if it had been simply not allowing her to be reborn then i would still have katie but that wasnt enough for you you had to have her memory wiped as well bryce took her from me laurens fingers curled into shaking fists and she raised tearglazed eyes to me i was beginning to realize exactly how wrong i had been about this entire situation katie had not been bryces lover but laurens unfortunately lauren was too young to bring a human into our world so she convinced bryce to secretly handle it outside justins knowledge it was common practice to wipe the memory of any human that had been denied access to our world it was too risky to leave them walking around with knowledge of our world in a moment of anger at being rejected they could strike out and talk to many of the wrong people spreading knowledge of the nightwalker and even lycanthrope world i had never considered what would happen to someone who hadnt that intention but truly had a connection with a nightwalker id been with katie since high school he took all her memories of me there was no getting her back she didnt know me didnt remember us she moaned it was all gutwrenchingly clear now lauren had killed katie rather than face what she saw as a horrible eternity without her katie might not have recognized lauren but her appearance was deceivingly sweet and innocent katie wouldnt have hesitated to open the door lauren had gone to the womans house broke her neck from behind so that she would feel no pain then drained her completely dry so that no one else could ever have her blood afterward lauren lovingly arranged her companion on the floor as if she was simply resting sleeping beauty waiting for her lovers kiss to awaken her im sorry i didnt know the situation but i started but rage had finally overtaken laurens grief youre sorry you ruined our lives putting one highheeled foot on the table lauren pushed off the wall and launched herself at me her fingers raised toward my face like claws i tried to sidestep her but hunger and fatigue had made me slow her nails scored four long cuts along my arm and another across my cheek before we crashed through the outer ring of tables still struggling we smashed into the crowd of people on the dance floor there was a cacophony of cries curses and hisses that went up at the collision but we ignored them all as lauren worked to regain her feet her eyes were locked on me still lying on my back i swung my leg around into her knocking her back to the floor i rose faster than her and slammed my fist into her face breaking her jaw before taking a step backward lauren howled in pain but still took another blind swipe at me with her long fingernails in hopes of drawing blood again knox stepped in front of me ready to take over the fight to my surprise another combatant had jumped into the ring and i hadnt even noticed her in the nightclub but then that was amandas special gift she had a special way of fading into the background so that you didnt immediately notice her there it made her all the more dangerous amanda had one fist wrapped in laurens hair pulling her head back so that the long expanse of her neck was exposed her right hand held laurens right arm twisting it behind her body hovering inches from laurens throat amandas fangs were poised to tear it out if i so much as blinked my approval hold i said brushing off my hands this is knoxs fight amanda frowned sheathing her fangs for the moment i knew the look of disappointment there was a truly heartless vicious quality about amanda she reveled in their pain and the violence that our kind was capable of yet it was more than that while knox saw to the nighttonight workings of my domain in many ways amanda was an enforcer for me among the fledglings she saw it as her duty to keep the young ones in line and somehow lauren had slipped by her amanda felt responsible and now she needed to be a part of laurens demise mira please amandas plea came out in a wavering whisper slipping my hands into the front pockets of my jeans i nodded help him clean up i watched as amanda and knox ushered lauren to a hallway toward the back of the nightclub where they would destroy her in the basement as the trio disappeared behind a door adam appeared at my elbow with another nod from me he ushered kari and bridgette from the club there was such a thing as guilt by association in my world while they may have been innocent i simply didnt want to look at them i settled into the back corner of the empty booth and set my crossed feet on the low table as i waited for knox something twisted in my stomach as i listened to laurens screams just under the throbbing beat of the music that had once again started the dancing seemed a little more frenzied as the occupants of the nightclub either enjoyed the rush from her painful end or fought to block out her death with music and dancing our world was a delicate balancing act we held these amazing powers in the palms of our hands but in a moment of carelessness we could lose everything to the humans that surrounded and outnumbered us over the long centuries we created a series of rules and laws that we all had to abide by from fledglings to the elders in the coven but ive seen these rules crush those they were attempting to protect just as frequently as ive seen them save us lauren broke our most sacred rule of never informing a hunter of our existence even if she hadnt attempted to have me killed she would have been dead tonight bishop sat down at the table and handed me a linen tablecloth with a grateful nod i pressed it to the line of claw marks lauren had scored on my right arm he gazed at the assembled crowd a frown teasing at the corners of his mouth didnt quite accomplish what you set out to did you i announced drawing his gaze back to me i can still take you back to venice with me he threatened his dark eyes narrowing on me no you cant id never willingly go but it might have been easier if i had been mentally or emotionally broken by the events here drawing a deep breath i lowered the napkin that was stained with my blood i was sore and tired from the various fights that had filled my night but this one was going to be my most dangerous were you the one to introduce lauren to the daylight coalition member or did you handle that all by yourself i dont know what youre talking about he blandly said of course you do youve been in town for months now watching and listening i know whats happening in my own domain only the urging of someone older and stronger would have gotten a fledgling to actually plot out my death involving justin ravanas family was a nice touch though he never actually contacted the coven did he no bishop finally admitted flashing me a smile full of fangs and menace as he realized that i had figured out his part in this plot to end my existence fledglings are meant to be used and ravana i didnt want to deal with him when i take over your domain which you get if i go back to the coven or simply die bishop lunged across the short distance between us as he drew a small wooden stake out of his pocket i grabbed his wrists but he was bigger and stronger than me and i was already weak from the nights encounterssomething im sure he was counting on the chunk of wood bit through my flesh as he put his entire body weight behind the stake pain lanced through my body as it dug into my chest grinding closer to my heart as i pushed against him a part of me didnt want to kill him i thought i had known bishop but i had been wrong dont do this i cried in a pained voice its too late to plead for your life he said past gritted teeth im not im pleading for yours bishop increased the pressure on the stake so that the tip punctured my heart winning a scream from me closing my eyes i conjured up flames so that they instantly consumed his body i continued to hold his wrists trapping him in the booth with me his screams rose above the music add their own unique chorus to match laurens screams coming from the next room when he was reduced to ash i removed the flames and opened my eyes with a grunt i pulled the stake from my chest and grabbed the napkin to once again stanch the bleeding i looked up in time to see knox crossing the dance floor toward my booth fresh blood was splattered across his clothes and skin knoxs eyes glowed with an almost frightening light as he stepped back onto the main floor dropping the napkin on the table i slowly pushed from my seat and walked toward him meeting him in the center of dance floor energy vibrated from his slender form born from the rush of killing another creature in what i was sure was a brutal death valerio would have taught him well cupping his head with my right hand i stepped close and ran my tongue along his neck and up his jaw drinking in some of laurens blood from where it had sprayed across him a shiver ran the length of his body and his right arm locked around my waist dear god in heaven mira he uttered in a husky voice you cant do that i simply chuckled as we began to sway to the beat of the music his body hardening against mine knox tightly wrapped both arms around me pulling me tight against him as he buried his face in the crook of my neck his fangs scraped the bare tender skin there lifting a sigh from my parted lips the murder was solved and the plot to dispose of me had been unraveled we could relax for a few minutes before the next disaster hit threatening to tear apart our fragile world we could afford this moment to forget about it all as we stood safe in our own sanctuary listening to music that pulsed through and around us did she tell franklin anything else about us i silently asked after a couple minutes nothing his right hand squeezed my waist in what was meant to be a reassuring gesture just the address of where to find bryce and to kill anyone that came to the house that night barrett and the lycanthropes would see to franklin we would need to watch for anyone else during the next few months looking for franklin or any signs that he had sent information to his companions at the daylight coalition we still werent out of the woods but we could see moonlight at the end of this dark journey bishop disposed of after the song ended i pressed a kiss to knoxs cheek and started to pull out of his arms but he stopped me i got a call while you were away looking into katie hixsons murder he began erasing our light moment of relief it was from a contact i have up in cincinnati she said that a hunter rolled into a town a few days ago looking for you by name i asked it was extremely rare for anyone to know me by name outside my own domain most simply referred to me as fire starter any hunter that knew of me would know me by that moniker yes i understood why the call was being made knoxs contact was looking for permission to send the hunter my way and get the person out of that domain a dark grin spread across my face tell your friend to send him my way ill be ready for the hunter two lines melissa mar to j vicki and mark for far more than i can ever say youre the best eavan pushed through the crush of dancers at club red sweatslicked alcoholsaturated prey swayed and gyrated in time with the music pulsing out of a wall of speakers it wasas it had been every other nighttempting but lately eavan had been letting herself be carried away by the crowd enjoying the toobrief touches of strangers neardrunk on the energy on the dance floor but tonight wasnt for indulgence daniel was in the club shed felt it the moment he crossed the threshold felt him in an unacceptable thrum under her skin for reasons she didnt know she could find him in a crowd without looking he was moving through the room a beacon among the waves of swaying bodies in another life she wouldve run away fromor perhaps tohim instead she waited proving to herself that she still held some measure of selfcontrol each time she caught him midcrime she whispered a silent prayer that hed stop poisoning girls that hed become innocuous but hoping and praying were no substitute for actionnot that action was proving particularly effective either trying to singlehandedly rescue the worst of daniels zombies was futile for every one she saved there were a dozen more she couldnt reach he was only a few bodies away from her now tiny electric zings bounced over her skin as she came closer to him he was tempting enough that it hurt and he knows foam poured onto the dance floor as daniel took a fartoohigh girl into his arms and the time for waiting passed away swirling violet and crimson lights gave an ethereal cast to the humans who squealed and writhed around them as the dance floor became a slippery mess a predators banquet the question of which of them was the better predator wasnt one eavan wanted to answer either answer meant she lost daniel glanced back at her and then moved toward a side door with the girl he cut through the crowd with an ease that made him seem other he wasnt though hes just another mortal she had repeated that assertion every night these past six months there was nothing particularly exceptional about him except for the way he provokes me putting a final end to him made good sense but she couldnt be the one to do it there were two steps needed to wake up her maternal heritagesex and death so far shed avoided both but if she did both in the same month shed become a fullblooded glaistig in another few moments hed be out of the club out of reach and the girl would be lost not this time some nights shed lost their quarry many nights she was at the wrong club once in a while she found his prey before daniel could tonight shed decided to step up the confrontation she intercepted daniel and grabbed the hand of the barely conscious girl chastity eavan squealed her name with false excitement an act for the crowd around them she had no clue what the girls real name was it didnt matter all that mattered was that eavan was taking the girl from daniel the two men on either side of him stepped closer if they wanted to there was a good chance that they could take the girl out of reach eavan was banking on daniels dislike of scenes she smiled at him a flash of teeth that animals still understood as aggression she didnt bother glancing at his employees daniel waved them away as usual when she was near he either didnt see her as a true threat or was amused by her efforts she hadnt figured out which it was but she knew that he preferred to be alone with her when he had a chance once the men vanished into the sea of bodies daniel stepped closer to eavan he didnt let go of the girl but he didnt do anything obvious to keep her out of reach either shes with me eve is that what you really want eavan let her conservative habits slip farther away and turned her full attention to daniel it wasnt a hardship to look at him he was a pretty specimen wrapped up in armani and attitude for a few heartbeats he said nothing but he wasnt immune real humans never were shes not meant for my bed i know eavan admitted enjoying his momentary meekness i know your taste daniel unconscious isnt it so tell me little eve what is my taste he came closer still holding the barely standing chastity say it aloud for a change give me that much it was painful to let those tendencies come closer to the surface hungers best left unfed were already omnipresent when he was near eavan sized him up openly caught and held his gaze just long enough to be toobold you look good tonight he smiled then admitting youre tempted ignoring that challenge was hard but eavan had been too close to the edge with him for weeks if she didnt know he was a monster shed want him i do anyhow if she had been thinking clearly she wouldnt be talking to him at all id miss it if she didnt want to stay human shed take him to her bed and kill him tonight i am not a monster she reached out and lifted the girls eyelid to peer into her extremely dilated pupil im taking her with me fine he relinquished his hold on the girl there are dozens more just like her chastity was swaying barely sober and soon to attract attention she was so far gone that eavan wasnt convinced she could be saved anger threatened to surfaceat herself at him at the inability to make a real difference daniel stepped closer invading the bubble of personal space she usually kept between herself and regular humans you need to start saying hello when you arrive at the clubs or say goodbye and come home with me despite her growing angeror maybe because of iteavan enjoyed his aggression something about him made her want to push the rules a bit further made her want to see how close to forbidden she could get without crossing over nice girls dont hunt human girls dont like murder she knew the boundaries she knew she wanted to stay on the right side of them hed be such fun to kill though daniels smile made clear that he sensed her interest even though he undoubtedly read it as merely sexual he was close enough that she could taste scotch on his breath can i give you a lift tonight anywhere you want to go or well call someone for her so we no she moved so the girl was farther out of his reach so she was farther out of reach too glaistigs drank down a mortals last breath hed sweetened his with a peaty scotch im not hunting him we could go to the chaos factory he reached out and ran a finger over her bare midriff tell me what you want eve whats it going to take to get you home with me it would be a bad idea she saidnot a lie but not an answer she stepped backward retreated from him not everything was about dominance shed rescued chastity shed taken the prey from his hands now she needed to get away so well do this another night he leaned in and brushed a kiss over eavans lips unknowingly teasing her with his sweetened mortal breath unless youre planning on running already ill be back she couldnt do otherwise and they both knew it ill be at your clubs and ill find you and then he vanished into the crowd of feverishly dancing mortals it was easy to see why people came willingly to his feet he was everything a man should bedangerous sexy and just eversoslightly aware of it in many cases hed be the alpha predator which is why i want to kill him logic insisted that her macabre fixation on him was basic animal law but it was outside logic to stalk daniel he dealt in magicks that made the other communityat the prompting of eavans own matriarchset a geis a ban forbidding fraternizing with him that ban on contact with daniel was as law for others but eavan wasnt purely other glaistigs were female only each one born of a human father and glaistig mother unless she crossed the two lines into adulthood she was technically mortalwith a few extra traits geasa dont apply to mortals that was her excuse at least not that im going to fraternize with daniel no sex no death i can do this muriel opened the door before eavan could knock she didnt quite scowl at the sight of the mostly unconscious girl in eavans arms her usually welcoming expression vanished but she kept her tone light for me you spoil me im sorry eavan carried the unconscious girl inside the apartment shesi know better i know we talked about iti justdaniel had her and later muriels blue robe was the only color in the black and white room it made it impossible not to stare at her as she closed the door the generous bit of bare skin didnt help matters i had to eavan whispered i know thats the problem isnt it muriel took the girl and carried her into the den as with every other time eavan went to the kitchen and fixed herself a drink she couldnt drink on the hunt but afterward she was shaky enough that she needed a few fingers of whiskey tonight was worse than usual it had been growing worse every time she saw daniel chastity whimpered muriels voice was too muffled to make out the words but the tone made clear that the words were some comforting lie muriel could do that lie at will eavan didnt have that luxury partially fey things could lie sometimes but it wasnt a predictable sometimes after glancing toward the closed door of the den eavan emptied her glass if chastity survived shed be slipping into withdrawal soon if she didnt survive shed still be better off than with daniel girls like chastity went to bidders with sadistic habits that eavan couldnt bear ponderingnot when so many chastitys had been sold already they had no control over their sexuality drugged to the point of being zombies they were reduced to nothing more than sex toys to be used until they were destroyed the beauty of sexuality was something she cherishedand couldnt have to have it sold for base coin was beyond intolerable or muriels right and i just have a fucking savior complex several more ounces of whiskey splashed into the glass or a death wish eavan hated that there wasnt a better answer to the problem but if not for muriel she wouldnt have much of a solution at all muriel drank enough of the girls blood to pull the poisons out if they survived muriel had ways to get them wherever they needed to go next alive and out of reach those were the goals beyond that there were no constants it depended on who chastity really was if she had a home and resources muriel would have one of her coven use those funds to set the girl up in a new city if not muriel would see her to a shelter or halfway house under some pretext or shell put her into the ground there were far too many that ended up dead despite eavans efforts that was how muriel got involved in the first place the vampire had a system for dealing with corpses eavan had needed that system one night and the only other resource shed had for disposal of bodies was her grandmother and asking nyx for such a favor had too high a price muriels willingness to remove the toxins was an added bonusone that gave eavan the ability to try to rescue girls who were much further gone on daniels drugs if not for muriel eavan wouldve been at a crisis months earlier even with muriels help the situation was akin to attempting to hold back a wave with a single hand it was impossible eavan couldnt stop daniel from destroying people she couldnt stop herself from hunting him and she couldnt see any way to avert the disaster that would follow if something didnt change eavan poured a drink for muriel as the petite vampire came into the kitchen well shes alive muriel took the glass and emptied it she swished the whiskey around her mouth and spit it into the sink before adding youre going to have to ante up something clean if youre going to keep asking me to drink all these toxins orshe gave a coquettish grinyou could give me a taste eavan blushed and looked away no you cant really kill me and maybe it doesnt count as sex if its eavan shook her head sex with women is real sex and were not crossing that line casual sex wouldnt be my thing even if youre a glaistig darling of course it would muriel lowered one hand sliding it over the blue silk covering her hip transfixed eavan watchedand then scowled no it wouldnt i dont want casual and you dont do commitments discussion closed really muriel stepped closer much as daniel had earlier and whispered your heart is racing awfully fast for someone who doesnt do casual interest doesnt mean consent eavan forced herself to look at muriels face i can say no ive been saying no for years no sex no death if i tried you tonight truly pushed you could you still say no muriel was gentle but she knew that the answer was liable to be different than it had been before the daniel obsession the more eavan hunted daniel the harder it was control either appetite being mortal means keeping control over centuries a few glaistigs had tried to stay human to not kill to not fuck eavan knew about them from journals and letters nyx had hidden away theyd all failed or were simply killed by their matriarchs culling the weak eavan nyx had stalked her as she lectured and punched her when eavan admitted to seeing the forbidden texts is that what i need to do with you eavan forced away the memory of nyxs fists and said i want to be mortal muriel that doesnt mean refusing both sex and blood ev muriel said just have one to take the edge off too many rules and hangups will be your downfallsooner than later if you keep stalking him if i cant live by my own rules friendship is like a commitment muriel tilted her head and gave eavan her best disarming look eavan laughed at her best friends faux innocence it is but its not enough for me theyd been having the same discussion for several years muriel had a host of partners to her it was like shoe shopping there were many choices for many moods it wasnt an emotional thing or a cruelty thing it did mean though that their occasional boundary pushing stopped short of sex teasing set aside then muriel took the bottle of middleton from the counter the junk brennans peddling ruins even virgin blood virgin as pure as you muriel took two clean glasses added a couple cubes and poured the whiskey eavan shuddered the idea of an innocentespecially one who had her will stolen by daniels zombie mixbeing sold to a sadist was more revolting than normal hes a sick bastard so kill him muriel said a drink in each hand she hopped up on the counter neither drink spilled she kicked her feet in the air like a child on a swing and held out a glass it was hard to remember that muriel was a monster she looked like a handcrafted doll one of those delicate pieces of art that belonged safely on a shelf eavan took the whiskey no im not going to sacrifice myself over him muriel snorted now that the flirting was out of the way she could relax into her less charming habits some sacrificeits not like youd be throwing yourself on a sword evvie no id just be throwing away my humanity humanitys overrated muriel warmed to the old argument shed been other for more than a century now and saw nothing wrong with it humanity means dying humanity meant a lot of things it meant ethics joy in the brevity of life compassionand yes dying dying didnt seem as oppressive as the alternative at least for me muriel wouldnt understand though vampires didnt grow cloven hooves when they stopped being human they didnt have tendrils of hair that writhed like serpents or need to sate not one but two depraved appetites no humanity is wonderful eavan insisted its what i am daniel isnt going to steal mine so maybe you should stop trying to save the girls he gives the zombie powder to muriels voice grew cold somethings going to break ev you keep pushing and hell push back or your family will find out what youre doingyoure walking a foolish path taunting brennan im handling it you think nyx would agree muriel put a hand on eavans wrist your grandmother finds out youre taking risks without any safety nets and shell be livid you need to kill him or back off just a little bit longer muriel i need to find a way to get him to stop i cant just let him sell those girlsi cant eavan leaned her head back on the cabinet behind her putting a bit of artificial distance between her and muriel if nyx comes calling you know i cant cover for you muriels expression was gentle but the words were anything but reassuring i wont i know eavan closed her eyes thinking about her matriarchs reaction was the last thing she wanted to do but it was sobering but until then muriel took her hand away the only sound in the kitchen was the soft slide of feet on the stone floor as muriel walked away eavan didnt follow didnt open her eyes she waited ice clicked together in eavans now empty glass the splash of whiskey followed for now yes muriel whispered but not forever eavan opened her eyes and accepted her glass then muriel added but the next time you go to the club im coming too before eavan could object muriel raised the hand not holding the bottle perfectly tinted nails and understated rings flashed through the air no invitation no help either you hunt or you dont evvie either you persist at this iwanttobemortal nonsense or you accept your heritage this halfassed thing is going to stop but tell me you arent right there at the edge with brennan muriels sweet exterior was gone this was the vampire that had gone toetotoe with nyx and survived her dollpretty exterior was a façade her coquettish charm was a ruse muriel was every breath the monster nyx was tell me evvie and well discuss it further eavan wanted to argue but there wasnt anything that she could say without lying no more club trips without you ill stand by you if you want to be mortal ill help you if you want to be glaistig muriels more familiar kinder expression returned she widened her blue eyes in a pleading way i just dont want to see you regret whichever it is because you were being foolish if i stop what happens to the next chastity eavan didnt bother saying that though muriel wouldnt be swayed by that concern any more than nyx would family first that was how the others thought and mortals werent family cillian walked toward dorothea dix hospital on his nightly mindclearing stroll hed spent the past several hours going over his file but still had no clue how to get closer to brennan or how he got the unknown powder he cut his coke with whatever the silvery talcumlike material was it wasnt matching anything on the periodic table or the existing databases at the crypto drug administration the drug was appearing in other areas around the country and brennan was the closest thing to a source that the cda had found the i and i intersection tended like many such interstate crossings to be a drugheavy region durham had a definite heroin business volumes of marijuana and cocaine slid through but those werent issues for the cda crypto drugs dealt exclusively in the chemicals that utilized or targeted the others that hid in mortal society brennans powder was an anomaly even in an organization established around coping with the unusual the cda didnt like anomalies or lack of results no one in brennans immediate circle seemed approachable none of the victims was around long enough to be of use the only one who seemed like a potential in was one woman brennan kept circling but she seemed to be stalking the drug dealer when he wasnt stalking her so i stalk the stalkers cillian thought about the darkhaired girl eve hed stared at her picture frequently enough that hed begun to feel like a perv he wanted her not to be a victim or a criminal but he couldnt find any evidence to suggest which she was or any logical way she wasnt one of the two nice girls dont flirt with drug dealers nice girls dont spend inordinate amounts of time at strip clubs he was pretty sure of thatexcept everything else he could find on eavan made her seem like a nice girl she worked at her jobs for short periods but her employment records were all flattering she was average modest clothes nondescript reading habits no odd purchases not a single unexplained trip in sum there wasnt anything at all that would flag her as criminal still thinking about eve he let himself into the apartment hed rented just inside the door he stopped a creamcolored envelope sat propped up against a book on his kitchen table no one knew he lived here other than his supervisors and they werent the sort of people to leave notes with calligraphic lettering on his table a quick search of the tiny apartment revealed that he was alone after donning a pair of gloves he carefully opened the letter mr owens if youd like to resolve the db problem youre having contact me nyx under it was an address in the historic district and a meeting time that was just late enough to be private several hours later cillian parked up the block from the address on the note he glanced again at the sheet of lilac paper sealed in the bag on his passenger seat as he cut off the engine the paper the calligraphic writing the lavender scent on the paperit wasnt covert it didnt seem apropos of intrigue at least not any sort im used to prior to this assignment hed worked in the research and cleanup divisions of the cda he closed the car door quietly and made his way up the flagstone path a woman sat on the front porch she looked to be in her thirties at most she was stern eyes too flat smile too calculating everything about her was predatory in the true sense of the word whispers of caution rose from that instinctual part of the mind walk carefully mind the escape routes mr owens so nice of you to visit nyx his voice was steadier than his emotions hed walked into altercations that resulted in hospital visits but this beautiful polite southern woman in a semipublic location was setting off the same sort of alarms usually reserved for the truly unsavory what is she come nyx patted the swing beside her then she reached over to a crystal decanter sitting on a side table whiskey no thanks its not poisoned dear she smiled a courtesans smile poison isnt a method i prefer too distant cillian paused midstep and looked around the porch and azaleas that lined the front of it there were no other people he could see nothing that looked dangerous except nyx hed learned before his first year with the cda that criminals didnt all look dangerous usually though they werent this odd combination of ballsy blunt and beautiful is there another method i should be watching for she laughed and poured herself a drink sit down mr owens the neighbors neednt see you looking at me so cautiously theyre used to my business but discretion is always wiseespecially in your business he sat next to her but not so close that he couldnt reach his gun im not sure what you think you know ms nyx she sipped her drink and smiled its just nyx if not for the fear he felt as he sat beside her hed find her attractive she was all curves and muscles and none of it hidden thick dark hair fell around her like a cloak she was nearnaked from the waist up clad in a sheer top over bare skin dark aureoles and pert nipples more than visible not an inch of flesh was bared below the waist a long skirt and boots hid her legs why hide the rest of i see the temptation in your expression nyx said softly trust me mr owens youre much better off not following those thoughts to completion he was here on business ogling someone he might have to kill was bad form he forced himself to hold her gaze and nyx smiled then her posture hadnt changed her spine was arrowstraight making her very notsagging breasts im not like this he felt positively amoral his libido was healthy enough but he didnt mix business and recreation im not going to start either he caught and held her gaze like being held in the gaze of the snakes in the reptile housewithout the safety of the glass what do you want he asked she handed him a picture this is eavan eve cillian kept his face blank and the girl my cousin eavan is getting mixed up with a man id rather she didnt youre stalking him so i thought we might help each other nyx folded her legs up on the swing angling her body so she was facing him id rather daniel brennan die i find himunpleasant but evvie would be cross with me if i killed him do you often murder people you find unpleasant the words were out before he could think better of them despite looking like an ingénue nyx spoke with a callousness that made cillian certain that the woman beside him was indeed capable of murder nyx laughed i think well both be happier if you dont ask too many questions like that cillian i know who you are i know about the cda and i know that mr brennan is a person of interest to your organization she lifted a folder from the floor and extended it to him heres a list of others you might want to investigate she held it there while he reeled from how casually she listed top security clearance cda information cillian reached out and took the folder do you have any idea what sort of trouble youd be in were talking about treason she waved away his remark with a flick of her wrist your government isnt a concern of mine i know what i know and youll not let anyone find out about me do you think that there arent people who would erase the entirety of your organization if they realized that your superiors know aboutpeople that treasure privacy history is filled with stories of strange groups of people secret societies if you will vanishing your sort exist only because weve yet to decide how much of a threat you might be i believe you can be harnessed and made useful i need my cousin looked after and you are getting nowhere with mr brennan its a simple business exchange she ran a finger absently through the beads of sweat sliding down her glass and licked a droplet from her fingertip before adding im trusting you mr owens in seven years for the cda hed never experienced anything quite as surreal as this meeting admitting that he understood that she was other was a breach of several papers hed signed under strictest security shes not human shes just admitted as much that didnt mean he could admit it though he tucked away the questions he wanted answered and focused on the issues he could address a single phone call and youll be in jail or worse for the rest of your life you cant summon a government agent to your house and just he shook his head i trust you because if you expose me or reveal the other unusual things you learn by accepting my offer ill kill you your sister in miami your nephew in chicagoand your dear sweet father inshe paused and tilted her headwhere was it phoenix i believe cillian had his hand on his mm before she was halfway through the threat lower your hand boy he did not by choice but he lowered his hand as obediently as the women addicted to brennans drugs he couldnt disobey wha who are you nyx sighed the answers to that dont matter to you today what you need to know right now is that neither younor your loved oneswould stand a chance if i asked you to obey meand no you may not ask why just now put your hands out here where i can see them when he did so she nodded placidly as if hed hadnt been seconds away from trying to shoot herand he couldnt force the questions of how and why from his lips i can be a great ally you want to stop brennans drugs i have reasons to want you to succeed at that nyx said cillian opened the folder and glanced at the sheets inside charts account numbers passwords maps key codes names aliasesit was far more information than hed seen on brennan after months of workups and considerably more detailed than anything hed gathered in the six weeks hed been in raleigh nyx pinched it closed you mustnt tell evvie that you know me im hiring you as her bodyguard as far as she knowswell will know nyxs mouth curved in a wry expression evvie will object shell attempt to evade you shellbe difficult ill need to talk to my supervisors talk to them so they can verify the value of that databut i am an anonymous source she stood up and stretched her arms over her head making her sheer top lift up and expose her bare stomach this time though cillian wasnt even slightly tempted or what he asked she laughed a husky bedroom sound that made him swallow hard despite his utter distaste or ill slaughter everyone who sees this data he stood and faced her still holding the folder it was foolish but he had to say it youre not human she put her hand on the folder pressing it against his chest leaned in and kissed his cheek if youre interested in my help take the folder and be here tomorrow at seven sharp to be introduced to my cousin as her new bodyguard if not leave the folder and walk away ill give you an out this once she kept her hand on the folder holding it between them as she invaded his space if you accept my offer please do understand that im quite serious about the terms of our contract then she turned and left cillian sat silently in the dark for several minutes debating the consequences of both actions if he took the folder hed have resources the cda needed resources that would enable him to do his job better if he left it behind he assured his familys safety of course they were only endangered if he couldnt keep silent that wasnt an issue the things cillian had learned in his job werent things he shared with his family this was no different if nyx was honest he and his loved ones were endangered only by violating her privacy if she wasnt honest they were already in danger either way taking the folder didnt change anything critical all it really meant was that he was becoming personally involved in the world of the others which has been inevitable since i took the damn job hed expected his overt knowledge of the nothumans to come through official routes but hed still expected it from the beginning what difference does it make he took the folder and walked away now he just needed to figure out what to tell his supervisorsand protect a woman who was some sort of other and if he was lucky stop daniel brennan all told he was more excited about his job than hed been in months eavan hated family meetings with a passion she reserved foractually a passion she reserved for family meetings she stood in the street staring at her home and trying not to fall under the sway of the neighborhood oakwood was a little bit of heavenhouses that werent prefab monstrosities people who sunk their roots into their city a community whose collective energy made this part of the city something pure her family always lived in such areas unlike the subdivisions that cropped up everywhere oakwood and its neighboring mordecai had personalities histories and dark whispers more than a few of those whispers were tied to the women in eavans family sometimes an unfaithful husband vanished once in a while a wayward family member returned home meek and eager to be forgiven drug traffic never took hold in the several blocks surrounding their home no one in their immediate area was ever robbed of course no one would speak directly about the belief that nyxs influence was what kept them safe in home and family secrets were all the more poignant for the fact that they were openly known but never spoken it was enough to keep the neighbors from looking too closely at the family if they truly knew would they still look away the neighbors might murmur about them being fancy women and the scandal of women owning strip clubs but they didnt pursue their talk beyond the occasional and quickly silenced remark they didnt speculate aloud at the familys methods of keeping peace there were no titillating rumors voiced about the beautiful murderesses who lived inside the modest house eavans family was a clan of true glaistigs they devoured people they were many mensand a fair number of womensdarkest fantasy but sometimes with a steep price they didnt kill many but they did kill glaistigs swallowed the last breath of mortals or strangled them preferably during sex monsters she walked around to the back of the house it was part of the routine shed clung to in order to keep herself from believing the façade routines were her anchor innumerable little tricks to keep from believing in illusions to create her own illusion of normalcy going through the front door the door for guests was walking into the illusion the truth was what kept her from surrendering to the role her family wanted for her this is not what i am steeling herself for the sensory shock she pushed open the door she wasnt but a step inside the room when mother chloe appeared in front of her uncharacteristically her legs were hidden away there must be guests even now no one in her family seemed able to keep her chest stomach or arms covered given a choice theyd roam in lingerie eavan straightened the sleeves of her suit jacket i am not like them shed worked hard to cultivate a modest streak and had gone a bit overboard lately with being so close to the edge no one else at the office dressed as conservatively as she did even the senior marketing consultants looked at her oddly she stood silently for her birthmothers inspection they were always like this greeting her at the threshold and assessing her like a stray dog returned to the pack chloe glanced at eavans stockingcovered calves approvingly she smileduntil she looked up and saw eavans tightly wound bun well that certainly sets a mood doesnt it you asked me to let it grow again eavan reminded she sat her briefcase at the front door and slipped off her pumps i dont understand you chloe walked away her boots striking the tile floor in a regular rhythm sounding out the familiar cadence bringing to mind memories of a lifetime of late night music sessions chloe insisted on wearing boots that would resonate on the floor as her own cloven feet would she liked music even that made of her own movement despite her irritation eavan smiled at the sound for years when shed lived in the house shed been happy things had made sense but back then shed known little of what shed one day become it wasnt until she was a teenager that she understood the parties the musicians and the strange cries her motherfamily glaistigs all fed on acts of sex and death it was essential that they feed it kept them alive eavan understood itbut understanding didnt equate to wanting to be like them far better to live a mortal lifespan and die naturally than to transform into a monster chloe paused and stamped her foot evvie come now your grandmother isnt feeling patient tonight is she ever chloe scowled shes far more patient with you than i would be yes mother chloe i do realize that eavan followed her mother into the sitting room where the rest of the family would be waiting of course calling it a sitting room was a bit of a kindness it was something between a bawdy house and the results of a victorian decorator on acid aunt nene had her foot propped on an honesttogoddess stuffed elephant foot that was fashioned into an ottoman gold tassels dangled from the cushion atop the atrocity all around the room floral patterns clashed with one another giltframed art cluttered walls and shelves dressing tables that had no place in a front room were scattered about like the desks in an untidy classroom on each table eavan could see a jumble of silver hand mirrors ivory combs feathered hair barrettes and crystal bottles of perfume with elaborate atomizers and her family satin dishabilleon overly plush divans in the center like a queen holding court was nyx eavans grandmother and matriarch her judge and torturer nyx held herself regally watching with serpentcold eyes eavan it wasnt a warm welcome but no one there thought eavan deserved nyxs warmth even me ever since eavan had told nyx she wasnt moving home after college things had been more strained glaistigs didnt live away from the clan it simply wasnt done of course no other glaistig clan would be foolish enough to challenge nyxs decision to violate tradition by allowing eavan a touch of freedom the same cruelty that had left scars on eavans back allowed nyx to defy tradition now crossing nyx was painful more often than not beautiful monsters my family the three of them looked like sisters like her sisters they appeared to be only a couple of years older than eavanwrinklefree lustrous hair bodies as sculpted as professional dancers in high school her guardians had incited equal parts envy and curiosity when they attended school events in college people assumed they were her sorority sisters or asked if she was part of a modeling agency luckily they hadnt visited her en masse at the office yet their unchanging nature would eventually elicit too many questions as will my own eavan wasnt sure when itd started bothering her but it irritated her more and moretheir immutable nature her own nowunchanging body for now choosing mortality meant eavan would eventually age and die shed age more slowly than mortals but it would still happen glaistigs didnt they brought death but didnt suffer from it what are you wearing its sonene fluttered her hands around as she took in eavans skirt which reached just below the kneeopaque its wool eavan leaned down and kissed her aunts cheek they might be monsters but they were still her family just like ive worn to every other meeting i mustve repressed it nene sniffed like the rest of the women with her gauzy camisole and thick tumble of hair nene looked as if she were awaiting clientele not expecting a visit from the girl theyd collectively raised as their daughter you know what this place needs is a stripper pole the words were out before eavan could stop herself but no one flinched eavan could say whatever came to mind here home wasnt where eavan wanted to be but she couldnt deny how right it still felt to be there glaistigs were clan creatures and although eavan was clinging fiercely to her humanity she was still part of the clan a pole would fit right in she added just like at your clubs grandmother nyx nodded i was just saying that wasnt i chloe handed eavan a brush before answering shes joking mama nyx shrugged lifting one delicate shoulder in a graceful move that belied her centuries it matters little shes right for a change eavan smothered a laugh nyx knew that eavan had been only partially joking it would fit in and theyd enjoy having it here sometimes when all the rest was set aside eavan suspected that nyx was the only one who truly understood her the older glaistig didnt approve of eavans urge to live as a mortal but she understood the impulse to forge new rules following a path simply because it had always been done that way wouldnt make sense to nyx of course neither would chastity eavan sat on the back of the sofa perched behind her grandmother and began unplaiting the womans thick rope of hair the tendrils were like living things in eavans hands as if night had taken solid form you look lovely grandmama of course nyx stretched muscles that shouldnt exist rippled under her wrinkleless skin the strength in those muscles would make it a simple thing to crush eavans throatand no one would stop her eavan learned that lesson years ago when she stood up to nyx the first time and a dozen times since nyx wasnt callous no more so than anyone else in the house but she was in charge forgetting that was unwise bring him in nyx said the tension in eavans body rose she paused a heartbeat longer him grandmama what have you youve stopped brushing eavan i dont like that dutifully eavan resumed the measured strokes gripping the olivewood handle pulling the tufts of boar bristles through the thick tresses keeping her eyes on her taskand not looking at the man whod entered the room like a lamb to slaughter ive checked all the windows he said by way of greeting lovely nyx rolled her shoulders keeping brushing eavan yes nyx eavan stayed in her increasingly uncomfortable position on the back of the sofa where nyx was seated she didnt look up at him if nyx had brought him here had insisted eavan meet him he was dangerous his voice alone a deep growling bass was proof of that temptation eavan knew her family wasnt above underhanded tricks treachery was their first instinct perhaps its not that she knew better though nyx didnt rule one of the strongest clans of glaistigs by accepting defeat ever the windows arent secure at all the man added a screwdriver and right so well replace those nene nyx made an imperious motion here nene held out a blank check fix whatever needs fixing our homes security is very important mr owens chloe said its cillian maam he corrected eavan paused at the change in timber of his voice he also sounded almost as assertive as nyx when eavan looked up her fears were confirmed he was perfect a visual feast lean confident and seemingly unintimidated by the nest of vipers he was in his instincts should be telling him to flee or to bow before nyx he did neither he stood there as if oblivious to her charm to all of their allure eavan couldnt help but stare just as nyx undoubtedly expected he was fit without being bulky muscular and toned if not for his almost pouty lips his face would be too stern as it was he looked just this side of fiercenot easily daunted or foolishly aggressive it made her want to see what it took to provoke him i am above this i am stronger than instinct the older glaistig looked back and caught eavans gaze a guilty blush burned on eavans face nyxs posture hadnt changed but she had her confirmation eavan was intrigued too much so the man made a note as he said ill have one of my associates drop by to go over the literature on the different options for replacing the windows whatever really my cousins safety is really the difficult thing mr owens as i said thats why i needed you here today nyx caught eavans hand and tugged so that their clasped hands were resting just over her collarbone eavan doesnt seem to understand how dangerous refusing to stay with the rest of the family is a young girl in the difficult world all alone is she in some sort of danger maam inevitably shes foolish you know nyx squeezed eavans hand until tears threatened i worry so over her beautiful wealthyand with the things i see in the newsdid you know there were shootings just up the street from her flat eavan blinked the tears away her voice was clear though as she said im not moving home no matter whathappens ill accept that nyx said mildly in fact ive hired mr owenss firm for that very reason ive taken a lease on the vacant flat across from yours i dont think or you can move home nyx looked back at eavan you have choices prove to me that you can do as youre told or return to the fold where i can look after you ill not have you die to prove a point nyx eavan pleaded please nyx turned away i want to apologize for making you stay in eavans dismal building mr owens how anyone could want a tiny little nest in some ugly modern thingits appalling nyxs reply couldnt have held more vitriol she sighed melodramatically before adding nene and chloe will go over the other details with you eavan and i have things to discuss in private before you two leave and with that nyx dismissed him and nene and chloe were at his sides almost instantly to assure that he was removed from the room nyx spoke and the world obeyed except me tell me about your associates mr owens chloe murmured as she trailed fingertips over his stomach chloe nyx curled her mouth into snarl not acceptable yes nyx chastened chloe ducked her head and hurried the man out of the room eavan repressed a shiver as everyone left her behind not that witnesses would matter eavan stood wordless she walked over to place the brush on one of the vanities nyx pulled the dark spill of hair over her shoulder where it coiled into a rope that wouldve made rapunzel jealous she turned her gaze to eavan do you think its easy for me to think of you vulnerable to the dangers of the world i dont have a choice do i id rather you didnt die id rather no one died eavan said sometimes death is necessary nyx made a fluttering gesture with her hand as if to shoo away an insect yours is not one id like eavan bowed her head shed lost shed lost months ago but simply hadnt known it yet nyx had concocted some story hired a bodyguard and effectively entrapped eavan shed been sentenced to spending her time around a tempting mortal how am i to do anything about daniel now eavan wasnt about to admit that shed been hunting the drug dealer nyx was always surly over dealers she liked her strip clubs well enough but refused to allow any drugs in her clubs unlike daniel hes pretty eavan turned to stare at her grandmother what the man hes pretty the type you try not to look at nyx stretched her legs out on the divan i notice child ive been noticing for years eavan didnt dare turn her back on nyx so she settled for a shrug nyx laughed sounding joyous as she often did after long days of partying im not like you grandmama i wont be eavans mouth was dry itd been months since nyx struck her but the possibility was always there putting him in my path doesnt change that youre wasting money hiring him to protect me i havent forgotten how difficult that first time is sweetie nyx held out a hand eavan went to her she took her grandmothers hand as she sat at the womans feet centuries of experience hid under nyxs flawless skin im not going to do it eavan whispered you will with her free hand nyx pulled the pin from eavans bun itd been only a week since itd been cut but it was already past her shoulders nyx ran her fingers through it loosening the strands so they drifted freely youll hunt youll fuck youll kill im not like you nyx squeezed her handgently this time youre a glaistig love youre exactly like me im not a murderer its the natural order of the world nyx smiled indulgently the higher beasts eat the lower do they get upset over eating other animals the predators thin the herd taking away the diseased or aberrant or weak its natural its not humans do it kill animals raise them like pets and butcher themour way is far more humane at least we dont wear their hides for garments were far more civilized eavan looked at nyxs handsewn leather boots they were butter soft custom made of the eel leather nyx preferred these days and if they were able to be crafted into clothing you liked no nyx ran her fingertips over a boot mortal skin isnt as silkyplus its just gauche gauche eavan asked and a stripper pole in the parlor practical nyx said if you are so sure you can be a mortal heres your test prove to me that you dont have the same lusts we all do if not he seems a good sort to keep around for at least one of your appetites we picked him especially for you eavan sighed sometimes i really hate you i know dear nyx stood and pulled eavan into a hug its one of the reasons i respect you lets go find your new temptation as if i need another one resisting hunting daniel was using up all her selfcontrol resisting another entanglement was the last thing she needed maybe hes a borea girl can dream right cillian waited outside in the overgrown yard behind the house if he didnt know better hed think it was left to grow wild but like everything the truth was in the details there were plants in this yard that he hadnt seen anywhere else in the triangle area ones that wouldnt flourish even in the raleigh humidity without attention the illusion was one of disorder but the truth was that this was cultivated fecundity his current job depended on his noticing minutiae on seeing past the lies people wove and on creating his own illusions those were the skills that would help him pretend to know nothing about eavan despite the hours theyd be forced together mr owens nyx stood on the back porch maam he turned to face her nyx paused as eavan kissed her cheeks then she turned her attention on cillian youll keep her safe ill do my best to not let anyone harm her he said it was the best he could offer especially as he had no idea who or what eavan was was brennan human that information was the sort of thing that the cda was never privy to but it did make a difference the first time cillian had had his ribs broken he learned exactly how much it could matter eavan took a step backward im not that fragile youre more fragile than you should be evvie for a strange moment nyx was the one who looked truly vulnerable her thus far implacable calm vanished she licked her lips anxiously youll let him teach you what you need youll be careful hes good at what he doesand the things youi picked him for reasons you nyx eavan backed down the porch stairs and looked up at nyx im not actually in any danger you and i both know that hiring himeavan glanced at cillianis a control tactic it wont change anything but you dont have to pretend its a legitimate bodyguard situation nyx lashed out with a closed fist eavan gripped the banister in front of her to keep from stumbling blood slid down her chin from a cut lip cillian started forward stay out of it nyx didnt even look his way her attention and her next words were for eavan youll let mr owens guard you as carefully as if there were hellhounds pursuing you eavan or youll move into this house i make the decisions in this family and this one is not negotiable eavan stood motionless staring at her cousin as the blood dripped from her mouth they both had all of the affect of statues dont challenge me eavan the consequences would be very unpleasant nyxs hair seemed to move of its own accord the dark tendrils twitched like restless serpents around her shoulders cillian stood there awkwardly he wasnt sure either of them should be trusted but instinct told him that there was a threat to eavan whether she was inside the house or on her own it shouldnt matter as much as it did but he had a longtime habit of cheering the underdog am i understood eavan nyx asked finally eavan bowed her head you are but ill prove that i dontneed him i almost wish you were right evvie nyx murmured then before anyone could say another word she spun on her heel and stepped back inside the house she didnt close the door instead she left it open so they could watch her walk away swinging her hips like an invitation her footsteps echoed as she went into the room a heartbeat rhythm beat out by her sharp heels and cillian couldnt look away seeing nyx go made him feel like he was losing somethingeven though she made his skin crawl are you all right eavans voice drew his attention from the open door are you ill be better once im out of here she dropped her shoes to the ground and slipped her feet into them then she pulled out a tissue and wiped the blood from her face he started down the walk but stopped when he realized that she hadnt moved why did you take the job mr owens she watched him as she twisted her hair back into a tight coil everything in her posture screamed challenge it made him want to refuse any answer which works out well he couldnt tell her anything its what i do right now he didnt lie not really watching her was his job his supervisors were very clear that he should accept the terms of his anonymous sources offerincluding guarding eavan guard people against nonexistent enemies she almost smiled and the change was remarkable she was every bit as tempting as the beautiful monster that had hiredblackmailed manipulated him and based on her family and her association with brennan she was also likely to be just as deadly he tamped down the softness he was feeling when hed watched her face off with nyx nyx seems certain youre in danger he said nyx is sure im in danger every time im not in her direct line of sight eavan shook her head if you wanted to simply say you guard me but not she hired me to watch you ill watch you he tried a falsely friendly smile theyd do better if they were at least civil to each other you could make that easier on both of us if you answered questions sure ill answer what you need to know to do the job nyx hired you for she smiled again not full of promises like the women inside but with barely curved lips it was a dismissal and in case he missed the message she turned and walked down the flagstone path yeah this is going to be a cakewalk he snorted and followed her before she had taken a halfdozen steps down the end of the walk he was in front of her guarding you means you dont go wandering off im not an errant child mr owens i drove here on my own i go to and from work every day on my own i go no you used to ill be escorting you to and from everything for the time being hed hoped that nyx had explained the extent of his role in eavans life but if she did eavan wasnt cooperating to be sure there was no confusion he added nyx was adamant about that part of my services ill be accompanying you everywhere you go every time you leave your apartment for any reason its why she rented the apartment that way ill be within reach the moment you step outside your door eavan made a frustrated sound what if you have other things to do we can come up with a schedule that eavan he waited until she looked at him and then said this is my job if im not able to keep up with your schedule ill call one of my associates but i suspect i can keep up this is going to be a pain in the ass isnt it she yanked open the passenger door of her z and dropped her briefcase on the seat you wont need that he didnt wince as he said it but he did draw a deep breath bracing himself for the next snarl that was sure to follow his clarification well leave it here to be picked up later she looked over her shoulder exactly what is it that i wont need mr owens the car well take mine he gestured at his car a nondescript black sedan that looked like the same sort innumerable car services and middleclass businessmen drove it blended eavans topaz blue bmw didnt you wont need yours for a while i wont need my car her hands were on her hips her lips were pressed together in a tight line look im not your enemy i was hired to keep you safeor out of troubleor maybe just drive you crazy so you move back home you can go back in there and talk to her or you can cooperate he wondered briefly if eavan had the same ability to hypnotize him as nyx apparently had if he tried to restrain her could she control him as nyx had done when hed pulled his gun he needed more answers than he had you need to accept that im like your shadow now you arent going anywhere without me if thats going to be an issue go talk to nyx while were still standing here eavans answer was a string of expletives and a glare at the closecurtained windows of her familys house talking to nyx wont change a thing it rarely does he nodded once okay then so do you want to eat while we go over your schedule or go to your apartment cillian felt a touch sorry for her it wasnt an easy position she was innot that his was much better now that cillian had sent the data in to his supervisor and been told to work withfor his anonymous source he had more than a few questions for nyx he just needed to get eavan tucked into her apartment so he could go ask a few of those questions its your choice he added we could go downtown and grab a bite or food first she interrupted fat daddys she slid into his car slammed the door and stared out the window right then he muttered as he walked around and opened his door this should be great fun late that night eavan slipped out of her apartment window she wasnt sure if she could get out the front door without cillian noticing odds were that he wasnt staring at her door but she wasnt sure about video feeds hed mentioned surveillance in the hallway the breezeway the parking deck and the back lot safer to slip out the window the drop wasnt that far she might be predominantly mortaland intending to stay that waybut her genetic heritage still came with a few extra benefits after a surreptitious glance to assure that no neighbors were out on their balconies she hopped up on the balcony rail so she had her back to her apartment and dropped down the impact of the landing was muffled by the grasscovered ground no one the wiser with a satisfied smile she crossed the lot and opened her car door it was good that her z was home instead of still at nyxs but when eavan thought about strangers driving her car it felt more like injury than insult she hated the fact that hed had some stranger drive her car home she slid her hand over the wheel affectionately she left her car door slightly open put it in neutral and coasted to the bottom of the hill once she hit the intersection she slammed the door and popped the clutch the squeal of tires and almostbutnotquiteoutofcontrol swerve as she slammed through the gears was exhilarating driving was one of the passions she could indulge no sex no murder no stalking okay a little stalking but no killing anyone a woman needed releases for pentup energy and there was only so much workouts and toys could do to let off stress sometimes speed was essential to sanity on this at least nyx had always been tolerant she had reduced rates on a number of vices for the local police in exchange for looking the other way on eavans driving habits it had started as a sixteenth birthday present and evolved into status quo over the last eight years eavan could navigate the streets of raleigh and durham and a number of cities within a fourhour radius having the i corridor i and i all but at her doorstep meant that her penchant for speed was easily indulged finding a mechanic who disabled nyxs gps tracking toys regularly added a layer of privacy the past two years that had made eavan feel almost like a normal woman not now not with cillian holding a leash eavan made her way to the beltline and just drove for a while before she headed downtown it helped but the anxiety was still riding her she took a few side streets turning at the last possible moment each time focusing on the importance of control and precision its not going to change a thing i am not going to change how i live this could be a shortterm problem a test to be passed or failed that was the real problem eavan felt herself getting closer and closer to crossing lines that she swore shed never approach this business with daniel had become an obsession it needed to end so that she could regain control of her life it made control of both appetites feel precarious if she could scare him away from the drug trade or find some information to get him arrested maybe she could stop hunting himbecause she was hunting him she knew it even if she wouldnt admit it to anyone else and she needed to get it in check before nyx found out eavan parked the car down by moore square and headed toward one of daniels warehouses it wasnt any trouble to let herself inside the warehouse shed lifted a key one night flirting with daniel softsoled shoes muffled her steps as she crossed the concrete floor this was what she did who she was every instinct shed had told her that she was where she should beexcept the ones that told her that naked with cillian was a better plan equally unhealthy urges she could control them though shed been doing so for twelve years a glaistigs dual needs for sex and deathpreferably togethercoincided with the onset of menses it had taken her six years to learn to smother those urges until they were just a whisper shed slipped and hunted a few times but shed never killed or fucked anyone shed walked away from every hunt before it became an obsession until now now both of eavans urges were screaming to life the smart move was to stay away from daniel to stay out of his clubs something there made all of her family uncomfortableand made eavan feel like electricity was battering all her synapses simultaneously that sensation had never been quite as allconsuming as it was right now because hes near me she stood in the shadowed recesses of a room half hidden by towering shelves peering between the wooden crates that were stacked at the end of the aisle of shelves in front of her in a bare bit of concrete in the center of a darkened warehouse stood danielher prey he wasnt other but he was tangling with things that made him resonate like he was more than mortal she could feel it what are you doing there was more to her reaction to him than the actions hed undertaken the taint of the magicks he used wasnt enough to explain her compulsion where he was concerned but she had no other explanation she did however know she couldnt ignore what he was doing drugging women and selling them like chattel was inexcusable he needs to be stopped the was heavy in her palm before she realized shed reached into her bag the stainless steel vein down the back of the grip didnt burn her hands or weaken her as it would if she were truly a full glaistig with her mortal blood still dominant iron and steel barely gave her a twinge instead the gun felt right in her hands the desire to sight down on the tainted mortal was a compulsion inside that grew from a whisper to a roar as she watched daniel ground the childs bones into powder it was an odd sight he stood in a business suit at a table alongside an averagelooking barbecue grill on the grill were bones a childsize skull and several small lizards on the table were assorted plants an empty mixing bowl a glass jar of what looked to be blood and a modern electric meat grinder daniel was barefoot in a pile of earth that seemed more out of place than all the rest muttering something and gesticulating he lifted the skull from the grill then he raised a large hammer closed his eyes said something in what she suspected was to be a reverent way and smashed the hammer onto the tiny skull until it cracked shards of bone lay scattered in the earth what do you want he didnt look at her when he said it so for a moment she thought he was talking to someone else she wondered if he could find her in that unerring way she had with him they were bound together in a way that made no sense to her is it the magick is it because im hunting him something existed between them and she wasnt sure what it wasor if she really wanted to know eve he tossed the hammer aside and began picking up the bone shards once they were all gathered he turned to stare directly at her what are you doing here i she didnt have words for what she wanted not words she wanted to share she wanted to kill him wanted to reorder the world press down the chaos that buzzed in her skin before she crossed a line that would change everything she wanted to end her hunt of daniel with something bloody and satisfying she settled for a socially acceptable statement what youre doing is wrong he was utterly nonplussed praying thats not praying sure it is its just an older religion an older religion all faiths had a place but humans like daniel were the reason mainstream humanity thought old faiths were evil he was using the veneer of religion to sate his greed what will you do with it she heard herself asking as if his admission to her would change anything she knew exactly what he did with his poison drugged people addicted them and sold them he dropped the bone fragments into the grinder the whirring noise seemed loud in the empty room how about i make you a deal she felt like her skin was crawling with stinging things as she stepped toward him she wanted to go to him despite everything what are you offering he was a bastard he preyed on the innocent he used earth and bone to enslave people not as punishment but randomly for avarice and malice he lifted the corner of his mouth is a sardonic half smile for starters drop that piece in your hand then tell me what you want from me she glanced at the she hadnt realized she had raised it she lowered it with effort her arm hung at her side but her finger still rested on the trigger did i take off the safety too she wasnt sure but she suspected she had the habitual movement wouldve preceded raising her weapon i want you to stop mixing that she told him the look he gave her was curious and if i dont are you going to stop visiting me stop stealing my toys she had an intense craving to show him exactly what would happen if he didnt stop why this one was different she didnt know but in that instant she wanted to let her other heritage reign sex and death the room was already filled with death her body was screaming for sex if she had both on the same night shed become just like the rest of her familylike nyx wanted like her mother wanted shed have eternity steal the lives of mortals enjoy those dual pleasures and shed be stronger faster live for centuries she swallowed against the dryness in her mouth and said please please what daniel gave her that same tempting smile hed offered in the clubs so often i dont like them mindless eve no medicine for you arent you tired of provoking me its been fun to have someone try to thwart me ballsy i like it let me give you what you want her hand tightened until the ridges on the grip pressed into her skin her tongue was slow in her mouth as she told him you cant are you sure daniel stood there with a jar of blood in one hand and the stuff of death all around him you see what i am but youre not disgusted are you come closer and in that instant she wanted to swallow his final breath more than anything shed ever wanted she reached out her other hand to touch him but stopped short of actual contact you dont want to give me what i want daniel trust me please if you have anything good in you change your path stop making these drugs for everyone and then she ran away from temptation away from the room of death and blood and bone she was a mortal she could walk away shed chosen humanity she just needed to keep choosing it eavan went to her car and began one of her tried and true reordering plans absently she drove out to chapel hill there was the first stop step one routine it was a strange loop shed adopted when she was a studentlike walking her perimeters demarcating territories like an animal no she reminded herself proving that i am not an animal it made her feel more focused i am not a monster at unc she measured her steps pacing them out just so as she crossed campus to reach the courtyard outside davis library that bricked vista felt reassuringline after line of red bricks there was order structure she clung briefly to that order follow the lines theyd just opened for the day how long was i driving she went inside and wandered through the wide open layout people regular mortals were already going back and forth between shelves and tables some were curled into cocoons of their own projectspapers and books and furrowed brows it was normalcy it was her worldthe one she chose the one im staying in shed find another way to deal with danieltalk to muriel or one of the lupineclan or even nyx if necessary she had found a limitation she wasnt going to test i cant keep stalking him she crossed back over the campus smiling at the green spaces even those were in order the paths were angled the layout was defined and orderly sure there were people who werent walking down those paths but they were following other guidelines they wore their school colors or their greek letters on their clothes they defied grouping by assigning themselves another group it gave form to the world it was notchaos she drove past durham not wanting to stop by dukes library when she was feeling so tentative step two choosing the perkins library building was gorgeous and the order she craved was more obvious inside but walking through the stacks made her feel predatory but i will not hunt good mortals smart humans didnt stalk and attack knowing what she could be wasnt always reason enough to resist she wanted it to be but it wasnt for that she needed her routines her triedandtrue tactics she hadnt needed to work this hard in years she left the library and drove to raleigh ncsu was twisted among the city the campus twisted between houses and restaurants and stores university buildings nestled around tattoo parlors and coffee shops and convenience stores students and professors ate next to construction workers and strangers everyone is welcome here sure there were those that wore letters and insignias but those who didnt could still blend it was a feeling more than a quantifiable element and the feeling was one that soothed her unease here she could restructure herself here she could create the order that kept her anchored to the world that she had chosen as she walked across the brickyard she felt herself settling maybe it was the routine maybe it was the familiarity it didnt matter not really she went inside d h hill library and went up to the second floor she walked through the east wing and then the west wing she went to the study carrels she stroked shelves and paused at water fountains it was all about the anchors it was all about order what in the hell are you doing cillian was behind her her new temptation was right there in reach nothing really so why were you at brennans warehouse the other morning why are you here tonight brennans a factor somewhere here eavan i just dont know how eavan bowed her head if cillian knew about daniel nyx would know too unless she already does how did you know where i went gps did you install it she asked although she was pretty sure she knew the answer no cillian admitted they were preinstalled eavan paused they shed really thought that the car was trackerfree her mechanic hadnt removed anything the last time hed pronounced her car clean hed lied your car phone the red jacket eavan schooled her face as she turned and said shh what are you doing cillian repeated softer this time in deference to their location for a heartbeat she considered telling him giving him the answers shed never spoken to anyone instead she said walking walking driving going in and out of libraries aimlessly pacing sidewalks he stepped closer moving into her personal space as if such a thing was acceptable at least you dont have a pattern i cant imagine how your potential stalker could that is my pattern mr owens she spoke evenly forcing emotion to stay in check shed need to be more careful shed need to figure out how to cope with the cage that was tightening around herbut not now not when she was still feeling unsettled she stared at cillian and said i drive i walk its how i make the world make sense well next time youll take me with you cillian looked frazzled you drive like youre invulnerable i thought you were going to get killed coming off the interchange she didnt have the heart to ask which interchange she didnt recall parts of the drive it was the anchorsred brick cold metal shelfthat mattered that was the world im going home she told him please eavan i need you to try to cooperate cillians expression was about as frayed as her emotions had been even if you dont think youre in danger nyx does slipping away from me puts us both in danger im going home she repeated i needed air now i need sleep for a moment she thought cillian was going to say more but instead he nodded im driving the car will stay here and eavan was too shaky to fight him she didnt hand over the keys but she did walk quietly to his car with him eavan stayed in her apartment for the next three days shed called and quit her job without notice being around mortals right now was untenable of course being around others wasnt a good idea either nyx had been tracking her the older glaistig knew something was going on eavan couldnt risk going out couldnt face talking to nyx and couldnt be sure she had the resolve to resist killing daniel she was trapped by her own biology her inability to deal with hunting daniel was wearing on her cillians kindness only made matters worse being trapped with him a temptation always in reach was slowly wearing away whatever control she still had left i called the grocery to deliver food your kitchen was barren he stood in her doorway not crossing the threshold but clearly expecting her to let him in eavan she blinked at him aware that shed been staring he had the loveliest green flecks in his eyes and kissable lips she turned sharply and walked away i was fine with takeout she ordered he accepted the delivery in the hall and once the delivery people left he knocked on her door not that he needed to knock she was watching through the peephole every time groceries are being delivered here just go in the bedroom when they arrive and im not in danger from delivery guys she snapped being housebound was not getting easier knowing it was selfimposed wasnt helping either im not in danger from any she started coughing the words werent ones she could force out they were a lie he stepped closer why are you fuck it she muttered and then she pinned him to the wall it wasnt her first kiss it wasnt even the first time shed lost control this badly she had a leg hitched around him pressing herself against his responding body trying not to grind against himand failing hed wrapped an arm around her supporting her weight a gentleman even now with decided effort she pulled back im sorry im so sorry eavan cillian looked stunned im sorry she backed up bumping into a small bookshelf in the process sending paperbacks crashing to the floor he reached out to touch her face its okay youre under pressure andits okay eavan ran to her bedroom while cillian let the delivery guy into the apartment she could hear his muffled voice like a sirens song in her safe harbor she stood with one hand palmflat on the bedroom door and the other on the knob hunting daniel had made both hungers allconsuming for the first time in years eavan wasnt sure she could stop herself from losing control of at least one appetite sex is safer she hadnt killed anyone she could bring cillian to her bed it was safe its not she could wrap her body around his and have just a taste of his breath during i could stop just a taste shed started to turn the knob when the phone rang she walked over to the bed and lifted her phone from the night table eve daniel asked how are you she sat on the edge of the mattress her hands were shaking daniel how did you get my number come see me eve he paused just long enough that she could hear hesitance i miss you no she closed her eyes wrapped one hand around the bedpost and tried to focus it wasnt working her whole body shook do you want to talk to chastity eavans heart thundered loud enough that it roared in her ears but her voice was whisperquiet what one of the girlsnot the same chastity just another mindless dollright here in my armswaiting for a rescue he murmured to someone who moaned into the phone shes a coed well she was what are you doing eavan squeezed the bedpost until the wood cracked and cut her palm stinging as blood slid between her fingers and trickled down the dark wood you cant do thislet her go come see me eve ill be at chaos tonight then he disconnected before she could reply eavan slowly unwrapped her fingers from the splintered wood of her bedpost a sliver of wood was embedded in her skin she stared at it as she sat quietly trying to force her mind to process daniels challenge she dialed the only person she could be almost honest with muriel whats wrong eavan explained and then she waited there was no judgment no leash that followed the vampire said only ill be there in thirty minutes get dressed even though muriel was too kind to say it eavan knew she was making a mistake but staying here was a mistake too her body was screaming for something it didnt matter which urge she fed staying near cillian isnt an option she was too tempted before daniels call now her body was thrumming like something feral the delivery guy was still out there that made it safer to slip out of the room to walk past him it was the best opening she could hope for steeling herself eavan opened her door and went to take a cold shower she didnt look at him didnt step nearer him although she could feel his gaze on her after a painfully cold shower she went back to her room and got dressed cillian was at the bedroom door he had been for several minutes eavan can we talk maybe youre feeling too housebound we can she opened her window an alarm went off ten minutes left cillian tried the knob damn it what are you doing dont answer just go out the window she stood looking at the window and then at the door he was jimmying the lock how in the hell am i to keep you safe if he opened the door what are you doing stay back please she looked at him too close and too kind i dont want you to get hurt he crossed the room and started to close the window if you dont cooperate i cant keep you safe weve talked about this if its the kiss frustration weighed in his voice his movements his everything its okay eavan we can pretend it didnt happen people react differently to stress andits not a big deal not prey he was too close though im sorry she whispered its okay i told you that cillian turned to face her he was not even three steps away she stared at his mouth just another taste the tip of her tongue darted out he froze but he didnt run its okay she wasnt sure if he was giving her permission or still forgiving her it didnt really matter she closed the space between them it was all she could do to speak but she warned him you should run now he didnt move so she kissed him she had both legs around him and he walked forward until she felt the wall behind her she pushed herself tighter to him more she pressed her lips back to his lifted herself up enough that she could reach between them and unbutton his jeans her skirt was around her hips leaving only her underwear between them she ripped it away the sound of tearing cloth brought an encouraging sound from cillian they were on the floor she was straddling him moments from crossing the line she swore she would not cross better sex than murder she pulled away and looked down at him i could swallow his final breath as he she lowered herself onto him and shuddered sex and death all at once she could have it all she licked her lips and leaned forward eavan suddenly muriel was there pulling her backward the small vampire was more than a match for eavan muriel pulled eavan off cillian eavan hissed muriel slapped her cillian looked dazed he scrambled to his feet naked and somehow already aiming a gun at muriel get in the car muriel said or perhaps repeated if the way she bit off each word was any indication she stayed like a guard between cillian and eavan and tell him who i am evvie before he tries to shoot me friend eavan forced out forming words just then was a trial but she did it muriels a friend i called her cillian lowered his gun eavans gaze followed the lowering weapon and fell on cillians very beautiful naked justoutofreach body she tried to step around muriel im fine here muriel sighed im sorry about this mr owens but until shes thinking clearly its for the best then she punched him eavan had a violent case of the shakes by the time she was a mile away from her apartment it was a little mortifying to think that muriel had seen her so out of control with a human but at least she had been there to stop eavan i owe you she said not looking at muriel yet sweetie muriel drawled you always owe me for something or other you just count yourself lucky that i dont call in all those chits why did you stop me eavan had heard muriels lectures on giving in often enough that she was a little surprised muriel glanced over at her taking her eyes off the road long enough that it gave eavan a pleasant shiver of danger when muriel looked back at the road she answered when you choose to cross those lines im good with it but its not my place to help you cross themunless you decide in advancepreferably with me along for the ride she flashed a fanged grin at eavan im not sure ill ever be woman enough for you eavan admitted muriel laughed not cruelly but in that way that made clear that she knew secrets that the rest of the world could only guess at ill be gentle the first timealthough im not so sure thats what youre looking for you came near to breaking your mortal im mortal too eavan wasnt sure of it just then she felt pretty far from mortal after the way shed thrown herself at cillian the words the reminderto herself and to murielwere important though im still mortal you are sweetie muriel reached over and squeezed her head you havent killed anyone and i dont know if that was sex enough to count eavan and muriel had discussed what constituted sex often enough but there werent any clear answers things other were notoriously prone to loopholes semantics and arguments of intention if she considered it true sex would it be or was it the definition of the matriarch or was it the interpretation of some long dead ancestor eavan had no answers but she did know that she needed to tread extra carefully the next month just in case one month without murderusually that wouldnt sound so impossible help me stop daniel eavan stared out the window into the dimly lit parking lot of the chaos factory somewhere out there her prey waited its a trap muriel pulled in and zipped around the line of cars to go to the valet stand you know that right i do eavan accepted a hand as she slid out of muriels vanquish muriel walked around the car and wrapped an arm around eavan then she caught and held the valets gaze dont joyride she warned her fangs appeared just long enough to scare the valet if any of you so much as stroke the car youre dinner the valet shuddered he wouldnt remember the words or seeing the fangs but he would take good care of muriels car this is a bad idea eavan muriel motioned at the club going in there when youre like this is a really bad idea i need to get the girl out eavan insisted i can handle it silently muriel walked past eavan she didnt need vampire powers to charm the doorman she skipped the line and went to stand in front of him eavan followed muriel wrapped an arm around her again this time though she stroked her fingers over eavans hip eavan gasped muriel as eavan leaned in to muriels caress she felt the doorman and innumerable mortals in the waiting line respond to the tease of a show not as much as i am shhh sweetie muriel whispered in her ear well be able to dance in a sec to the doorman she added in a low whisper my girls in a bit of a mood can we skip the line shes not much of an exhibitionist unless the musics on the doorman grinned and motioned them inside they stopped just inside the door muriels hand slid up and across the small of eavans back this is where we are ev youre not in any shape to be here staying here eavan swallowed she fisted her hands driving small half moons into her palms ive been almost as bad before not in years i can do this eavan forced the craving back as hard as she could please muriel muriel shook her head but she asked tell me the ground rules dont let daniel take me anywhere get the girl out eavan leaned against a wall feeling the onslaught of music the thrum of sexual energy the lure of prey in the club no sex with anyone knock my ass out if you need to anything up to that point or nothing at all muriel forced eavan to look at her nothing with anyone but you if i needif eavan hated to ask muriel to be her crutch i dont want to hurtyoure strong muriel laughed woe is me were friends eavan would hate herself if muriel actually attached emotion to sex theyd pushed a few barriers over the years though so it wasnt unheard of muriel was the closest to sex eavan had been until tonight im here muriels teasing vanished just like old times right i get all the fun and you refuse to enjoy yourself eavan laughed i plead the fifthactually she took muriels hand and led the way to one of the bars redbreast triple shot neat the bartender looked at muriel crown rocks with a splash she paused and looked behind her as if the man standing there was with them and a vodka tonic neat that was mean eavan whispered i hate vodka muriel sighed vodkas mine sweets you can have my whiskey with a grateful smile eavan took the two glasses of whiskey when the bartender returned she upended the triple and left the glass behind it was a start the whiskey was a comforting narcotic numbing her senses enough to help block the cravings a little for the next two hours they pushed through the crowd pausing at each of the bars rather than running a tab so as not to alarm any of the bartenders with how much she was consuming not enough for a glaistig but far more than a real mortal could drink safely even still eavan was one pulsing nerve after pressing too close to mortals all but stoned on the pheromones in the club another hour passed daniel was nowhere to be found she could feel him nearby several times close enough to set her body on edge but when she turned he was not near enough to find what game is he playing daniels not here muriel yelled the words theyd just made another circuit of the main dance floor he was but the only way for eavan to know that was through some creepy affinity that eavan wasnt about to admit to muriel it was stronger now a compulsion to seek him is this how the zombie girls feel she was sure she hadnt ingested any of his drugs but she felt called to him it didnt make sense she slammed the rest of her latest glass of whiskey and then took muriels out of her hand and downed it too muriel led the way to the stairs top bar she mouthed eavan nodded and followed at the top muriel pushed open the heavy door they went into the lavish room and the door fell closed with a thud sealing out most of the noise it wasnt silent but the top floor bar was designed to make conversation possible oh shit eavan whispered cillian was standing at the bar looking far from happy muriel put her back to him give me rules evvie are you okay i am eavan was able to look away from him ive had a half a fifth already everything is sleeping now muriel smiled at cillian as he came up beside her hows the head im fine cillian scowled but to his credit he didnt do anything else muriel gave him a quick onceover i know his scowl deepened so eavan stepped closer and told muriel should i stay muriel asked eavan shook her head im goodbecause of you again with a wicked grin muriel brushed a quick kiss over eavans lips be safe ev once she was gone eavan turned to face cillian are you okay really he closed his eyes like he was trying to control the temper that was playing in the edges of his expression about the blueballs yes about your girlfriend knocking me out i guess about you running out so i cant do my fucking job no not so much im sorry she told him yet again for which part everything but the running out she admitted with a small smile in the space between words she paused her skin was crawling daniel was near perhaps hed stayed away only because muriel was in the bar cillian took eavans elbow and led her to a table toward the back of the room are you on something eavan like drugs me she felt her mouth curving into a smile at the thought if he knew the truth what would he think the cocktail waitress thankfully chose that moment to stop at the table cillian waited while eavan ordered another drink through a tinted window they could see the main dance floor in the middle of the floor surrounded by guards daniel stood he stared up as if he could see her through the darkened glass eavan stood and stepped closer to the window in the crowd below daniel waited cuddled into his arms was a very malleable young woman daniel kept her upright he kissed her forehead and then looked up at eavan and mouthed ill let her go ifhe stopped a group of women gave the girl over to their care and then looked back up at eavanyou come see me soon eve cillian came to stand beside her he peered into the crowd below are you looking for someone a dealer brennan again if your family is trying to protect you because youre mixed up in something she walked away from the window daniel was gone it wasnt a trap but a negotiation what do i do now she couldnt chase after him the idea of seeing him in this state was sheer foolishness she couldnt take cillian eitheror leave him behind rage started to build inside her she was a glaistig not some child to be toyed with and broken daniel had no clue who he was taunting eavan watched the mortals of the dance floor it looked so normal thats the sort of life shed used to dream of having it was the life she thought she could have one day nyx had seemed to be giving her a little more freedom everything seemed to be going welluntil nyx hired cillian until daniel shes been watching me the whole time there was no normal only degrees of beautiful lies eavan knew the answer but she asked all the same did my cousin hire you because of daniel cillian didnt reply or flinch but his silence was answer enough for her eavan held down on her mobile and said grandmother nyx didnt bother with greetings at this hour are you injured no eavan watched cillian as she spoke how long have you known long enough to see that you were too far gone nyx said i dont like brennan not for you or for anyone especially not as your first you know what hes doing eavan asked still watching cillian of course i do nyx sighed thats not your business though evvie brennan is trouble the powder he usesits really not good for our kind it works on some of us too eavan looked away then shed been a fool to think she could hide anything from her matriarch and in that instant she had to wonder if she truly could do anything beyond nyxs control this doesnt change the other thing im done with daniel because im not able to ask your cillian what his real job is nyx interrupted eavan looked up and caught cillians gaze what do you do for real im your bodyguard on the other end of the phone nyx made a rude sound tell him to tell you the rest nyx wants me to know she told him she said cillian held out his hand for the phone silently she released it he held it up to his ear listened for a moment and then scowled and hung up quietly he said lets take a walk cillian wasnt sure what he hated more the fact that he had to tell eavan that he was with the cda or the fact that he seemed to have picked up a second supervisor he wanted to tell nyx to piss off but his superiors would be anything but pleased if he lost his anonymous source so soonplus that whole threat business of nyxs echoed in his mind eavan was silent by his side as they walked down the street toward a tiny park that was reasonably welllit he stopped at a small cluster of unoccupied benches it was late enough that they had a bit of privacy im here investigating him cillian told her your cousin offered me a wealth of information on his activities among other things in exchange for protecting you eavan laughed a bitter sound that made him want to comfort her she sat down beside him threats sex or money he didnt pretend to be shocked not sex with her at least with any of them cillian corrected eavan was silent for a moment she hired you in the hopes that id sleep with you its an obsession of hers excuse me he angled his body so he was facing her of all the things hed been prepared to hear that wasnt anywhere on the list she hired me because she knew you were spending time with brennan and hes bad news he is eavan took a breath but nyx couldve simply broken a few of my bones if all she wanted was to keep me away from daniel she couldvecillian lowered his voice as a small group of people walked bybroken your bones you say that like its an everyday event not these days but eavan shrugged nyx is in charge im guessing you already know on some level how terrible she is else we wouldnt be having this conversation she picked you for reasons that arent about guarding me from daniel she picked you for me to have sex with does she pick a lot of people for you to sleep with he tried to keep his voice even but the idea that his family had been threatened his life endangered his career toyed with and his peace of mind completely upended over sex was infuriating it isnt eavans fault he reminded himself shed been adamant that she did not want him around eavan blushed no youre supposed to be the first well thats something at he stopped midsarcasm the first firstlike yes she looked about as comfortable as he felt the very first my virginity is a matter of family irritation your family is concerned over your being a virgin he said the words slowly so you were dating a drug dealer and your cousin hired me to have sex with you is that what earlier wasnever mind no earlier was about my wanting you it was a mistake a pleasurable one but a mistake nonethelessand i wasnt dating daniel eavan smiled regretfully i know it all seems a bit odd you think they sat there for a moment while cillian tried to figure out what to say on the phone nyx had been very clear in her orders to be completely honest with eavan and then report to the house to speak with her screw it he was already so far out of his comfort zone that he wasnt sure hed be seeing level ground again can i ask you what you are what i am she repeated ive met your familyand now this youre not quite like most humans right i can see where youd get that im human mostly she hedged id like to stay that way too explain there are a couple things i cant do if i am to stay human she squirmed and a blush burned up her cheeks my grandmother nyx would like me to do those things shes not particularly pleased with my intention to live and die as a human and if you do these things you become something else something other she nodded so nyx hired me to he whistled and shook his head and brennan hes what daniel is a human one that my family doesnt like so he paused and shook his head trying to make sense of the things she was sharing he thought he was taking it remarkably well all things considered im trying to understand help me out here eavan stood and crossed her arms over her chest nyx wanted my first to be someone id remember fondly shed prefer i sleep with you than with daniel and she undoubtedly thinks id be in danger if i continuedstalking him hes making some zombie powder that hes using to enslave and sell girls i was just going to try to scare him rescue some of the girls but i got caught up and nyx thinks that whatever hes doing with the zombie powder is dangerous to our kind cillian sat speechless watching the people cross through the park a preacher or madman perhaps was harassing passersby calling them harlots and misquoting the christian bible if only he knew what dangers really lived in his city he wasnt sure which side of the goodevil fence she belonged onor which side her family was onbut there were nights when he wasnt sure where he belonged either ill tell nyx that you left get out of here mr owens before you get trapped she turned and walked away get out and dont look back eavan was midway across the park before cillian could formulate a reply he wasnt sure what to think about the things shed told him but he was sure that nyxand possibly eavanhad answers to help him stop brennan thats what hed been sent here to do hed expected to do so by ordinary means the cda might track and eradicate crypto drugs but he had no direct and open dealings with the world of the others the human world still functioned in ignorance he was to continue to act as if he too was ignorant other cda members had a higher security clearance and were thus able to do otherwise did they end up involved this way too was it just a random case gone off the rails on a personal level he wasnt sure if he was flattered or horrified he didnt want to think long on that detail hed watched her at the clubs with brennan hed watched her stand up to nyx and held her in my arms like something molten and too dangerous to touch there was something different about her but getting involved personally with a case was a bad idea he caught up to eavan and said you need a lift she gave him a strained smile its a bad idea cillian he shrugged im not runningfrom either of my jobs its a mistake she said its my mistake then the way she held herself aloof made him want to comfort her but in light of what shed just revealed that was the very last thing he could do instead they walked silently to his car and drove to nyxs house nyx was dressed in the closest thing to proper attire that she ever wore eavan knew when she walked in that they werent staying she shivered will you let mr owens leave mr owens nyx repeated with a knowing smile your cillian is perfectly free to leave if hed like to go eavans distancing tactic was like most things utterly transparent to nyx how many times had they stood in the kitchen in a standoff nothing had changed not the ridiculously artificial countryshabby decor of the room not the fear that she felt and certainly not the fact that nyx had the upper hand nyx gestured toward the door theyd just entered he can go no strings as long as he doesnt tell anyone what hes learned of our world im not a monster evvie before eavan could dispute that claim nyx held up hand and said not now so cillians tone was relaxed but he stood nearer eavan with his body slightly at an angle positioning himself between the two women he hadnt left instead hed chosen sides for whatever reason he was still acting as if he was there to protect her nyx stepped toward him each pace measured and timed to give him a chance to back away to acknowledge her as the alpha predator she was cillian stepped forward moving away from the kitchen counter to give himself room to maneuver he grinned if youre going to get hostile over her figuring out that you hired me because of brennan nows the time grandma nyx paused eavan winced youre either brave or foolish mr owens nyx reached out beside him and took a pair of bone carved hair sticks from the counter my granddaughter is precious to me i want you to keep her safe in exchange i will help you in your job that hasnt changed eavan was speechless done ill do my best butcillian scowledim not a stud for hire eavan told me aboutthe other thing of course she did its a bit sooner than i expected but this was all inevitable my dears nyx twisted her hair up into a coil atop her head tendrils snaked down on either side stylists would have to work for the look she achieved in a momentof course glaistig hair was a living extension of the body so that did help nyx stepped between them and put one arm around eavan and the other around cillian if she needs a bedmate she might not killwhich she seems fixated onyoull be handy its the most progress ive had with her so im content now lets go see daniel so that matter can be put to rest shall we eavan hesitated grandmama do you think thats its a good idea for all of us to go nyxs laughter was unrestrained she patted eavan on the cheek and walked out the door they stood in brennans living room after having nyx charm the doorman a maid and two security guards cillian wasnt sure at all of the protocol be wasnt outside the parameters of his job but murder usually required either a series of paperwork or immediate threat much easier to tread quietly when he covers the floor with this nyx looked gleeful as she walked across the plush carpet poor bastard wont know what hit him hes unnaturally tempting eavan spoke softly theres something off he plays with voodoo dabbles in zombification so hes abuzz with energy and yourenyx paused and looked askance at cillianyoure hungry the privilege of age eavan im not starving or unsure eavan stood examining an obsidian sculpture to avoid looking at nyx or cillian as she admitted i dont like this noted nyx didnt bother to hide her amusement she looked around brennans house like an antiques appraiser he has good taste im not sure this is a good idea cillian repeated for the sixth time unfortunately after the second time nyx ignored him as if he hadnt spoken aloud cillian wasnt exactly sure why she even allowed them to come along he did however know what he was doing there months of work would be wasted if brennan was murdered admittedly it would be satisfying having criminals simply arrested sometimes felt anticlimactic but having them murdered before they revealed the information he needed to proceed on his case was a trouble of a different sort he tried again unless he has records here this will stall the whole investigationnyx he turned to eavan can she hear me this time though nyx paused hes selling mortals it upsets evvie and shes behaving foolishly hes moving drugs that are causing you complications if i kill him shell be happier your employer will have resolved a drug flow i can always use a snack wheres the downside then she sashayed across the room and into brennans bedroom humming softly she left the door wide open so they could see her when she stopped beside a massive glassblock pedestal bed with a wicked grin she watched cillian as she lifted one side of her skirt he couldnt look awayor stop the sound of shock her legs were not those of a human they were muscular and furred like an animals legs told you that you didnt want all of those questions answered cillian she said as she pulled out her hairpins her hair was writhing around her shoulders like angry serpents he took a step backward eavan reached out and squeezed his hand we should look for his files brennan stirred as nyx straddled him the sheet was only partially covering him his upper body was bare his hands were under the pillow beneath his head wake up mr brennan nyx sounded cheerful we have to chat who shhh nyx put a finger over his mouth my dears perhaps you could close the door before you go looking for whatever documents you needed daniel and i need some privacy dont we dear cillian didnt speak as eavan pulled the door shut closing in the two predators he wasnt sure which of them was worse good and evil werent always clearly delineated nyx intended to kill daniel brennan brennan drugged and sold people is it monstrous to kill a monster is nyx evil he wished briefly that his childhood catechism held up under such questions it didnt moral relativity made clear that blackandwhite questions werent realistic in the world cillian saw the world these peoplecreaturesall see too come on cillian eavan said gently its easier if you dont think about it for whom for all of us she gave him a rueful smile thats my family my blood and shes about to kill him is that all he hated that he wanted to know but he did hed involved himself in the business affairs of nyx and her familynot just because of the cda but also because he felt the stirring of interest in eavan that interest didnt die when shed told him that she wasnt altogether human hed been pretty certain of that long before shed kissed him what will she dont ask me that right now eavan opened a door and peered inside fitness equipment filled the room she walked to another door and opened it here we are and her legs he had to ask now while he still could i mean your legs arentive felt he looked at her bare ankles and toned calves youre not like that she didnt flinch im still mostly human i told you that there were things i had to do in order to be like the rest of my family sex and murder eavan looked at the closed door preferably at the same time and last night when wewere you going to kill me his heartbeat felt too fast but he wasnt sure it was entirely from fear i dont know her tongue darted out to trace her lips she looked straight at him and said i thought about it for a moment and brennan she stared at him still a challenge plain in her expression yes i wanted to kill him cillian felt a strangeunhealthystab of jealousy and maybe she shook her head ive never done either one i cant do both so i do neither i want to stay human cillian wasnt sure what to say other than lets start searchingif you see anything that could be business set it aside she nodded and they searched in silence nyx screamed but not in pleasure eavan was out of the office before cillian realized shed moved he followed her not as fast as she moved but only a few steps behind her when he crossed the threshold of brennans room and saw nyx he was horrified brennan had her bound with thick chains white powder was all over her face giving her lips a chalky appearance she was unconscious there were gashes in both of her arms and one high up on her thigh blood poured from those cuts into paint basins under each arm eve brennan was bloodcovered naked and far too happy i had no idea you would bring me such a present glaistig blood is ridiculously expensive in the open market and for whatever reason theyre averse to my presence so i cant lure them in for love nor money get nyx was all eavan said and then she was on brennan like a crazed person brennan pushed her back like she weighed nothing and wrapped his arms around her she leaned forward and bit him grabbing his earlobe in her mouth he laughed joyously i knew youd be perfect cillian unwound the chains from nyx and looked up at eavan shes breathing go eavan said she was held in an unwilling embrace by brennan bind her wounds in the car get her out of here before shes too weakened cillian couldnt stand the idea of leaving eavan behind but please she asked cillian before turning her attention to brennan and adding let them leave and ill stop fighting brennan kissed her better yet how about i let them go and you keep fighting i dont like my zombie girls i just like the money i make selling them done she looked over at cillian again get her home now tell chloe to call muriel cillian lifted nyx into his arms but he hesitated how do i leave her here eavan caught his gaze and asked please shesshe needs help if she diesplease brennan picked up a knife and held it against eavans throat she didnt move listen to eve or ill bleed her out brennan drew a heart on eavans throat with the tip of the knife if you go eve gets a fair chance at fighting eavan stood meekly as blood trickled slowly down her skin and vanished into her shirt please cillian i need nyx safe eavan watched cillian carry her grandmother out daniel held her still she could feel how happy he was to be entangled with her he nuzzled her bleeding throat and murmured did you really think i didnt know what you were eve how i drink glaistig blood i mix it in my drugs i knew who and what you were the moment you crossed my path a virgin glaistig do you know what youre worth on the market lovely eve he licked her throat i dont want to share you though not now and definitely not once your hooves are here she didnt speak the words she had screaming in her head werent words to share with mortals tell me yes he traced the contours of her body better yet tell me no why he kissed her and she couldnt deny how easily her body responded it wasnt the mindblowing reaction she had to cillian but it was a reaction but he hurt nyx if he hadnt done that if hed have been honest with her she wasnt sure shed be able to resist we could skip this whole messy business save me having to kill your lovely family he loosened his grip we could keep playing our games but youll be stronger he got more excited as he spoke rubbing against her itll be fun he unbuttoned her blouse you cant run he traced down her sternum with bloody fingers thats what i said to your grandmother a little glaistig blood powder and magic and she was helpless just like youi have your kinds blood in me just like glaistigs when i speak you have to obey he kissed her and laid her back on his bed lose the skirtand the gun eve over the years eavan had felt herself forced under nyxs will shed watched nyx and the rest of the clan bend mortals to their wishes no one but nyx was strong enough to force her to obey daniel shouldnt be either he was though thought you didnt like them mindless eavan ran her thumb along her bellyband holster would death by bullet not by my actual hand still mean changing she wasnt sure i dont once you lose the gun ill gladly give you control his eyes darkened at the thought you want me dont you eve you wanted me the night we met tell me the truth i did she admitted the skirt he sat up so she could remove it but keep the panties why she lifted her hips and slipped the skirt off then she loosened the holster pulling it apart at the fastenings as slowly as she could years of resisting nyx had helped her to learn the tricks of disobeying glaistig control it was about finding the loophole that allowed disobedience i want you to make the choice he shivered as he said it she slid the gun out of the holster i am im still mortal danielwith immunity to all but a matriarchs control i couldnt have survived my family if i wasnt immune no unturned glaistig could but she still let him take the gun from her hand lucky medaniel licked nyxs blood from his forearmi have matriarchal blood right here you know what glaistigs do im going to kill you is that what you want youd have shot me before if you were going to kill me daniel rolled her on top of him you cant kill me eve thats the last order ill give you you have your will but for this as long as im breathing you cant ever kill me and with that she had possession of her will hed given her complete control save for murdering him he knew enough about what she was to say the words that could make her safe he forbade her and she had to obey could nyx have done that if nyx had ordered eavan not to murder anyone she would be free to stay human free to have sex and live like a normal person she wanted to weep at how basic it could be as long as youre breathing she repeated as she turned the words over in her mind she saw the flaw she sealed her lips to his and breathed in her hands tightened around his throat he clawed at her hands but an instinct centuries in the making held her he was her first but her body knew how things were to be she drew his life into her mouth sucking his dreams and fears into her lungs holding him to her with hair that was extending from her in the same serpentine tendrils shed once thought were beautiful on nyx she did what nyx could not what her matriarch had failed to do what shed never wanted to do then she dropped daniel to the floor ive worked for years to not kill anyone ive lived like a virgin ive done everything i could to avoid this moment as she stepped over him she could still see her feet her normal human toes her pedicure she didnt have hooves yet eavan was bloodcovered when she walked into her house cillian didnt bother asking if brennan was alive he couldnt help glancing at her legs though are they going to change he wasnt sure if such a change was immediate or not nyx she asked sleeping now muriel is with her she says everything will be fine he didnt know if he should reach out or what to do if eavan had been human hed have offered a shoulder to lean on if she was a friend hed have offered an embrace she was something else so he settled for words are you going to be all right eavan nodded she dropped a stack of files on the table i didnt know what you needed so i brought these he came to stand beside her do you need anything a shower she looked lost but resolute im a mess he forgot his misgivings his professionalism and his common sense he wrapped his arms around her and held on to her she didnt resist but she didnt crumble into sobs either for a moment she stayed stiff and then she relaxed into his embrace drying blood some of it hers streaked her skin traces of tears on her face made it apparent that she had cried just not where there were witnesses you should run cillian she whispered being around us is unsafe im not going anywhere yet he wasnt sure where hed be or when he was going but until his supervisors assessed the files shed brought he was untethered my assignment was to come to raleigh until i get new orders im here that doesnt mean you need to be around monsters she didnt move away from him as she spoke nyx wont force you to stay and daniel isnt around to investigate hes gone cillian hadnt wanted to bring it up but they did need to deal with it if hes dead ill call it in and the cda will clean it up she nodded hes dead its not your fault he said you hunted him brought nyx there left her in a room with him she made a bitter sound and stepped away no its not my fault at all she walked past him ignoring the rest of her family and heading into the room where muriel and nyx were she stopped in the doorway and bowed her head forgive me grandmama cillian watched for a minute and then he took the files with him into the sitting room to call the office ill be staying in raleigh for a while he said when his supervisor answered i need a cleanup and containment though he filled them in and then sat down in the gaudy room and started to read there was plenty to do in raleigh eavan stood in the doorway and looked down at her matriarch shed always been imperious seemingly invincible and terrifying seeing her weakened was heartbreaking to eavan why was she weakened by him why couldnt nyx kill him eavan realized that she had done what her matriarch could not it wasnt a comforting feeling to be the better monster when nyx was the competition im sorry she whispered later there would be time for questions later there would be room to think about the unpleasant truth that she was going to need to make peace with being a part of her clan right now all that mattered was that her family was unbroken im so sorry dont be a fool eavan you didnt injure me nyx opened her eyes is he dead yes by your hand nyx wasnt any less fierce for being injured yes eavan admitted it was worth it then now if you want to make me happy go celebrate with cillian call it a cure for your guilt nyx closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep eavan stood there for several moments some things never change her grandmother was still the family matriarch still focused on her personal agenda still determined to save eavan from dying from the disease of mortality quietly with only muriel for a witness eavan walked over and kissed her grandmothers forehead and whispered the same words she used to whisper as a girl youre such a bitch grandmama nyx nyx smiled but didnt open her eyes love you too evvie after her shower eavan sat in nyxs room and flipped through a manila folder shed found in daniels office one she hadnt given cillian he had looked up when she walked past the sitting room but he hadnt followed her into nyxs room eavan flipped through the pages and stared at the names christophe james imlee d mckinsey rachel wall there were more than a dozen pages on different people and other thicker packets of information that made no sense to her she wasnt meant for a normal life but that didnt mean she had to give up hope of everything shed believed maybe nyx was right maybe she couldnt deny what she was she was a murderess a daughter of glaistigs but she was also daughter to a longgone human father shed commit a few murders to keep her appetites in control she wasnt going to become fully glaistig there were choices left to hernot as many as before daniel but still enough that she could keep hold her of her humanity
