jeffery deaver the stone monkey the fourth book in the lincoln rhyme series to those we lost on september whose only crime was their love of tolerance and freedom and who will be in our hearts forever authors note im including here some information that might be helpful for readers unfamiliar with certain aspects of chinese life that are described in the book geography most of the illegal immigrants to the united states from china come from the southeastern coastal region of that country generally from two provinces in the far south guangdong province where hong kong is located and just north of that fujian province whose major city is fuzhou a large seafaring center and probably the most popular point of embarkation for illegal immigrants beginning their journeys to other lands language the written chinese language is the same throughout the country but as spoken there are great differences from one region to the other the major dialects are cantonese in the south minnanhua in fujian and taiwan and mandarin or putonghua in beijing and the north the few chinese words i use in the book are in the putonghua dialect which is the official language of the country names chinese names are traditionally given in the reverse order from that used in the united states and europe for example with li kangmei li is the family name and kangmei is the given name some chinese in the more urbanized regions of china or with close ties to the united states or other western cultures may adopt a western given name which they use in addition to or instead of a chinese given name in such a case the anglicized name precedes the family name such as jerry tang jd i the snakehead tuesday the hour of the tiger am to the hour of the dragon am the word weichi consists of two chinese words wei which means to encircle and chi which means piece as the game represents a struggle for life it may be called the war game danielle pecorini and tong shu the game of weichi chapter one they were the vanished they were the unfortunate to the human smugglers the snakeheads who carted them around the world like pallets of damaged goods they were jujia piglets to the american ins agents who interdicted their ships and arrested and deported them they were undocumenteds they were the hopeful who were trading homes and family and a thousand years of ancestry for the hard certainty of risky laborious years ahead of them who had the slimmest of chances to take root in a place where their families could prosper where freedom and money and contentment were the story went as common as sunlight and rain they were his fragile cargo and now legs steady against the raging fivemeterhigh seas captain sen zijun made his way from the bridge down two decks into the murky hold to deliver the grim message that their weeks of difficult journeying might have been in vain it was just before dawn on a tuesday in august the stocky captain whose head was shaved and who sported an elaborate bushy mustache slipped past the empty containers lashed to the deck of the seventytwometer fuzhou dragon as camouflage and opened the heavy steel door to the hold he looked down at the twodozen people huddled there in the grim windowless space trash and childrens plastic blocks floated in the shallow tide under the cheap cots despite the pitching waves captain sen a thirtyyear veteran of the seas walked down the steep metal steps without using the handrails and strode into the middle of the hold he checked the carbon dioxide meter and found the levels acceptable though the air was vile with the smell of diesel fuel and humans whod lived for two weeks in close proximity unlike many of the captains and crew who operated buckets human smuggling ships and who at best ignored or sometimes even beat or raped the passengers sen didnt mistreat them indeed he believed that he was doing a good thing transporting these families from difficulty to if not certain wealth at least the hope of a happy life in america meiguo in chinese which means the beautiful country on this particular voyage however most of the immigrants distrusted him and why not they assumed he was in league with the snakehead whod chartered the dragon kwan ang known universally by his nickname gui the ghost tainted by the snakeheads reputation for violence captain sens efforts to engage the immigrants in conversation had been rebuffed and had yielded only one friend chang jingerzi who preferred his western name of sam chang was a fortyfiveyearold former college professor from a suburb of the huge port city of fuzhou in southeastern china he was bringing his entire family to america his wife two sons and changs widower father a halfdozen times on the trip chang and sen had sat in the hold sipped the potent maotai that the captain always had in good supply on his ship and talked about life in china and in the united states captain sen now saw chang sitting on a cot in a forward corner of the hold the tall placid man frowned a reaction to the look in the captains eyes chang handed his teenage son the book hed been reading to his family and rose to meet the captain everyone around them fell silent our radar shows a fastmoving ship on course to intercept us dismay blossomed in the faces of those whod overheard the americans chang asked their coast guard i think it must be the captain answered were in us waters sen looked at the frightened faces of the immigrants around him like most shiploads of illegals that sen had transported these people many of them strangers before theyd met had formed a close bond of friendship and they now gripped hands or whispered among themselves some seeking some offering reassurance the captains eyes settled on a woman holding an eighteenmonthold girl in her arms her mother whose face was scarred from a beating at a reeducation camp lowered her head and began to cry what can we do chang asked troubled captain sen knew he was a vocal dissident in china and had been desperate to flee the country if he was deported by us immigration hed probably end up in one of the infamous jails in western china as a political prisoner were not far from the dropoff spot were running at full speed it may be possible to get close enough to put you ashore in rafts no no chang said in these waves wed all die theres a natural harbor im steering for it should be calm enough for you to board the rafts at the beach therell be trucks to take you to new york and what about you chang asked ill head back into the storm by the time its safe for them to board youll be on highways of gold heading toward the city of diamonds now tell everyone to get their belongings together but only the most important things your money your pictures leave everything else it will be a race to the shore stay below until the ghost or i tell you to come up top captain sen hurried up the steep ladder on his way to the bridge as he climbed he said a brief prayer for their survival to tian hou the goddess of sailors then dodged a wall of gray water that vaulted the side of the ship on the bridge he found the ghost standing over the radar unit staring into the rubber glare shade the man stood completely still bracing himself against the rolling of the sea some snakeheads dressed as if they were wealthy cantonese gangsters from a john woo film but the ghost always wore the standard outfit of most chinese men simple slacks and shortsleeved shirts he was muscular but diminutive cleanshaven hair longer than a typical businessmans but never styled with cream or spray they will intercept us in fifteen minutes the snakehead said even now facing interdiction and arrest he seemed as lethargic as a ticket seller in a rural longdistance bus station fifteen the captain replied impossible how many knots are they making sen walked to the chart table the centerpiece of all oceancrossing vessels on it sat a us defense mapping agency nautical chart of the area he had to judge the two ships relative positions from this and from the radar because of the risk of being traced the dragons global positioning system and her epirb emergency beacon and global maritime distress and safety system were disconnected i think it will be at least forty minutes the captain said no i timed the distance theyve traveled since we spotted them captain sen glanced at the crewman piloting the fuzhou dragon sweating as he gripped the wheel in his struggle to keep the turks head knot of twine tied around a spoke straight up indicating that the rudder was aligned with the hull the throttles were full forward if the ghost was right in his assessment of when the cutter would intercept them they would not be able to make the protected harbor in time at best they could get within a half mile of the nearby rocky shore close enough to launch the rafts but subjecting them to merciless pounding by the tempestuous seas the ghost asked the captain what sort of weapons will they have dont you know ive never been interdicted the ghost replied tell me ships under sens command had been stopped and boarded twice before fortunately on legitimate voyages not when he was running immigrants for snakeheads but the experience had been harrowing a dozen armed coast guard sailors had streamed onto the vessel while another one on the deck of the cutter had trained a twobarreled machine gun on him and his crew thered been a small cannon too he now told the ghost what they might expect the ghost nodded we need to consider our options what options captain sen now asked youre not thinking of fighting them are you no i wont allow it but the snakehead didnt answer he remained braced at the radar stand staring at the screen the man seemed placid but sen supposed he mustve been enraged no snakehead hed ever worked with had taken so many precautions to avoid capture and detection as the ghost on this voyage the twodozen immigrants had met in an abandoned warehouse outside of fuzhou and waited there for two days under the watch of a partner of the ghosts a little snakehead the man had then loaded the chinese onto a chartered tupolev which had flown to a deserted military airfield near st petersburg in russia there theyd climbed into a shipping container been driven kilometers to the town of vyborg and boarded the fuzhou dragon which sen had sailed into the russian port just the day before he himself had meticulously filled out the customs documents and manifests everything according to the book so as not to arouse suspicion the ghost had joined them at the last minute and the ship had sailed on schedule through the baltic sea the north sea the english channel then the dragon had crossed the famous starting point of transatlantic voyages in the celtic sea n w and had begun steaming southwest toward long island new york there was not a single thing about the voyage that would arouse the suspicion of the us authorities how did the coast guard do it the captain asked what the ghost responded absently find us no one could have its impossible the ghost straightened up and pushed outside into the raging wind calling back who knows maybe it was magic chapter two were right on top of em lincoln the boats headin for land but are they gonna make it nosir nohow wait do i hafta call it a ship i think i do its too big for a boat i dont know lincoln rhyme said absently to fred dellray i dont really do much sailing the tall lanky dellray was the fbi agent in charge of the federal side of the efforts to find and arrest the ghost neither dellrays canary yellow shirt nor his black suit as dark as the mans lustrous skin had been ironed recently but then no one in the room looked particularly well rested these halfdozen people clustered around rhyme had spent the past twentyfour hours virtually living here in this improbable headquarters the living room of rhymes central park west town house which resembled not the victorian drawing room it had once been but a forensics laboratory chockfull of tables equipment computers chemicals wires and hundreds of forensics books and magazines the team included both federal and state law enforcers on the state side was lieutenant lon sellitto homicide detective for the nypd far more rumpled than dellray stockier too hed just moved in with his girlfriend in brooklyn who the cop announced with rueful pride cooked like emeril young eddie deng a chineseamerican detective from the nypds fifth precinct which covered chinatown was present too deng was trim and athletic and stylish sporting glasses framed by armani and black hair spiked up like a hedgehogs he was serving as sellittos temporary partner the big detectives usual coworker roland bell had gone down to his native north carolina for a family reunion with his two sons a week ago and as it turned out had struck up a friendship with a local policewoman lucy kerr hed extended his vacation another few days assisting on the federal portion of the team was fiftysomething harold peabody a pearshaped clever middle manager who held a senior spot at the immigration and naturalization services manhattan office peabody was closelipped about himself as are all bureaucrats narrowing in on their retirement pension but his farranging knowledge of immigration issues attested to a lengthy and successful stint in the service peabody and dellray had faced off more than once during this investigation after the golden venture incident in which ten illegal immigrants drowned after a smuggling vessel of that name ran aground off brooklyn the president of the united states had ordered that the fbi take over primary jurisdiction from the ins on major human smuggling cases with backup from the cia the immigration service had far more experience with snakeheads and their human smuggling activities than the fbi and didnt take kindly to yielding jurisdiction to other agencies especially one that insisted on working shouldertoshoulder with the nypd and well alternative consultants like lincoln rhyme assisting peabody was a young ins agent named alan coe a man in his thirties with closecropped dark red hair energetic but sour and moody coe too was an enigma saying not a word about his personal life and little about his career aside from the ghost case rhyme had observed that coes suits were outletmall chic flashy but stitched with obvious thread and his dusty black shoes had the thick rubber soles of security guard footwear perfect for running down shoplifters the only time he grew talkative was when hed give one of his spontaneous and tedious lectures on the evils of illegal immigration still coe worked tirelessly and was zealous about collaring the ghost several other underlings federal and state had appeared and disappeared over the past week on various errands relating to the case goddamn grand central station lincoln rhyme had thought and said frequently in the past day or so now at am on this stormy morning he maneuvered his batterypowered storm arrow wheelchair through the cluttered room toward the case status board on which was taped one of the few existing pictures of the ghost a very bad surveillance shot as well as a picture of sen zijun the captain of the fuzhou dragon and a map of eastern long island and the ocean surrounding it unlike during his bedridden days of selfimposed retirement after a crime scene accident turned him into a c quadriplegic rhyme now spent half of his waking hours in his cherry red storm arrow outfitted with a new stateoftheart mkiv touchpad drive controller that his aide thom had found at invacare the controller on which his one working finger rested gave him far more flexibility in driving the chair than the older sipandpuff controller how far offshore he called staring at the map lon sellitto on the phone glanced up im finding out rhyme frequently worked as a consultant for the nypd but most of his efforts were in classic forensic detection criminalistics as the jargonhappy law enforcement world now preferred to call it this assignment was unusual four days ago sellitto dellray peabody and taciturn young alan coe had come to him at his town house rhyme had been distracted the consuming event in his life at the moment was an impending medical procedure but dellray had snagged his attention by saying youre our last hope linc we got us a big problem and dont have a single idea where else to turn go on interpol the international clearinghouse on criminal intelligence had issued one of its infamous red notices about the ghost according to informants the elusive snakehead had surfaced in fuzhou china flown to the south of france then gone to some port in russia to pick up a load of illegal chinese immigrants among whom was the ghosts bangshou or assistant a spy masquerading as one of the passengers their destination was supposedly new york but then hed disappeared the taiwanese french and russian police and the fbi and ins could find him nowhere dellray had brought with him the only evidence they had a briefcase containing some of the ghosts personal effects from his safehouse in france in hopes that rhyme could give them ideas where his trail might lead why all hands on deck rhyme had asked surveying the group which represented three major law enforcement organizations coe said hes a fucking sociopath peabody gave a more measured response the ghosts probably the most dangerous human smuggler in the world hes wanted for eleven deaths immigrants and police and agents but we know hes killed more illegalsre called the vanished if they try to cheat a snakehead theyre killed if they complain theyre killed they just disappear forever coe added and hes raped at least fifteen women immigrants that we know of im sure therere more dellray said looks like mosta the highlevel snakeheads like him dont make the trips themselves th only reason hes bringing these folk over personally is cause hes expandin his operation here if he gets into the country coe said peoplere going to die a lot of people well why me rhyme asked i dont know a thing about human smuggling the fbi agent said we tried everthing else lincoln but we came up with nothin we dont have any personal info bout him no good photos no prints zeerow cept that a nod toward the attaché case containing the ghosts effects rhyme glanced at it with a skeptical expression and where exactly did he go in russia do you have a city a state or province or whatever they have over there its a rather big country so im told sellitto replied with a lifted eyebrow which seemed to mean we have no idea ill do what i can but dont expect miracles two days later rhyme had summoned them back thom handed agent coe the attaché case was there anything helpful in it the young man asked nup rhyme replied cheerfully hell muttered dellray so were outta luck which had been a good enough cue for lincoln rhyme hed leaned his head back into the luxurious pillow thom had mounted to the wheelchair and spoke rapidly the ghost and approximately twenty to thirty illegal chinese immigrants are on board a ship called the fuzhou dragon out of fuzhou fujian province china its a seventytwometer combination container and breakbulk cargo ship twin diesels under the command of sen zijun thats last name sen fiftysix years old and has a crew of seven it left vyborg russia at hours fourteen days ago and is presently im estimating now about three hundred miles off the coast of new york its making for the brooklyn docks how the helld you figure that out coe blurted in astonishment even sellitto used to rhymes deductive abilities barked a laugh simple i assumed that theyd be sailing east to west otherwise he would have left from china itself ive got a friend on the moscow police does crime scene work ive written some papers with him expert in soils by the way best in the world i asked him to call the harbor masters in ports in western russia he pulled some strings and got all the manifests from chinese ships that left port in the past three weeks we spent a few hours going over them by the way youre getting a very obese bill for the phone calls oh and i told him to charge you for translation services too i would now we found that only one ship took on enough fuel for an mile trip when the manifest reported it was making a mile one eight thousand would get them from vyborg to new york and back to southampton england for refueling they werent going to dock in brooklyn at all they were going to drop off the ghost and the immigrants then scoot back to europe maybe fuels too expensive in new york dellray had offered rhyme had shrugged one of the few dismissive gestures his body allowed him and said sourly everythings too expensive in new york but theres more the dragons manifest said she was transporting industrial machinery to america but you need to report your ships draft thats how far the hull sinks into the water if youre interested to make sure you dont run aground in shallow ports the dragons draft was listed at three meters but a fully loaded ship her size should draw at least seven and a half meters so she was empty except for the ghost and the immigrants not offended by calling the ship she anyone it is customary oh i say twenty to thirty immigrants because the dragon took on enough fresh water and food for that many when like i said the crew was only seven damn offered the otherwise stiff harold peabody with an admiring grin later that day spy satellites had picked up the dragon about miles out to sea just as rhyme had predicted the coast guard cutter evan brigant with a boarding party of twentyfive sailors backed up by twin fifties and an mm cannon had gone to ready status but kept its distance waiting until the dragon had sailed closer to shore now just before dawn on tuesday the chinese ship was in us waters and the evan brigant was in pursuit the plan was to take control of the dragon arrest the ghost his assistant and the ships crew the coast guard would sail the ship to the harbor at port jefferson long island where the immigrants would be transferred to a federal detention center to await deportation or asylum hearings a call was patched through from the radio of the coast guard cutter closing in on the dragon thom put it on the speakerphone agent dellray this is captain ransom on the evan brigant im readin you captain we think theyve spotted us they had better radar than we thought the ships turned hard for shore we need some direction on the assault plan theres some concern that if we board therell be a firefight i mean considering who this particular individual is were worried about casualties over among who coe asked the undocumenteds the disdain in his voice when he used the word that described the immigrants was clear right we were thinking we should just make the ship come about and wait until the ghost surrenders over dellray reached up and squeezed the cigarette he kept behind his ear a memento from his smoking days negative on that follow your original rules of engagement stop the ship board it and arrest the ghost the use of deadly force is authorized you copy that after a moment of hesitation the young man responded five by five sir out the line went dead and thom disconnected the call electric tension flowed into the room on the heels of the silence that followed sellitto wiped his palms on his foreverwrinkled slacks then adjusted his service pistol on his belt dellray paced peabody called ins headquarters to tell them he had nothing to tell them a moment later rhymes private line rang thom took the call in the corner of the room he listened for a moment then looked up its dr weaver lincoln about the surgery he glanced at the roomful of tense law enforcers ill tell her youll call her back no rhyme answered firmly ill take it chapter three the winds were stronger now the waves arcing high over the sides of the intrepid fuzhoudragon the ghost hated water crossings he was a man used to luxury hotels to being pampered human smuggling voyages were dirty oily cold dangerous man has not tamed the sea he thought and never will it is an icy blanket of death he scanned the rear of the ship but could not find his bangshou anywhere turning toward the bow he squinted into the wind and could see no land either just more restless mountains of black water he climbed to the bridge and pounded on the window of the rear door captain sen looked up and the ghost gestured for him sen pulled a knit cap on his head and dutifully walked outside into the rain the coast guard will be here soon the ghost shouted over the raging wind no sen replied i can get close enough to offload before they intercept us im sure i can but the ghost turned his still eyes on the captain and said you will do this leave those men on the bridge and you and the rest of the crew go below with the piglets hide with them get everyone out of sight in the hold but why because the ghost explained youre a good man too good to lie ill pretend to be the captain i can look a man in the eye and he will believe what i tell him you cannot do that the ghost grabbed sens cap in reaction the man started to reach for it but then lowered his hand the ghost put it on there he said humorlessly do i look like a captain i think i make a good captain this is my ship no the ghost shot back on this voyage the dragon is my ship im paying you in onecolor cash us dollars were far more valuable and negotiable than chinese yuan the currency many lowlevel snakeheads paid in you are not going to fight with them are you the coast guard the ghost gave an impatient laugh how could i fight them they have dozens of sailors right a nod toward the crewmen on the bridge tell your men to follow my orders when sen hesitated the ghost leaned forward with the placid yet chilling gaze that so unsettled everyone who looked into his eyes is there something you want to say sen looked away then stepped onto the bridge to give the instructions to the crewmen the ghost turned back to the stern of the ship looking again for his assistant he then pulled the captains cap tighter over his head and strode onto the bridge to take command of the rocking ship the ten judges of hell the man crawled along the main deck to the stern of the ship stuck his head over the side of the fuzhou dragon and began retching again hed been lying beside a life raft all night long ever since the storm picked up and hed fled from the stinking hold to purge his body of the disharmony wrought by the rocking sea the ten judges of hell he thought again his gut was in agony because of the dry heaving and he was as cold and miserable as hed ever been in his life slumping against the rusty railing he closed his eyes he was called sonny li though the given name ruthlessly bestowed upon him by his father was kangmei which meant resist america it was typical of children born under maos reign to have such politically correct and thoroughly shameful given names still as often happened with youngsters from coastal china fujian and guangdong hed taken a western name too his was the one that the boys in his gang gave him sonny after the dangerous badtempered son of don corleone in the movie the godfather true to the character after whom he was named sonny li had seen and been the cause of much violence in his life but nothing had ever brought him to his knees literally like this seasickness judges of hell li was ready for the infernal beings to take him hed own up to everything bad hed done in life all the shame hed brought to his father all the foolishness all the harm let the god taishan assign me a place in hell just stop this fucking sickness lightheaded from nearly two weeks of meager food dizzy from the vertigo he fantasized that the sea was in turmoil thanks to a dragon gone mad he wanted to rip his heavy pistol from his pocket and fire bullet after bullet into the beast li glanced behind him toward the bridge of the ship and he thought he saw the ghost but suddenly his stomach lurched and he had to turn back to the railing sonny li forgot about the snakehead forgot about his dangerous life back in fujian province forgot about anything except the ten judges of hell gleefully urging demons to prod his dying belly with their spears he began heaving once again the tall woman leaned against her car the contrasts stark her red hair tossed by the fierce wind the yellow of the old chevy camaro the black nylon utility belt securing a black pistol to her hip amelia sachs in jeans and a hooded windbreaker on the back of which were the words nypd crime scene looked out over the turbulent water of the harbor near port jefferson on the north shore of long island she surveyed the staging area around her immigration and naturalization the fbi the suffolk county police and her own shop had cordoned off a parking lot that on an average day in august would normally have been packed with families and teenagers here to catch some rays the tropical storm however had kept vacationers far away from the shore parked nearby were two large department of corrections prisoner buses the ins had borrowed a halfdozen ambulances and four vans filled with tactical officers from the various agencies in theory by the time the dragon arrived here it would be under the control of the crew of the cutter evan brigant and the ghost and his assistant would be in custody but there would be a certain period of time after the ghost had spotted the coast guard cutter and before the actual boarding by the crew perhaps as much as forty minutes that would give the ghost and his bangshou plenty of time to masquerade as immigrants and hide weapons a tactic that snakeheads frequently used the coast guard might not be able to effectively search the immigrants and the ship before it arrived at the harbor here and the snakehead and any assistants might try to shoot their way to freedom sachs herself would be in particular danger her job was to walk the grid to sweep the ship for crime scene evidence that would bolster the various cases against the ghost and to find leads to his confederates if the searcher is running a scene where say a body is found or a robbery has occurred long after the perp has fled there is relatively little danger to the cs officer but if the scene is the actual takedown site involving an unknown number of perps whose appearance isnt well known the risks can be great particularly in the case of human smugglers who have ready access to good weaponry her cell phone rang and she dropped into the tight seat of the chevy to answer it the caller was rhyme were all in place she told him we think theyre on to us sachs he said the dragon turned toward land the cutterll get there before they make it to shore but were thinking now that the ghost is gearing up for a fight she thought of the poor people on board when rhyme paused sachs asked him did she call a hesitation then he said yes about ten minutes ago they have a slot open at manhattan hospital next week shes going to call back with the details ah sachs said the she was dr cheryl weaver a renowned neurosurgeon whod come up to the new york area from north carolina to teach for a semester at manhattan hospital and the slot referred to an opening for some experimental surgery that rhyme was having an operation that might improve his quadriplegic condition an operation sachs was not in favor of id get some extra ambulances in the area rhyme said his tone was now curt he didnt like personal subjects intruding in the midst of business ill take care of it ill call you back sachs the phone went silent she ran through the downpour to one of the suffolk county troopers and arranged for more med techs she then returned to her chevy and sat down in the front bucket seat listening to the rattle of the powerful rain on the windshield and cloth roof the dampness made the interior smell of plastic motor oil and old carpeting thinking about rhymes operation put her in mind of a recent conversation with another doctor one who had nothing to do with his spinal cord surgery she didnt want her thoughts to go back to that meeting but go there they did two weeks ago amelia sachs had been standing by the coffee machine in a hospital waiting room up the hall from lincoln rhymes examining room she remembered the july sun falling brutally on the green tile floor the whitejacketed man had approached and then addressed her with a chilling solemnity ah ms sachs here you are hello doctor ive just been meeting with lincoln rhymes physician yes ive got to talk to you about something her heart pounding shed said youre looking like its bad news doctor why dont we sit down over there in the corner hed asked sounding more like a funeral home director than an md heres fine shed said firmly tell me let me have it straight a gust of wind now rocked her and she looked out over the harbor again at the long pier where the fuzhou dragon would dock bad news tell me let me have it straight sachs flicked her motorola to the coast guards secure frequency not only to learn what was happening with the dragon but to keep her thoughts from returning to that scaldingly bright waiting room how far from land the ghost asked the two remaining crewmen on the bridge a mile maybe less the slim man at the helm glanced quickly at the ghost well turn just before the shallows and try for the harbor the ghost gazed forward from the vantage point of the crest of a wave he could just see the line of light gray land he said steer straight on course ill be back in a moment bracing himself he stepped outside the wind and rain lashed his face as the ghost made his way down to the container deck and then to the one below it he came to the metal door that opened into the hold he stepped inside and looked down at the piglets their faces turned toward him with fear and distress the pathetic men the frumpy women the filthy children even some pointless girls why had their foolish families bothered to bring them what is it captain sen asked is the cutter in sight the ghost didnt answer he was scanning the piglets for his bangshou but there was no sign of him angry he turned away wait the captain called the snakehead stepped outside and closed the door bangshou he shouted there was no response the ghost didnt bother to call a second time he screwed down the latches so that the door to the hold couldnt be opened from the inside he hurried back toward his cabin which was on the bridge deck as he struggled up the stairs he took from his pocket a battered black plastic box just like the door opener for the garage of his luxurious house in xiamen he opened the box and pushed one button and then a second the radio signal zipped through two decks down to the duffel bag hed placed in the aft hold below the waterline the signal closed the circuit and sent an electrical charge from a ninevolt battery into a blasting cap embedded in two kilos of composition explosive the detonation was huge much larger than hed expected and it sent a tall spume of water shooting into the air higher than the highest waves the ghost was thrown off the stairs onto the main deck he lay on his side stunned too much he realized thered been too much explosive already the ship was starting to list as she took on seawater hed thought it would take half an hour for the ship to sink instead she would go down in minutes he looked toward the bridge deck where his money and guns sat in the small cabin then once again scanned the other decks for his bangshou no sign of him but there was no time to look further the ghost rose and scrabbled across the listing deck to the nearest rubber life raft and began undoing the tiedown ropes the dragon lurched again rolling farther onto her side chapter four the sound had been deafening a hundred sledgehammers on a piece of iron nearly all of the immigrants had been thrown to the cold wet floor sam chang climbed to his feet and picked up his youngest boy whod fallen into a puddle of greasy water he then helped up his wife and his elderly father what happened he shouted to captain sen who was struggling through the panicked crowd to the door that led up to the deck did we hit the rocks the captain called back no no rocks the waters a hundred feet deep here either the ghost has blown up the ship or the coast guard is firing on us i dont know what is happening asked a panicstricken man sitting near chang he was the father of the family that had camped out in the hold next to the changs wu qichen was his name his wife lay listlessly on the cot nearby shed been feverish and lethargic throughout the entire voyage and even now seemed hardly aware of the explosion and chaos whats going on wu repeated in a high voice were sinking the captain called and together he and several of his crewmen grabbed the latches of the door and struggled to open them but they didnt move hes jammed them some of the immigrants both men and women began wailing and rocking back and forth children stood frozen with fear tears running down their dirty cheeks sam chang and several of the crew joined the captain and tugged on the latches but the thick metal bars wouldnt give a millimeter chang noticed a suitcase sitting on the floor slowly it toppled to its side and hit the floor with a splash the dragon was listing sharply cold seawater was shooting into the hold from seams in the metal plates the puddle his son had fallen into was now a half meter deep several people slid into the deepening pools filled with trash luggage food styrofoam cups papers they screamed and flailed about in the water desperate men and women and children futilely slamming luggage into the walls to break through the metal hugging one another sobbing screaming for help praying the scarfaced woman clutched her young daughter the way the child herself clung to a filthy yellow pokémon toy both were sobbing a powerful groaning from the dying ship filled the stale air and the brown vile water grew deeper the men at the hatch were making no headway with the latches chang wiped his hair out of his eyes this wont work he said to the captain we need another way out captain sen replied theres an access panel on the floor in the back of the hold it leads to the engine room but if thats where the hull was breached we wont be able to open it too much pressure where chang demanded the captain pointed it out a small door secured by four screws it was only large enough for one person to pass through at a time he and chang pushed toward it struggling to stay upright against the sharp angle of the floor scrawny wu qichen helped his sick wife to her feet the woman shivered with chills chang bent down to his own wife and said in a firm voice listen to me you will keep our family together stay close to me by that doorway yes husband chang joined the captain at the access door and using sens flickknife they managed to undo the screws chang pushed hard on the door and it fell into the other room without resistance water was filling the engine room too but it wasnt as deep as in the hold chang could see steep stairs leading to the main deck screams and shouts as the immigrants saw the open passageway they pushed forward in panic crushing some people against the metal walls chang struck two of the men with his large fist he cried no one at a time or well all die several others desperation in their eyes started for chang but the captain turned on them brandishing his knife and they backed away captain sen and chang stood side by side facing the crowd one at a time the captain repeated through the engine room and up the ladder therere rafts on the deck he nodded to the immigrants closest to the doorway and they crawled outside the first was john sung a doctor and a dissident whom chang had spent some time talking with on the voyage sung stopped outside the doorway and crouched down to help the others out a young husband and wife climbed out next and scurried to the ladder the captain caught changs eye and he nodded go chang motioned to chang jiechi his father and the old man went through the door john sung gripping him by his arm then changs sons teenage william and eightyearold ronald next his wife chang went last and pointed his family toward the ladder he turned back to help sung get the others out the wu family was next qichen his sick wife their teenage daughter and young son chang reached into the hold to take the hand of another immigrant but two of the crewmen raced for the doorway captain sen grabbed for them he raged im still in charge the dragon is my ship the passengers go first passengers you idiot theyre cattle one of the crew screamed and knocking aside the scarfaced mother and her little girl crawled through the opening the other followed right behind him pushing sung to the floor and running for the stairs chang helped the doctor to his feet im all right sung shouted and clutched a charm he wore around his neck muttering an abbreviated prayer chang heard the name chenwu the god of the northern sky and protector against criminals the ship lurched hard and tilted faster the wind of escaping air began to shoot out through the doorway as water flooded in filling the hold the screams were heartbreaking and were soon mixed with the sound of choking shes going down chang thought another few minutes at the most he heard a hissing sparking sound behind him he glanced up and saw water flowing down the stairwell onto the massive grimy engines one of the diesels stopped running and the lights went out the second engine then went silent john sung lost his handhold and slid across the floor into the wall get out chang called to him we cant do anything more here the doctor nodded scrabbled for the stairs and climbed out but chang himself turned back to the doorway to try to rescue one or two more he shivered sickened at the sight in front of him water was pouring out of the doorway from which four desperate arms extended into the engine room clawing for help chang grabbed one mans arm but the immigrant was so jammed among the others that he couldnt be dislodged the arm shivered once and then chang felt the fingers go limp through the roiling water now bubbling into the engine room chang could just see captain sens face chang motioned for him to try to climb out but the captain disappeared into the blackness of the hold a few seconds later though the bald man swam back to the doorway and shoved something up through the fountain of seawater toward chang what was it gripping a pipe to keep from sliding away chang reached into the frothy water to take what the captain offered he closed his muscular hand around cloth and pulled hard it was a young child the daughter of the scarred woman she rose from the doorway through the stalks of lifeless arms the toddler was choking but conscious chang held her to his chest firmly then let go of the pipe he slid through the water to the wall then swam to the stairwell where he climbed through the icy cascade to the deck above he gasped at what he saw the stern of the ship was barely above water and gray turbulent waves were already covering half the deck wu qichen and changs father and sons were struggling to untie a large orange inflatable launch on the stern of the boat it was already floating but would soon be underwater chang stumbled forward handed the baby to his wife and began to help the others undo the rope but soon the knot securing the raft was beneath the waves chang dove under the surface and tugged futilely on the hemp knot his muscles quivering from the effort then a hand appeared near his his son william was holding a long sharp knife that he mustve found on the deck chang took it and sawed on the rope until it gave way chang and his son surfaced and gasping helped his family the wus john sung and the other couple into the raft which was quickly drawn away from the ship by the massive waves he turned to the outboard motor he pulled the cord to start the engine but it wouldnt engage they needed to get it going immediately without the control of a motor theyd be overturned by the sea in seconds he began yanking furiously and finally the motor buzzed to life chang braced himself in the back of the raft and quickly turned their small craft into the waves it bucked furiously but didnt capsize he accelerated and then steered carefully in a circle heading back through the fog and rain toward the dying ship where are you going wu asked the others chang shouted we have to find the others some might have that was when the bullet snapped through the air no more than a meter from them the ghost was furious he stood at the bow of the sinking fuzhou dragon his hand on the lanyard of the forward life raft and looked back fifty meters to sea where hed just spotted some of the fucking piglets whod escaped he fired his pistol once more another miss the pitching seas made accurate shooting from this distance impossible he scowled in fury as his targets maneuvered behind the dragon out of his sight the ghost surveyed the distance to the bridge deck on which his cabin was located where he had his machine gun and his money more than a hundred thousand in onecolor cash he wondered momentarily if he could make it back to the cabin in time as if in answer a huge spume of venting air broke through the hull of the dragon and she began to sink even more quickly rolling farther on her side well the loss hurt but it wasnt worth his life the ghost climbed into the raft and pushed away from the ship with an oar he scanned the nearby water struggling to see through the fog and rain two heads bobbed up and down their arms waving frantically fingers splayed in panic here here the ghost shouted ill save you the men turned to him kicking hard to rise from the water so he could see them better they were two of the crew members the ones whod been on the bridge he lifted his chinese military model automatic pistol again he killed the two crewmen with one shot each then the ghost got the outboard motor going and riding the waves looked once more for his bangshou but there was no sign of him the assistant was a ruthless killer and fearless in shootouts but he was a fool when he was out of his element hed probably fallen into the water and drowned because he wouldnt throw away his heavy gun and ammunition well the ghost had other matters to attend to he turned the raft toward where hed last seen the piglets and twisted the outboards throttle up high thered been no time to find a life vest no time for anything just after the explosion shattered the dragons rusty hull knocking sonny li to his belly the ship began to list the water rushing over him and tugging him relentlessly toward the ocean suddenly he found himself off the side of the ship alone and helpless in the frantic hills of water ten fuck judges of hell he thought bitterly in english the water was cold heavy breathtakingly salty the waves slammed him onto his back then lifted him high and dunked him li managed to kick to the surface and looked around for the ghost but in the cloudy air and stinging rain couldnt see anyone li swallowed a mouthful of the sickening water and began gasping and coughing he smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and drank liters of tsingtao beer and maotai soon he was winded and the littleused muscles in his legs started to cramp painfully reluctantly he reached into his belt and withdrew his automatic pistol he released it and the gun sank quickly from his fingers he did the same with the three clips of ammunition in his back pocket this helped his buoyancy some but it wasnt enough he needed a vest anything that floated anything to share the agonizing burden of staying on the surface he thought he heard the sound of an outboard motor and he twisted around as best he could thirty meters away was an orange raft he raised his hand but a wave caught him in the face as he was inhaling and his lungs filled with stinging water searing pain in his chest air i need air another wave slammed into him he sank below the surface tugged down by the great muscles of gray water he glanced at his hands why werent they moving paddle kick dont let the sea suck you down he struggled once more to the surface dont let he inhaled more water dont let it his vision began to crinkle to black ten judges of hell well sonny li thought it seemed that he was about to meet them chapter five they lay at his feet a dozen or so in the cold soup at the bottom of the raft caught between the mountains of water beneath them and the lacerating rain from above their hands desperately gripped the rope that circled the orange raft sam chang reluctant captain of the fragile craft looked over his passengers the two families his own and the wus huddled in the back of the raft around him in the front were dr john sung and the two others whod escaped from the hold whom chang knew only by their first names chaohua and his wife rose a wave crashed over them soaking the hapless occupants even more changs wife meimei pulled off her sweater and wrapped it around the tiny daughter of the scarfaced woman the girl chang recalled with a pang was named poyee which meant treasured child shed been the goodluck mascot of their voyage go wu cried go for shore we have to look for the others hes shooting at us chang looked at the boiling sea but the ghost was nowhere to be seen well go soon but we have to rescue anyone who can be saved look for them seventeenyearold william struggled to his knees and squinted through the sharp spray wus teenage daughter did the same wu shouted something but his head was turned away and chang couldnt hear the words chang entwined his arm around the rope and pushed his feet hard against an oar clamp to brace his body as he struggled to nurse the raft in a circle around the fuzhou dragon twenty meters away the ship slipped farther into the water a blast of foamy water occasionally shooting high as air escaped from a rent in the side of a porthole or hatch the groaning like that of an animal in pain rose and fell there william cried i think i see somebody no wu qichen called we have to leave what are you waiting for william was pointing yes father there chang could see a dark lump next to a much smaller white lump ten meters from them a head and a hand perhaps leave them wu called the ghost will see us hell shoot us ignoring him chang steered closer to the lumps which indeed turned out to be a man he was pale and choking thrashing the air a look of terror on his face sonny li was his name chang recalled while most of the immigrants had spent time talking and reading to one another several of the men traveling without families had kept to themselves li was among these thered been something ominous about him hed sat alone for the entire voyage sullen occasionally glaring at the children who were noisy around him and often sneaking up on deck which was strictly forbidden by the ghost when hed talk at all li would ask too many questions about what the families planned to do when they got to new york and where they would live subjects that wise illegal immigrants didnt discuss still li was a human being in need and chang would try to save him the man was swallowed up by a wave leave him wu whispered angrily hes gone from the front of the raft the young wife rose called please lets go chang turned the raft into a large wave to keep from tipping over by the time they were stable again chang saw a flash of orange about fifty meters away rising and falling it was the ghosts raft the snakehead started toward them a wave rose between the two crafts and they lost sight of each other momentarily chang gunned the throttle and turned toward the drowning man down everybody down he reversed the motor quickly just as they reached li leaned over the thick rubber and grabbed the immigrant by the shoulder pulling him into the raft where he collapsed on the floor coughing fiercely another gunshot a burst of water flew up near them as chang sped the raft around the dragon putting the sinking ship between them and the ghost once more the snakeheads attention turned away from them for a moment when he saw several other people in the water crew members bobbing on the surface in orange life vests about twenty or thirty meters away from the killer the ghost sped toward the two his motor running full understanding now that the man was going to kill them they waved their arms desperately toward chang and kicked furiously away from the approaching raft chang gauged the distance to the crewmen wondering if he could reach them before the snakehead was close enough to have a clear shot the mist and rain and the rolling waves would make it hard for the ghost to shoot accurately yes he thought he could do it he started to apply the power suddenly a voice was in his ear no its time to leave it was his father chang jiechi whod spoken the old man had pulled himself to his knees and was leaning close to his son take your family to safety chang nodded yes baba using the affectionate chinese term for father he aimed the raft toward shore and turned the motor up full a minute later came the crack of a gun firing then another as the snakehead murdered the two crew members sam changs soul cried in dismay at the sounds forgive me he thought to the sailors forgive me glancing back he saw an orange shape through the fog the ghosts raft coming after them he felt the despair in his bones as a dissident in china sam chang was used to fear but in the peoples republic fear was an insidious unease that you learned to live with it was nothing like this the terror of seeing a mad killer hunting down your beloved family and companions stay down everyone stay down he concentrated on keeping the raft upright and making as much speed as possible another shot the bullet struck the water nearby if the ghost hit the rubber theyd sink in minutes a huge unearthly groan filled the air the fuzhou dragon turned completely on her side and vanished under the surface the massive wave created by the sinking ship rolled outward like the shock ring from a bomb blast the immigrants raft was too far away to be affected but the ghosts was much closer to the ship the snakehead looked back and saw the tall wave heading toward him he veered away and after a moment was lost to sight though he was a professor an artist a political activist sam chang was also like many chinese more accepting of spirituality and portents than a western intellectual might be he thought for a moment that guan yin the goddess of mercy might have interceded on their behalf and sent the ghost to a watery death but only a moment later john sung who was facing backward shouted hes still there hes coming the ghost is coming after us so guan yin is busy elsewhere today sam chang thought bitterly if were going to survive well have to do it on our own he adjusted their course toward land and sped away from the limp corpses and the flotsam that were like floating tombstones marking the graves of captain sen and his crew and the many people whod become changs friends over the past weeks he scuttled the ship lon sellittos voice was a whisper christ the phone dropped away from his ear what harold peabody said shocked a fat hand rose to his cumbersome glasses and removed them he sank it the detective nodded a grim confirmation lord no dellray said lincoln rhymes head one of the few parts of his physique that was still mobile turned toward the heavyset cop shocked at this news he felt a wave of heat pass through his entire body solely an emotional sensation of course when it sped below his neck dellray stopped pacing and peabody and coe stared at each other sellitto looked down at the yellow parquet as he listened once more into the phone and then looked up jesus linc the ships gone with everybody on board oh no the coast guard doesnt know exactly what happened but they picked up an underwater explosion and ten minutes later the dragon vanished from the radar casualties dellray asked no idea the cutters still a few miles away and they dont know the location nobody on board the dragon hit any emergency distress signals they send out the exact coordinates rhyme stared at the map of long island its eastern end split like a fishtail his eye was on a red sticker that marked the dragons approximate location how far offshore about a mile rhymes sweeping mind had run through a halfdozen logical scenarios of what might happen when the coast guard interdicted the fuzhou dragon some optimistic others involving some injury and the loss of life criminal apprehension was a tradeoff and you could minimize the risks but never completely eliminate them but drowning everyone on board all those families and children no that thought had never occurred to him christ hed lain in his luxurious bed and listened to the inss little problem of the ghosts whereabouts as if it were a diverting game at a cocktail party then hed drawn his conclusions and snappily given them the solution and hed let it go at that never thinking one step further never thinking that the immigrants might be at such terrible risk illegalsre called the vanished if they try to cheat a snakehead theyre killed if they complain theyre killed they just disappear forever lincoln rhyme was furious with himself he knew how dangerous the ghost was he should have anticipated this deadly turn he closed his eyes momentarily and adjusted the burden somewhere in his soul give up the dead he often told himself and the cs techs whod worked for him and he reiterated this command silently now but he couldnt quite give them up not these poor people the sinking of the dragon was different these dead werent corpses at a crime scene whose glassy eyes and rictus grin you learned to ignore in order to do your job here were whole families dead because of him after theyd interdicted the ship arrested the ghost and run the crime scene his involvement in the case would end rhyme had thought and hed get back to preparing for his surgery but now he knew he couldnt abandon the case the hunter within him had to find this man and bring him to justice dellrays phone rang and he answered after a brief conversation he snapped off the call with a long finger heresa deal the coast guard thinks a coupla motorized raftsre heading toward shore he stalked to the map and pointed probly around here easton little town on the road to orient point they cant get a chopper in the air with the storm beings nasty as it is but they got some cutters on the way to look for survivors and were going to get our people at port jefferson out to where the raftsre headed alan coe brushed his red hair only slightly darker than sachss and said to peabody i want to go out there the ins supervisor replied pointedly im not making personnel decisions around here a nonetoosubtle comment about the fact that dellray and the fbi were running the show one of many such barbs that had been exchanged between the two agents over the past few days how bout it fred coe asked nup the preoccupied agent said but i dellray shook his head emphatically theres nothin you can do coe if they collar him you can go question him in detention jabber at him all you want but thiss a tactical apprehension op now and that aint your specialty the young agent had provided good intelligence about the ghost but rhyme thought he was difficult to work with he was still angry and resentful that he hadnt been allowed to actually be on board the cutter interdicting the ship another battle dellray had had to fight well thats bullshit coe dropped moodily into an office chair without a response dellray sniffed his unlit cigarette tucked it behind his ear and took another call after he hung up he said to the team were trying to set up roadblocks on the smaller highways out of the area routes and but its rush hour and nobodys got the balls to close the long island expressway or sunrise highway sellitto said we can call the toll takers at the tunnel and the bridges dellray shrugged thats somethin but its not enough hell chinatown s that boys turf once hes there itll be hell to find him we gotta get him on the beach if theres anyway and when rhyme asked are the life rafts going to land theyre guessin twenty twentyfive minutes and our folkre fifty miles away from easton peabody asked isnt there any way to get somebody out there sooner rhyme debated for a moment then said into the microphone attached to his wheelchair command telephone the indianapolis pace car was a general motors camaro super sport convertible for this honor gm picked the strongest of their muscle car line the ss fitted with a cubicinch turbojet v engine which could churn horsepower and if you were inclined to tinker with the vehicle by removing sound deadeners undercoating sway bars and interior wheel wells and playing around with the pulleys and cylinder heads for instance you could goose the effective hp up to which made it a boss machine for drag racing but a bitch to drive at miles per hour through a gale squeezing the leatherclad wheel feeling the pain in her arthritic fingers amelia sachs piloted the car eastbound on the long island expressway she had a blue flasher on the dash a suction cup doesnt stick well to convertible roofs and wove perilously in and out of the commuter traffic as she and rhyme had decided when hed called five minutes before and told her to get the hell out to easton sachs was onehalf of the advance team which if they were lucky might get to the beach at the same time the ghost and any surviving immigrants did the other half of the impromptu team was the young officer from the nypd emergency services unit sitting next to her the esu was the tactical branch of the police department the swat team and sachs well rhyme actually had decided that she should have some backup with firepower of the sort that now sat in the mans lap a heckler koch mp machine gun miles behind them now were the esu the crime scene bus a halfdozen suffolk county troopers ambulances and assorted ins and fbi vehicles making their way through the vicious storm as best they could okay said the esu officer well now he offered this in response to a brief bit of hydroplaning sachs calmly brought the camaro back under control recalling that shed also removed the steel plates behind the backseat put in a fuel cell in lieu of the heavy gas tank and replaced the spare with fixaflat and a plug kit the ss was about pounds lighter than when her father had bought it in the seventies could use a little of that ballast now she thought and snipped another skid short okay were okay now the esu cop said apparently far more comfortable in a shootout than driving down the wide expanse of the long island expressway her phone rang she juggled the unit and answered it say miss the esu cop asked you gonna use one of those handsfree things im just thinking it might be better and this from a man dressed like robocop she laughed plugged the earpiece in and upshifted hows the progress sachs rhyme asked doing the best i can but we turn off onto surface roads in a few miles i may have to slow up for some of the red lights may the esu cop muttered any survivors rhyme sachs asked nothing further he answered the coast guard can only confirm two rafts looks like most people didnt get off sachs said to the criminalist i hear that tone rhyme its not your fault appreciate the sentiment sachs thats not an issue now you driving carefully oh yeah she said calmly steering into the spin that took the car forty degrees off center her heart rate rising not a single digit the camaro straightened as if it were on guy wires and continued down the expressway its speed goosed up to the esu cop closed his eyes its going to be close sachs keep your weapon handy it always is another brief skid were getting calls from the coast guard cutter sachs ive got to go he paused for a moment then said search well but watch your back she laughed i like that we need to print it up on tshirts for the crime scene unit they hung up the expressway ended and she skidded off onto a smaller highway twentyfive miles to easton where the lifeboats would land shed never been there citygirl sachs wondered what the topography was like would it be a beach rocky cliffs would she have to climb her arthritis had been bad lately and this thick humidity doubled the pain and stiffness wondering too if the ghost was still at the beach were there plenty of hiding places for him to snipe from she glanced down at the speedometer ease back but the treads on her wheels were true and the only moisture on her palms was from the rain that had drenched her back at port jefferson she kept her foot near the floor as the launch smashed through the water closer to the shore the rocks grew more distinct and more jagged sam chang squinted through the rain and spray there were some short stretches of beach ahead covered with pebbles and dirty sand but much of the shoreline was dark rock and bluffs well over their heads and to reach a portion of beach where they could land hed have to maneuver through an obstacle course of jutting stone hes still there behind us wu shouted chang looked back and could see the tiny orange dot of the ghosts raft it was heading directly for them but was making slower progress than theirs the ghost was hampered by the way he handled the raft he aimed right toward the shore and fought the waves which slowed his progress but chang true to his taoist leanings piloted his craft differently he sought the natural flow of the water not fighting it but steering around the stronger crests in a serpentine pattern and using the shorebound waves to speed them forward more quickly the distance between them and the snakehead was increasing before the ghost landed there should be enough time to find the trucks that were waiting to take them to chinatown chang estimated the truck drivers wouldnt know about the sinking but chang would tell them that the coast guard was after them and order the men to leave immediately if they insisted on waiting chang and wu and the others would overpower them and drive the trucks themselves he studied the shoreline and beyond past the beach were trees and grass it was hard to see in the windblown rain and mist but he detected what looked like a road some lights too not far away a cluster of them a small village it seemed wiping the stinging seawater from his eyes chang watched the people at his feet falling silent as they gazed at the shore ahead of them the turbulent currents here riptides and whirlpools the approaching rocks sharp as knives dark as dried blood then just ahead of them under the surface of the water appeared a bank of rock chang throttled back fast and turned hard to the side just missing the stone shelf the raft was now sideways buffeted by the ragged waves which flooded the vessel they nearly capsized once then again chang tried to steer through a gap in the bank but the motor suddenly cut out he grabbed the lanyard and tugged hard a chug then silence again a dozen times but nothing happened the motor didnt even turn over his older son scrabbled forward and tipped the gasoline can empty william shouted desperate weak with fear for his familys safety he looked behind them the fog was thicker now and obscured them but it also hid the ghost how close was he the raft rose on a high wave then dropped into a gully of water with a jarring crash down everybody down chang shouted stay low he dropped to his knees in the dark water sloshing on the floor of the raft he grabbed the oar and tried to use it as a rudder but the waves and current were too powerful the raft too heavy a fist of water struck him and ripped the oar from his hands chang fell backward he glanced in the direction they were headed and he saw a line of rocks just ahead a few meters away the water caught the launch like a surfboard and sped it forward they struck the rocks with stunning force bow first the rubber shell ripped open with a gasping hiss and began to deflate sonny li john sung and the young couple in the front chaohua and rose were pitched out into the turbulent water just past the rocks and swept away in the surf the two families the wus and the changs were in the rear of the raft which remained partially inflated and they managed to hold on the raft struck the rocks again wus wife was thrown hard into a ledge of stone but she didnt go overboard screaming she fell back into the raft blood covering her arm and lay stunned on the floor no one else was injured by the impact then the raft was past the rocks and headed toward shore deflating quickly chang heard a distant cry for help from one of the four whod vanished when they struck the rock but he couldnt tell where the shout had come from the raft slid over another rock low in the water fifteen meters from shore they were trapped in the surf now battered and being dragged toward the pebbly beach wu qichen and his daughter struggled to keep his injured and halfconscious wife above the surface her arm torn open and bleeding badly in meimeis arms poyee the baby had stopped crying and was staring listlessly around her but the motor of the raft was hung up on a rock ledge trapping them eight or nine meters from shore the water wasnt deep here two meters but the waves were still pounding them hard the shore he shouted coughing water now the swim took forever even chang the strongest among them was gasping for breath and racked by cramps before he reached land finally under his feet he felt stones slippery with kelp and slime and stumbled forward out of the water he fell once hard but quickly regained his foothold and helped his father out of the water exhausted they all stumbled to a nearby shelter on the beach open on the sides but with a corrugated roof that protected them from the slashing rain the families collapsed on the dark sand underneath it coughing water crying gasping praying sam chang finally managed to stand he gazed out to sea but saw no sign of the ghosts raft or the immigrants whod been swept overboard then he sank down to his knees and lay his forehead on the sand their companions and friends were dead and they themselves injured tired beyond words and pursued by a killer still sam chang reflected they were alive and were on firm land he and his family had at last finished the endless journey that had taken them halfway around the world to their new home america the beautiful country chapter six half a kilometer out to sea the ghost hunched over his cell phone trying to protect it from the rain and waves as his raft plowed through the water toward the piglets the reception was bad the signal was bouncing via satellite through fuzhou and singapore after it left his phone but he managed to get through to jerry tang a bangshou he sometimes used in new yorks chinatown and who was now waiting somewhere on the shore nearby to pick him up breathless from the rough ride the ghost managed to describe to the driver more or less where hed be landing about three or four hundred meters east from what seemed to be a strip of stores and houses what weapons do you have the ghost shouted what tang shouted he had to repeat the question several times weapons but tang was a debt collector more of a businessman than an enforcer and it turned out that he had with him only a pistol gan the ghost spat out fuck armed only with his old model handgun hed hoped for an automatic weapon of some kind the coast guard tang told him the transmission lost in static and the sound of the wind theyre on here im listening scanner have to get away where the ghost shouted if you see any of the piglets kill them did you hear me theyre on the shore nearby you find them kill them kill them you want but a wave washed over the side of the raft and drenched him the phone went silent and the ghost glanced at the screen it was dead shorted out disgusted he flung it to the floor a wall of rock loomed and the ghost steered around it making for a broad beach far to the left of the small town it would take some time to get back to where the piglets had landed but he didnt want to risk injuring himself on the outcroppings of stone still beaching the raft proved to be harrowing as he closed in on the sand the small craft rose on the crest of a wave and nearly tipped over but the ghost throttled back fast and the raft settled onto the water a wave though caught him in the back and knocked him to the floor of the boat drenching him and spinning the raft sideways it slammed into the shore in an explosion of surf and tossed its occupant hard onto the beach the propeller tipped out of the water and the motor screamed as it raced the ghost afraid the sound would give him away crawled frantically back to the engine and managed to shut it off he saw jerry tang in a silver fourbyfour bmw on a sandy asphalt road about twenty meters from the shore he rose and jogged toward the vehicle fat unshaven tang caught sight of him and drove forward the ghost leaned down to the window on the drivers side did you see the others the nervous man said we have to go he nodded at a police scanner the coast guard knows were here theyre sending the police to search the others the ghost snapped the piglets i didnt see anybody else but i cant find my bangshou either i dont know if he got off the ship the ghost scanned the shoreline i havent seen anyone tang said his voice high but we cant stay here from the corner of his eye the ghost saw motion near the surf a man in gray cloth was crawling on the rocks away from the water like an injured animal the ghost stepped away from the truck and pulled his gun from his belt wait here what are you doing tang asked desperately we cant stay here anymore theyre coming theyll be here in ten minutes dont you understand me but the ghost was paying no attention to the thug as he walked back across the road the piglet looked up and saw the ghost approaching but the man had apparently broken his leg in the landing and couldnt even stand much less flee he began to crawl desperately back to the water the ghost was curious why he was even bothering sonny li opened his eyes and thanked the ten judges of hell not for surviving the sinking but because for the first time in two weeks the slippery twist of nausea within his gut was virtually gone when the raft had hit the rocks he and john sung and the young couple had been thrown into the water and swept away by the strong current li had immediately lost sight of the other three and had been dragged down the beach for what seemed like a kilometer until hed been able to kick his way onto the sand then crawling as far away as he could from the ocean li collapsed hed lain motionless under the pounding rain as the seasickness dissipated and the throbbing in his head lessened now struggling to his feet li started slowly toward the road his skin irritated from the cloth of his jeans and sweatshirt which were filled with sand and saturated with the pungent residue of salt water he could see nothing in either direction he remembered though the lights of a small village to his right and it was in that direction that he now began to walk along the sandswept road where was the ghost li wondered then as if in answer came a brief pop which li recognized immediately as a pistol shot it reverberated through the dark wet dawn but was it the ghost or some local resident everyone knew that all americans carried guns maybe it was a us public security officer better to be safe he was eager to find the ghost quickly but he knew he had to be careful he stepped off the road into some brush where he was less visible and started forward as fast as his cramped and exhausted legs could carry him at the sound the families paused it was wu qichen began yes sam chang muttered a gunshot hes killing us hes tracking us down and killing us i know chang snapped back his heart cried for them for dr sung for sonny li for the couple whoever among them had just died but what could he do chang looked at his father and observed that chang jiechi was breathing hard but despite the battering in the raft and the swim to shore the old man didnt seem to be in great pain he nodded to his son meaning it was all right to continue the cluster of people started walking once again through the rain and wind their concerns about begging or coercing the drivers to take them to chinatown were unfounded thered been no trucks waiting for them chang supposed that the vehicles were at a different location altogether or perhaps as soon as the ghost decided to scuttle the ship hed called and had them return he and wu had spent several minutes calling for sung and li and the others whod been washed overboard but then chang had seen the orange raft of the snakehead approaching and hed led the two families off the road into the grass and bushes where theyd be out of sight and they made their way toward the lights where he hoped to find a truck the beacons that drew them turned out to be a line of restaurants a petrol station several stores selling souvenirs like on the waterfront at xiamen ten or twelve houses a church the hour was just around dawn perhaps or but there were signs of life a dozen cars were parked in front of the two restaurants including a driverless one with the motor running but it was a small sedan and chang needed a vehicle with room for ten and he needed one whose theft wouldnt be noticed for at least two or three hours the length of time hed been told it would take them to get to chinatown in new york city he told the others to wait behind a tall hedge of bushes and motioned his son william and wu to follow him crouching they moved behind the buildings there were two large trucks behind the petrol station but they were both well in view of a young attendant in the garage rain pelted the glass making visibility poor but he would have noticed immediately if theyd started to drive a truck away twenty meters farther on was a darkened house and behind it was a pickup truck but chang didnt want to expose his father or the children to the rain and weather also ten shipwrecked chinese would be easily spotted in a rickety old vehicle of this sort driving toward new york city like a band of the floating population itinerant laborers who travel from town to town in china looking for work stay out of the mud chang ordered his son and wu walk only on the grass or branches or stones i dont want to leave footprints caution was instinctive for chang with both public security bureau and peoples liberation army agents constantly following them dissidents in china learn quickly to obscure their movements they moved on through brush and trees whipped by the ferocious wind past more houses some dark some showing signs of families waking televisions flickering breakfasts being prepared seeing this poignant evidence of normal life chang was stabbed by the hopelessness of their plight but as hed learned to do in china where the government had taken so much away from him he pushed these sentimental feelings aside and urged his son and wu to move more quickly finally they came to the last building on this strip of habitation a small church dark and apparently unoccupied behind the weathered building they found an old white van from his hours on the internet and watching tv chang knew a little english but these words he didnt understand at his urging though both of his sons had studied the language and american culture for years william glanced at the van and explained it says pentecostal baptist church of easton another soft crack in the distance chang froze at the sound the ghost had killed another one of them lets go an anxious wu said hurry see if its open but the vans door was locked as chang looked around for something they could use to break the window william surveyed the lock closely he called over the noisy wind do you have my knife your knife the one i gave you on the ship to cut the rope holding the raft that was yours what on earth had his son been doing with a weapon like that it was a switchblade do you have it the boy repeated no i dropped it getting into the raft the boy grimaced but chang ignored the expression why it was almost impertinent and scanned the rainpelted ground he found a piece of metal pipe and swung it hard into the window of the van the glass shattered into a hundred tiny pieces of ice he climbed into the passenger seat and looked through the map box for keys he couldnt find any and stepped out onto the muddy ground glancing at the building he wondered if there would be a set inside the church and if so where an office there might be a caretaker inside what if the man heard and confronted them chang believed that he couldnt hurt anyone innocent even if he heard a loud snap and spun around in alarm his son was crouched in the drivers seat and had shattered the plastic housing of the ignition lock with a kick from his boot as chang watched astonished and dismayed the boy pulled out wires and began brushing them against each other suddenly the radio came on with a blare he will always love you let our savior into your heart william touched a button on the dash and the volume lowered he touched other wires together a spark the engine fired up chang stared in disbelief how did you know how to do that the boy shrugged tell me wu clutched changs arm lets go we have to get our families and leave the ghost is looking for us the father pierced his son with a look of shock he expected the boy to lower his eyes in shame but william stared back coldly in a way that chang himself never would have done with his own father at any age please wu begged lets go back for the rest no chang said after a moment have them come here follow our path and make sure they dont leave any footprints wu hurried off to get them in the van william found a booklet of maps of the area and studied them carefully he nodded as if memorizing directions resisting his desire to interrogate his son about hotwiring the ignition chang asked him do you know where to go i can figure it out the boy looked up do you want me to drive then he added bluntly youre not very good at it like most urban chinese sam changs main means of transportation was a bicycle chang blinked at these words of his sons spoken once again in a tone that approached insolence then wu appeared with the rest of the immigrants and chang ran forward to help his wife and father into the van calling back to his son yes you drive chapter seven hed killed two of the piglets on the beach the injured man and a woman but thered been about a dozen people in the raft where were the rest a horn blared the ghost whirled around it was jerry tang drawing his attention he held up the police scanner his gestures frantic the police will be here any minute we have to go the ghost turned away and scanned the beach once more the road where had they gotten to maybe theyd with a squeal of tires tangs fourbyfour pulled into the road accelerating fast no stop seized by fury the ghost aimed his pistol and fired once the slug hit the rear door but the vehicle continued not slowing to an intersection and then skidded through the turn and disappeared the ghost stood frozen the pistol at his side staring through the mist at the road where his means of escape had just vanished he was eighty miles from his safehouses in manhattan his assistant was missing and probably dead he had no money and no cell phone dozens of policemen and troopers were on their way and tang had just abandoned him he could he tensed not far away a white van suddenly appeared out of a field on the other side of a church and turned onto the road it was the piglets the ghost lifted his pistol again but the vehicle disappeared into the fog lowering the gun the ghost took several deep breaths after a moment he grew serene he was plagued by troubles at the moment yes but hed experienced much adversity in his life far worse than this you are part of the old you will reform your ways you will die for your old beliefs a reversal hed come to learn was merely a temporary unbalance and even the most horrific events in his life had ultimately been harmonized by good fortune his abiding philosophy was found in one word naixin this translated as patience in chinese but meant something more in the ghosts mind the english equivalent would be all in good time he had survived these fortysome years because hed outlasted trouble and danger and sorrow for the moment the piglets had gotten away their deaths would have to wait now there was nothing to do but escape from the police and the ins he put his old pistol into his pocket and trudged through the rain and wind along the beach toward the lights of the small town the closest building was a restaurant in front of which was a car with its engine running so some good fortune already and then glancing out to sea he saw something that actually made him laugh yet more good luck not far offshore he saw another piglet a man struggling to stay afloat at least he could kill one more of them before he escaped to the city the ghost pulled his gun from his pocket and started back toward the shoreline the wind was wearing him down making his way toward the small town sonny li slogged through the sand he was a slight man and in the hard dangerous world in which he made his way he relied on bluff and surprise and wits weapons too of course not on physical strength he was now at his limits exhausted from this mornings ordeal the wind twice it actually knocked him to his knees no more he thought despite the risk of being seen struggling through the soft sand was simply too much for him and he stumbled back onto the rainswept asphalt road and continued toward the lights of the small village he pushed forward as best he could afraid that the snakehead would leave before li found him but a moment later he received the reassurance that the man was still here several more gunshots li struggled up a hill and peered into the streaming wind and rain but he could see no one the sound had apparently been carried some distance on the wind discouraged he continued forward for ten endless minutes he battled his way along the road throwing his head back occasionally and letting the rain soak his parched mouth after all the seawater hed swallowed he was desperately thirsty then he saw on his right a small orange life raft sitting on the beach he assumed that it was the ghosts he looked up and down the shore for the snakehead but it was impossible to see very far through the mist and the rain he started toward the raft thinking that perhaps he could follow the mans footprints and find him hiding in town but as he took a step off the road a flashing light appeared he wiped the rain from his eyes and squinted the light was blue and moving rapidly toward him along the road ins security bureau officers li hurried into some dense bushes on the far side of the asphalt he crouched and watched the light grow brighter as the vehicle in which it was mounted a sporty yellow convertible materialized out of the rain and murk and skidded to a stop meters away in a crouch li began to move slowly toward the car amelia sachs stood on the rainswept beach staring down at the womans body slumped in the grotesque pose of death hes killing them rhyme amelia sachs dismayed whispered into the headset mike of her motorola sp handytalkie hes shot two of them a man and a woman in the back theyre dead shot them the criminalists voice was hollow and she knew that he was shouldering the responsibility for yet more deaths the esu officer trotted toward her holding his machine gun ready no sign of him the man shouted over the wind people in that restaurant a half click up the road said that somebody stole a car about twenty minutes ago the officer gave sachs the description of a honda and the tag number and she relayed it to rhyme lonll put it on the wire he said was he alone think so because of the rain therere no footprints in the sand but i found some in the mud where he was standing to shoot the woman he was by himself then so well assume his bangshous still unaccounted for he couldve gotten to shore in another raft or he mightve been in the wrecked one her hand near her weapon she scanned the scenery fogbleached forms of rocks and dunes and brush surrounded her a man with a gun would be invisible then she said were going to look for the immigrants rhyme she expected him to disagree to tell her to run the scene first before the raging elements destroyed all the evidence but he said simply good luck sachs call me back when you start on the grid the line went dead search well but watch your back the two officers trotted along the beach they came across a second raft a smaller one beached a hundred yards from the first sachss instinctive reaction was to search it for evidence but she stayed true to her immediate mission and arthritis stabbing her joints ran with the wind at her back as she scanned the landscape for the immigrants and signs of an ambush or a hideyhole where the ghost mightve gone to ground they found neither then she heard sirens in the distance carried on the streaming wind and saw the carnival of emergency vehicles speed into town the dozen or so residents whod been ensconced in the restaurant and gas station now braved the weather to find out exactly what kind of excitement the storm had brought to their miniature town the first mission of a crime scene officer is controlling the scene so that contamination is minimal and evidence doesnt vanish either accidentally or at the hands of souvenir hunters or the perp himself masquerading as a bystander sachs reluctantly gave up her search for other immigrants and crew there were plenty of other people to do that now and ran to the nypd blueandwhite crime scene bus to direct the operation as the cs techs roped off the beach with yellow tape sachs pulled the latest in forensic couture over her soaked jeans and tshirt the nypds new crime scene overalls a hooded fullbody suit made of white tyvek prevented the searcher from sloughing off his or her own trace evidence hair skin or sweat for instance and contaminating the scene lincoln rhyme approved of the suit hed lobbied for something similar when hed been running the investigation and resources division which oversaw crime scene sachs wasnt so pleased however the fact that the overalls made her look like an alien from a bad space movie wasnt the problem what troubled her was that it was brilliant white easily spotted by any perps who for whatever reason might wish to hang around the crime scene and try out their marksmanship on cops picking up evidence hence sachss pet name for the garb the bullseye suit a brief canvass of the patrons in the restaurant employees of the gas station and residents living in the few houses on the beach yielded nothing except facts theyd already learned about the honda in which the ghost had escaped no other vehicles had been stolen and no one had seen anybody swimming to shore or hiding out on land or even heard the gunshots over the wind and rain so it fell exclusively to amelia sachs and lincoln rhyme to wring from the crime scene whatever information about the ghost the crew and the immigrants might reside here and what a crime scene it was one of the biggest theyd ever run a mile of beach a road and on the other side of the asphalt strip a maze of scruffy brush millions of places to search and possibly still populated by an armed perp its a bad scene rhyme the rains let up a little but its still coming down hard and the winds twenty miles an hour i know weve got the weather channel on his voice was different now calmer the sound spooked her a bit it reminded her of the eerily placid quality of his voice when he talked about endings about killing himself about finality all the more reason he prodded to get on with the search wouldnt you say she looked up and down the beach its just everythings too big theres too much here how can it be too big sachs we work every scene one foot at a time doesnt matter if its a square mile or three feet it just takes longer besides we love big scenes therere so many wonderful places to find clues wonderful she thought wryly and starting closest to the large deflated raft she began walking the grid the phrase described one technique for physically searching a crime scene for clues in which the cs officer covers the floor or ground in one direction back and forth like mowing a lawn then turns perpendicular and covers the same ground again the theory behind this method of searching is that you see things from one angle that you might miss when looking at them from a different angle although there were dozens of other methods of searching crime scenes all of them faster the grid the most tedious type of search was also the most likely to yield gold it was the one that rhyme insisted that sachs use just as hed done with the officers and techs who worked for him at nypd forensics thanks to lincoln rhyme walking the grid had become synonymous with searching a crime scene among cops in the metropolitan area soon she was out of sight of the village of easton and the only sign that she wasnt alone was the diffuse flashing of the emergency vehicle lights like blood pulsing through pale skin unsettling and eerie but soon the lights too vanished in the fog the solitude and a creepy sense of vulnerability curled snug around her oh man i dont like this the fog was worse here and the sounds of the rain tapping loudly on the hood of her suit the waves and the wind would mask an attackers approach she slapped the grip of her black glock pistol for reassurance and kept on the grid im going to go quiet for a while rhyme ive got this feeling theres somebody still here somebody watching me call me when youre through he said his hesitant tone suggested there was something more he wished to say but after a moment the line clicked off watch your back for the next hour through the wind and rain she searched the beach and road and the foliage beyond like a child hunting for seashells she examined the intact raft in which she found a cell phone and the deflated one which two esu officers had muscled up onto the beach finally she assembled her collection of evidence shell casings blood samples fingerprints and polaroids of footprints then she paused and looked around then she clicked on the radio and was patched through to a cozy town house lightyears away somethings funny rhyme thats not helpful sachs funny what does that mean the immigrants ten or so of them they just vanish i dont understand it they leave a shelter on the beach then cross the road and hide in the bushes i see the prints in the mud on the other side of the road then they just disappear i guess theyve gone inland to hide but i cant find any tracks and nobodys going to give a ride to hitchhikers like them around here and none of the people in town saw any trucks waiting to pick them up there arent any tire treads here anyway all right sachs youve just walked in the ghosts footsteps youve seen what hes done you know who he is youve been where hes been whats going through your mind i youre the ghost now rhyme reminded in a lulling voice youre kwan ang nicknamed gui the ghost youre a multimillionaire a human trafficker a snakehead a killer youve just sunk a ship and killed over a dozen people whats in your mind finding the rest of them she answered immediately finding them and killing them i dont want to leave not yet im not sure why but i have to find them for an instant an image jolted her mind she did see herself as the snakehead filled with a salivating lust to find the immigrants and kill them the sensation was harrowing nothing she whispered is going to stop me good sachs rhyme replied softly as if he was afraid of breaking the thin wire that was connecting a portion of her soul to the snakeheads now think about the immigrants theyre being pursued by someone like that what would they do it took her a moment to transform herself from a heartless murderer and snakehead into one of the poor people on that ship appalled that the man shed paid her lifes savings to had betrayed her in this way had killed people shed grown close to perhaps family members too and was now compelled to kill her im not going to hide she said firmly im getting the hell out of here as fast as i can any way i can as far away as possible we cant go back into the ocean we cant walk we need a ride and how would you get one he asked i dont know she said feeling the frustration of being close to an answer yet having it evade her any houses inland he asked no any trucks at the gas station yes but the troopers asked the attendants none of emre missing anything else sachs scanned the street nothing there cant be nothing sachs he scolded these peoplere running for their lives they escaped somehow the answers there what else do you see she sighed and began reciting i see a stack of discarded tires i see a sailboat upside down i see a carton of empties sam adams beer in front of the church theres a wheelbarrow church rhyme pounced you didnt mention a church before its tuesday morning rhyme the place is closed and esu cleared it get over there sachs now stiffly she began to walk toward the place but had no clue what she might find that would be helpful rhyme explained didnt you do vacation bible school sachs ritz crackers hawaiian punch and jesus on summer afternoons no potluck picnics no youth group conventions once or twice but i spent most of my sundays rebuilding carburetors how do you think churches get the younguns to and from their little theological diversions minivans sachs minivans with room for a dozen people could be she added skeptically and maybe not rhyme conceded but the immigrants didnt sprout wings and fly did they so lets check out the more likely possibilities and as so often happened he was right she walked around to the back of the church and examined the muddy ground footprints tiny cubes of broken safety glass the pipe used to shatter the window the tread marks of a van got it rhyme a bunch of fresh prints damn thats smart they walked on rocks grass and weeds to avoid the mud so they wouldnt leave prints and it looks like they got into the van and it drove away through a field before it turned onto the road so nobodyd see it on the main street rhyme ordered get the scoop on the van from the minister sachs asked a trooper to call the minister of the church a few minutes later the details came back it was a white dodge five years old with the name of the church on the side she took down the tag number then relayed this to rhyme who said he would in turn put out another vehicle locator request in addition to the one on the honda and tell the port authority police to pass the word to the toll takers at the bridges and tunnels on the assumption that the immigrants were headed for chinatown in manhattan she walked the grid carefully behind the church but found nothing else i dont think theres much more we can do here rhyme im going to log the evidence in and get back she disconnected the call returning to the crime scene bus she packed away the tyvek suit then logged in what shed found and attached the chain of custody cards that must accompany every item collected at a crime scene she told the techs to get everything to rhymes town house asap though it seemed hopeless she wanted to make another sweep for survivors her knees were on fire the chronic arthritis inherited from her grandfather the disease often bothered her but now alone she allowed herself the luxury of moving slowly whenever she was among fellow officers she tried hard not to show the pain she was afraid that if the brass got wind of her condition theyd desk her for disability after fifteen minutes though of not finding any sign of more immigrants she started toward her camaro which was the only vehicle left on this portion of the beach she was alone the esu officer whod accompanied her here had opted for a safer ride back to the city the fog was lighter now a half mile away on the other side of the town sachs could just make out two suffolk county rescue trucks and an unmarked ford sedan parked nearby she believed it was an ins vehicle sachs dropped stiffly into the front seat of her camaro found a piece of paper and began to write out notes of what shed observed at the scene to present to rhyme and the team back at his town house the wind buffeted the light car and the rain pelted the steel bodywork furiously sachs happened to glance up in time to see a dramatic spume of seawater flying ten feet into the air as it hit a jutting black rock she squinted hard and wiped the steam off the inside of the windshield with her sleeve what is that an animal some wreckage from the fuzhoudragon no she realized with a start it was a man he clung desperately to the rock sachs grabbed her motorola clicked to the local ops frequency and radioed this is nypd crime scene five eight eight five to suffolk county rescue at easton beach you copy roger five eight eight five go ahead im a half click east of the town ive got a vic in the water i need some help k came the reply were on our way out sachs stepped out of the car and started down to the shore she saw a large wave lift the man off the rock and pitch him into the water he tried to swim but he was injured there was blood on his shirt and the best he could do was keep his head above water but just barely he went down once and struggled to the surface oh brother sachs muttered glancing back at the road the yellow rescue truck was just then moving forward off the sand the immigrant gave a choked cry and slipped under the waves no time to wait for the pros from the police academy she knew the basic lifesaving rule reach throw row then go meaning try to rescue a drowning victim from the shore or a boat before you yourself swim out to save him well the first three werent options at all so she thought go ignoring the searing pain in her knees she ran toward the ocean stripping off her gun and ammo belt at the shoreline she unlaced her standardissue shoes kicked them off and eyes focused on the struggling swimmer waded into the cold turbulent water chapter eight crawling from the bushes sonny li got a better look at the woman with the red hair as she pulled off her shoes and plowed into the rough water then kicked away from the shore toward somebody struggling in the waves li couldnt make out who it was either john sung or the husband of the couple whod sat next to him in the raft but in any case his attention was drawn back immediately to the woman whom hed been studying from his hiding spot in the bush since shed arrived at the beach over an hour ago now she wasnt his type of girl he didnt care for western women at least the ones hed seen around fuzhou they were either on the arms of rich businessmen tall and beautiful casting disdainful glances at the chinese men whod stare at them or tourists with their husbands and children badly dressed casting disdainful glances at men spitting on the sidewalks and the bicyclists who never let them cross the street this woman though intrigued him at first he hadnt been able to figure out what she was doing here shed arrived in her bright yellow car accompanied by a soldier with a machine gun then shed turned her back and hed glimpsed nypd on her windbreaker so she was a public security bureau officer safely hidden across the road hed watched her search for survivors and clues sexy hed thought despite his vast preference for quiet elegant chinese women and that hair what a color it inspired him to give her a nickname hongse pronounced hoankseh chinese for red looking up the road li saw a yellow emergency truck speeding toward them as soon as it turned into a shallow parking lot and stopped he crawled to the edge of the road there was a chance hed be spotted of course but he had to act now before she returned he waited until the rescue workers attention was on hongse and then scrabbled across the road and up to the yellow car it was an old one the sort you saw in american tv shows like kojak and hill streetblues he wasnt interested in stealing the car itself most of the security bureau officers and soldiers had left but there were still enough nearby to pursue and capture him especially behind the wheel of a car as bright as an egg yolk no at the moment he just wanted a gun and some money opening the passenger door of the yellow car he eased inside and began going through the map box no weapons he angrily thought of his tokarev pistol sitting at the bottom of the ocean no cigarettes either fuck her he then went through her purse and found about fifty dollars in onecolor money li pocketed the cash and looked over a paper shed been writing on his spoken english was good thanks to american movies and the follow me program on radio beijing but his reading skills were terrible which hardly seemed fair considering that english only had or so letters while the chinese language had after some stumbling he recognized the ghosts real name kwan ang in english and made out some other writing he folded this up and slipped it into his pocket then scattered the rest of the sheets on the ground outside the open drivers side door so it would look as if the wind had blown them away another car was approaching a black sedan that smelled to li like a government vehicle crouching he made his way back to the road hidden once more in the bushes he glanced out into the turbulent sea observing now that hongse seemed to be struggling in the choppy ocean just as much as the drowning man he felt a pang that such a beautiful woman was in danger but that wasnt really his concern finding the ghost and simply staying alive were his priorities now the effort of swimming against the battering surf to reach the drowning immigrant had nearly exhausted amelia sachs and she found she had to kick furiously to keep them both above water her knee and hip joints protested in pain the immigrant himself wasnt any help at all he was of medium build and trim without much fat for buoyancy he kicked his feet lethargically and his left arm was useless thanks to a gunshot wound in his chest gasping spitting out the vile salt water that kept spilling into her mouth and nose she fought her way toward shore the water stung her eyes and blurred her vision but she could see on the sand near the breaking surf two medics with a stretcher and a large green oxygen tank motioning broadly for her to swim toward them thanks boys im trying she steered toward them as best she could but the undertow was fierce she glanced back at the rock the immigrant had been clinging to and saw that despite her massive efforts theyd swum only about ten feet kick harder harder reciting to herself one of her personal mantras when you move they cant getcha another eight or nine feet but sachs finally had to stop and catch her breath watching in dismay as the undertow tugged them back out to sea come on get out of here the listless immigrant now nearly unconscious kept pulling her down sachs kicked harder a cramp seized her calf and she cried out and sank fast the murky gray water filled with seaweed and sand swallowed her up one hand holding the immigrants shirt the other pounding on her own calf to break the cramp she struggled to hold her breath for as long as she could oh lincoln she thought going down farther into the gray linen water then jesus whats this a barracuda a shark a black eel shot out of the foggy water and grabbed her around the chest she instinctively reached for the switchblade she kept in her back pocket but her arm was pinned to her body by the terrible fish it tugged her upward and a few seconds later she was on the surface sucking sweet air into her stinging lungs she looked down the fish turned out to be a mans arm encased in a black wetsuit the suffolk county rescue diver spit a regulator from a pony bottle of compressed air out of his mouth and said its okay miss i got you its okay a second diver was gripping the immigrant keeping his lolling head out of the water cramp sachs gasped cant move my leg hurts he reached underwater with one hand straightened her leg and then pressed her toes toward her body stretching out the muscles of her calf after a moment the pain went away she nodded dont kick just relax ill take you in he began to tow her and she leaned her head back concentrated on breathing his powerful legs aided by the flippers moved them rapidly toward shore he said that was gutsy going out most people wouldve just watched him die they swam through the chill water for what seemed like forever finally sachs felt pebbles under her feet she staggered onto the shore and took the blanket one of the medics offered her after catching her breath she walked over to the immigrant who was lying on the stretcher an oxygen mask over his face his eyes were dazed but he was conscious his shirt was open and the medic was cleaning a bloody wound with disinfectant and bandages sachs brushed as much sand off her feet and legs as she could then replaced her shoes and hooked her gunbelt around her once more how is he wounds not bad the shooter hit him in the chest but from an angle but well have to watch the hypothermia and exhaustion can i ask him a few questions just the minimum for now the first paramedic said he needs oxygen and rest whats your name sachs asked the immigrant he lifted away the oxygen mask john sung im amelia sachs with the new york city police department she showed him her shield and id as procedure dictated she asked what happened the man lifted away the oxygen mask again i was thrown out of our raft the snakehead on the ship we call him the ghost he saw me and came down to the shore he shot at me and missed i swam underwater but i had to come back for air he was waiting he shot again and hit me i pretended to be dead and when i looked again i saw him get into a red car and drive off i tried to swim to the beach but i couldnt i just held on to those rocks and waited sachs studied the man he was handsome and appeared to be in good shape shed recently seen a tv special on china and had learned that unlike americans who exercise temporarily usually out of vanity many chinese work out all their lives the man asked how are he coughed again the spasms turned violent the medic let him cough out the water for a few moments and when sung stopped knelt down and placed the oxygen mask on his face sorry officer but he really needs to suck air now but sung lifted the mask off how are the others are they safe it wasnt nypd procedure to share information with witnesses but she saw the concern in his eyes and she said im sorry two are dead he closed his eyes and with his right hand clutched a stone amulet he wore on a leather strap around his neck how many were on the raft she asked he thought for a moment fourteen altogether then he asked did he get away the ghost were doing everything we can to find him again sungs face filled with dismay and he again squeezed the amulet the medic handed her the immigrants wallet she flipped through it most of it was turning to mush from the seawater and nearly all of the contents were in chinese but one card that was still legible was in english it identified him as dr sung kai kai is that your first name he nodded but i use john mostly youre a doctor yes medical doctor he nodded again sachs was looking at a picture of two young children a boy and a girl she felt a jolt of horror thinking that theyd been on the ship and your her voice faded sung understood my children theyre at home in fujian theyre living with my parents the medic was standing near his patient unhappy that he kept lifting off the mask but sachs had her job to do too dr sung do you have any idea where the ghost might be going does he have a house or apartment here in this country a company any friends no he never talked to us he never had anything to do with us he treated us like animals how about the other immigrants do you know where they mightve gone sung shook his head no im sorry we were going to houses somewhere in new york but they never told us where his eyes strayed back to the water we thought maybe the coast guard shot us with a cannon but then we realized he sank the ship himself his voice was astonished he locked the door in our hold and blew the boat up with everyone on board a man in a suit an ins agent sachs remembered meeting in port jefferson stepped out of the black car which had just joined the rescue vehicle on the sand he pulled on a windbreaker and crunched through the sand toward them sachs handed him sungs wallet he read through it and crouched down dr sung im with the us immigration and naturalization service do you have a valid passport and entry visa sachs thought the question was absurd if not provocative but she supposed this was one of the formalities that needed to be performed no sir sung replied then im afraid were going to have to detain you for illegally entering united states territory im seeking political asylum thats fine the agent said wearily but were still going to have to detain you until the bond hearing i understand sung said the agent asked the medic how is he hell be all right but we need to get him to a trauma center wheres he being processed sachs interrupted to ask the ins agent can he go to your manhattan detention center hes a witness in the case and weve got a task force working there the ins agent shrugged doesnt matter to me ill do the paperwork sachs rocked from one leg to the other and winced as the pain shot through her knee and hip still absently clutching the amulet around his neck sung studied her and said in a low heartfelt voice thank you miss for what you saved my life she nodded holding his dark eyes for a moment then the medic replaced the oxygen mask a flash of white from nearby caught her eye and amelia sachs looked up to see that shed left the door of the camaro open and that the wind was blowing her notes on the crime scene out to sea wincing she trotted back to her car ii the beautiful country tuesday the hour of the dragon am to the hour of the rooster pm the battle is won by the player who sees the furthest the one that is who can see through his opponents move can guess his plan and counter it and who when attacking anticipates all the defensive moves of his opponent the game of weichi chapter nine the life of a tollbooth operator guarding the portals to new york city is not particularly glamorous occasionally theres a little excitement like the time a thief stuck up a toll taker and netted a clean the only problem being that the robber struck at the entrance to the triborough bridge at the other end of which a dozen bemused cops were waiting for him at the only possible exit he could take but the operator sitting in a queens midtown tunnel booth this stormy morning just after am a retired nyc transit cop working parttime as a toll taker hadnt seen any serious trouble in years and he was excited that something had happened to break the monotony all the tollbooth operators in manhattan had gotten a priority call from port authority headquarters about a ship thatd sunk off the coast of long island one of those illegal immigrant ships the word was that some of the chinese on board were now headed into town as was the smuggler himself they were in a white van bearing the name of a church and in a red honda some or all of them were reportedly armed there were several ways to get into the city from long island by surface transportation bridges or tunnels some of these were free no tolls were charged at the queensboro or the brooklyn bridges for instance but the most direct route from the end of long island was through the queens midtown tunnel the police and fbi had gotten permission to shut down all of the express pass and exact change lanes so that the perps would have to go through a manned booth the excop had never thought that hed be the one to spot the immigrants but it looked like that was the way things were going to fall out he was now wiping his sweaty palms on his slacks and watching a white van some writing on the side driven by a chinese guy easing toward his booth ten cars away nine he pulled his old service piece from its holster a smith wesson with a fourinch barrel and rested the pistol on the far side of the cash register wondering how to handle the situation hed call it in but what if the guys in the van acted funny or evasive he decided hed draw down on them and order them out of the van but what if one of them reached under the dash or between the seats hell here he was in an exposed glass booth no backup with a vanload of chinese gangsters heading toward him they might even be armed with russia s crowning contribution to small arms ak machine guns fuck it hed shoot the operator ignored a woman complaining about the ezpass lanes being closed and looked at the line of traffic the van was three cars away he reached onto his belt and pulled off his speedloader a metal ring holding six bullets with which he could reload his smittie in seconds he rested this next to his pistol and wiped his shooting hand on his slacks once again he debated for a moment picked up the gun cocked it and set it back on the counter this was against regulations but then he was the one in the fishbowl not the brass who wrote the regs at first sam chang had worried that the long line of cars meant a roadblock but then he saw the booths and decided this was some kind of a border crossing passports papers visas they had none of these in panic he looked for an exit but there was none the road was surrounded by high walls but william said calmly we have to pay pay why sam chang asked the boy their resident expert on american customs its a toll he explained as if this were obvious i need some us dollars three and a half in a moneybelt chang had thousands of yuan soggy and salty though they were but hadnt dared change the money into us dollars on the black markets of fuzhou which wouldve tipped off public security that they were about to flee the country in a well beside the two front seats though theyd found a fivedollar bill the van crawled slowly forward two cars were in front of them chang glanced up at the man in the booth and observed that he seemed very nervous he kept looking at the van while appearing not to one car ahead of them in line now the man in the booth now studied them carefully from the corner of his eye his tongue touched the side of his lip and he rocked from one foot to the other i dont like this william said he suspects something theres nothing we can do his father told him go forward ill run it no chang muttered he may have a gun hell shoot us william eased the van to the booth and stopped would the boy in his newfound rebellion disregard changs order and speed through the gate the man in the booth swallowed and gripped something next to a large cash register was it a signal button of some kind chang wondered william looked down and pulled the us money from the plastic divider between the front seats the officer seemed to flinch he ducked moving his arm toward the van then he stared at the bill william was offering him what was wrong had he offered too much too little did he expect a bribe the man in the booth blinked he took the bill with an unsteady hand leaning forward to do so and glanced at the side of the van on which were the words the home store as the guard counted out change he looked into the back of the van itself all that the man could see chang prayed were the dozens of saplings and bushes that chang william and wu had dug up in a park on the way here from the beach and packed into the van to make it look like they were delivering plants for a local store the rest of the families were lying on the floor hidden beneath the foliage the officer gave him the change for the toll good place the home store i shop there all the time thank you william replied bad day for making deliveries huh he asked chang nodding up at the stormy skies thank you chang said william eased the van forward he accelerated and a moment later they plunged into a tunnel okay were safe were past the guards chang announced and the rest of the passengers sat up brushing leaves and dirt off their clothing well his idea had worked as theyd sped down the highway from the beach chang realized that the police here might do what the chinese pla and security bureau officers did frequently to search for wanted dissidents set up roadblocks so theyd stopped at a huge shopping center in the middle of which was the home store it was open twentyfour hours and with few employees so early in the morning chang wu and william had no trouble slipping in through the loading dock from the stockroom they stole some cans of paint brushes and tools then slipped outside again but not before chang had snuck to the doorway that led to the store itself and looked at the astonishing place he saw acres of aisles it was breathtaking chang had never seen so many tools and supplies and appliances kitchens readymade a thousand light fixtures outdoor furniture and grills doors windows carpets whole rows devoted to nuts and bolts and nails changs first reaction was to bring meimei and his father inside just to show them the place well there would be time for that later chang told william im taking these things now because we need to for our survival but as soon as i get some onecolor im going to pay them back ill send them the money youre crazy the boy replied they have more than theyll need they expect things to be stolen its built into the price we will pay them back chang snapped this time the boy didnt even bother to respond chang found a colorful newspaper in a large pile on the loading dock struggling with the english he realized that this was a sales flyer and that it had the addresses of a number of home stores on it when he got his first pay envelope or converted some yuan he would send them the money theyd returned to the van and found a truck parked nearby william swapped the number plates and then they drove toward the city until they found a deserted factory they parked in the loading dock out of the rain and chang and wu painted over the letters spelling the name of the church after the white paint dried chang a lifelong calligrapher expertly drew the words the home store on the side in a typeface similar to that in the flyer hed taken yes the trick had worked and unstopped by security officers and the guard at the tollbooth they now sailed out of the tunnel into the streets of manhattan william had studied the map carefully as they had waited in line at the toll and knew generally where they should go to get to chinatown the oneway streets caused a bit of confusion but soon he oriented himself and found the highway he sought through dense rushhour traffic further slowed by the intermittent rain and patches of fog they drove along a river whose shade perfectly matched the ocean they had just survived the gray land chang reflected not highways of gold and a city of diamonds as the unfortunate captain sen had promised as chang looked around at the streets and buildings he wondered what now awaited them in theory he still owed the ghost a great deal of money the going rate for smuggling someone from china to the united states was about us since chang was a dissident and desperate to leave he expected that the ghosts agent in fuzhou would charge him a premium yet hed been surprised to find that the ghosts fee was only for his entire family his father included chang had raided his meager savings and had borrowed the rest from friends and relatives to make up the ten percent down payment in his contract with the ghost chang had agreed that he meimei and william and changs youngest son when he was old enough would give money to the ghosts debt collectors monthly until the remainder of the fee was paid off many immigrants worked directly for the snakehead whod smuggled them into the country the men generally in chinatown restaurants the women in garment factories and lived in safehouses provided by them for a stiff fee but chang didnt trust snakeheads especially the ghost there were too many rumors of immigrants being beaten and raped and kept prisoner in ratinfested safehouses so he had made his own arrangements for a job for him and william and had located an apartment in new york through the brother of a friend back in china sam chang had always intended to pay his obligation but now with the sinking of the fuzhou dragon and the ghosts attempts to murder them the contract was void and they were out from under the crushing debt if of course they could stay alive long enough for the ghost and his bangshous to be captured or killed by the police or to flee back to china and this meant going to ground as soon as possible william drove expertly through the traffic where had he learned that the family didnt even own a car sam chang looked back at the others in the van they were disheveled and stank of seawater wus wife yongping was in a bad way her eyes were closed and she shivered sweat covering her face her arm was shattered from their collision with the rocks and the wound was still bleeding through an impromptu bandage wus pretty teenage daughter chinmei seemed unhurt but was clearly frightened her brother lang was the same age as changs youngest son and the two boys with nearly identical bowlshaped haircuts sat close to each other staring out the window and whispering elderly chang jiechi sat motionless in the back of the van with his legs crossed and arms at his sides thin white hair slicked back saying nothing but observing all through eyes half covered by drooping lids the old mans skin seemed more jaundiced than when theyd left fuzhou over two weeks ago but perhaps that was just changs imagination in any case hed decided that the first thing hed do after they were settled in their apartment was get the man to a doctor the van slowed to a stop because of the traffic william pressed the horn impatiently quiet his father snapped dont draw attention to us the boy hit the horn once more chang glanced toward his son the boys lean face the long hair which fell well below his ears he asked in a harsh whisper the van how did you learn to start it that way what does it matter the boy asked tell me i heard somebody talking about it at school no youre lying youve done it before i only steal from party undersecretaries and commune bosses thatd be all right with you wouldnt it you do what but the boy grinned in a snide way and chang understood he was joking the comment though was cruelly intended it was a reference to changs anticommunist political writings which had caused the family so much pain in china and necessitated the flight to america itself who do you spend time with thieves oh father the boy shook his head a condescending gesture and chang wanted to slap him and what did you have that knife for chang asked a lot of people have knives yeye has one this was the affectionate term for grandfather which many chinese children used thats a penknife for cleaning pipes chang said not a weapon he finally lost his temper how can you be so disrespectful he shouted if i didnt have the knife the boy answered angrily and if i didnt know how to start the engine wed probably be dead now the traffic sped up and william fell into a moody silence chang turned away feeling as if hed been physically assaulted by the boys words by this very different side of his son oh certainly thered been problems with william in the past as hed neared his late teens hed grown sullen and angry and withdrawn his attendance at school dropped when hed brought home a letter from his teacher reprimanding him for bad grades chang had confronted the boy whose intelligence had been tested and was far higher than average william had said that it wasnt his fault he was persecuted at school and treated unfairly because his father was a dissident whod flouted the onechild rule spoke favorably about taiwanese independence and the worst sacrilege of all was critical of the ccp the chinese communist party and its hardline views on freedom and human rights both he and his younger brother were taunted regularly by superbrats youngsters who as only children in comfortable rich and middleclass communist families were spoiled by hordes of doting relatives and tended to bully other students it didnt help that william was named after the most famous american entrepreneur in recent years and young ronald for a us president but neither his behavior nor this explanation for it had seemed to chang very serious and he hadnt paid much mind to his sons moods besides it was meimeis task to rear the children not his why was the boy suddenly behaving so differently but then chang realized that between working ten hours a day at a print shop and engaging in his dissident activities for most of the night hed spent virtually no time with his son not until the voyage from russia to meiguo perhaps he thought with a chill this is how the boy always behaved for a moment he felt another burst of anger though only partially directed toward william himself chang couldnt tell exactly what he was furious at he stared at the crowded streets for a few moments then said to his son youre right i wouldnt have been able to start the car myself thank you william didnt acknowledge that his father had even spoken and hunched over the wheel lost in his own thoughts twenty minutes later they were in chinatown driving down a broad road that was named in both chinese and english canal street the rain was letting up and there were many people on the sidewalks which were lined with hundreds of grocery and souvenir shops fish markets jewelry stores bakeries where should we go william asked park there chang instructed and william pulled the van to a curb chang and wu climbed out they walked into a store and asked the clerk about the neighborhood associations tongs these organizations were usually made up of people from common geographic areas in china chang was seeking a fujianese tong since the two families were from the province of fujian they would not chang assumed be welcomed in a tong with roots in canton where most of the early chinese immigrants had come from but he was surprised to learn that much of manhattan s chinatown was now heavily populated with people from fujian and many of the cantonese had moved away there was a major fujianese tong only a few blocks away chang and wu left the families in the stolen van and walked through the crowded streets until they found the place painted red and sporting a classic chinese birdwing roof the dingy threestory building might have been transported here directly from the shabby neighborhood near the north bus station in fuzhou the men stepped inside the tong headquarters quickly with their heads down as if the people lounging about in the lobby of the building were about to pull out cell phones and call the ins or the ghost to report their arrival jimmy mah wearing a gray suit dusted with cigarette ash and about to burst at the seams greeted them and invited them into his upstairs office president of the east broadway fujianese society mah was the de facto mayor of this portion of chinatown his office was a large but plain room containing two desks and a halfdozen mismatched chairs piles of paper a fancy computer and a television set a hundred or so chinese books sat on a lopsided bookcase on the wall were faded and flyblown posters of chinese landscapes chang wasnt fooled by the rundown appearance of the place however he suspected that mah was a millionaire several times over sit please mah said in chinese the broadfaced man with black hair slicked straight back offered them cigarettes wu took one chang shook his head no hed stopped smoking after he lost his teaching job and money grew scarce mah looked over their filthy clothes their mussed hair ha you two look like you have a story to tell do you have an interesting story a compelling story what would it be i bet i would like very much to hear it chang indeed did have a story whether it was interesting or compelling he couldnt have said but one thing he did know it was fictional he had decided not to tell any strangers that theyd been on the fuzhou dragon and that the ghost might be searching for them he said to mah weve just come into the port on a honduran ship who was your snakehead we never learned his name he called himself moxige mexican mah shook his head i dont work with latino snakeheads mahs dialect was tainted with an american accent he took our money chang said bitterly but then he just left us on the dock he was going to get us papers and transportation he vanished with curiosity wu watched him spin this tale chang had told the man to keep quiet and let him talk to mah on the dragon wu drank too much and grew impulsive hed been careless about what hed told the immigrants and crew in the hold dont they do that sometimes mah said jovially why do they cheat people isnt it bad for business fuck mexicans where are you from fuzhou wu offered chang stirred he was going to mention a different city in fujian to minimize any connection between the immigrants and the ghost chang continued feigning anger i have two children and a baby my father too hes old and my friend here his wife is sick we need help ah help well that is an interesting story isnt it but what kind of help do you want i can do some things other things i cant do am i one of the eight immortals no of course im not what do you need papers id papers for myself my wife and my oldest son sure sure i can do some of them drivers licenses social security cards some old company id cards bankrupt companies so no one can check on you arent i clever only jimmy mah thinks of things like this these cards theyll make you look like citizens but you wont be able to get a real job with them the ins bastards make companies check everything nowadays ive got an arrangement for work chang said and i dont do passports mah added too dangerous no green cards either what is that resident permits were going to stay underground and wait for an amnesty chang explained are you may wait a long time chang shrugged he then said my father needs to see a doctor a nod toward wu his wife too can you get us health cards i dont do health cards too easy to trace youll have to go to a private doctor are they expensive yes very expensive but if you dont have money go to a city hospital they will take you is the care good what do i know if the care is good besides what choice do you have all right chang said for the other documents how much fifteen hundred yuan mah laughed onecolor chang showed no emotion but he thought fifteen hundred us dollars that was insane in the money belt around his waist he had about five thousand dollars worth of chinese yuan it was all the cash that his family had left in the world shaking his head no impossible after a few minutes of animated haggling they settled on for all the documents you too mah asked wu the gaunt man nodded but added only for myself that will be less wont it mah drew heavily on his cigarette five hundred i wont go lower than that wu tried to bargain too but mah held firm finally the skinny man grudgingly agreed mah said youll have to get me pictures of everybody for the drivers licenses and employee cards go into an amusement arcade you can have the pictures made there chang remembered poignantly the night he sat with meimei in such a booth at a large entertainment center in xiamen years ago not long after theyd first met the pictures were presently in a suitcase sitting within the corpse of the fuzhou dragon at the bottom of the dark ocean we also need a van i cant afford to buy one can i rent one from you the tong leader scoffed dont i have everything of course of course after more bargaining they agreed on a rental mah calculated the total that the men owed and then figured the exchange rate for paying in yuan he told the men the astonishing sum and they reluctantly agreed give me the names and address for the documents he turned to his computer and as chang dictated the information mah typed with fast keystrokes chang himself spent a lot of time on his old laptop computer the internet had become the main means for dissidents in china to communicate with the outside world though doing so was very difficult changs modem was woefully slow and the public security bureaus as well as agents from the peoples liberation army were constantly looking for emails and postings by dissidents chang had a firewall on his computer that would often give a beep signaling that the government was trying to break into his system hed log off immediately and have to establish a new service provider account his laptop too he thought sadly was sleeping forever inside the fuzhoudragon as chang dictated the address the tong leader looked up from the keyboard so youll be staying in queens yes a friend arranged a place for us is it a big place is it comfortable for all of you dont you think my broker could do better im thinking he could i have contacts in queens he is my best friends brother hes already arranged for the lease ah friends brother good well we have an affiliated association there the flushing neighborhood and merchants association very big powerful thats the new chinatown in the new york area flushing maybe you wont like your apartment maybe the children wont be safe thats possible dont you think go to the association and mention my name ill remember that mah nodded toward the computer screen and asked wu youre both at this address chang started to say that they were but wu interrupted no no i want to stay in manhattan chinatown here can your broker find us a house but chang said frowning you dont mean house do you mah inquired amused there are no houses he added that you could afford an apartment then mah said yes he has temporary rooms you can get a place today and then stay there until he finds you a permanent home as mah typed some more and the hiss of the modem filled the office chang put his hand on wus arm and whispered no qichen you must come with us were staying in manhattan leaning closer so that mah could not hear chang whispered dont be a fool the ghost will find you wu laughed dont worry about him dont worry he just killed a dozen of our friends gambling with wus own life was one thing but to risk his wife and children was unthinkable but wu was adamant no we are staying here chang fell silent as mah logged off the computer and then wrote a note handed it to wu this is the broker hes only a few blocks from here youll pay him a fee he added i wont charge you for this am i generous everybody says jimmy mah is generous now for mr changs car mah made a call and began to speak quickly into the phone he made arrangements for a van to be brought around he hung up and turned to the two men there that concludes our business isnt it a pleasure to work with reasonable men they rose in unison and shook hands do you want a cigarette to take with you he asked wu who took three when the immigrants were at the door mah asked one thing this mexican snakehead theres no reason for him to come after you is there youre even with him yes were even good dont we have enough reason to look over our shoulders mah asked jovially arent there enough demons after us in this life chapter ten in the distance sirens pierced the early morning air the sound grew louder and lincoln rhyme hoped it would mark the arrival of amelia sachs the evidence shed gathered at the beach had already arrived delivered by a young tech whod sheepishly entered the den of the legendary lincoln rhyme without a word and scurried about to deposit the bags and stacks of pictures as the criminalist gruffly directed sachs herself had been diverted on the way back from the beach however to run a secondary crime scene the church van stolen at easton had been found in chinatown abandoned in an alley next to an uptown subway stop fortyfive minutes ago the van had slipped past the roadblocks because not only did it sport stolen plates but one of the immigrants had painted over the name of the church and replaced it with a good facsimile of the logo for a local home improvement store smart rhyme had said with some dismay he didnt like smart perps hed then called sachs who was speeding back to the city on the long island expressway and ordered her to meet a crime scene bus downtown and process the van the inss harold peabody was gone summoned to juggle press conferences and calls from washington about the fiasco alan coe lon sellitto and fred dellray remained as did the trim hedgehoghaired detective eddie deng an addition as well mel cooper slim balding reserved he was one of the nypds top forensic lab workers and rhyme often borrowed him walking silently on his crepesoled hush puppies which he wore during the day because they were comfortable and at night because they gave him good traction for ballroom dancing cooper was assembling equipment organizing examination stations and laying out the evidence from the beach at rhymes direction thom taped a map of new york city on the wall next to the map of long island and the surrounding waters which theyd used in following the fuzhoudragons progress rhyme stared at the red dot that represented the ship and he once again felt the pain of guilt that his lack of foresight had resulted in the deaths of the immigrants the sirens grew louder then stopped outside his window which faced central park a moment later the door opened and amelia sachs limping slightly hurried into the room her hair was matted and flecked with bits of seaweed and dirt and her jeans and work shirt were damp and sandy those in the room nodded distracted greetings dellray studied her clothes and lifted an eyebrow had some free time she said went for a swim hi mel amelia cooper said shoving his glasses higher on his nose he blinked at her appearance rhyme noted with eager anticipation what she carried a gray milk crate filled with plastic and paper bags she handed the evidence to cooper and started for the stairs calling back in five a moment later rhyme heard the shower running and indeed five minutes after shed left she was back wearing some of the clothes she kept in his bedroom closet blue jeans and a black tshirt running shoes wearing rubber gloves cooper was laying the bags out organizing them according to the scenes the beach and the van in chinatown rhyme gazed at the evidence and felt in his temples not his numb chest a quickening of his heart the breathtaking excitement of a hunt that was about to begin indifferent toward sports and athletics rhyme nonetheless supposed that this edgy exhilaration was what ski racers for instance felt when they stood at the top of a run looking down the mountain would they win would the course defeat them would they make a tactical mistake and lose by a fraction of a second would they be injured or die okay he said lets get to it he looked around the room thom thom where is he he was here a minute ago thom what lincoln the harried aide appeared in the doorway with a pan and dish towel in hand be our scribe write our pithy insights down a nod at the whiteboard in that elegant handwriting of yours yes bwana thom started back to the kitchen no no just leave it rhyme groused write sighing thom set down the pan and wiped his hands on the towel he tucked his purple tie into his shirt to protect it from the marker and walked to the whiteboard hed been an unofficial member of several forensic teams here and he knew the drill he now asked dellray you have a name for the case yet the fbi always named major investigations with acronymlike variations of the key words describing the case like abscam dellray pinched the cigarette that rested behind his ear he said nup nothing yet but less just do it ourselves and make washington live with it how bout the name of our boy ghostkill that good enough for everbody that spooky enough plenty spooky sellitto agreed though with the tone of someone who was rarely spooked thom wrote this at the top of the whiteboard and turned back to the law enforcers rhyme said weve got two scenes the beach in easton and the van the beach first as thom was writing the heading dellrays phone rang and he took the call after a brief conversation he hung up and told the team what hed just learned no other survivors so far he said and the coast guard hasnt found the ship but they did recover some bodies out to sea two shot one drowned id on one of them had merchant papers nothing on the other two theyre sending prints and pictures to us and copies to china he even killed the creweddie deng asked in disbelief what do you expect coe responded you know him by now you think hed leave a single witness alive a grim laugh besides with the crew dead he wont have to pay the balance due for chartering the boat and back in china hell probably claim that the coast guard fired on them and sank the dragon but rhyme had no time for anger at the ghost or for dismay at the cruel potential of the human heart okay sachs he said curtly the beach tell us what happened she leaned against a lab table and consulted her notes fourteen people came ashore in a life raft about a half mile east of easton on the road to orient point she walked to the wall and touched a spot on the long island map near the horton point lighthouse as they got closer to shore the raft hit some rocks and started to deflate four of the immigrants were thrown into the water and were washed down the beach the other ten stayed together they stole the church van and got away photos of the footprints rhyme asked here you go sachs said handing thom an envelope he taped up polaroids i found them under a shelter near the raft it was too wet to use electrostatic she explained to the team i had to take pictures and fine artwork they are too rhyme said wheeling back and forth in front of them im counting nine dellray said why you sayin ten amelia because rhyme said theres a baby right sachs nodded right under the shelter i found some patterns in the sand i couldnt identify looked like something had been dragged but there were no footprints in front of it only behind i figured it was a crawling child okay rhyme said studying the sizes of the shoes looks like weve got seven adults andor older teens two young children and one infant one of the adults could be elderly hes shuffling i say he because of the shoe size and somebodys injured probably a woman to judge from the size other shoes the man next to her is helping her sachs added there were bloodstains on the beach and in the van samples of the blood cooper asked there wasnt much on the raft or the beach the rain had washed most of it away i got three samples from the sand and plenty in the van still wet she found a plastic bag containing some vials handed it to him the tech prepared samples for typing and filled out a form he called in an expedited request for typing and gendering into the serology lab at the medical examiners office and arranged for a uniformed officer to take the samples downtown sachs continued her scenario now the ghost in a second launch landed about two hundred yards east of where the immigrants did her fingers disappeared into her abundant red hair and worried the flesh of her scalp sachs would often injure herself in minor ways like this a beautiful woman a former fashion model she often had stubby sometimes bloody fingernails rhyme had given up trying to figure out where this painful compulsion came from but oddly he envied her the same cryptic tensions drove him as well the difference was that he didnt have her safety valve of fidgety motion to bleed off the stress he silently sent out a plea to dr weaver his neurosurgeon do something for me release me just a little from this terrible confinement please then he slammed the door on these personal thoughts angry with himself and turned his attention back to sachs then she continued with a splinter of emotion in her voice then he started tracking down the immigrants and killing them he found two whod fallen off the raft and killed them shot them in the back he wounded one the fourth immigrants still missing wheres the wounded one coe asked they were taking him to a trauma center then to the ins manhattan detention facility he said he doesnt know where the ghost or the immigrants mightve been going once they got here sachs again consulted her soggy handwritten notes now there was a vehicle on the road near the beach but it left fast spun the wheels and skidded to make a turn i think the ghost took a shot at it so we may have a witness if we can track down the make and model i got dimensions of the wheelbase and wait rhyme interrupted what was it near the car near she asked nothing it was just parked by the roadside the criminalist frowned why would somebody park there on a stormy day before dawn drivin by and saw the rafts dellray suggested no rhyme said in that case he wouldve gone for help or called and there werent any nineoneones reporting anything no i think the driver was there to pick up the ghost but when it turned out the snakehead wasnt in any hurry to leave he took off so he got abandoned sellitto observed rhyme nodded sachs handed a sheet of paper to mel cooper dimensions of the wheelbase and here are pictures of the tread marks the tech scanned the marks into the computer and then sent the image along with the dimensions to the nypds vi vehicle identifier database shouldnt be long coopers calm voice reported young detective eddie deng asked what about the other trucks what other trucks sachs asked coe filled in the terms of a smuggling contract include land transport too there shouldve been some trucks to take the immigrants back to the city sachs shook her head i didnt see any sign of them but when he sank the ship the ghost probably called the driver and had them go back to the city she looked over the evidence bags again i found this she held up a bag containing a cell phone excellent rhyme said hed dubbed clues like this nasdaq evidence after the hightechheavy stock market computers cell phones personal electronic organizers a whole new breed of evidence these telltale devices could provide huge amounts of information about perps and the people theyd been in contact with fred lets get your people to look it over gotcha the bureau had recently added a computer and electronics team to the new york office dellray made a call and arranged for an agent to pick up the cell phone and take it to the federal forensics lab downtown for analysis rhyme said musing okay hes hunting them down shooting the immigrants shooting at the driver who abandoned him hes doing it by himself right sachs no sign of the mysterious assistant she nodded at the footprint polaroids no im sure the ghost was the only one in the second raft and the only one shooting rhyme frowned i dont like unidentified perps out there someplace when were running crime scenes nothing on who this bangshou is sellitto muttered nope not a clue the ghosts got dozens of them around the world and no sign of the fourth immigrant the other one who fell out of the raft no the criminalist then asked sachs what about ballistics sachs held up a plastic bag containing shell casings for rhyme to examine sevenpointsixtwo millimeter he said but the brasss an odd length and its uneven cheap though he had a body that couldnt move his eyes were as sharp as those of the peregrine falcons that lived on the windowsill outside his bedroom upstairs check out the casings online mel when rhyme had been head of nypd forensics hed spent months putting together databases of evidence standards samples of substances and materials along with the sources they came from like motor oil thread fibers dirt and so on to facilitate tracing evidence found at crime scenes one of the largest and most often used databases was the compilation of bullet shell casings and slugs information the combined fbi and nypd collection had samples and digitized images of nearly every projectile that had ever been fired from a weapon in the past hundred years cooper opened the plastic bag and then reached in with chopsticks appropriately considering the case they were now working on this was the tool that rhyme had found was the least damaging to evidence and hed ordered all his techs to learn to use the sticks preferring them to tweezers or forceps which could too easily crush delicate samples back to your captivating narrative about the beach sachs she continued things were heating up by now the ghost had been on land for a while he knew the coast guard had a rough idea of his location he found the third immigrant in the water john sung shot him then stole the honda and left she glanced at rhyme any word about it an emergency vehicle locator notice had gone out to all nearby law enforcement agencies as soon as the stolen red honda was spotted anywhere in the new york metropolitan area sellitto or dellray would get a call but thered been no word the homicide detective told her then added the ghosts been to new york before though plenty of times hed know the transit system id guess he stuck to back roads west until he got close to the city then dumped the car and took the subway into town hes got to be here by now rhyme noticed a frown of concern on the fbi agents face what is it fred i wish weda found the prick fore he got over the city line why reports my peoplere feeding mere that hes got a nice tidy network in town tongs and street gangs in chinatown course but its way beyond that even got people in the government on his roll government sellitto asked surprised what i hear dellray said i believe it deng said cynically if hes got dozens of officials in china in his pocket why not here too so rhyme reflected weve got an unidentified presumably armed assistant and a homicidal snakehead and now spies within our own ranks its never easy but really a glance at sachs which meant keep going friction ridges he asked the technical name for finger palm and footprints she explained the beach was a mess the rain and wind i got a few partials from the outboard motor and the rubber sides of the rafts and the cell phone she held up the cards of the prints shed lifted the qualitys pretty bad rhyme called scan em and get them into afis the automated fingerprint identification system was a huge network of digitized federal and state fingerprint files afis reduced the search time for matching prints from months to hours or even minutes in some cases i also found this she held up a metal pipe in a plastic bag one of them used it to break the window of the van there were no visibles on this one so i thought we better raise the prints here go to work mel the thin man took the bag pulled on cotton gloves and extracted the pipe holding it only by the ends ill use vmd vacuum metal deposition is considered the rollsroyce of fingerprintraising systems it involves binding a microscopic coating of metal to the object to be printed and then radiating it after a few minutes cooper had a razorsharp image of several latent prints he shot pictures of them and ran the photos through the scanner then sent them off to afis he handed the pictures to thom who pinned them up thats about it for the beach rhyme sachs said the criminalist glanced at the chart the evidence told him little yet but he wasnt discouraged this was how criminalistics worked it was like dumping a thousand jigsaw puzzle pieces out on the table incomprehensible at first only after trial and error and much analysis did patterns begin to appear he said the van next sachs pinned up pictures of the van on the whiteboard recognizing the location in chinatown from the polaroid coe said its crowded around that subway station there mustve been some witnesses nobody saw a thing sachs said wryly whereve i heard that before sellitto added it was astonishing rhyme knew what kind of amnesia was induced by the mere act of flashing a gold shield in front of your average citizen what about the plate rhyme asked stolen off a truck in a parking lot in suffolk county the burly homicide cop said no wits there either whatd you find in the van he asked sachs theyd dug up a bunch of plants and had them in the back plants to hide the others im guessing and make it look like they were a couple of employees making deliveries for that place the home store but i didnt get much else just the fingerprints some rags and the blood the spatter was on the window and door so im guessing the injury was above the waist arm or hand probably rhyme asked no paint cans brushes from when they painted the logo on the side nope they ditched it all she shrugged thats it aside from the friction ridges she handed cooper the cards and polaroids of the fingerprints shed lifted from the van and he scanned and ran them digitized them and then fed them into the afis rhymes eyes were glued to the chart he studied the items for a moment the way a sculptor sizes up a raw piece of stone before he begins carving then he turned away and said to dellray and sellitto how do you want to handle the case sellitto deferred to the fbi agent who said we gotta split the effort dont see a single other way to handle it one well be going after the ghost two we gotta find those families fore he does he glanced at rhyme well do the command post thing from here if thats okay rhyme nodded he no longer cared about the intrusion no longer cared about his town houses conversion to grand central station whatever it took the criminalist was going to find the man whod ruthlessly taken so many innocent lives now heres what im thinkin dellray said pacing on his long legs were not fuckin around with this guy im gettin a dozen more agents assigned to the case here in the southern and eastern districts and ill get us a spectac team up from quantico spectac was short for special tactics though it was pronounced as in spectacular this littleknown outfit within the fbi was the best tactical unit in the country it regularly engaged in practice operations with delta force and the navy seals and usually won rhyme was glad to hear that dellray was beefing up their side from what they now knew about the ghost their present resources were inadequate dellray for instance was the only fbi agent assigned fulltime to the ghost case and peabody was only midlevel ins gonna be tough to get everbody on board down at the federal building the agent said but ill make sure it happens coes phone rang he listened for a few moments nodding his head after he hung up he said that was ins detention in midtown about that undocumented john sung he was just released on bond by one of our hearing officers coe raised an eyebrow everybody whos caught coming

mobile patrol coptalk for squad car if the ghost finds out sungs still alive hell be a target too the detective jotted the address down sure ill do it now okay everybody whats the theme of the investigation rhyme called out search well but watch your backs sachs responded with a laugh keep that in mind we dont know where the ghost is we dont know where or who his bangshou is then his attention faded he was vaguely aware of sachss grabbing her purse and starting to the door just as he was aware of coes disgruntled sigh at his limited jurisdiction dellrays pacing and fashionable eddie dengs amusement at their running the case from this oddball command post but these impressions were fading from his thoughts as his quick eyes made the circuit of the evidence culled from the crime scenes he gazed at these items intently as if imploring the inanimate evidence assembled before him to come to life give up whatever secrets it might hold and guide them to the killer and the unfortunate prey that the snakehead was hunting ghostkill easton long island crime scene two immigrants killed on beach shot in back one immigrant wounded dr john sung one missing bangshou assistant

blood spatter suggests injured woman has hand arm or shoulder injury blood samples sent to lab for typing fingerprints sent to afis chapter eleven the ghost waited for the three men in decadent surroundings showered and dressed in clean unobtrusive clothes he sat on the leather couch and looked over new york harbor from the vantage point of his eighteenthfloor apartment that was his main safehouse in new york it was in a fancy highrise near battery park city in the southwest corner of manhattan not far from chinatown but away from its crowded streets the smells of seafood the stink of rancid oil from the tourist restaurants he reflected now on how elegance and comfort like this which hed fought hard to achieve had long been targets of the communist party why do you pursue the path of decadence you are part of the old do you repent your ways you must rid yourself of old culture old customs old habits old ideas you must reject your decadent values you are infected with wrong thought and wrong desires wrong desires he considered smiling cynically to himself desires feeling the familiar crawling sensation in his groin an urge hed been very familiar with and often ruled by all his life now that hed survived the sinking of the ship and had escaped from the beach his thoughts were returning to his normal priorities he needed a woman badly hed had none for over two weeks a russian prostitute in st petersburg a woman with a broad mouth and breasts that lolled alarmingly toward her armpits when she lay on her back the event was satisfying but only barely and on the fuzhoudragon none usually it was a snakeheads prerogative to ask one of the prettier women piglets to his stateroom promising to reduce her transit fee in exchange for a night in his bed or if she was traveling alone or with a weak man simply to drag her to his cabin and rape her what was she going to do after all call the police when they arrived in the beautiful country but his bangshou hiding out in the hold as his spy had reported that the women piglets on the dragon werent particularly attractive or young and the men were defiant and smart perfectly capable of causing trouble so it had been a long celibate voyage he now resumed fantasizing about the woman he called yindao the chinese word for female genitals the nickname was contemptuous of course but not particularly so in her case for the ghost thought of all women except for a few businesswomen and female snakeheads he respected solely in terms of their bodies a number of images came to mind about the liaison he had planned with yindao her lying beneath him the distinctive sound of her voice in his ear her arching back his hands gripping her long hair such beautiful silken hair he found himself painfully aroused for a moment he thought about forgetting the changs and the wus he could meet yindao she was here in new york and make the fantasies real but of course it wasnt in his nature to do that first the piglet families would die then he would be able to spend long hours with her naixin all in good time a glance at his watch it was nearly am where were the three turks he wondered when the ghost had arrived at the safehouse not long ago hed used one of the stolen cell phones he kept there to call a community center in queens with which hed done business several times in the past hed hired three men to help him find and kill the piglets ever paranoid and wishing to keep his connections between himself and his crimes as distant as possible the ghost hadnt gone to any of the traditional tongs in chinatown hed hired uighurs racially the vast majority of mainland china is han tracing their ancestry back to the dynasty of that name which established itself about bc the other eight or so percent of the population is made up of minority groups like the tibetans mongolians and manchus the uighurs pronounced weegurs whose people are from western china were one such minority predominantly islamic their native region is considered central asia and before being annexed by china was called east turkestan hence the ghosts name for them turks like the other minorities in china the uighurs were often persecuted and under great pressure from beijing to assimilate into chinese culture separatists were often brutalized and killed and uighurs were very vocal in their demands for independence most of the terrorist acts in china could be traced to uighur freedom fighters the uighur community in new york was quiet devout and peaceful but this particular group of men from the turkestan community and islamic center of queens was as ruthless as any triad the ghost had ever dealt with and since this assignment involved killing families who were han chinese they were the perfect choice to help him they were motivated by both years of oppression and the generous amounts of cash the ghost would pay them part of which would ultimately go to the western chinese province of xinjiang to help fund the foundering uighur independence movement ten minutes later they arrived hands were shaken and they gave their names hajip yusuf kashgari they were dark quiet thin of smaller stature than he and the ghost was not particularly big they wore black suits gold bracelets or necklaces and fancy cell phones on their hips like badges uighurs spoke turkic a language the ghost didnt understand and they werent comfortable with any of the chinese dialects they settled on english the ghost explained what was needed and asked if theyd have any trouble killing people who were unarmed women and children too yusuf a man in his late twenties with eyebrows that met above his nose was the spokesman his english was better than the others without consulting them he said no problem we do that we do what you want as if he killed women and children regularly and perhaps the ghost reflected he did the ghost gave them each from a cashbox he kept in the safehouse and then called the head of the turkestan community center and handed the phone to yusuf who told his boss in english how much money the ghost had distributed so there would be no dispute about underpayment and where the money had gone they hung up the ghost now said im going out for a while i need to get some information we will wait may we have coffee the ghost nodded them into the kitchen then he walked to a small shrine he lit a joss stick of incense muttered a prayer to yi the divine bowman in chinese mythology whom the ghost had adopted as his personal deity he then put his pistol into an ankle holster and left his decadent apartment sonny li sat on a long island commuter services bus which was nudging its way through the rainspattered early morning traffic as the skyline of manhattan slowly grew larger cynical and hard by nature li nonetheless was in awe of what he was examining not the massive size of the city they were approaching lis world was the southeast china coast which was the most populous metropolitan sprawl on earth shanghai was twice the size of new york and million people lived in the pearl delta between hong kong and guangzhou no what fascinated him was the bus in which he rode in china the main means of public transit is buses theyre cramped filthy vehicles often broken down stifling in the warm months freezing in the fall and winter windows greasy from smoke residue and hair oil and soot the bus stations too were old decrepit places li had shot a man behind the infamous north bus station in fuzhou and had himself been knifed not far from the same spot so li had never seen any vehicle like this behemoth it was huge and luxurious with thick padded seats clean floors and spotless windows even on this oppressive dank day in august the airconditioning worked perfectly hed spent two weeks being violently sick every day was virtually broke had no idea where the ghost was he had no gun not even a pack of cigarettes but at least the bus was a blessing from heaven after hed fled from the beach where the survivors of the fuzhou dragon had landed li had begged a ride from a trucker at a rest stop on the highway several kilometers away the man had looked over his wet disheveled clothes and let him ride in the back of the truck after a half hour or so the trucker dropped him at a sleek bus station in a massive parking lot here the driver explained sonny li could take a commuter bus to where he wanted to go manhattan li wasnt sure what was required to buy a ticket but apparently no passports or documents were necessary hed handed one of the twentydollar bills hed stolen from redheaded hongses car to the clerk and said new york city please he enunciated in his best accent mimicking the actor nicolas cage speaking so clearly in fact that the clerk perhaps expecting unintelligible words blinked in surprise and handed him a computerprinted chit along with six dollars in change he counted the money twice and decided that either the clerk had robbed him or as he muttered under his breath in english he was now in one fuck expensive country hed gone to a newsstand connected to the station and bought a razor and comb in the mens room hed shaved and washed the salt water out of his hair and dried it with paper towels then he combed the thinning strands back and brushed as much sand off himself as he could he joined the welldressed commuters on the platform now approaching the city the bus slowed for a tollbooth and then continued through a long tunnel finally it emerged into the city itself ten minutes later the vehicle parked on a busy commercial street li climbed out like everyone else and stood on the sidewalk his first thought wherere all the bicycles and motorbikes they were the main means of private transport in china and li couldnt imagine a city this big without millions of seagull bicycles coursing through the streets his second thought where can i buy some cigarettes he found a kiosk selling newspapers and bought a pack when he looked at his change this time he thought ten judges of hell nearly three dollars for a single pack he smoked at least two packs a day three when he was doing something dangerous and needed to calm his nerves hed go broke in a month living here he estimated he lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply as he walked through the crowds he asked a pretty asian woman how to get to chinatown and was directed to the subway jostling his way through the mass of commuters li bought a token from the clerk this too was expensive but hed given up comparing costs between the two countries he dropped the token in the turnstile walked through the device and waited on the platform he had a bad moment when a man began shouting at him li thought the man might be deranged even though he was wearing an expensive suit in a moment he realized what the man was saying apparently it was illegal to smoke on the subway li thought this was madness he couldnt believe it but he didnt want to make a scene so he stubbed out his cigarette and put it in his pocket muttering under his breath another assessment one crazy fuck country a few minutes later the train roared into the station and sonny li got on board as if hed been doing it all his life looking around attentively though not for security officers but simply to see if anyone else was smoking so that he could light up again to his dismay no one was at canal street li stepped out of the car and climbed up the stairs into the bustling early morning city the rain had stopped and he lit the snuffed cigarette then slipped into the crowd many of the people around him were speaking cantonese the dialect of the south but aside from the language this neighborhood was just like portions of his town liu guoyuan or any small city in china movie theaters showing chinese action and love films the young men with long slickedback hair or pompadours and challenging sneers the young girls walking with their arms around their mothers or grandmothers businessmen in suits buttoned snugly the icefilled boxes of fresh fish the bakeries selling tea buns and rice pastries the smoked ducks hanging by their necks in the greasy windows of restaurants herbalists and acupuncturists chinese doctors shop windows filled with ginseng roots twisted like deformed human bodies and somewhere near here he was hoping would be something else he was very familiar with it took li ten minutes to find what he sought he noticed the telltale sign the guard a young man with a cell phone smoking and examining passersby as he lounged in front of a basement apartment whose windows were painted black it was a twentyfourhour gambling hall he walked up and asked in english what they play here fan tai poker maybe thirteen points the man looked at lis clothes and ignored him i want play li said fuck off the young man spat out i have money li shouted angrily let me inside you fujianese i hear your accent you not welcome here get outta here or you get hurt li raged my dollar good as fuck cantonese dollar you boss he want you turn away customers get outta here little man im not going to tell you again and he pulled aside his nice black jacket revealing the butt of an automatic pistol excellent this is what li had been hoping for appearing frightened he started to turn away then spun back with his arm outstretched he caught the young man in the chest with his fist knocking the wind out of him the boy staggered back and li struck him in the nose with his open palm he cried out and fell hard to the pavement the guard lay there gasping frantically for breath blood pouring from his nose while li delivered a kick to his side taking the gun an extra clip of ammunition and the mans cigarettes li looked up and down the street two young women walking arm in arm pretended that they hadnt seen aside from them the street was empty he bent down to the miserable man again and took his wristwatch too and about three hundred dollars in cash if you tell anyone i did this li said to the guard speaking in putonghua ill find you and kill you the man nodded and sopped up the blood with his sleeve li started to walk away then he glanced back and returned the man cringed take your shoes off li snapped shoes take them off he undid the black laceup kenneth coles and pushed them toward li socks too the expensive black silk socks joined the shoes li took off his own shoes and socks gritty with sand and still wet and flung them away he put on the new ones heaven he thought happily li hurried back to one of the crowded commercial streets there he found a cheap clothing store and bought a pair of jeans a tshirt and a thin nike windbreaker he changed in the back of the store paid for his purchases and tossed his old clothes into a trash bin li then went into a chinese restaurant and ordered tea and a bowl of noodles as he ate he pulled a folded piece of paper out of his wallet the sheet that hed stolen from hongses car at the beach august from harold c peabody assistant director of enforcement u s immigration and naturalization service to det capt lincoln rhyme ret re joint insfbinypd task force in the matter of kwan ang aka gui aka the ghost this confirms our meeting at ten am tomorrow to discuss the plans for the apprehension of the abovereferenced suspect please see attached material for background stapled to the memo was a business card which read lincolnrhyme central park west new york ny he flagged down the waitress and asked her a question something about li seemed to scare her and warn that she shouldnt help this man but a second glance at his face mustve told her that it would be worse to say no to him she nodded and eyes down gave him what li thought were excellent directions to the street known as central park west chapter twelve you look better amelia sachs said how are you feeling john sung motioned her into the apartment very sore he said and closing the door joined her in the living room he walked slowly and winced occasionally an understandable consequence of having been shot she supposed the apartment that his immigration lawyer had arranged for him to stay in was a dingy place on the bowery two dark rooms containing mismatched damaged furniture directly below on the first floor was a chinese restaurant the smell of sour oil and garlic permeated the place a compact man with a few stray gray hairs sung walked hunched over from the wound watching his unsteady gait she felt a poignant sympathy for him in his life in china as a doctor presumably he would have enjoyed some respect from his patients and even though he was a dissident may have had some prestige but here sung had nothing she wondered what he was going to do for a living drive a taxi work in a restaurant ill make tea he said no thats all right she said i cant stay long im making some for myself anyway there was no separate kitchen but a stove a halfsize refrigerator and a ruststained sink lined one wall of the living room he put a cheap kettle on the sputtering flame and took a box of lipton from the cabinet over the sink he smelled it and gave a curious smile not what youre used to she asked ill go shopping later he said ruefully sachs asked the ins let you out on bond sung nodded ive formally petitioned for asylum my lawyer tells me that most people try for it but dont qualify but i spent two years in a reeducation camp and ive published articles attacking beijing for human rights violations we downloaded some as evidence the examining officer wouldnt guarantee anything but he said theres a good case for asylum whens the hearing she asked next month sachs watched his hands as he took two cups from the cupboard and carefully washed dried and arranged them on a tray there was something ceremonial about the way he did this he tore open the bags of tea and put them in a ceramic pot and poured the hot water over them then whisked the brew with a spoon all for a cup of massmarket lipton he carried the pot and cups into the living room sat stiffly he poured two cups and offered one to her she rose to help him she took the cup from his hands which she found to be soft but very strong is there any word on the others he asked theyre in manhattan somewhere we think we found a truck they stole abandoned not far from here id like to ask you about them of course what can i tell you anything that you know names descriptions anything sung brought the tea to his lips and took a very small sip there were two families the changs and the wus and a few other people who escaped i dont remember their names some crewmen got off the ship too chang tried to save them he was steering our raft but the ghost shot them sachs tried her tea it seemed to taste very different from the grocerystore beverage she was used to my imagination she told herself sung continued the crew was decent to us before we left i heard bad rumors about the crews on the smuggling ships but on the dragon they treated us okay gave us fresh water and food have you remembered anything about where the changs or the wus mightve gone nothing other than what i told you on the beach all we heard was that we were going to be dropped at a beach on long island and then trucks were going to take us to someplace in new york and the ghost can you tell me anything that might help us find him he shook his head the little snakeheads in china they were the ghosts representatives said that once we landed wed never see him again and they warned us not to try to contact him we think he had an assistant on board pretending to be one of the immigrants sachs said the ghost generally does that do you know who that mightve been no sung replied there were several men in the hold who stayed by themselves they didnt say much to anyone it mightve been one of them but i never paid any attention i dont know their names did the crew say anything about what the ghost would do when he got to the country sung grew grave and seemed to be considering something he said nothing specific they were afraid of him too i think but one thing i dont know if it will help you but its something i heard the captain of the ship was talking about the ghost and used the expression pofu chen zhou about him it translates literally as break the cauldrons and sink the boats youd say i suppose there is no turning back it refers to a warrior from the qin dynasty after his troops had crossed a river to attack some enemy thats what he ordered his men to do break the cauldrons and sink the boats so thered be no possibility of either encamping or retreating if they wanted to survive they had to push forward and destroy the other side the ghost is that kind of enemy so he wont stop until he finds and kills the families sachs reflected uneasily silence fell between them interrupted by the grating sounds of traffic on canal street on impulse sachs asked your wife is in china sung looked into her eyes and said evenly she died last year im sorry in a reeducation camp the officials said that she got sick but they never told me what her illness was and there was no autopsy i hope that she did get sick though rather that than to think she was tortured to death sachs felt a chill surge through her at these words she was a dissident too he nodded thats how we met at a protest in beijing ten years ago on the anniversary of tiananmen square over the years she became more outspoken than me before she was arrested we were going to come here together with the children sungs voice faded and he let the ellipses following his words explain the essential sorrow of his present life finally he said i decided i couldnt stay in the country any longer politically it was dangerous of course but more than that there were too many associations with my wife i decided to come here apply for asylum and then send for my children a faint smile after my mourning is over ill find a woman here to be the mother to my children he shrugged and sipped tea but that will be in the future his hand went to the amulet he wore her eyes followed it he noticed and took it off his neck and handed it to her my goodluck charm maybe it works he laughed it brought you to me when i was drowning what is it she asked holding the carving close its a carving from qingtian south of fuzhou the soapstone there is very famous it was a present from my wife its broken she observed rubbing the fracture with her nail some of the soft stone flaked off it got chipped on the rock i was holding on to when you saved me the design was of a monkey sitting on his haunches the creature seemed humanlike wily and shrewd sung explained he is a famous character in chinese mythology the monkey king she handed the amulet back to him he replaced it and the charm dropped back against his muscular hairless chest the bandages from the ghosts gunshot wound were just visible under the blue work shirt suddenly she was keenly aware of sungs presence inches away from her she could smell disinfectant soap and harsh laundry detergent from his clothes she felt an inexplicable comfort coming from him this man who was virtually a stranger she told him were leaving a patrol car outside your apartment to protect me yes this amused sung the public security bureau officers in china wouldnt do that theyd only park outside your door to spy or intimidate you youre not in kansas anymore john kansas an expression i have to get back to lincoln to the man i work with lincoln rhyme she rose felt a stab of pain in her knee wait sung said he took her hand she felt a serene power radiating from his touch he said open your mouth what she laughed lean forward open your mouth why im a doctor i want to look at your tongue amused she did and he examined her mouth quickly you have arthritis he said releasing her hand and sitting back chronic she said how did you know that as i said im a doctor come back and i will treat you she laughed ive been to dozens of doctors western medicine western doctors they have their place chinese medicine is best for curing chronic pains and discomfort problems that seem to arise for no apparent reason there always is a reason though there are things i can do that will help im indebted to you you saved my life i would be shamed if i didnt repay that that was two big guys in black rubber suits no no if not for you i would have drowned i know that so please you will come back and let me help you she hesitated for a moment but then as if prodding her to act a bolt of pain shot through her knee she gave no outward reaction to the twinge but kept a placid face as she took out her pen and gave sung her cell phone number standing on central park west sonny li was confused what was with the public security bureau here hongse drove that fast yellow car bang bang like a tv cop and now it seemed the officers were hunting the ghost from a building as luxurious as this no psb officer in china could afford such an apartment even the most corrupt and there were some pretty damn corrupt public security officers li tossed his cigarette away spat on the grass and then with his head down walked quickly across the street into the alley that led to the back of the building even the alley was spotless in lis home of liu guoyuan which was richer than most towns in china an alley like this would have been piled high with trash and discarded appliances he paused looked around the corner and found the back door of the building open a young man with perfectly trimmed blond hair wearing dark slacks a light shirt and a flowery tie stepped out he carted two green plastic trash bags with him which he carried to a large blue metal container and tossed inside the man glanced around the alley picked up a few stray pieces of paper and threw those out too he brushed his hands together then returned inside pulling the door closed it didnt however latch thank you sir sonny li slipped into the basement smelling the powerful musty scent of the place listening for sounds the young mans footsteps ascended the stairs li waited behind a stack of large cartons for him to return but the man had apparently gone on to other chores there were creaks from upstairs and the sound of running water li glanced into cardboard boxes on the floor some were filled with clothes others seemed to be memorabilia plaques awards degrees from schools university of illynoise li pronounced the english to himself the american institute of forensic science achievement award a federal bureau of investigation letter of commendation signed by the director himself dozens of others the recipient of all of these commendations was lincoln rhyme the blond man was apparently not bringing any more trash downstairs and li left his hiding place up a flight of stairs walking slowly the wood was old and he stepped carefully to avoid creaks he paused behind the door at the top and pushed it open slightly then loud footsteps came toward him several people it seemed like li pressed himself back against the wall beside some mops and brooms voices calling well be back in a couple of hours linc well have forensics call some other things that li couldnt understand the footsteps stopped and li heard another man ask hey lincoln you want one of us to stay another voice irritated responded stay why would i want somebody to stay i want to get some work done and i dont want any interruptions im just saying it might be better to have somebody with a weapon the ghosts fucking vanished his assistant too you said yourself to watch our backs but hows he going to find me hows he going to know where on gods green earth i live i dont need anyone to babysit me i need you to get me that goddamn information i wanted okay okay from above the sounds of people walking a door opening and closing then silence sonny li listened for a moment he pushed the door open fully and glanced out in front of him was a long corridor that led to the front door the one through which the men presumably other security bureau officers had just left to lis right was an entryway to what must have been a living room staying close to the baseboards to keep his footsteps quiet li moved through this hallway he paused outside the living room then looked in quickly an odd sight the room was filled with scientific equipment computers tables charts and books of all kinds which was the last thing one would expect to find in this fine old building but what was more curious was the darkhaired man sitting in a complicated red wheelchair in the middle of the room leaning forward looking at a computer screen talking to himself it seemed then li realized that no the man was talking into a microphone near his mouth the mike must have been sending signals to the computer telling it what to do the screen responded to his commands so was this creature lincoln rhyme well it hardly mattered who he was and besides li had no time to speculate he didnt know when the other officers would return lifting the gun sonny li stepped into the room chapter thirteen one meter forward another sonny li was a slight man and he moved silently sneaking closer to the back of the wheelchair looking on the tabletops for any evidence or information about the ghost he would li had no idea where the men came from one of them far taller than li was black as coal and wearing a suit and bright yellow shirt hed been hiding against the wall inside the room in a seamless motion he swept the gun from lis hand and pressed a pistol against his temple another man short and fat flung li to the ground and knelt on his back pushing the air from his lungs as sharp pain coursed through his belly and sides handcuffs were ratcheted on fast as an eel english the black man asked li was too shocked to answer ima ask you once more skel do you speak english a chinese man whod also been hiding in the room stepped forward he wore a stylish dark suit and had a badge dangling from a chain around his neck he asked the same question in chinese it was the cantonese dialect but li was able to understand yes li responded breathlessly i talk english the man in the wheelchair spun around lets see what weve caught the black man hauled him to his feet nearly off the ground ignoring lis moans and gasps of pain holding him with one hand he began patting his pockets with the other listen here you little skel i find any needles in your pockets i find anything thats gonna poke me unpleasantly answer the question now and tell the truth cause if i get poked you gonna get poked too he shook li by the collar and shouted needles you saying drug stuff no no the man pulled the cash out of his pockets his cigarettes ammunition the sheet of paper hed stolen from the beach ah looks like this boy here borrowed something he shouldnta from ayemelia an while she was busy savin lives no less shame on him thats how he found us lincoln rhyme said eyeing the sheet of paper with his card attached i was wondering the trim blond man appeared in the doorway so you got him he said without surprise and li understood then that this young man had spotted him in the alley when hed taken out the bags and had left the door open on purpose to draw him upstairs and the other men had made a noisy show of departing pretending to leave lincoln alone soyou got him the man in the wheelchair noticed the disgust in lis eyes he said thats right my observant thom here spotted you when he took the trash out and then he nodded at the computer screen and said command security back door on the computer screen a video image of the back door of the building and the alley popped up li suddenly understood how the coast guard had located the fuzhou dragon floating in the endless ocean this man lincoln rhyme judges of hell he muttered the fat officer laughed dontcha just hate days like this then the black man pulled lis wallet out of his pocket he squeezed the damp leather our lil skel here been swimming i deduce he opened the wallet and handed it to the chinese officer the fat man pulled out a radio and spoke into it mel alan come on back in we got him two men probably the ones li had heard leaving a few moments ago returned a balding slight man ignored li and walked to a computer began to type frantically on it the other was a man in a suit with striking red hair he blinked in surprise and said wait thats not the ghost his missing assistant then rhyme said his bangshou no the redhaired man said i know him ive seen him before li realized that there was something familiar about this man too seen him the black officer asked some of us from ins were at a meeting last year in the fuzhou public security bureau about human smuggling he was there he was one of them one of who the fat officer grumbled the chinese officer gave a laugh and held up an id card from lis wallet comparing lis picture with his face one of us he said hes a cop rhyme too examined the card and the drivers license both of which had pictures of the man they gave his name as li kangmei a detective with the liu guoyuan public security bureau the criminalist said to dellray see if any of our people in china can confirm it a tiny cell phone appeared in the agents large hand and he started punching keys looking over the diminutive man rhyme asked li is your first or last name last and i not like kangmei he explained i use sonny western name whatre you doing here rhyme asked ghost he kill three people in my town last year he had meeting im saying had meeting with little snakehead in restaurant you know what is little snakehead rhyme nodded go on the little snakehead cheating him big fight ghost kill him but woman and her daughter also killed and old man sitting on bench got in way and ghost just kill them to escape im saying bystanders li nodded we try to arrest him but he has very powerful he sought for a word finally he turned to eddie deng and said guanxi that means connections deng explained you pay off the right people and you get good guanxi li nodded no one willing testify against him then evidence in shooting disappear from headquarters office my boss lose interest case got collectivized collectivized sellitto asked li smiled grimly when something ruined we say it got collectivized in old days maos day when government turn business or farm into commune or collective it fail pretty fuck fast but rhyme offered the case wasnt collectivized to you no li said his eyes hard ebony disks

important guys and was leaving from china for month until taiwan nsb stop looking for him he going to south of france then taking immigrants from vyborg in russia to new york on fuzhoudragon rhyme

ghost where he stays here associates of his no nobody talk to me much got on deck when crew not looking mostly for puking he shook his head apparently at the unpleasant memory of the voyage but not get close to ghost coe said but what were you going to do we wouldnt extradite him to china perplexed li said why i want him extradited you not listen guanxi im saying in china they let him go i going

mean no smoking why not because you cant the aide said firmly that craziest thing you not make joke no subway stupid enough but this is house im saying yes a house where you cant smoke very fuck li said he grudgingly put the pack away a faint beeping from across the room mel cooper turned to his computer he read for a moment and then spun the screen around so that everybody could look the fbis singapore office had sent an email confirmation that li kangmei was indeed a detective in the liu guoyuan public security bureau of the peoples republic of china he was presently listed as being on undercover assignment but his office would say no more about it a picture of li in a navyblue uniform accompanied the message it was clearly the man in the room before them li then explained how the ghost had scuttled the dragon sam chang and wu qichen and their families along with dr sung several other immigrants and the baby of a woman on board the ship got away in a life raft everyone else drowned sam chang he become leader on raft good man smart save my life pick me up when ghost shooting people wu was father of second family wu smart too but not balanced liverspleen disharmony deng saw rhymes frown and said chinese medicine hard to explain li continued wu too emotion im saying does impulse things even the fbis crack behavioral profiling was out of rhymes comfort zone being the physical scientist that he was he had no time whatsoever for disharmonious spleens lets stick with facts he said li then told them how the raft hit the rocks and he sung and the others were washed overboard they were swept down the shoreline by the time li made it back to where the raft had beached the ghost had killed two of the immigrants i hurry to arrest him but by time i get there he gone i hide in bushes on other side of road i saw woman with red hair rescue one man john sung rhyme said dr sung li nodded sat next to me on raft he okay the ghost shot him but hell be all right amelia the woman you saw is interviewing him now hongse i call her hey pretty girl sexy im saying sellitto and rhyme shared a humorous glance rhyme was picturing the consequences if li had said that to sachss face li pointed around the town house i get address from her car and come here thinking maybe i get stuff that lead me to ghost information im saying evidence steal it coe asked yes sure he said unabashedly whyd you do that you little skel dellray asked menacingly using a popular cop word short for skeleton meaning basically worthless little snitch have to get it for myself because hey you not let me help you right you just send me back and i going to arrest him collar right you say collar coe said well youre right youre not helping us you may be a cop in china but here youre just one more fucking undocumented you are going back eyes flashing angrily sonny li stepped close to coe who towered over the small man sellitto sighed and tugged li back by the shirt naw none of that shit amused at the mans bravado coe reached for his cuffs li youre under arrest for entering the united states but lincoln rhyme said no i want him what the agent asked in shock hell be a consultant like me impossible anybody who goes to this much trouble to nail a perp i want him working on our side you bet i help loaban do lots im saying whatd you call me li explained to rhyme loaban it mean boss you got keep me i can help i know how ghost think we from same world him and me i in gang when i boy like him and spent lots time as undercover officer working docks in fuzhou no way coe blurted for christs sake hes an undocumented as soon as we turn our back hell just run off get drunk and go to a gambling parlor rhyme wondered if a kung fu match was about to break out but this time li ignored coe and spoke in a reasonable voice in my country we got four classes people not like rich and poor stuff like you got here in china what you do more important than money you got and know what highest honor is working for country working for people that what i do and i one fuck good cop im saying theyre all on the take over there coe muttered i not on take okay li then grinned not on important case like this coe said and how do we know hes not really on the ghosts payroll li laughed hey how we know you not working for him fuck you coe said he was furious the young ins agents problem rhyme assessed was that he was too emotional to be an effective law enforcer the criminalist often heard contempt in his voice when he spoke about the undocumenteds he seemed affronted that they would break federal law to sneak into this country and had suggested several times that immigrants were motivated essentially by greed to come here not by a love of freedom or democracy apart from his derisive attitude toward the aliens however he had a troubling personal stake in collaring the ghost several years ago coe had been stationed in taipei the capital of taiwan running undercover agents in mainland china trying to identify major snakeheads during an investigation of the ghost one of his informants a woman had disappeared and presumably been killed later it was learned that the woman had two young children but had so desperately needed money that she was willing to snitch on the ghost the ins never would have used her as an informant if theyd known that she had children coe was reprimanded suspended for six months hed become obsessed with collaring the ghost but to be a good cop youve got to tuck those personal feelings away detachment is absolutely necessary this was a variation on rhymes rule about giving up the dead dellray said listen up aint in the mood tput you kiddies in a timeout corner so juss settle down li stays with us fors long as lincoln wants him make it happen coe call somebody at the state department and get him a temporary visa we all together on that coe muttered no im not all together on that you cant have one of them on a task force them dellray asked pivoting on a very long foot who exactly might them be undocumenteds the tall agent clicked his tongue now you know coe that words kinda like marbles in a blender to me doesnt sound respectful doesnt sound nice specially the way you say it well as you folks from the bureauve made clear all along this isnt really an ins case keep him if you want but im not taking any heat for it you make good decision sonny li said to rhyme i help lots loaban li walked over to the table and picked up the gun hed been carrying nup nup nup dellray said get your hands offa that hey i a cop like you no you aint a cop like me or anysinglesolitary soul else here no guns okay okay keep gun for now heise whats that dellray snapped heise means black hey hey dont get offense nothing bad nothing bad well can it sure i can it sure welcome on board sonny rhyme said then glanced at the clock it was just noon six hours had passed since the ghost began his relentless pursuit of the immigrants he could be closing in on the poor families even now okay lets start on the evidence sure sure li said suddenly distracted but i need cigarette first come on loaban you let me all right rhyme snapped but outside and for christs sake somebody go with him chapter fourteen wu qichen wiped the sweat off his wifes forehead shivering burning with fever soaking with sweat she lay on a mattress in the bedroom of their tiny apartment the basement rooms were down an alley off canal street in the heart of chinatown theyd been provided by the broker that jimmy mah had sent them to a robber wu had thought angrily the rent was ridiculous as was the fee the slimy man had demanded the apartment stank the place was virtually unfurnished and roaches roamed the floor boldly even now in the diffuse noon light bleeding in through the greasy windows he studied his wife with concern the raging headache yongping had suffered on board the dragon the lethargy the chills and sweats which hed believed were seasickness had persisted even after theyd landed she was afflicted with something else his wife opened her feverglazed eyes if i die she whispered you wont die her husband said but wu wasnt sure that he believed his own words he remembered dr john sung in the hold of the dragon and wished hed asked the mans opinion on his wifes condition the doctor had treated several of the immigrants for various maladies but wu had been afraid that hed charge him money to examine yongping sleep wu said sternly you need rest youll be fine if you rest why wont you do that if i die you must find a woman someone to take care of the children you wont die where is my son yongping asked lang is in the living room he glanced through the doorway and saw the boy on the couch and teenage chinmei hanging laundry on a line strung through the room after theyd arrived the family had taken turns showering then dressing in the clean clothes that wu had bought at a discount store on canal street after some food which yongping had not taken a single bite of chinmei had directed her brother to the tv set and washed their saltwaterencrusted clothing in the kitchen sink this is what she was now hanging up to dry wus wife looked around the room squinting as if trying to remember where she was she gave up and rested her head on the pillow where where are we were in chinatown in manhattan of new york but she frowned as his words belatedly registered in her feverish brain the ghost husband we cant stay here its not safe sam chang said we should not stay ah the ghost he gestured dismissively he has gone back to china no yongping said i dont think so im scared for our children we have to leave we have to get as far away from here as we can wu pointed out no snakehead would risk being captured or shot just to find a few immigrants whod escaped are you foolish enough to think that please husband sam chang said forget chang hes a coward he snapped were staying his anger at her disobedience was tempered by the sight of the poor woman and the pain she must be suffering he added softly im going out im going to get you some medicine she didnt respond and he rose and walked into the living room he glanced at the children who looked uneasily toward the room where their mother lay is she all right the teenage girl asked yes shell be fine ill be back in a half hour he said ill get some medicine wait father chinmei said uncertainly looking down what may i come with you the girl asked no you will stay with your mother and brother but what there is something i need a fashion magazine he thought cynically makeup hair spray she wants me to spend our survival money on her pretty face what please let me come with you ill buy it myself she was blushing fiercely what do you want he demanded i need some things for she whispered head down for what he asked harshly answer me she swallowed for my time you know pads with a shock wu suddenly understood he looked away from the girl and gestured angrily toward the bathroom use something in there i cant its uncomfortable wu was furious it was his wifes job to take care of matters like this no man he ever knew bought those things all right he snapped all right ill buy you what you need he refused to ask her what kind she wanted hed get the first box of whatever was in the closest store shed have to use that he stepped outside and locked the door behind him wu qichen walked down the busy streets of chinatown hearing a cacophony of languages minnanhua cantonese putonghua vietnamese and korean english too laced with more accents and dialects than hed ever known existed he gazed at the stores and shops the piles of merchandise the huge highrises ringing the city new york seemed ten times bigger than hong kong and a hundred times the size of fuzhou im scared for our children we have to leave we have to get as far away from here as we can but wu qichen had no intention of leaving manhattan the fortyyearold man had nurtured a dream all his life and he wouldnt let his wifes sickness or the faint threat from a bully of a snakehead deter him from it wu qichen was going to become a wealthy man the richest ever in his family in his twenties hed been a bellboy then a junior assistant manager at the paradise hotel on hundong road near hot springs park in the heart of fuzhou waiting on rich chinese and europeans wu had decided then that he would be a successful businessman he worked hard at the hotel and even though he gave his parents a quarter of his income he managed to save enough to buy a sundries and souvenir shop near the famous statue of mao zedong on gutian road with his two brothers with the money they made from that store they bought one grocery then two more they intended to run the businesses for several years and save as much money as they could then buy a building and make their fortune at real estate but wu qichen made one mistake the economic face of china was changing drastically economic free zones were prospering and even the top politicos had been speaking favorably of private business the chinese leader deng xiaoping himself had said to be wealthy is glorious but wu neglected to remember the first rule of chinese life that the ccp the chinese communist partyruns the show wu was bluntly vocal in his call for closer economic ties with taiwan ending the iron rice bowl system of guaranteed employment regardless of productivity and cracking down on party and government officials taking bribes and levying arbitrary taxes on businesses ironically wu didnt even care about what he advocated his point was merely to attract the attention of western trading partners in europe and america who he dreamed would come to him with money to invest because he was the voice of the new chinese economy but it wasnt the west who listened to the skinny man it was the cadres and secretaries of the communist party suddenly governmental inspectors began appearing at the wus stores finding dozens of violations of health and safety codes many of which they simply made up on the spot unable to pay the crushing fines the brothers were soon broke as shamed as he was by his lowered station though wu refused to give up on his goal of becoming rich and so seduced by the fat opportunities in the beautiful country wu qichen had bundled up his family and risked immigrating illegally he would become a landlord in chinatown he would ride to work in a limousine and when finally he was able to travel back to china he would walk into the paradise hotel and stay in the grandest suite the penthouse the very room to which as a young man he had carried hundreds of bags no his dreams had been delayed too long the ghost would not drive him from the city of money wu now found a chinese medicine store he stepped inside and talked to the herbalist about his wifes condition the doctor listened carefully and diagnosed deficient qi the life spirit and obstructed blood both of which were aggravated by excessive cold he put together a bundle of herbs for wu who reluctantly paid the huge bill of eighteen dollars furious once again that hed been taken advantage of leaving the herbalist he continued down the street to a chinese grocery store he stepped inside quickly before his courage broke found a basket and grabbed some groceries he didnt need he swooped past the drug section picking up a box of womens pads for his daughter he walked quickly to the counter and kept his eyes on a glass container of ginseng root throughout the entire transaction the grayhaired woman rang up the purchase and though she didnt smile or call attention to his purchase wu knew she was laughing at him he left the store with his head down and his face as red as the chinese flag wu turned in the direction of his apartment but after five minutes of fast walking he slowed and began meandering through the side streets he was concerned about his wife of course and about leaving his children but gods of heaven this day had been a nightmare hed nearly been killed in a shipwreck hed lost all his possessions had been cheated by jimmy mah and the real estate broker and worst of all hed endured the shame and humiliation of buying what was in the bag in his hand right now he decided that he needed some diversion some male companionship it took only a few minutes to find what hed sought a fujianese gambling den after showing his money to the guard in front he was admitted he sat silently for a time playing thirteen points smoking and drinking some baijiu he won a little money and began to feel better another cup of the powerful clear spirits then another and finally he relaxed making sure though that the grocery bag was completely hidden beneath his chair eventually he struck up a conversation with the men around him and from the thirty dollars he won a huge sum to him he bought them drinks drunk and in good humor he told a joke and a number of the men laughed hard with the conspiratorial tone of men alone they all shared stories of disobedient wives and disrespectful children the places they now lived and what jobs they had or were seeking wu lifted his cup here is to zai chen he announced drunkenly this was the god of wealth and one of the most revered throughout china wu believed that he had a special connection with this folk deity the men all tossed back their drinks youre new here an old man said when did you come over pleased that he had the spotlight among his equals wu bragged in a whisper just this morning on the ship that sank the fuzhoudragon one man asked his eyebrow raised it was on the news they said the seas were terrible ah wu said the waves were fifteen meters high the snakehead tried to kill us all but i got a dozen people out of the hold and then i had to swim underwater to cut a life raft off the deck i nearly drowned but i managed to get us to shore you did that yourself he looked down sadly i couldnt save them all but i tried another asked him is your family all right yes wu answered drunkenly are you in the neighborhood up the street what is the ghost like one man asked hes all bluff and a coward hes never without a gun if hed put it aside and fought like a man with a knife i could have killed him easily then wu fell silent as sam changs words began to echo in his mind he realized he probably should not be saying these things he changed the subject can someone tell me theres a statue i want to see maybe you can tell me where it is the man nearest wu asked statue which one there are statues everywhere here its very famous its of a woman and shes holding her accounts accounts another man asked yes wu explained you see her in movies about the beautiful country shes on an island somewhere holding a lantern in one hand and a book of her business accounts in the other shes holding the torch so she can read her register at any time of the night or day and see how much money she has is that here in new york yes shes here one man said but he began laughing several of the others did too wu joined in though he had no idea what was so funny you go down to a place called battery park and take a boat out to see the statue i will do that another man laughed to the lady of accounts they all emptied their glasses and resumed the game chapter fifteen amelia sachs returned from the witnesss apartment in chinatown and rhyme was amused to see the harsh look with which she studied sonny li when he announced with consummate pride that he was a detective with public security bureau in peoples republic of china you dont say she responded coolly sellitto explained to her about the chinese cops presence you check him out she asked closely studying the man who was nearly a foot shorter than she li spoke before the detective could they checked me out good hongse im clean hoankseh what the hells that she barked he held up his hands defensively means red only that nothing bad your hair im saying i saw you on beach saw your hair rhyme believed that there was the dabbling of a flirt in his crookedtooth smile eddie deng confirmed that the word meant only the color there was no secondary derogatory meaning to it hes okay amelia dellray confirmed though he oughta be in a holding cell coe muttered sachs shrugged and turned to the chinese cop whatd you mean about the beach you were spying on me not say anything then afraid you send me back wanted chance to get ghost too sachs rolled her eyes wait hongse here he held out some crumpled dollars she frowned whats that on beach your bag im saying i need money i borrow it sachs looked into her purse snapped it shut loudly jesus christ a glance at sellitto can i collar him now no no i am paying back not thief here look all there ten dollar extra even ten extra interest im saying whered you get it she asked cynically i mean whod you steal this from no no it okay well theres a defense for you its okay sachs sighed took the money and handed back the questionable ten she then told the team what the witness john sung had said rhyme relaxed a bit more about his decision to keep sonny li when he heard that sung confirmed the information li had given them bolstering the chinese cops credibility he was troubled though when sachs mentioned john sungs story about the captains assessment of the ghost break the cauldrons and sink the boats she said explaining the meaning of the expression to fu chen zhou li said nodding grimly that describe ghost good never relax or retreat until you win sachs then began to help mel cooper log in the evidence from the van cataloging it and carefully filling out chain of custody cards to show at trial that the evidence was accounted for and hadnt been tampered with she was bagging the bloody rag shed found in the van when cooper looked at the sheet of newsprint on the table underneath the bag she was holding he frowned the tech pulled on latex gloves and extracted the bloody rag from the plastic using a magnifying glass he looked it over carefully thiss odd lincoln cooper said odd what does odd mean give me details give me anomalies give me specifics i missed these fragments look he held the cloth over a large sheet of newsprint and caressed it carefully with a brush rhyme couldnt see anything some kind of porous stone cooper said leaning over the sheet with a magnifying glass how could i miss it the tech seemed disheartened where had the fragments come from had they been embedded in a fold what were they oh hell sachs muttered looking at her hands what rhyme asked blushing she held up her fingers that was from me i picked it up without gloves without gloves rhyme asked an edge in his voice this was a serious error by a crime scene tech apart from the fact that the rag contained blood which might be tainted with hiv or hepatitis shed contaminated the evidence as head of the forensic unit at the nypd lincoln rhyme had fired people for this type of lapse im sorry sachs said i know what its from john dr sung was showing me this amulet he wore it was chipped and i guess i picked at it with my nail are you sure thats it rhyme demanded li nodded and said i remember sung let children on fuzhou dragon play with it qingtian soapstone worth some money im saying good luck he added it was of monkey very famous in china eddie deng nodded sure the monkey king he was a mythological figure my fatherd read me stories about him but rhyme wasnt interested in any myths he was trying to catch a killer and save some lives and trying to figure out why sachs had made a mistake of this magnitude a rookies mistake the mistake of someone whos distracted and what exactly is on her mind he wondered throw out the he began im sorry she repeated throw out that top sheet of newsprint rhyme said evenly lets move on as the tech tore off the sheet of paper his computer beeped incoming he read the screen okay weve got the blood types back all samplesre from the same person presumably from the injured woman its type ab negative and the barr body test confirms that its a womans blood up on the wall thom rhyme called and the aide wrote before he was finished mel coopers computer summoned them again its the afis search results they were discouraged to find that the search of the fingerprints sachs had collected came back negative but as he examined the prints which were digitized and sitting on the screen in front of them rhyme observed something unusual about the clearest prints theyd lifted from the pipe used to break into the van they knew these were the prints of sam chang because they matched a few lifted from the outboard motor and li had confirmed that chang had piloted the raft to shore look at those lines he said whatcha see lincoln dellray asked rhyme said nothing to the agent but wheeling close to the screen ordered command cursor down stop cursor left stop the arrow of the cursor on the screen stopped on a line an indentation on the pad of the index finger of changs right hand there were similar ones on his middle finger and his thumb as if chang had been tightly gripping a thin cord what is that rhyme wondered aloud callus a scar eddie deng offered mel cooper offered never seen that before maybe its a cut or wound of some kind maybe a rope burn sachs suggested no thatd be a blister it must be a wound of some kind did you see any scars on changs hands rhyme asked li no i not see indentations calluses and scars on fingers and palms can be revealing about the professions or hobbies of the people who leave the prints or on the actual fingers themselves in the case of suspects or victims these are less useful nowadays where the only physical skill required by so many professions is keyboarding or jotting notes still people who are in the manual trades for instance or who play certain sports frequently develop distinctive markings on their hands rhyme had no idea what this pattern meant but some additional information might reveal that he instructed thom to write the observation down on the board he then took a call from special agent tobe geller one of the fbis computer and electronics gurus presently assigned to the manhattan office hed completed his analysis of the ghosts cell phone which sachs had found in the second raft at easton beach the criminalist transferred the call to the speakerphone and a moment later gellers animated voice said now let me tell you this is an excessively interesting phone rhyme didnt know the young man well but he remembered curly hair an easy disposition and a consuming passion for anything containing microchips howsat dellray asked first of all dont get your hopes up its virtually untraceable we call em hot phones the memory chips been deactivated so that the phone doesnt record the last call dialed or incoming calls the log features are out completely and its a satellite phone you can call anywhere in the world and you dont need to go through local service providers the signals are relayed through a government network in fuzhou the ghost or somebody working for him hacked into the system to activate it dellray snapped well lets juss call somebody in the peoples fuckin republic and tell em this bad guys using their system we tried that but the chinese position is that nobody can hack their phone system so we must be mistaken thank you for your interest even if it means helpin collar the ghost geller said i mentioned kwan ang by name they still werent interested meaning they were probably paid off guanxi rhyme thanked the young agent and they hung up score one for the ghost the criminalist thought angrily they were somewhat more successful with the firearms database mel cooper found that the shell casings matched one of two weapons both of them dating back nearly fifty years a russian tokarev mm automatic was one type but cooper continued im betting he was using the model a chinese version of the tokarev virtually the same gun yeah yeah sonny li said gotta be im saying i had tokarev but lost it in ocean more peoples in china got s ammunition rhyme asked he might need to replenish it here somewhere he was thinking that if the ammo was rare they might stake out the most likely places the ghost would go to purchase more but cooper shook his head you can buy the shells in any goodsized gun shop damn a messenger arrived with an envelope sellitto took it and tore the end off he extracted a handful of photographs he glanced at rhyme with a raised eyebrow the three bodies the coast guard recovered from the water about a mile offshore two shot one drowned the photos were facial shots of the dead men eyes partially open but glazed one had a hole in his temple the other two showed no sign of visible injuries there were fingerprint cards too those two li said they crew members other guy one of immigrants down in hold with us dont know name pin them up rhyme said and run the prints through afis sellitto taped them to the board under the ghostkill heading and rhyme realized that the room had gone silent as the members of the team stared at the macabre additions to the evidence charts he supposed that coe and deng had little experience with corpses that was one thing about crime scene detail he recalled how fast one becomes immune to the countenance of death sonny li continued to gaze at the photos silently for a moment he muttered something in chinese what was that rhyme asked he glanced at the criminalist i said judges of hell just expression we have myth in china ten judges of hell decide where your name go in register of living and dead judges decide when you born and when you die everybody in world name is in register rhyme thought momentarily of recent doctors appointments and of his upcoming operation he wondered exactly where his own name was entered in the register of the living and the dead the silence was then broken by another beep from the computer mel cooper glanced at the screen got the make of the drivers car at the beach bmw x its one of those fancy fourbyfours he added i myself drive a tenyearold dodge good mileage though put it on the chart as thom wrote li looked at the board and asked whose car that sellitto said we think somebody was at the beach to pick up the ghost thats what he was driving a nod at the board what happen him looks like he panicked and took off deng said the ghost shot at him but he got away he leave ghost behind li asked frowning yep dellray confirmed rhyme ordered run the make through motor vehicles new york jersey and connecticut too can you break the search down to lets say a hundred fifty miles outside of manhattan yup cooper logged online heading for the secure dmv sites remember when this took weeks he mused with a faint hum rhymes wheelchair drove up to the screen in front of the tech only a moment later he could see the screen fill with the names and addresses of all the registered owners of xs shit dellray muttered walking close how many we got more popular car than id hoped cooper said hundreds whatre the names sellitto asked any chinese cooper scrolled through the list sounds like two ling and zhao he looked at eddie deng who nodded his confirmation yep theyre chinese cooper continued but neither of themre close to downtown ones in white plains and the others in new jersey paramus have new york and jersey troopers check em out dellray ordered the tech continued to scroll through the list heres a possibility therere about forty xs registered to corporations and another fifty or so registered to leasing agents any of the corporations sound chinese rhyme asked wishing he himself could pound on the keys and scroll quickly through the list nope cooper replied but theyre all pretty generic holding companies you know itd be a bear but we could contact all of them and the leasing companies too find out whos actually driving the cars too much of a long shot rhyme said waste of resources itll take days have a couple of officers from downtown check the ones closest to chinatown but no no loaban sonny li interrupted you got to find that car number one thing you do fast rhyme lifted a querying eyebrow the chinese cop continued find it now beemer right you call them beemers put lots people on it all your cops im saying whole bunch itll take too much time rhyme muttered irritated at the distraction we dont have the manpower wed have to find somebody in the corporation who was in charge of buying cars and if it was leased talk to the dealers leasing agent get the records and half of them wouldnt do it without a court order i want to concentrate on finding the changs and the wus no loaban li insisted the ghost he going to kill that driver that what he doing now looking for him nup ima thinking youre wrong dellray said his prioritys killing the wits from the boat what you mean wit witnesses sellitto explained sachs agreed my take is that sure hes pissed about the driver leaving him and maybe hell go after him if he has time later but not now no no li said shaking his head emphatically important im saying find man in beemer why sachs asked very clear very obvious get that driver he lead you to snakehead maybe use him as bait to find ghost and what sonny a testy lincoln rhyme muttered darkly is your basis for that conclusion wherere the data to support it lots data im saying what the small man shrugged when i on bus coming to city this morning i saw sign a road sign rhyme asked what do you mean no no what you say it i dont know he spoke in chinese to eddie deng the young detective said he means an omen an omen rhyme barked as if he were tasting spoiled fish li reached absently for his cigarettes then left them untouched when he saw thoms sharp glance he continued i am coming into town on bus im saying i saw crow on road picking at food another crow tried steal it and first crow not just scare other away he chase and try to peck eyes out not leave thief alone li raised his palms this was apparently his entire argument and not clear loaban what i say no what youre saying isnt the least fucking bit clear okay okay i remember that crow now and i start thinking about ghost and who he is and thinking about driver man in fancy beemer and who he is well he is enemy to ghost like crow stealing food the families the wus the changs they not do anything bad to him personal im saying the driver li frowned looked frustrated and spoke again to deng who offered betray yes betray him he now ghosts enemy lincoln rhyme tried not to laugh noted sonny he turned back to dellray and sellitto now i see your face loaban li said i not saying gods come down and give me sign of crows but remembering birds make me think different way open up my mind get wind flowing through it that good you not think no i think its superstitious rhyme said its woo woo and we dont have any time for what the hell are you laughing at woo woo you say woo woo you speaking chinese woo mean fog so you say something woo woo it foggy unclear well to us it means supernatural bullshit even facing rhymes considerable bluster li wouldnt back down no this not bullshit find that driver you got to loaban sachss eyes were studying the small persistent man i dont know rhyme no way fuck good idea im saying li assured the criminalist there was thick silence for a moment sellitto intervened how bout if we put bedding and saul on it give em a halfdozen guys from patrol linc they can check corporate and lease x registrations in manhattan and queens only those chinatown here and the one in flushing and if therere any other breaks and we need bodies well pull em off all right all right rhyme said angrily just get moving on it halfdozen just six right li complained need more than that but rhymes glare silenced him okay okay loaban pecking crows stone monkeys and the register of the living and the dead rhyme sighed then looked over the team now if its not too much to ask can we get back to some real police work ghostkill easton long island crime scene two immigrants killed on beach shot in back one immigrant wounded dr john sung bangshou assistant on board identity unknown ten immigrants escape seven adults one elderly one injured woman two children one infant steal church van blood samples sent to lab for typing injured woman is ab

immigrants with the home store logo blood spatter suggests injured woman has hand arm or shoulder injury blood samples sent to lab for typing injured woman is ab negative fingerprints sent to afis no matches chapter sixteen the family name chang means archer his father wife and children sitting around him sam chang with a calligraphers magic touch drew the chinese characters for this name on a slat of broken wood hed found in the backyard of their new apartment the silk case holding his prized wolf goat and rabbithair brushes ink stick and stone well had gone down with the fuzhou dragon and he was forced to use a dreadful american plastic pen still chang had learned calligraphy from his father when he was young and had practiced the art all his life so although the line width of the ink didnt vary the strokes were perfectly formed they were he decided like the studies by sixteenthcentury artist wan li who would do a simple rendering to record a scene he would later paint on ceramic the sketch was halfformed but beautiful in its own right chang took the piece of wood representing the family name and rested it on the impromptu cardboard altar sitting on the fireplace mantel in the living room china is a theological shopping mall a country in which the buddha is the most recognized traditional deity but where the philosophers confucius and laotzu stand as demigods where christianity and islam have large pockets of devotees and where the vast majority of people hedge their bets by regularly praying and sacrificing to folk gods so numerous no one knows exactly how many there are but highest in the pantheon of gods for most chinese are their ancestors and it was to the chang progenitors that this red altar was devoted decorated with the only ancestral likenesses that had survived the sinking of the ship seawaterstained snapshots from changs wallet of his parents and grandparents there he announced our home chang jiechi shook his sons hand and then gestured for tea which meimei poured for him the old man cupped the hot brew and looked around the dark rooms better than some despite the mans words though sam chang felt another wave of shame like a hot fever that he was subjecting his father to such a mean place as this the strongest duty after that owed to the ruler of the government according to confucius is that which a son owes to his father ever since chang had planned their escape from china hed worried about how the trip would affect the elderly man ever quiet and unemotional chang jiechi had taken the news of their impending flight silently leaving chang to wonder if he was doing the right thing in the old mans eyes and now after the sinking of the dragon their life wasnt going to get better any time soon this apartment would have to be their prison until the ghost was captured or went back to china which might be months from now he thought again about that place theyd stopped at to steal the paint and brushes the home store the rows of glistening bathtubs and mirrors and lights and marble slabs he wished he could have moved his father and family into a home outfitted with the wonderful things hed seen there this was squalor this was a firm knock on the door for a moment no one in the family moved then chang looked out through the curtain and relaxed he opened the door and broke into a smile at the sight of the middleaged man wearing jeans and a sweatshirt joseph tan walked inside and the men shook hands chang glanced outside into the quiet residential street and saw no one who looked like enforcers for the snakehead in the humid overcast air was a foul smell the apartment it turned out was not far from a sewage treatment plant he stepped inside locked the door tan the brother of a good friend of changs in fujian had come over here some years ago he was a us citizen and since he had no history of dissident activity traveled freely between china and new york chang had spent several evenings with him and his brother in fuzhou last spring and had finally grown comfortable enough to share with tan the news that he intended to bring his family to the beautiful country tan had volunteered to help he had arranged for this apartment and for chang and his oldest son to work in one of tans businesses a quick printing shop not far from the apartment the easygoing man now paid respects to elderly chang jiechi and then to meimei and they sat down to tea tan offered cigarettes sam chang declined but his father took one and the two men smoked we heard about the ship on the news tan said i thanked guan yin you were safe many died it was terrible we nearly drowned all of us the tv said the snakehead was the ghost chang replied that it was and that hed tried to kill them even after they came ashore then we will have to be very careful i will not mention your name to anyone but i have people around the shop who will be curious about you i had thought you should start work right away but now with the ghost it would be better to wait maybe next week or the week after ill train you then do you know about american printing equipment chang shook his head no in china hed been a professor of art and culture until his dissident status had gotten him fired just like the displaced and despised artists whod lost their jobs during the cultural revolution of the s chang had been forced to do rightthinking work labor and like many of the calligraphers and artists from that earlier era hed gotten a job as a printer but hed operated only outdated chinese or russian presses they spoke for a time about life in china and life here then tan wrote out directions to the shop and the hours chang and his son would be working he asked to meet william chang opened the door to the boys bedroom he stared first in surprise then in dismay at the empty room william was not there he turned to meimei where is our son he was in the bedroom i didnt see him leave chang strode to the back door and found it was unlocked william had left it unlatched when hed snuck out no the backyard was empty the alleyway behind it too he returned to the living room he asked tan where would a teenage boy go around here he speaks english better than we do at the corner theres a starbucks do you know them yes the coffee place a lot of chinese teenagers go there he wont say anything about the dragon will he chang said no im sure he knows the danger tan who had children himself said hell be your biggest problem hell watch that gesturing at the television set and want everything he sees on it video games and cars and clothes and hell want them without working for them because in the television you see people have things you dont see them earning them you came all this way you survived the atlantic ocean you survived the ghost dont get deported because the police arrest your son for shoplifting and turn him over to the ins chang understood what the man was saying but was panicking at the moment not able to concentrate on the advice the ghost might have bangshous all over the streets here or men who would sell their whereabouts to him i must go find my boy now he and tan walked outside to the sidewalk tan pointed him toward the corner where the coffee shop was located ill leave you now be strong with your son now that hes here it will be far more difficult but you must control him chang kept his head down as he walked past the cheap apartments laundromats delicatessens restaurants and stores this neighborhood was less congested than manhattan s chinatown sidewalks wider fewer people on the streets more than half the people here were asian but the population was mixed chinese vietnamese and korean there were many hispanics too and a number of indians and pakistanis hardly any whites he glanced into the shops as he walked past and didnt see his son in any of them he prayed to chenwu that the boy had merely gone for a walk by himself and that he hadnt met someone and told them how theyd come here perhaps trying to impress a girl a small park no sign of him a restaurant nothing he walked into the starbucks coffee shop and a number of cautious teenagers and complacent old men glanced at the immigrants troubled face william was not here chang ducked out quickly then happening to glance down a dim alley he saw his son the boy was talking with two young chinese men both wearing black leather jackets their hair was long and high swept back with spray or oil william handed one of them something chang couldnt see the man nodded to his friend and slipped a small bag into williams hand then the two turned quickly and walked back down the alley william looked into the bag examining what hed just received then stuffed it into his pocket no chang thought in shock what was this drugs his son was buying drugs chang ducked back out of the alley and when his son stepped out grabbed the shocked boy by his arm and pressed him against the wall how could you do this chang demanded leave me alone answer me william glanced at the nearby coffee shop where three or four people sat outside enjoying the momentary absence of rain theyd heard changs raised voice and glanced toward the boy and his father chang noticed them and released his son nodding with his head for the boy to follow dont you know that the ghost is looking for us he wants to kill us i wanted to go outside its like a prison here that fucking little room with my brother chang grabbed his sons arm again dont use that language with me you cant disobey me like this its a shitty little place i want a room of my own the boy replied pulling away later we all have to make sacrifices it was your choice to come here you can make the sacrifices dont speak to me that way chang said im your father i want a room i want some privacy you should be grateful we have someplace to stay at all none of us have rooms of our own your grandfather sleeps with your mother and me the boy said nothing hed learned many things about his son today that he was insolent that he was a car thief that the iron cables of obligation to family that had so absolutely guided sam changs life meant little to the boy chang wondered superstitiously if he had made a mistake in giving the boy his western name when he started school calling him after the american computer genius gates perhaps this had somehow caused the boy to veer onto a path of rebellion as they approached the apartment chang asked who were they who the boy answered evasively those men you were with nobody what did they sell you was it drugs irritated silence was the response they were at the front door to the apartment william started to walk past his father but chang stopped him he reached into the boys pocket williams arms rose hostilely and for a shocked moment chang thought his son would shove him away or even hit him but after an interminable moment he lowered his hands chang pulled out the bag and looked inside stunned at the sight of the small silver pistol what are you doing with this he whispered viciously so you can rob people silence tell me son his strong calligraphers hand closed firmly on the boys arm tell me i got it so i can protect us the boy shouted i will protect us and not with this you william laughed with a sneer you wrote your articles about taiwan and democracy and made our life miserable you decided to come here and the fucking snakehead tries to kill us all you call that taking care of us what did you pay for this with he held up the bag containing the pistol where did you get the money you have no job the boy ignored the question the ghost killed the others what if he tries to kill us what will we do well hide from him until the police find him and if they dont why do you dishonor me like this chang asked angrily pushing inside the apartment william shook his head a look of exasperation on his face and walked brusquely into the bedroom he slammed the door chang took the tea his wife offered him chang jiechi asked where did he go up the street he got this he showed him the gun and the elder chang took it in his gnarled hands chang asked is it loaded his father had been a soldier resisting mao zedong on the long march that swept chiang kaishek and the nationalists into the sea and was familiar with weapons he examined it closely yes be careful keep the safety lever in this position he handed the gun back to his son why does he disrespect me chang asked angrily he hid the weapon on the top shelf of the front closet and led the old man to the musty couch his father said nothing for a moment the pause was so long that chang looked at the old man expectantly finally with a wry look in his eyes his father responded where did you learn all your wisdom son what formed your mind your heart my professors books colleagues you mostly baba ah me you learned from your fatherchang jiechi asked in mock surprise yes of course chang frowned unsure what the man was getting at the old man said nothing but a faint smile crossed his gray face a moment passed then chang said and you are saying that william learned from me ive never been insolent to you baba not to me but you certainly have been to the communists to beijing to the fujianese government son youre a dissident your whole life has been rebellion but if beijing said to you why does sam chang dishonor us what would your response be id say what have you done to earn my respect william might say the same to you chang jiechi lifted his hands his argument complete but my enemies have been oppression violence corruption sam chang loved china with his complete heart he loved the people the culture the history his life for the past twelve years had been a consuming passionate struggle to help his country step into a more enlightened era chang jiechi said but all william sees is you hunched over your computer at night attacking authority and being unconcerned about the consequences words of protest formed in changs mind but he fell silent then he realized with a shock that his father perhaps was right he laughed faintly he thought about going to speak to his son but something was holding him back anger confusion maybe even fear of what his son might say to him no hed speak to the boy later when suddenly the old man winced in pain baba chang said alarmed one of their few possessions that had survived the sinking of the dragon was the nearly full bottle of chang jiechis morphine chang had given his father a tablet just before the ship sank and hed had the bottle in his pocket it was tightly sealed and no seawater had gotten inside he now gave his father two more pills and placed a blanket over him the man lay back on the couch and closed his eyes sam chang sat heavily in a musty chair their possessions gone his father desperately needing treatment a ruthless killer their enemy his own son a renegade and criminal so much difficulty around them he wanted to blame someone mao the chinese communist party the peoples liberation army soldiers but the reason for their present hardship and danger seemed to lie in only one place where william had assigned it at changs own feet regret would serve no purpose though all he could now do was pray that the stories about life here were true and not myths that the beautiful country was indeed a land of miracles where evil was brought to light and purged where the most pernicious flaws within our bodies could quickly be made right and where generous liberty fulfilled its promise that troubled hearts would be troubled no more chapter seventeen at that afternoon the ghost was walking quickly through chinatown head down worried as always about being recognized to most westerners of course he was invisible his features blending together into one generic asian man white americans could rarely tell the difference between a chinese japanese vietnamese or korean among the chinese though his features would be distinct and he was determined to remain anonymous hed once bribed a traffic magistrate in hong kong onecolor cash to avoid being arrested in a minor brawl some years ago so there would be no picture of him in criminal records even interpols automated search and archives section and the analytical criminal intelligence unit didnt have any reliable surveillance photos of him he knew this because hed used a hacker in fuzhou to break into interpols database through its supposedly secure x email system so he now strode quickly keeping his head down most of the time but not always he would lift his eyes to study women the pretty and young ones the voluptuous ones the svelte ones the coy and flirtatious and the timid the clerks the teenage girls the wives the businesswomen the tourists eastern or western made no difference to him he wanted a body lying beneath him whimpering in pleasure or pain that made no difference either as he pulsed up and down on top of her gripping her head tightly between his palms a woman with light brown hair passed by a western woman he slowed and let himself be touched by the veil of her perfume he hungered though he realized too that his lust wasnt for her but for his yindao he had no time for his fantasies though hed come to the merchants association where the turks awaited him he spat on the sidewalk found the back entrance which theyd left open and stepped inside he made his way up to the top floor it was time to conduct some important business inside the large office he found yusuf and the two other turks it hadnt taken much a few phone calls a threat and a bribe to find the name of the man who was sitting nervous to the point of tears in a chair in front of his own desk jimmy mahs eyes fell to the floor when the ghost walked into the room the snakehead pulled up a chair and sat beside him the ghost took mahs hand casually a gesture not unusual among chinese men and he felt the trembling of muscles and the pulsing of a frightened heart i didnt know they came in on the dragon they didnt tell me i swear that they lied to me when they were here i hadnt even heard about the ship i didnt watch the news this morning the ghost continued to hold the mans hand adding slight pressure to his grip but saying nothing are you going to kill me mah asked the question in such a whisper that he repeated it though the ghost had heard perfectly the changs and the wus where are they the ghost squeezed the mans hand slightly harder and received a pleasant whimper for his effort where are they mahs eyes glanced at the turks hed be wondering what kind of terrible weapons theyd have on them knives or garrotes or guns but in the end it was simply the faint pressure of the ghosts palm against poor jimmy mahs that loosened his tongue two different places sir wu qichen is in an apartment in chinatown a broker i use set him up with a place the address i dont know i swear but the broker knows hell tell you where is this broker mah quickly recited the name and address the ghost memorized it and the others sam chang took his family to queens queens the ghost asked where a particularly delicate squeeze of the hand he imagined momentarily that he was touching yindaos breast mah nodded toward the desk there its on that piece of paper the ghost picked it up glanced at the address and then pocketed the note he released the tong leaders hand and slowly rubbed his thumb in the sweat that had poured from mahs palm you wont tell anyone i asked about this the ghost murmured no no of course not the ghost smiled you did me a favor for which i am thankful i am indebted to you now i will do you a favor in return mah fell silent then cautiously he asked in a shaky voice a favor what other business arrangements do you have mr mah what other activities are you involved in you help piglets you help snakeheads but do you run massage parlors some the man was looking calmer he wiped his hand on his slacks mostly gambling ah gambling sure much gambling here in chinatown i like to gamble do you mah swallowed and wiped his face with a white handkerchief dont we all love to gamble yes yes tell me then who interferes with your gambling operation another tong a triad some meiguo gang the police i can talk to people i have connections throughout the government my connections go very high i can make sure nobody bothers your gambling parlors yes sir yes arent there always problems its not the chinese though or the police its the italians why do they cause us such trouble i dont know the young men they firebomb us beat up our customers rob the gambling halls the italians the ghost mused what are they called theres a derogatory term i cant think of it wops mah said in english wops mah smiled its a reference to those in your line of work mine immigration wop means without passport when italian immigrants came here years ago without documentation they were labeled wop its very insulting the ghost looked around the room frowning is there something you need sir mah asked do you have a thick marker some paint perhaps paint mahs eyes followed the ghosts no but i can call my assistant downstairs i can have her get some whatever you like i can get anything wait the ghost said that wont be necessary i have another thought lon sellitto looked up from his nokia and announced to the ghostkill team weve got a body in chinatown detective from the fifth precincts on the line he turned back to his phone alarmed rhyme looked up at him had the ghost tracked down and killed another of the immigrants who he wondered chang wu the baby but sellitto hung up and said doesnt look related to the ghost vics names jimmy mah know him eddie deng said heads a tong coe nodded ive heard of him too smugglings not his specialty but he does a little meeting and greeting whats that mean rhyme asked acerbically when coe explained no further the agent answered when undocumenteds get to chinatown theres an official who helps them out gets them into a safehouse gives them a little money called meeting and greeting the illegals most of the meeters work for snakeheads but some do it freelance like mah its just that theres not a lot of profit there if youre corrupt and you want big bucks youll go with drugs or gambling or massage parlors thats what mahs into well was apparently rhyme asked why dont you think its related sellitto said there was a message painted on the wall behind his desk where they found the body it said you call us wops you take our homes it was written in mahs blood by the way nodding deng said major rivalry between the thirdgeneration mafiosi you know the sopranos crowd and the tongs chinese gambling and massage parlors some drugs too theyve just about kicked the italians out of manhattan oc the demographics of organized crime rhyme knew were as fluid as those of the city itself anyway coe said those people off the dragon theyre going to dig underground as fast as they can theyd avoid somebody public like mah i would unless they were desperate sachs said which they are she looked at rhyme maybe the ghost killed mah and made it look like an oc hit should i run the scene rhyme debated for a moment yes the families were desperate but rhyme had already seen the immigrants resourcefulness presumably the work of sam chang it would leave too many trails to go to somebody like mah for help he assessed no i need you here but send a special team from crime scene and tell them to copy us on the crime scene report stat to eddie deng rhyme said call dellray and peabody at the federal building let them know about the killing yessir deng said dellray had gone downtown to arrange for the extra agents from the two relevant federal jurisdictions in new york the southern and eastern which covered manhattan and long island he was also wielding his influence to get the spectac team on site which washington was reluctant to do the special unit was generally reserved for major hostage standoffs and embassy takeovers not for manhunts still rhyme knew dellray was a tough man to say no to and if anybody could get the muchneeded tactical force up here itd be the lanky agent rhyme maneuvered the chair back to the evidence and the whiteboards nothing nothing nothing what else can we do he wondered what havent we exhausted scanning the board finally he said lets look at the blood some more he looked over the samples that sachs had found that from the injured immigrant the woman with the broken or gashed arm hand or shoulder lincoln rhyme loved blood as a forensic tool it was easy to spot it stuck like glue to all kinds of surfaces it retained its important forensic information for years the history of blood in criminal investigation in fact largely reflects the history of forensic science itself the earliest effort in the mids to use blood as evidence focused simply on classifying it that is determining if an unknown substance was indeed blood and not say dried brown paint fifty years later the focus was on identifying blood as human as opposed to animal not long after that detectives began looking for a way to differentiate blood break it down into a limited number of categories and scientists responded by creating the process of blood typing the a b o system as well as the mn and the rh systems which narrows down the number of sources in the sixties and seventies forensic scientists sought to go one step further to individuate the blood that is trace it back to a single individual like a fingerprint early efforts at doing this biochemically identifying enzymes and proteins could eliminate many individuals as the source but not all it wasnt until dna typing that true individuation was achieved classification identification differentiation individuation thats criminalistics in a nutshell but there was more to blood than linking it to an individual the way it fell on surfaces at crime scenes spatter it was called provided great information about the nature of the attack and lincoln rhyme often examined the content of blood to determine what it could tell about the individual whod shed it lets see if our injured womans got a drug habit ors taking some rare medicine call the mes office and have them do a complete workup i want to know everything thats in her bloodstream as cooper was talking to the office sellittos phone rang and he took the call rhyme could see in the detectives face that he was receiving some bad news oh jesus oh no the criminalist sensed an odd fibrillation in the core of his body an area where he could by rights feel nothing at all people who are paralyzed often feel phantom pain from limbs and parts of their body that cannot have any sensation rhyme not only had experienced this feeling but hed felt shock and adrenaline rushes too when his logical mind knew that this was impossible what lon sachs asked fifth precinct again chinatown he said wincing another killing this time its definitely the ghost he glanced at rhyme and shook his head man its not good what do you mean i mean theyre saying its fucking unpleasant linc unpleasant was not a word that one heard often from an nypd homicide detective especially lon sellitto as hardened a cop as youd ever find he wrote down some information then hung up the phone and glanced at sachs suit up officer youve got a scene to run ghostkill easton long island crime scene two immigrants killed on beach shot in back one immigrant wounded dr john sung bangshou assistant on board identity unknown ten immigrants escape seven adults one elderly one injured woman two children one infant steal church van blood samples sent to lab for typing injured woman is ab negative requesting more information about her blood vehicle

fingerprints sent to afis no matches chapter eighteen amelia sachs had left the camaro on the street near rhymes town house and was driving a crime scene bus downtown on the fdr drive the vehicle was functional city property a ford station wagon but she drove it pretty much the same as if shed been behind the wheel of her gaudy yellow sports car the time was pm before rush hour but the roads were still crowded and maneuvering through traffic took all her skill hey hongse sonny li began nervously as she skidded around a taxi at mph but he apparently preferred she keep her attention on the road and fell silent in the backseat were eddie deng who wasnt concerned about her driving and agent alan coe who like the chinese cop clearly was he gripped the chest strap of his seat belt as if he were holding the rip cord of a parachute during a skydive did you see that sachs asked casually as a cab ignored the siren and light on the cs bus and pulled out directly in front of her to make the exit at houston street we moving real fast li said then seemed to remember that he didnt want to distract her and he stopped talking again which way eddie sachs asked the bowery turn left two more blocks then a right she pulled off onto a rainslick canal street at fifty controlled the skid before they went into a garbage truck and accelerated into chinatown the tires goosed by the big cop engine steaming up the wheel wells li muttered something in chinese what ten judges of hell he translated his own words sachs recalled the ten judges of hell who kept the book called the register of the living and the dead containing the name of everybody in the world the balance sheet of life and death my father herman she thought is already inscribed on the dead side where does my name fall in the register she wondered and the names of people im now close to the people yet to be thinking of life and death ah ms sachs here you are hello doctor ive just been meeting with lincoln rhymes physician yes ive got to talk to you about something youre looking like its bad news doctor uhm officer deng interrupted her thoughts i think thats a red light ahead of us got it she said and slowed to thirty to sweep through the intersection gan li whispered then offered what sachs had guessed was the translation fuck three minutes later the crime scene bus skidded to a stop in front of an alley surrounded by a small crowd of onlookers kept back by a spider strand of yellow police tape and a halfdozen uniformed officers from the patrol division the front door to what seemed to be a small warehouse was open sachs climbed out followed by deng who called hey detective to a blond man in a suit he nodded and deng introduced her to a homicide detective from the fifth precinct youre running the scene he asked sachs nodded what is this place warehouse owners clean looks like weve contacted him and he doesnt know anything except that the victim name was jerry tang worked here eight arrests two convictions mostly he boosts wheels and drives getaway does did some muscle work he nodded at the silver bmw fourbyfour in the alley an x this was the suv that tang had driven out to long island to pick up the ghost this morning there was a bullet hole in the back door from the ghosts gunshot as tang had fled abandoning him a patrol officer responding to some screams had noticed a latemodel bmw fourbyfour next to the building where the commotion had come from then hed seen the bullet hole in the back and with his partner theyd entered the warehouse and found what was left of jerry tang hed been tortured with a knife or razor skin was missing including his eyelids then killed rhyme she knew hated to be oneupped by other law enforcers almost as much as he hated being oneupped by perpetrators and when it turned out that sonny li the crow detective had been right that the ghosts first mission was to kill the man whod abandoned him the criminalists mood darkened even more it hadnt helped of course that lid said hey should have listen to me loaban should have listen the detective from the fifth now continued weve got two canvassers from downtown checking out wits oh there they are now sachs nodded to two detectives shed worked with before bedding and saul were no longer needed to track down registered owners of bmw xs and were back at their usual assignment postcrime canvassing spadework as it was called they were known for their consummate skill in doubleteaming witnesses despite their different heights builds and complexions one had freckles their identical sandy hair and their demeanor resulted in their nickname the twins they were also known as the hardy boys got here twenty minutes after the first sighting said either bedding or saul the tall one was a teenage girl on her way home from drama club at school heard a scream in the building but didnt report it till she got home she was afraid you know cant blame her considering what the respondings found at the scene inside id be too afraid he means blood everywhere and body parts sachs winced but not from the gore it was only because she was lifting her knees to pull on the white tyvek crime scene suit and her arthritic joints protested painfully weve talked to about eight people in the building bedding or saul said and around it this is even more a case of the deaf and dumbs than usual yeah most people here got the blinds too we think they heard it was the ghost who worked on tang and that scared everybody off nobodyll help the most anybodyll tell us is that two or three or four people presumably men kicked in the door to the warehouse there and there was major screaming for ten minutes then two gunshots then it got quiet the girls mother called nineoneone but everybody was gone by the time patrol got here sachs looked up and down the alleyway and the street in front of the warehouse as shed feared the rain had destroyed any hope of finding tread marks of whatever kind of car the ghost and his assistants had been driving whos been inside she asked the blond detective from the fifth precinct only one uniform to see if the vic was alive we heard from upstairs you wanted it virgin so we didnt even let the tour doc from the medical examiners office go in good she said i want the patrol officer who was inside ill track em down a moment later he returned with a uniformed patrolwoman i was first officer you wanted to see me just your shoe well okay the woman slipped it off and handed it to sachs who shot a picture of the tread and noted the size of the sole so that she could differentiate it from the prints of the ghost and his accomplices she then put rubber bands around her own shoes to distinguish her footprints looking up she noticed sonny li standing in the doorway of the warehouse excuse me she said testily you mind standing back sure sure hongse that big room man lot to look at but you know confucius right not really she said concentrating on the scene he write longest journey must begin with first step i think he write that maybe somebody else i read mickey spillane more than confucius could you wait over there officer li call me sonny im saying he stepped aside and sachs walked into the warehouse the headset went on and she clicked the motorola handytalkie to life crime scene five eight eight five to central need a patch to a landline k roger five eight eight five whats the number k she gave them lincoln rhyrnes phone number and a moment later she heard his voice sachs where are you at the scene yet weve got to move on this as always and inexplicably his feisty impatience reassured her she scanned the carnage jesus rhyme thiss a mess tell me he said give me the blueprint first warehouse and office combined thirty by fifty feet more or less office area about ten by twenty a few desks and few two or eighteen rhyme was hell on anyone guilty of sloppy observation sorry she said four metal desks eight chairs no nine ones overturned the one that tang had been tied to when the ghost had tortured and killed him rows of metal shelves stacked with cardboard boxes food inside canned goods and cellophane packages restaurant supplies okay thoms ready to start writing you are ready arent you thom write big so i can see it those words over there i cant make them out redo them all right all right please redo them he then said start on the grid sachs she began to search the scene thinking a first step the longest journey but twenty minutes of onestepatatime searching revealed virtually nothing useful she found two shell casings which appeared to be the same as those from the ghosts gun at the beach but there was nothing that would lead them directly to where he might be hiding out in new york no cigarettes no matchbooks no fingerprints the assailants had worn leather gloves she studied the ceiling and smelled the scene two of rhymes important directives to crime scene searchers but detected nothing that would help sachs jumped when rhymes voice popped into her ear talk to me sachs i dont like it when youre quiet the place is a mess she repeated you said that a mess that doesnt really tell us very much now does it give me details its been ransacked drawers opened posters torn off the walls desks swept clean statues figurines fishbowl cups and glasses smashed in a struggle i dont think so theft of anything in particular maybe but its mostly vandalism id say whatre their shoe treads like rhyme asked all smooth stylish bastards he muttered he was she knew hoping for some dirt or fibers that might lead them to the ghosts safehouse but while the gullies in deeptreadsoled shoes can retain such evidence for months smoothsoled shoes lose trace far more quickly okay sachs keep going what do the footprints tell you im thinking that dont think sachs thats not the way to understand a crime scene you know that you have to feel it his seductive low voice was hypnotizing and with each word he spoke she felt herself uneasily being transported back to the crime itself as if she were a participant her palms began to sweat copiously in the latex gloves hes there jerry tang is at his desk and they we rhyme corrected sternly youre the ghost remember we kick the door in he gets up and runs toward the back door but we get him and drag him back to his chair lets narrow it down sachs youre the snakehead youve found the man whos betrayed you what are you going to do im going to kill him i saw crow on road picking at food another crow tried steal it and first crow not just scare other away he chase and try to peck eyes out suddenly she was filled with a burst of unfocused anger it nearly took her breath away no wait rhyme its like his death is secondary what i really want is to hurt him ive been betrayed and i want to hurt him bad what do you do exactly she hesitated sweating hard in the hot suit several places on her body itched at once she felt like ripping a hole in the suit to scratch her skin i cant i sachs whos i youre the ghost remember solidly in her own persona though she said im having trouble with this one rhyme theres something about him about the ghost hes way on the other side she hesitated it feels really bad there a place where families die where children are trapped in the holds of sinking ships where men and women are shot in the back scrabbling for the only sanctuary they can find a heartless cold ocean a place where they die for no reason other than that they are irritations and stumbling blocks sachs stared at the everopen eyes of jerry tang go there sachs rhyme murmured go on ill get you back dont worry she wished she could believe him the criminalist continued youve found your betrayer youre furious with him what do you do the other three men with me tie tang to a chair and we use knives or razors on him hes terrified screaming were taking our time all around me therere bits of flesh what looks like part of an ear strips of skin we cut his eyelids off she hesitated but i dont see any clues rhyme nothing thatll help us but there are clues there sachs you know there are remember locard edmond locard was an early french criminalist who stated that at every crime scene theres an evidence exchange between the victim and the perpetrator or between the scene itself and the perp it might be difficult to identify the evidence thats been exchanged and harder yet to trace it to its source but as rhyme had said dozens of times a criminalist must ignore the apparent impossibilities of the job keep going further further youre the ghost youre holding your knife or razor then suddenly the phantom anger she felt vanished replaced by an eerie serenity this shocking yet oddly magnetic sensation filled her breathing hard sweating she stared at jerry tang and was possessed fully by the foul spirit of kwan ang gui the ghost she did feel what he had experienced a visceral satisfaction at the sight of his betrayers pain and slow death gasping she realized she felt a deep lust to see more to hear tangs screams watch his blood spiral down his shaking limbs and with that thought came another im what sachs im not the one torturing tang youre not no i want the others to do it so that i can watch its more satisfying that way its like a porno tape i want to see everything hear everything i dont want to miss a single detail and i have them cut his eyelids off first so tang has to watch me watch him she whispered i want it to keep going on and on a whisper ah good sachs and that means theres a place youre watching from yes theres a chair here facing tang about ten feet away from the body her voice cracked im watching she whispered im enjoying it she swallowed and felt sweat pouring from her scalp the screams lasted for five ten minutes im sitting in front of him all that time enjoying every scream every drop of blood every slice her breathing was fast now how you doing sachs okay she said but she wasnt okay at all she was trapped in that very place where she didnt want to be suddenly everything good in her life was negated and she slipped further into the core of the ghosts world youre looking like its bad news her hands shook she was desperate and alone youre looking like its bad stop it she told herself sachs rhyme asked im fine stop thinking about it stop thinking about the bits of curled flesh the smears of blood stop thinking about how much youre enjoying his pain then she realized that the criminalist wasnt saying anything rhyme no answer you okay she asked not really he finally answered what is it i dont know what good does knowing where he sat do us he was wearing those fucking smoothsoled shoes its the only place we know the ghost himself spent any time but what kind of evidence is there still feeling nauseous tainted by the ghosts spirit within her she glanced at the chair but she looked away unable to concentrate discouraged angry he continued i cant think i theres got to be something he continued she heard frustration in his voice and she supposed he was wishing he could come down and walk the grid himself i dont know she said her voice weak she stared at the chair but she saw in her mind the knife working its way up and down jerry tangs flesh hell rhyme said i dont know either is the chair upright the one the ghost sat in to watch from yes but what do we do with that fact his voice was frustrated well this wasnt like him lincoln rhyme had opinions about everything and why was he sounding as if hed failed his tone alarmed her was he still brooding over his role in the deaths of the immigrants and crew on the fuzhoudragon sachs focused again on the chair which was covered with debris from the vandalism she studied it carefully ive got an idea hold on she walked closer to the chair and looked beneath it her heart thudded with excitement therere scuff marks here rhyme the ghost sat down and leaned forward to see better he crossed his feet under the chair and rhyme asked that means that any trace in the seam between the uppers and his soles mightve fallen out ill vacuum underneath it if were lucky we might find something thatll lead us to his front door excellent sachs rhyme said get the dustbuster excited at this find she started for the cs kit near the door to retrieve the vacuum but then she stopped she gave a faint laugh you got me rhyme i did what dont sound so innocent she realized now that hed known there was trace beneath the chair from the moment shed deduced that the ghost had sat watching the carnage but hed recognized that she was still lost in the ghosts terrible world and that he needed to get her to a better place the haven of the job they did together hed pretended to be frustrated to draw her attention back to him and ease her out of the darkness a misrepresentation she supposed but it is in such feints as this that love is found thanks i promised id get you back now go do some vacuuming sachs swept the floor under and around the chair and then removed the filter from the portable vacuum and placed it in a plastic evidence bag what happens next rhyme asked she judged the angle of the blood spatter from the bullets that killed tang looks like when tang finally passed out from the pain the ghost stood up and shot him then he leaves and the assistants trash the place how do you know things happened in that order because there was debris covering one of the shell casings and there was broken glass and some torn poster paper on the chair the ghostd been sitting in good sachs said im going to do electrostatic prints of the shoes dont tell me sachs rhyme muttered being rhyme once again just do it she stepped outside and returned with the equipment in this process a plastic sheet is placed over a shoeprint and an electric charge is sent through the sheet the result is an image like a plastic xerox copy of a footor shoeprint it was as she was crouching down her back to the dark warehouse that she smelled the cigarette smoke oh jesus she thought suddenly one of the killers was back maybe aiming his weapon on the radiant white suit maybe the ghost himself no she realized it was the missing bangshou sachs dropped the electrostatic equipment with a crash and spun around falling hard to the floor on her back her glock in her hand the notch and blade sight rested squarely on the intruders chest what the fuckre you doing here she raged in agony from the jarring fall sonny li smoking a cigarette was wandering through the office looking around what i doing i investigate too whats going on sachs rhyme asked lis in the perimeter hes smoking what get him the hell out im trying to she rose painfully and stormed up to the chinese cop youre contaminating the scene a little smoke you americans are worry too much and the trace on your shoes on your clothes your footprints youre ruining the scene no no i investigate get him out of there sachs rhyme called she took him by the arm and walked him to the door she called to deng and coe keep him out sorry officer eddie deng said he said he was going to help you run the scene i am doing li said perplexed what is problem keep him here cuff him if you have to hey hongse you got temper you know that she stormed back to the scene and finished the printing rhyme said is eddie deng there hes outside sachs replied i know the companys supposedly clean but have him go through the files anyway i assume theyre in chinese see if he can find anything about the ghost or smuggling other snakeheads anything helpful outside she waved to eddie deng he plucked a telephone earbud out of his ear and joined her she relayed rhymes request and as the photo and identification units took over for sachs deng dug through the desks and file cabinets after a half hour of diligent work he told her nothing helpful its all about restaurant supplies she told this to rhyme and added ive got everything here ill be back in twenty minutes they disconnected the radio massaging her sore spine she reflected and what about the ghosts bangshou was he in the city was he really a threat to them watch your backs she was just at the doorway when her cell phone rang she answered it and was surprised and pleased to hear john sung identify himself how are you she asked fine the wound itches some he then added i wanted to tell you i got some herbs for your arthritis theres a restaurant downstairs in my building could you meet me there sachs looked at her watch what could it hurt she wouldnt be long handing off the evidence to deng and coe she told them she had a stop to make and would be at rhymes in a half hour they and sonny li got a ride back to rhymes from another officer li looked relieved he wouldnt be riding with her sachs slipped out of the tyvek suit and packed it away in the cs bus as she dropped into the drivers seat she glanced into the warehouse in which she could clearly see the body of jerry tang his everopen eyes staring at the ceiling another corpse at the hand of the ghost another name transferred from one balance sheet column to the other in the register of the living and the dead no more she thought to the ten judges of hell please no more chapter nineteen amelia sachs nursing the crime scene bus through the narrow streets of chinatown pulled into an alley near john sungs apartment climbing out she glanced at a handpainted sign in the florist shop on the ground floor of his building next to the restaurant need luck in your life buy our lucky bamboo she then noticed sung through the window of the restaurant he waved smiling inside he winced as he rose to greet her no no sachs said dont get up she sat opposite him in a large booth would you like some food no i cant stay long tea then he poured it and pushed the small cup toward her the restaurant was dark but clean several men sat hunched together in various booths speaking in chinese sung asked have you found him yet the ghost disinclined to talk about an investigation she demurred and said only that they had some leads i dont like this uncertainty sung said i hear footsteps in the hall and i freeze its like being in fuzhou someone slows down outside your home and you dont know if theyre neighbors or security officers the local party boss sent to your house to arrest you an image of what had happened to jerry tang came to her and she glanced out the window for a reassuring look at the squad car parked across the street in front of his building guarding him after all the press about the fuzhoudragonshe said youd think the ghostd go back to china doesnt he know how many peoplere looking for him sung reminded break the cauldrons and sink the boats she nodded then she added well hes not the only one whos got that motto sung assessed her for a moment youre a strong woman have you always been a security officer we call them police or cops security officers are private oh naw i went to the police academy after id been working for a few years she told him about her stint as a model for a madison avenue agency you were a fashion model his eyes were amused i was young interesting to try for a while was mostly my mothers idea i remember once i was working on a car with my dad he was a cop too but his hobby was cars we were rebuilding an engine in this old thunderbird a ford a sports car you know it no and i was i dont know nineteen or something id been doing freelance work for a modeling agency in the city i was under the car and he dropped a crescent wrench caught me on the cheek ouch a nod but the big ouch was when my mother saw the cut i dont know who she was madder at me my father or ford motor company sung asked and your mother is she who watches your children when you work a sip of tea a steady gaze i dont have any he frowned you im sorry sympathy flooded his voice its not the end of the world she said stoically sung shook his head of course not i reacted badly east and west have different ideas about families not necessarily she thought but wouldnt let her mind go any further than that sung continued in china children are very important to us sure we have the overpopulation problem but one of the most hated parts of the central government is the onechild rule that only applies to the han the majority race in china so we actually have people in borderline areas claiming to be racial minorities to have more than one child i will have more someday i will bring my children over here and then when i meet someone have two or three more he watched her when he said this and she felt that comfort radiating from his eyes again from his smile too she knew nothing of his competence as a practitioner of chinese medicine but his face alone would go a long way in calming a patient and helping the healing process you know our language is based on pictograms the chinese character for the word love is brushstrokes that represent a mother holding a child she felt an urge to tell him more to tell him that yes she wanted children very badly but suddenly she felt like crying then controlled it fast none of that no bawling when youre wearing one of austria s finest pistols on one hip and a can of pepper spray on the other she realized that theyd been gazing at each other silently for a moment she looked down sipped more tea are you married sung asked no i have someone in my life though thats good he said continuing to study her i sense hes in the same line of work is he by any chance that man you were telling me about lincoln rhyme she laughed youre pretty observant in china doctors are detectives of the soul then sung leaned forward and said hold your arm out what your arm please she did and he rested two fingers on her wrist what shhh im taking your pulse after a moment he sat back my diagnosis is correct about the arthritis you mean arthritis is merely a symptom we think its misguided to merely cure symptoms the goal of medicine should be to rebalance harmonies so whats unbalanced in china we like our numbers the five blessings the five beasts for sacrifice the ten judges of hell she said he laughed exactly well in medicine we have liuyin the six pernicious influences they are dampness wind fire cold dryness and summer heat they affect the organs of the body and the qi the spirit as well as the blood and essence when they are excessive or lacking they create disharmony and that causes problems too much dampness must be dried out too much cold must be warmed the six pernicious influences she reflected try putting that on a blue crossblue shield form i see from your tongue and pulse that you have excessive dampness on the spleen that results in arthritis among other problems spleen it is not just your actual spleen according to western medicine he said noting her skepticism spleen is more of an organ system so what does my spleen need sachs asked to be less damp sung answered as if it were obvious i got you these he pushed a bag toward her she opened it and found herbs and dried plants inside make them into tea and drink it slowly over the course of two days then he handed her a small box as well these are qi ye lien tablets herbal aspirin therere instructions in english on the box sung added acupuncture will also help a great deal im not licensed for acupuncture here and i dont want to risk any trouble before my ins hearing i wouldnt want you to but i can do massage i think you call it acupressure its very effective ill show you lean toward me put your hands in your lap sung leaned forward over the table the stone monkey swinging away from his strong chest beneath his shirt she could see the fresh bandages over the wound from the ghosts gunshot his hands found spots on her shoulders and pressed into her skin hard for five seconds or so then found new places and did the same after a minute of this he sat back now lift your arms she did and though there was still some pain in her joints she believed it much less than shed been feeling lately she said a surprised it worked its only temporary acupuncture lasts much longer ill think about it thank you she glanced at her watch i should be getting back wait sung said an urgency in his voice im not through with my diagnosis he took her hand examining the torn nails and worried skin normally she was very selfconscious about these bad habits of hers but she didnt feel the least embarrassed by this mans perusal in china doctors look and touch and talk to determine what is ailing a patient its vital to know their frame of mind happy sad worried ambitious frustrated he looked carefully into her eyes theres more disharmony within you you want something you cant have or you think you cant have it its creating these problems he nodded at her nails what harmony do i want im not sure perhaps a family love your parents are dead i sense my father and that was difficult for you yes and lovers youve had trouble with lovers i scared em off in school i could drive faster than most of them this was meant as a joke though it was true but sung didnt laugh go on he encouraged when i was a model the worthwhile men were too scared to ask me out why would a man be scared of a woman sung asked genuinely bewildered its like yin being scared by yang night and day they should not compete they should complement and fulfill each other then the ones who had the guts to ask me out wanted pretty much only one thing ah that yeah that sexual energy sung said is very important one of the most important parts of qi spiritual power but its only healthy when it comes out of a harmonized relationship she laughed to herself now theres a phrase to try out on the first date you interested in a harmonized relationship after a sip of tea she continued then i lived with a man for a while on the force the what sung asked he was a cop too i mean it was good intense challenging i guess id say wed have dates at the smallarms range and try to outshoot each other only he got arrested taking kickbacks you know what i mean sung laughed ive lived in china all my life of course i know what kickbacks are and now he added youre with that man you work with yes maybe this is the source of the problem sung said quietly studying her even more closely why dyou say that she asked uneasily i would say you are yang that word means the side of a mountain with the sun on it yang is brightness movement increase arousal beginnings soft spring and summer birth this is clearly you but you seem to inhabit the world of the yin that means the shadowy side of the mountain it is inwardness darkness introspection hardness and death it is the end of things autumn and winter he paused i think perhaps the disharmony is that you arent being true to your yang nature you have let the yin too far into your life could that be the trouble i im not sure ive just been meeting with lincoln rhymes physician yes ive got to talk to you about something her cell phone rang and sachs jumped at the sound as she reached for the phone she realized that sungs hand was still resting on her arm sung eased back into the booth bench and she answered hello officer where the hell are you it was lon sellitto she was reluctant to say but she glanced at the patrol car across the street and had a feeling that they might have told the detective where she was she said with that witness john sung why just needed to follow up on a few things not a lie she thought not exactly well finish following up the man said gruffly we need you here at rhymes theres evidence to look at jesus she thought whats eating him ill be right there make sure you are the detective snapped perplexed at his attitude she disconnected the line and said to sung i have to go a hopeful expression on his face the doctor asked have you found sam chang and the others from the ship not yet as she rose he startled her by asking quickly id be honored if you would come back to see me i could continue my treatment sung pushed the bag of herbs and pills toward her she hesitated only a moment before saying sure id like that chapter twenty hope we didnt interrupt anything important officer lon sellitto said gruffly when she walked into rhymes living room she began to ask the detective what he meant but the criminalist himself began sniffing the air sachs responded with a querying glance recall my book sachs perfumes should not be worn by crime scene personnel because odors not native to the scene may help identify individuals who have been present there good but its not perfume rhyme incense maybe he suggested i met john sung at a restaurant in his building there was some incense burning it stinks rhyme concluded no no sonny li said peaceful very peaceful no it stank petulant rhyme thought he glanced at the bag she carried and wrinkled his nose and what is that medicine for my arthritis that stinks even more than the incense what do you do with it make it into tea probably tastes so vile that you forget about the pain in your joints hope you enjoy it ill stick to scotch he examined her closely for a moment enjoy your visit with dr sung sachs i she began uneasily troubled by his edgy tone hows he doing rhyme asked blithely better she answered talk much about his home in china where he travels whom he spends time with whatre you getting at she asked cautiously im just curious if what occurred to me occurred to you and that would be that sung was the ghosts bangshou his assistant his coconspirator what she gasped apparently it didnt rhyme observed but theres no way ive spent some time talking to him he cant have any connection with the ghost i mean as a matter of fact rhyme interrupted he doesnt we just got a report from the fbi office in singapore the ghosts bangshou on the dragon was victor au the prints and picture match one of the three bodies the coast guard found this morning at the site of the sinking he nodded toward the computer sachs looked at the picture on rhymes screen and then glanced at the whiteboard on which were taped the coast guards pictures of the bodies au was the one whod drowned not been shot rhyme said sternly sungs clean but we didnt know that until ten minutes ago i told you to be careful sachs and you just dropped by sungs to socialize dont go getting careless on me his voice rose saying and that goes for everybody search well but watch your back sorry she muttered what was distracting her rhyme wondered again but he said only back to work boys and girls then nodded at the electrostatic shoeprints from the tang crime scene that thom had mounted on the evidence board there was not much they could tell except that the ghosts shoeprints though an average size shoe about an in america were larger than the three prints of his accomplices now what about the trace that was in the ghosts shoes mel okay lincoln the tech said slowly looking over the screen of the chromatograph weve got something here very old oxidized iron flakes old wood fibers and ash and silicon looks like glass dust and then the main act is a dark lowluster mineral in large concentrations montmorillonite alkaline oxide too okay rhyme mused where the hell did it come from he nodded slowly then closed his eyes and began figuratively to pace when hed been head of ird the investigation and resources division of the nypd the forensic unit rhyme had walked everywhere in new york city he carried small bags and jars in his pockets for the samples of soil and concrete and dust and vegetation hed collect to add to his knowledge of the city a criminalist must know his territory in a thousand different ways as sociologist cartographer geologist engineer botanist zoologist historian he realized that there was something familiar about the trace that cooper was describing but what wait theres a thought hold on to it damn it slipped away hey loaban a voice called but from a distance rhyme ignored li and continued to walk intently through then fly over the various neighborhoods of the city is he shhhhh sachs said firmly freeing him to continue on his journey he sailed over the columbia university tower over central park with its loam and limestone and wildlife excrement through the streets of midtown coated with the residue of the tons of soot that fall upon them daily the boat basins with their peculiar mix of gasoline propane and diesel fuel the decaying parts of the bronx with their lead paint and old plaster mixed with sawdust as filler soaring soaring until he came to one place his eyes opened downtown he said the ghosts downtown sure alan coe shrugged chinatown no not chinatown rhyme replied battery park city or one of the developments around there howd you figure that out sellitto asked that montmorillonite its bentonite thats a clay used as slurry to keep groundwater out of foundations when construction crews dig deep foundations when they built the world trade center they sunk the foundation sixtyfive feet down to the bedrock the builder used millions of tons of bentonite its all over the place down there but they use bentonite in a lot of places cooper pointed out sure but the other trace materials sachs found are from there too that whole area is landfill and its full of rusted metal and glass trace and the ash to clear the old piers down there the builders burned them and its only twenty minutes from chinatown deng pointed out thom wrote this on the evidence chart still it was a huge area and contained many highdensity buildings hotels apartments and office buildings they would need more information in order to narrow down exactly where the ghost might be staying sonny li was pacing walking in front of the board hey loaban i got some ideas too about what rhyme grumbled the man reeked of cigarette smoke rhyme had never smoked but he felt a huge burst of crip envy that this man could partake in his vices all by himself without having to track down a conspirator to help him fucking surgery better do something he thought hey loaban you listening go ahead sonny rhyme said distracted i was at crime scene too yeah sachs said giving him an exasperated look walking around smoking see rhyme explained trying against his nature to be patient anything that comes into the crime scene after the perpetrator can contaminate it that makes it harder to find the evidence that would lead to the suspect hey loaban you think i dont know that sure sure you pick up dust and dirt and put in gas chromatograph and then spectrometer and use scanning electron microscope the complicated english words fell awkwardly from his tongue match against databases you know about forensic equipment rhyme asked blinking in surprise know about it sure we use that stuff hey i study at beijing institute of forensics got nice medal second in class i know all that im saying he added testily we not back in ming dynasty loaban i got own computer windows xp all kinds databases too and cell phone and pager okay sonny got the point whatd you see at the scene disharmony that what i saw explain rhyme said harmony very important in china even crime has harmony at that place back there that warehouse no harmony at all whats a harmonious killing coe asked wryly the ghost find man who betray him he torture him kill him and leave but hey hongse remember place all destroyed posters of china torn up statues of buddha and dragons broken han chinese not do that thats the racial majority in china the han eddie deng explained but the ghosts han isnt he sure but he not do it office got messed up after tang killed i hear her say that sachs confirmed this probably ghost left and then those men work for him they vandal the office im thinking he hire ethnic minority for his batu muscle thugs deng translated yeah yeah thugs hire them from minorities mongols manchus tibetans uighurs thats crazy sonny rhyme said harmony crazy li replied shrugging broadly sure you right loaban i crazy like when i say you find jerry tang first i crazy but hey you listen me then we maybe found tang when he alive strap him down and use ox prod till he tell us where is ghost the entire team turned to him in shock li hesitated a moment then laughed hey loaban joke though rhyme wasnt completely sure he was kidding li continued pointing at the board you want evidence okay here evidence shoeprints smaller than ghosts han chinese not big people like me not big like you but people from west and north minorities lot of them even smaller than us there you like that forensic stuff loaban thought you would so go find some minorities you get lead to ghost im saying rhyme glanced at sachs and he could tell she was thinking the same thing what can it hurt rhyme asked eddie deng what about it you know these minorities i dont have a clue he replied most of the people we deal with in the fifth precinct are han fujianese cantonese mandarin taiwanese coe agreed adding the minorities would keep to themselves impatient now that there was a lead to be pursued rhyme snapped well who would know i want to follow up on it how tongs li said tongs know everything han nonhan everything and what exactly is a tong rhyme asked having only a vague memory from some bad movie hed watched when recovering from his accident eddie deng explained that tongs were societies of chinese who had common interests people who came from a particular area in china or who practiced the same trade or profession they were shrouded in secrecy and in the old days met only in private tong means chamber in the united states they arose for protection from whites and for selfgovernance traditionally chinese resolved disputes among themselves and the head of ones tong had more power over his members than did the president of the united states though they had a long tradition in crime and violence he continued in recent years tongs had cleaned themselves up the word tong was out and they began calling themselves public associations benevolent societies or merchant guilds many were still just as involved in gambling massage parlors extortion and money laundering as ever but they distanced themselves from violence they hired young men with no connection to the tongs to act as enforcers outsourcing deng joked were you in one eddie rhyme asked the detective polished his stylish glasses as he responded defensively for a while it was a kid thing is there anybody at one we can talk to sachs asked deng thought for a moment id give tony cai a call he helps us some up to a point and hes one of the best connected loabans in the area lot of guanxi he runs the eastern chinese public association theyre on the bowery call him rhyme ordered coe shook his head wont talk on the phone bugged deng said no no its a cultural thing for some matters you have to meet facetoface but theres a catch cai wont want to be seen around police not with the ghost involved a thought occurred to rhyme get a limo and bring him here what sellitto asked the heads of tongs they have egos right you bet coe said tell him we need his help and that the mayors sending a limo to pick him up while sellitto called about the car eddie deng rang up cais community association the conversation was in the clipped and singsongy cadence of rapidly spoken chinese eddie put his hand over the mouthpiece let me get this straight im telling him this is at the mayors request no rhyme said tell him its the governors office we oughta be a little careful here linc sellitto said delicately well be careful after we collar the ghost deng nodded returned to the phone and they spoke some more he hung up okay hell do it sonny li was patting the pockets of his trousers absently looking for cigarettes undoubtedly he seemed uneasy hey loaban i ask you something maybe you do me favor what i make phone call back to china cost some money i not have but i pay you back thats all right rhyme said whore you calling coe asked bluntly private my business no you dont have a private life around here li tell us or no call the cop offered a cold glance at the ins agent and said call is to my father coe muttered i know chinese putonghua and minnanhua i understand hao ill be listening rhyme nodded at thom who got an international operator on the line and placed the call to the town of liu guoyuan in fujian he handed the receiver to li who took it uncertainly he glanced at the plastic hand piece for a moment then turned away from rhyme and the others and slowly brought it to his ear rhyme suddenly saw a different sonny li one of the first words he heard was kangmei sonnys formal name the man was obsequious slumped nervous nodding like a young student as he spoke finally he hung the phone up and stood looking down at the floor for a moment sachs asked something wrong the chinese cop was suddenly aware that someone had spoken to him he shook his head in reply to the question and turned back to rhyme okay loaban what we going do now were going to look at some harmonious evidence rhyme responded chapter twentyone a half hour later the doorbell sounded and thom vanished into the hall he returned with a heavyset chinese man in a gray fully buttoned suit white shirt and striped tie his face revealed no surprise or shock at seeing rhyme in the storm arrow chair or at the collection of forensic equipment in the quaint victorian town house the only bit of emotion was when he glanced at sachs and saw her sipping tea redolent of herbs the man seemed to recognize by smell i am mr cai rhyme introduced himself youre comfortable with english yes we have a problem mr cai and i hope you can help us you work for governor thats right in a distant sort of way we do rhyme thought raising an ironic eyebrow toward the stilluneasy lon sellitto as cai sat down rhyme explained about the fuzhou dragon and the immigrants hiding in town another flash of emotion when the name the ghost was mentioned but then the face went blank again rhyme nodded to deng who told him about the killers and their suspicion that the men were from a chinese ethnic minority group cai nodded considering this beneath large wirerimmed bifocals his eyes were quick the ghost we know about him he does much harm to all of us here i will help you ethnic minorities in chinatown there are none but ill make some inquiries into other areas around the city i have many connections its very important sachs said to him those ten people the witnesses the ghost is going to kill them if we dont find them first of course cai said sympathetically ill do whatever i can if your driver can take me back now ill begin thank you sachs said sellitto and rhyme nodded their gratitude too cai rose and shook hands though unlike most visitors there was not even a vestigial gesture of his arm toward rhyme but merely a nod which told the criminalist that he was very much in control of himself and far more perceptive and intelligent than his distracted demeanor suggested he was glad this man would be helping them but as cai walked toward the door sonny li said abruptly ting he said wait eddie deng explained to rhyme in a whisper cai turned around a frown on his face li strode up to him and gesturing broadly began speaking harshly the tong leader leaned closer to li and the two began an explosive conversation rhyme thought they were going to come to blows hey sellitto said to li what the hellre you doing li ignored him and redfaced continued to pummel cai with words the tong leader finally grew quiet his head finally dipped and his eyes scanned the floor rhyme looked at deng who shrugged too fast for me i couldnt follow it as li continued to speak more calmly now cai began to nod and respond finally li asked a question and the tong leader extended his hand and they shook cai gave another brief nod to rhyme his face completely emotionless and then left what on earth was that sachs asked why you just let him leave before li said gruffly to rhyme he not going to help you yes he was no no no not matter what he said dangerous for him help us he has family not want them hurt he not getting nothing from you limo not fool him he waved around the room he know governor not involved but he said hed help us sellitto said chinese not like say no li explained easier for us to find excuse or just say yes and then forget it cai was going back to office and forget you im saying he say he help but he was really saying meiyou you know what is meiyou means i not help you go away whatd you say what were you fighting about no no not fight we negotiation you know business now he going to look for your minorities he really do it why rhyme asked you pay him money what sellitto asked not so much only cost you ten thousand dollar not yuan no way alan coe said jesus christ sellitto said we havent got that in the budget rhyme and sachs looked at each other and laughed li scoffed you a big city you rich you got strong dollar wall street you run world trade organization hey cai want lot more at first we cant pay sellitto began come on lon rhyme said youve got your snitch fund anyway technically thiss a federal operation the insll cough up half of it i dont know about that coe said uneasily running his hand over his red hair its okay ill sign the chit myself rhyme said and the agent blinked not sure whether it was appropriate to laugh at this call peabody and well get dellray to contribute too he glanced at li whatre the terms i did good bargain he give us names first and then he get paid course he wants pay in cash of course okay i need a cigarette i take break for while loaban i need good cigarettes you got fuck worst ones in this country not taste like nothing get some food too go ahead sonny you earned it as the chinese cop left the room thom asked what do i put down on the chart nodding at the evidence whiteboard about cai and the tongs i dont know sachs said i think id say checking out the woowoo evidence lincoln rhyme however opted for something somewhat more helpful how bout suspected accomplices from chinese ethnic minority he dictated presently pursuing whereabouts the ghost accompanied by the three turks was driving a stolen chevrolet blazer into queens en route to the changs apartment as he drove through the streets carefully as always so that he wouldnt get stopped he reflected on jerry tangs death he hadnt for a moment considered letting the man go unpunished for his betrayal nor had he considered delaying the retribution disloyalty to your superiors was the worst crime in confucian philosophy tang had abandoned him on long island a situation from which hed escaped only because of the luck of finding that car with the engine running at the restaurant on the beach so the mand had to die and to die painfully the ghost thought of the shang emperor zhou xin once sensing disloyalty from one of his vassals the emperor butchered the mans son and had him cooked and served to the unsuspecting traitor for dinner after which he cheerfully revealed the primary ingredient of the main course the ghost thought such justice was perfectly reasonable not to mention satisfying a block from the changs apartment he pulled the blazer to the curb masks he ordered yusuf dug into a bag and handed out ski masks the ghost considered how best to attack the family sam chang had a wife and an elderly father or mother with him hed been told the main risk though would be any older children like teenage boys life was for them just a video game and when the ghost and the others broke in a teenager might charge them with a knife kill any sons first he instructed them then their father and the old people then he had a thought dont kill the wife yet bring her with us the turks apparently understood the reason for this and nodded the ghost surveyed the quiet street across which were two long warehouses halfway along the block was an alley between the buildings according to the map the changs address was just on the other side of the warehouses it was possible that chang and his sons or father would be watching the front of the house so the ghost would speed down the alley to the rear and they would rush in through the back door while one of the turks ran to the front door in case the family tried to escape that way he said in english wear the masks on top of your heads like hats until were at the house they nodded and did so with their dark complexions and the stocking caps they looked like black gangstas in a bizarre rap video the ghost donned his own mask he felt a moments fear as he often did at times like this just before going into battle there was always a chance that chang had a gun or that the police had found the family first had taken them to detention and were themselves waiting for the ghost at the apartment but he reminded himself that fear was part of humility and it was the humble who succeeded in this world he thought of one of his favorite passages from the tao yield and you need not break bent you can straighten emptied you can hold torn you can mend the ghost now added his own line afraid you can be brave he glanced at yusuf sitting next to him in the passenger seat the uighur nodded firmly in reply and with the skill of seasoned craftsmen they began checking their weapons chapter twentytwo sonny li had found some very good cigarettes indeed camels without filters on the end which tasted pretty close to the brand he regularly bought in china he inhaled deeply and said bet five li pushed the chips forward and watched the other poker players consider how to respond as the bet went around the cheap fiberboard table stained from years of sweaty hands and spilled liquor the gambling parlor was on mott street in the heart of chinatown the neighborhood to which hed come to buy his cigarettes such a long trip probably wasnt what loaban had in mind when he gave li permission to buy some smokes but no matter hed return soon enough there was no hurry the parlor was a large one populated mostly with fujianese he wanted to avoid running into the cantonese guard hed mugged that morning and featured a full bar and three cigarette machines the room was dark except for dim lights over the tables but with his sharp security bureau officers eye he had spotted five armed guards this was not a problem though no stealing guns now or beating up pretty boys he was here only to gamble drink and chat he won the hand and laughed then poured maotai into the glasses of everyone at the table except the dealer who was not allowed to drink the men lifted the glasses and quickly tossed back the clear potent liquor maotai was chinas version of moonshine and you didnt sip it you poured it into your gullet as fast as you could li struck up conversations with the men hunched over the table around him a bottle of liquor and a dozen camels later sonny li estimated his net loss to be merely seven dollars he decided against another glass and rose to go several of the men asked him to stay they were enjoying his company but litold them that his mistress awaited and the men nodded enthusiastically she fuck you every way an old drunk man said it wasnt clear to li if this was a question or a statement sonny li walked to the door giving them a smile that confirmed the high quality of his love life the truth however was that this particular gambling parlor had turned out to have little for him and he wanted to try another the blazer speeding down the alleyway that led to the rear of the changs apartment the ghost gripping his model pistol in one hand the leatherclad steering wheel in the other the turks poised to leap from the suv they burst from the alley into a large parking lot and found a huge semi truck bearing down on them headon with a deep groan of brakes the truck began to skid the ghost shoved his foot down on the brake pedal instinctively striking the floor with his left foot as well hitting the spot where the clutch in his bmw sports car was the blazer swerved and skidded to a stop doortodoor with the truck he gasped and felt his heart stutter from the nearmiss what the fuckre you doing the truck driver shouted he leaned down toward the blazers driversside window its oneway you fucking jap you come to this country learn the fucking rules the ghost was too shaken to answer the driver put the truck in gear and pulled past the chevy the ghost thanked his god yi the archer for saving him from death ten seconds later and they would have collided headon with the truck starting forward slowly the ghost glanced at the turks who were looking around with frowns they were confused troubled where it is asked yusuf who was gazing at the large parking lot in which they found themselves the changs apartment i cannot see it there were no residences anywhere around here the ghost checked the address the number was correct this was the place except except that it was a large retail shopping center the alleyway that the ghost had turned into was one of the exits from the parking lot gan the ghost spat out what happened one of the turks in the back asked him what had happened was that chang hadnt trusted jimmy mah the ghost realized hed given the tong leader a fake address hed probably seen an advertisement for this place he glanced up at the big sign over their heads the home store your source for every house and lawn need the ghost considered what to do the other immigrant wu probably hadnt been so clever he had used mahs broker to get an apartment the ghost had the name of the broker and they could find out the location of that family quickly well get the wus now the ghost said then well find the changs naixin all in good time sam chang hung up the phone numb he stood for a moment staring at a tv show which depicted a living room very different from the one he was now in and a content and silly family very different from his own he glanced at meimei who was looking at him with a querying glance he shook his head and she dutifully returned to poyee the baby chang then crouched down beside his father and whispered to him mah is dead mah the loaban in chinatown the one who helped us i called to ask about our papers his girl said that he was dead the ghost that was who killed him who else his father asked did mah know where we are no chang hadnt trusted mah so hed given the address of one of the home stores in the flyer hed found at the shopping center where theyd stolen the paint and brushes the changs were in fact not in queens at all but in brooklyn a neighborhood called owls head near the harbor that this had been their destination was a secret hed kept from everyone except his father the old man nodded and winced as some pain shot through him morphine his father shook his head and breathed deeply for a moment this news about mah it confirms that the ghost is looking for us yes then chang had a troubling thought the wus the ghost can find them they got their apartment through mahs broker i have to warn him he stepped toward the door no his father said you cant save a man from his own foolishness he has a family too children his wife we cant let them die chang jiechi thought for some moments finally the old man said all right but dont go yourself use the phone call that woman back tell her to get a message to wu warn him chang picked up the phone and dialed he spoke to the woman from mahs office again and asked her to get a message to wu tell him he must move at once he and his family are in great danger you will tell him that yes yes she said but she was clearly distraught and chang had no idea if she actually would do as hed asked his father closed his eyes and lay back on the couch chang wrapped the blanket around his feet the old man would need to see a doctor very soon so many things to do precautions to take for a moment he was overwhelmed by the hopelessness of it all he thought of the amulet that dr john sung wore the monkey king in the hold of the ship hed let young ronald play with the charm and had told him stories about monkey one of them was how the gods punished monkey for his effrontery by burying him under a huge mountain this is how sam chang now felt covered by a million kilos of fear and uncertainty but his eyes then fell on his family and the burden lessened somewhat william laughed at something on the television chang believed this was the first time that his oldest son had been free from the anger and sour spirit that hed radiated all day he was laughing in genuine good spirits at the frivolous show ronald too chang then looked at his wife completely absorbed in the child poyee how comfortable she is with children chang himself didnt have this easiness with them he was forever weighing what he said should he be stern about this matter lenient about that meimei perched the baby on her own knees and made the child giggle as she rocked her in china families pray for a son to carry on the family name traditionally not bearing a male heir was grounds for divorce chang of course had been delighted when william had been born and ronald after him proud that he could assure his own father that the chang line would continue but meimeis sadness at not having a daughter had been a source of sorrow for him too and so chang had found himself in a curious position for a chinese man of a certain age hoping for a girl should meimei have gotten pregnant again as a persecuted dissident and flouter of the onechild rule the party could not have punished him more for having yet another child so he was fully prepared to try to give his wife a daughter but she had been very ill during her pregnancy with ronald and it had taken her months to recover from the delivery she was a slight woman no longer young and the doctors urged for her health that she not have any more children she had accepted this stoically as she had accepted changs decision to come to the beautiful country which virtually precluded the chance that they could adopt a daughter because of their illegal status out of this terrible plight though had apparently come some good to balance the hardship the gods or fate or the spirit of some ancestor had bestowed poyee on them the daughter that they could never have and restored the harmony within his wife yinyang light and dark male and female sorrow and joy deprivation and gift chang rose and walked to his sons and sat down to watch the television with them he moved very slowly very quietly as if any abrupt motion would shatter this fragile familial peace like a rock dropping into a still morning pond iii the register of the living and the dead tuesday the hour of the rooster pm to wednesday the hour of the rat am in weichi the two players facing the empty board begin by seizing the points they believe to be advantageous little by little the deserted areas disappear then comes the clash between the conflicting masses struggles of defense and offense develop just as happens in the world the game of weichi chapter twentythree his wife was getting worse it was now early evening and wu qichen had sat for the past hour on the floor next to the mattress and bathed his wifes forehead his daughter had painstakingly brewed the herbal tea hed bought and together he and the girl had fed the hot liquid to the feverish woman shed taken the pills too but there seemed to be no improvement he leaned forward again and wiped her skin why wasnt she getting better he raged had the herbalist cheated him and why was his wife so thin to start with she wouldnt have gotten sick on the voyage if shed eaten right gotten more sleep before they left yongping a fragile pale woman should have forced herself to take better care of herself she had responsibilities im frightened she said i dont know whats real its all a dream to me my head the pain the woman began muttering and finally fell silent and suddenly wu realized that he was frightened too for the first time since theyd left fuzhou a lifetime ago wu qichen began to think about losing her oh there were many things about yongping that he didnt understand they had married impulsively without knowing much of each other she was moody she was sometimes less respectful than his father say would have tolerated but she was a good mother to the children she was dependable in the kitchen she deferred to his parents she was clever in bed and she was always ready to sit quietly and listen to him to take him seriously not many people did the thin man glanced up and saw their son standing in the doorway langs eyes were wide and he had been crying go back and watch television wu told him but the boy didnt move he stared at his mother the man stood chinmei he snapped come here the girl appeared in the doorway a moment later yes baba bring me some of the new clothes for your mother the girl disappeared and returned a moment later with a pair of blue stretch pants and a tshirt together they dressed the woman chinmei got a clean cloth and wiped her mothers forehead wu then went to the electronics store next door to the apartment he asked the clerk where the closest hospital was the man told him that there was a big clinic not far away he wrote down the address in english as wu asked hed decided to spend the money on a taxi to take his wife there and needed the written note to show the driver his english was very bad when he returned to the apartment he said to his daughter well be back soon listen to me carefully you are not to open the door for anyone do you understand that yes father you and your brother will stay in the apartment do not go outside for any reason she nodded lock the door and put that chain on it after we leave wu opened the door held his arm out for his wife to cling to and then stepped outside he paused heard the door latch and the rattle of the chain then they started down canal street filled with so many people so many opportunities so much money none of which meant much of anything to the small frightened man at the moment there the ghost said urgently as he turned the corner and eased the blazer to the curb on canal street near mulberry in chinatown its the wus before he and the turks could find their masks and climb out of the vehicle though wu helped his wife into a taxi he climbed in after her and the cab drove away the yellow cab was soon lost in the busy traffic of rushhour canal street the ghost eased back into traffic and parked in a space directly across from the apartment whose address and frontdoor key mahs real estate broker had given him a half hour ago just before theyd shot him to death where do you think theyve gone one of the turks asked the ghost i dont know she looked sick his wife you saw how she was walking maybe to a doctor the ghost surveyed the street he measured distances and noted particularly the number of jewelry stores here at the intersection of mulberry and canal it was a smaller version of the midtown diamond district this troubled the ghost it meant that there would be dozens of armed security guards on the street if they killed the wus before the stores closed they might expect one of them to hear the gunshots and come running to the sound even afterhours though there would be risks he could see the square boxes of dozens of security cameras covering the sidewalks they were out of sight of the cameras here but to approach the wus they would be well within range of the lenses theyd have to move fast and wear the ski masks i think here is how we should handle it the ghost said in slow english are you listening each of the turks turned his attention to him after her father and mother had left wu chinmei made some tea for her brother and gave him a tea bun and rice she reflected how badly her father had embarrassed her in front of a handsome young man in the grocery store by actually bargaining for the food theyd bought this morning when theyd arrived in chinatown saving a few yuan on tea buns and noodles she sat eightyearold lang down in front of the television with his food and then walked into the bedroom to change the sweatstained sheets of their mothers bed glancing at the mirror she studied herself she was pleased with what she saw her long black hair wide lips deep eyes several people had remarked that she looked like lucy liu the actress and chinmei could see that was true well she would look more like her after she lost a few pounds and fixed her nose of course and these ridiculous clothes a pale green workout suit how disgusting clothes were important to wu chinmei she and her girlfriends would raptly study the broadcasts of the fashion shows from beijing hong kong and singapore the tall models swiveling their hips as they walked down the runway then the girls thirteen and fourteen would stage their own fashion shows traipsing down a homemade runway then ducking behind screens to change one time before the party cracked down on her father for opening his loud mouth the family had gone with him to xiamen south of fuzhou this was a delightful town a tourist draw catering to many taiwanese and western travelers at a tobacco shop where her father had gone to buy cigarettes chinmei had been stunned to see more than thirty fashion magazines in the racks shed remained in the store for a half hour while her father did some business nearby and their mother took lang to a park she worked her way through all of them most were from the west but many were published in beijing or in other cities in the free zones along the coast and showed the latest creations of chinese designers which were as stylish as anything produced in milan or paris the teenager had planned to study fashion in beijing and become a famous designer herself possibly after a year or two of modeling but now her father had ruined that she dropped onto the bed grabbed the phony cloth of her cheap running suit and tugged at it in a fury wanted to rip it to pieces what would she do with her life now work in a factory stitching together crappy clothes like this making two hundred yuan a month and giving it to her pathetic parents maybe that would be how shed spend the rest of her life that would be her career in the fashion business slavery she was a sharp knock on the door interrupted her thoughts gasping in fright she sat up fast picturing the snakehead in the raft a gun in his hand the pop of the shots as he killed the drowning victims she walked into the living room and turned the volume on the tv down lang looked up with a frown but she touched his lips to keep him silent a womans voice called mr wu are you there mr wu i have a message from mr chang chang she recalled the man who had saved them from the hold of the ship and sailed the raft to shore she liked him she liked his son too the one with the western name william he was sullen and lean and handsome cute but a risk he was clearly triad bait its important the woman said if youre there open the door please mr chang said youre in danger i worked with mr mah hes dead youre in danger too you need a new place to stay i can help you find one can you hear me chinmei couldnt get the sound of the gun out of her mind the terrible man the ghost shooting at them the explosion in the ship the water should she go with this woman chinmei debated please more pounding but then she heard her fathers words ordering her to stay not to open the door for anyone and as angry as she was as wrong as she thought her father was in so many ways she couldnt disobey him shed wait here silently and not let anyone in when her parents returned she would give them the message the woman in the alleyway mustve gone there was no more knocking chinmei turned up the volume on the tv again and fixed a cup of tea for herself she sat for a few minutes studying the outfits of the american actresses on a sitcom then she heard the click of a key in the latch her father was back already she leapt up wondering what had been wrong with their mother was she all right now did she have to stay in hospital just as she got to the door and said father it opened fast and a small swarthy man pushed inside slammed the door behind him and pointed a pistol at her chinmei screamed and tried to run to lang but the man leapt forward and grabbed her around the waist he flung her to the floor he took her sobbing brother by the collar and dragged him across the room to the bathroom pushed him inside stay there be quiet brat he snarled in bad english he pulled the door shut the girl wrapped her arms around her chest and scrabbled away from him she stared at the key how where did you get that afraid that hed killed her parents and taken it from them he didnt understand her chinese though and she repeated it in english shut your mouth if you scream again ill kill you he took a cell phone from his pocket and made a call im inside the children are here the man dark and arablooking probably from western china nodded as he listened looking chinmei up and down then he gave a sour sneer i dont know seventeen eighteen pretty enough all right he disconnected the call first he said in english some food he seized her hair and dragged the sobbing girl into the kitchen what do you have to eat here but all she could hear were those three words looping over and over through her mind first some food first some food and then wu chinmei began to cry in lincoln rhymes town house gray and gloomy thanks to the storms early dusk the case wasnt moving at all sachs sat nearby calmly sipping that disgustingsmelling tea of hers which irritated the hell out of rhyme for no particular reason fred dellray was back pacing and squeezing his unlit cigarette not in any better mood than anyone else i wasnt happy then and i aint happy now not a happy person he was referring to what hed been told were resource allocation issues within the bureau which were delaying their getting more agents on the ghostkill team the tall man contemptuously spat out they actually said rai if you kin believe it yep yep its an rai situation he rolled his eyes and muttered jesus loves his mother dellrays take was that nobody in the justice department thought human smuggling was particularly sexy and therefore worth much time in fact despite the executive order in the nineties shifting the jurisdiction the bureau didnt have as much experience as the ins dellray had tried explaining to the assistant special agent in charge that there was also the little matter that the snakehead in question was a mass murderer the response to that was also tepid it fell into the category of lsfh hed explained which is rhyme asked let somebody else fuckin handle it i made that up butcha get the picture the spectac team too was still cooling their heels down in quantico the agent glumly added and they were having no better luck with the evidence from any of the crime scenes okay what about the honda he stole at the beach rhyme barked its in the system isnt anybody in the hinterland looking for it i mean it is on an emergency vehicle locator sorry linc sellitto said after he checked with downtown nothing sorrylincnothing it was a hell of a lot easier to find a ship in a port in russia than it was to find ten people in his own backyard then the preliminary crime scene report from the mah killing came back thom held the notes up for rhyme and turned the pages for him there was nothing to suggest that the ghost was behind the killing no evidence associated the ghost with the scene the forensics term for connected no ballistics were involved mahs throat had been cut and the carpet in his office and the hallways hadnt yielded any footprints the techs had lifted hundreds of latents and three dozen samples of trace evidence but it would take hours to analyze them all all the remaining afis requests from the fingerprints that sachs had lifted at the prior scenes had come back negative with the exception of jerry tangs but his identity was hardly an issue any longer of course i want a drink rhyme said discouraged its cocktail hour hell its after cocktail hour dr weaver said no alcohol before the operation thom pointed out she said avoid it thom im sure she said avoid avoidance is not abstention im not going to argue websters here lincoln no booze the operation isnt until next week give me a goddamn drink the aide was adamant youve been working way too hard on this case your blood pressures up and your schedules shot to hell rhyme said well compromise a small glass thats not a compromise that would be a win for you and a loss for me you can drink after the surgery he disappeared into the kitchen rhyme closed his eyes pushed his head back into the chair angrily imagining a moment of absurd fantasy that the operation would actually fix the nerves that operated his entire arm he told no one this not even amelia sachs but though walking was out of the question he often fantasized that the surgery would actually let him lift things he now pictured grabbing the macallan and taking a hit directly from the bottle rhyme could almost feel his hand around the cool round glass a clink on the table beside him made him blink the astringent smoky smell of whisky rose up and engulfed his head he opened his eyes sachs had placed a small glass of scotch on the wheelchair armrest its not very full the criminalist muttered to her but the subtext of the comment both lincoln and she understood was thank you she winked in reply he drank deeply through the straw and felt the warm burn of the liquor in his mouth and throat another sip he enjoyed the liquor but found that it did little to dull the urgency and frustration he felt at the slow pace of the case his eyes fell on the whiteboard one entry caught his eye sachs he called sachs what i need a phone number fast the ghost held his model pistol against his cheek the hot metal redolent of oil and sweet grease gave him reassurance yes he wanted a new weapon something bigger and more dependable like the uzi and the beretta hed lost on the dragon but this was a goodfortune gun one hed had for years he believed it was lucky because hed come by the pistol in this way near taipei once hed gone to a temple to pray someone had tipped the police that he was inside and two officers stopped him as he came down the stairs one of them though had hesitated to pull a gun at a buddhist temple and flustered hed dropped this very weapon on the grass the ghost had scooped it up shot both of the young policemen to death then escaped from that day on this gun had been his goodluck charm a present from his bowman god yi it had been nearly an hour since kashgari had gone inside to make sure the wus children stayed put the shops had closed along this part of canal the armed guards were gone he was sure and the sidewalks were largely deserted lets get on with it the ghost thought and stretched he was tired of waiting yusuf and the other turk were too theyd been complaining about hunger but he guessed that even some of the restaurants and delis here had security cameras and the ghost was not going to let himself or any associate be recorded on tape for something as frivolous as food theyd have to look he whispered glancing up the street at the end of the block he saw two people climb from a cab nervously keeping their heads down the wus the ghost recognized them clearly from the cheap running suits they wore they paid the driver and walked into a drugstore on the corner the husband clutching his wife around the waist her arm was in a cast or was wrapped with thick bandages he carried a shopping bag get the masks ready check your weapons the two turks complied five minutes later the wus left the drugstore they were walking as quickly as they could considering the wifes condition he said to hajip you stay with the car keep the engine running he and i a nod toward yusuf will follow the wus inside we push them into their apartment and close the door well use pillows for silencers i want to bring the daughter with us well keep her for a while yindao would he knew forgive this infidelity the wus were now five meters from their doorway shuffling fast heads down oblivious to the gods of death who fluttered nearby the ghost found his cell phone and called the turk in the wus apartment yes kashgari answered the wusre close to the building where are the children the boys in the bathroom the girls with me as soon as they walk into the alley well come in right behind them he shut off the power to the phone so thered be no distracting ring at inopportune moments the ghost and yusuf pulled their masks down over their faces and climbed out the other turk slipped behind the wheel of the blazer the wus were moving closer to the door the ghost stepped off the curb and walked straight toward his victims afraid you can be brave ghostkill easton long island crime scene two immigrants killed on beach shot in back one immigrant wounded dr john

battery park city area suspected accomplices from chinese ethnic minority presently pursuing whereabouts chapter twentyfour the wus in the doorway the children in the apartment the ghost and yusuf masks over their faces and guns at their sides were sprinting across canal street he felt the rush of excitement he always did before a kill his hands vibrated slightly but would grow still when he lifted the gun to shoot he thought again about wus daughter seventeen eighteen pretty enough he would it was at this moment that a loud crack echoed through the street and a bullet slammed into a parked car just behind the ghost the alarm began braying jesus a mans voice called from somewhere who fired the ghost and yusuf stopped and crouched they lifted their weapons scanning the street for their attacker hell came another voice ceasefire and another who the fuck the wus too stopped crouching down on the pavement the ghosts head was swiveling he gripped yusufs arm a mans voice cried through a loudspeaker kwan ang stop this is the united states immigration service followed immediately by a second gunshot from the man whod called out it seemed and a side window of a nearby parked car exploded in a cloudburst of glass his heart vibrating from the shock the snakehead scrabbled backward his lucky gun up as he looked for a target the ins was here how its a trap he raged to yusuf back to the car chaos now filled canal street more shouting passersby and store clerks diving for cover up the block the doors of two white vans opened and men and women in black uniforms carrying guns leapt out and what was this the wus themselves were drawing weapons the husband pulled a machine pistol from the plastic bag hed held the wife was lifting a weapon from her running suit pocket and then the ghost realized that they werent the wus at all they were decoys chineseamerican police officers or agents wearing the wus clothing somehow the police had found the couple and sent these people back in their place to lure him out of cover drop your weapons the man masquerading as wu shouted the ghost fired five or six shots at random to keep people down and stoke the panic he shot out a window in a jewelry store adding another siren to the tumult of sounds on the street and bolstering the chaos the turk in the drivers seat opened the door and began firing at the white vans running looking for cover and looking for targets the police scattered on the far side of canal as he crouched beside their fourbyfour the ghost heard who fired backups arent in position what the fuck happened watch the bystanders for christs sake a panicked driver in a car in front of the wus apartment started to speed up to get out of the line of fire the ghost fired two shots into the front seat the window glass vanished and the car skidded into a row of parked vehicles with a huge bang kwan ang came an electronic shout from a bullhorn or vehicle loudspeaker a different voice this time this is the fbi put down he shut up the agent by firing twice more in his direction and climbed into the blazer the uighurs climbed into the back kashgari he is inside yusuf cried and nodded toward the wus apartment where the third turk waited hes dead or captured the ghost snapped understand were not waiting yusuf nodded but just as the ghost turned the key and started the engine he noticed a police officer step from a line of cars motioning bystanders to get back and take cover he lifted his pistol aimed toward the front of the fourbyfour get down the ghost cried as the officer fired repeatedly the three men ducked expecting the windshield to shatter but instead they heard loud ring after loud ring as the bullets struck the front of the vehicle eight or nine of them finally there was a huge clanging as fan blades were knocked out of alignment and jammed into other parts of the engine which gave a huge squeal steam pouring from the pierced radiator finally it went silent out the ghost ordered jumping out and firing several shots at the officer to drive him under cover behind a row of cars the three men crouched on the sidewalk for a moment there was a lull the police and agents were holding their fire probably waiting for the arrival of the backup officers more emergency cars sirens howling were racing down canal street toward them right now drop your weapons and stand up the staticky voice called through the loudspeaker again kwan drop your weapons we give up asked hajip his eyes huge with fear the ghost ignored him and wiped his sweating hand on his slacks then slipped another clip of ammunition into his model he looked behind him this way he rose and fired several times toward the officers then ran into the fish market behind them several patrons and clerks were cowering behind bins of fish and eels racks of food freezer cases the ghost and the two turks ran to the back alleyway where they found an old man standing beside a delivery truck seeing the guns and the masks the man dropped to his knees and lifted his arms he began wailing dont harm me please i have a family his voice trailed off into sobbing inside the ghost shouted to the turks they leapt in the truck the snakehead looked behind them through the doorway and could see several officers cautiously approaching the store he turned and fired several shots in their direction they scattered for cover the ghost then spun back and froze the old man had grabbed a long filleting knife and had taken a step forward he stopped and blinked in terror the ghost lowered his pistol to the old mans agespotted forehead the knife fell to the wet cobblestones at his feet he closed his eyes five minutes later amelia sachs arrived at the scene she ran toward the wus apartment her pistol in her hand what happened she called to an officer standing beside a shotup car what the hell happened but the young cop was badly shaken and just glanced at her numb she continued down the street and found fred dellray crouched over an officer whod been shot in the arm holding an improvised bandage on the mans wound medics ran up and took over dellray was furious this is bad amelia we were an inch away from him a half inch where is he she asked holstering the glock stole a delivery van from that fish market cross the street we got everbody in town with a badge looking for it sachs closed her eyes in dismay all of rhymes brilliant deductions and the superhuman efforts to put together a takedown team in time had been wasted what rhyme frustrated by the lack of leads had noticed on the evidence chart was the reference to the injured immigrants blood the number sachs had found for him was that of the medical examiners office he realized the lab had never called back with results of the tests rhyme had bullied a forensic pathologist into quickly completing the analysis the doctor had found several helpful things the presence of bone marrow in the blood indicating a severe bone fracture sepsis suggesting a deep cut or abrasion and the presence of coxiella burnetii a bacteria responsible for q fever a zoonotic disease one transmitted from animals to people the bacteria were often picked up in places where animals were kept for long periods of time like pens at seaports and the holds of ships which meant that the immigrant was one very sick woman and that in turn was something that rhyme believed might be useful tell me about this q fever rhyme had asked the pathologist though it wasnt contagious or lifethreatening the symptoms of the disease could be severe hed learned headache chills fever possibly even liver malfunction is it rare rhyme had asked very around here excellent rhyme had announced buoyed by this news and had sellitto and deng put together a team of canvassers from the big building one police plaza downtown and the fifth precinct they began calling all the hospitals and emergency clinics in chinatown in manhattan and the one in flushing queens to see if any female chinese patients had been admitted with q fever and a badly broken infected arm after only ten minutes theyd received a call from one of the officers manning the phones downtown it turned out that a chinese man had just brought his wife into the emergency room of a clinic in chinatown she fit the profile perfectly advanced q fever and multiple fractures her name was wu yongping shed been admitted and her husband was there too officers from the fifth precinct had sped to the hospital along with sachs and deng to interview them the wus shaken badly over their arrest had told the police where they were living and that their children were still in the apartment then rhyme had called to tell her that hed just gotten the afis results from the jimmy mah killing some of the prints matched those found at prior ghostkill scenes the snakehead had committed the crime when wu explained that mahs broker had gotten them the apartment rhyme and sachs realized that the ghost knew where the wus were staying and was probably on his way to kill them at that moment since the bureaus crack spectac team was still not on hand to assist on the case dellray sellitto and peabody put together a joint takedown team of their own and would have some chineseamerican officers from the fifth precinct masquerade as the wus but because of one premature gunshot the whole effort was wasted dellray snapped at another agent anything more on the fishstore van how come nobodys seen it its got the fuckin name of the store on the side in big ugly letters the agent made a call on his radio and a moment later reported nothing sir no reports of it on the road or abandoned dellray played with the knot of his purpleblack tie just visible above his body armor somethin aint right what do you mean fred sachs asked but the agent didnt answer he glanced back at the fish store and strode toward it sachs accompanied him standing near the large ice bin in the front were three chinese store clerks sachs assumed and two nypd police officers interviewing them dellray looked over the clerks one by one and his gaze settled on an old man whose eyes dropped immediately to the dozen graypink flounders resting on the bed of ice he pointed a finger at the man he told you the ghost stole the van right thats right agent dellray one of the cops said well he was goddamn lying dellray and sachs ran to the back of the shop and into the alleyway behind it hidden behind a large dumpster thirty feet away they found the fish markets van returning to the front of the store dellray said to the old man listen skel tell me what happened and dont fuck with me we all together on that he going kill me the man said sobbing make me say they stole van three men had gun at my head they drove down alley hid van then got out and run dont know where go dellray and the policewoman returned to the impromptu command post cant hardly blame him but still shit and a half so she speculated they got onto a side street and jacked some wheels probly and killed the driver a moment later an officer indeed called in saying that thered been a report of a carjacking three armed men in ski masks had run up to a lexus at a stoplight ordered the couple out and sped off contrary to dellrays prediction though the driver and passenger were unhurt why didnt he kill em dellray wondered probably didnt want to fire his gun sachs said draw too much attention she added bitterly it wouldve been inconvenient as more emergency vehicles pulled up she asked dellray who was it who fired the shot that spooked him dunno yet but ima look this one over with a fuckin magnifyin glass but he didnt need to look too far as it turned out two uniformed officers walked up to the fbi agent and conferred with him the agents face compressed into a frown dellray looked up and strode over to the guilty party it was alan coe what in thliving hell happened dellray barked defensive but defiant the redhaired agent looked back into the fbi agents eyes i had to fire the ghost was going to shoot the decoys didnt you see no i did not his weapon was at his side not from my angle crap on your angle dellray snapped it was at his side im getting sick of you lecturing me dellray it was a fucking judgment call if you had everybody in position we still couldve collared him we set it up to take him down on the sidewalk without innocents around not in the middle of a crowded street dellray shook his head thirty lil tiny seconds and he woulda been tied up like a christmas package then the tall agent nodded at the big glock on coes hip an even if he was moving on somebody how the hell couldja miss with a piece like that from fifty feet even i coulda hit him and i dont fire my pissy weapon but once a year fuck coes defiance slipped and he said contritely i thought it was the right thing to do under the circumstances i was worried about saving some lives dellray plucked the unsmoked cigarette from behind his ear looking like he was about to light it up thiss gone way far enough from now on ins is advisory only no enforcement no tactical you cant do that coe said an ominous look in his eyes cording to the executive order i can son im going downtown and doing what i gotta to put that in place he stormed off coe muttered something sachs didnt catch she watched dellray climb into his car slam the door and speed off she turned back to coe did anybody get the children children the agent asked absently you mean the wus kids i dont know their parents were frantic that the children be brought to them at the hospital as soon as possible i told downtown about em coe said dismissively meaning she supposed the ins i guess theyre sending somebody to take custody thats procedure well im not thinking about procedure she snapped therere two children alone in there and they just heard a shootout in front of their apartment wouldnt you think theyd be a little scared coe had had enough reprimands for one day silently he turned and walked back to his car without a word pulling out his cell phone as he left he too drove off angrily his phone pressed against his ear sachs then called rhyme and gave him the bad news what happened rhyme asked even angrier than dellray one of our people fired before we were in position the street wasnt sealed and the ghost shot his way out rhyme it was alan who fired the shot coe right oh no dellrays bumping the ins down a notch peabody wont like that at this point freds in no mood to care about what people like and dont good rhyme said we need somebody to take charge were groping around in the dark on this one i dont like it then he asked casualties a few officers and civies wounded nothing serious she noticed eddie deng ive got to get the wus children rhyme ill call you back after i run the scene she disconnected the call and said to deng need some translation help eddie with the wus kids sure pointing to the bulletpocked fourbyfour sachs said to another officer keep it sealed ill run the scene in a minute the cop nodded in response deng and sachs walked to the apartment she said i dont want the kids to go downtown to the ins alone eddie can you sneak em out of here and get em to their parents at the clinic sure they walked down the few stairs that led to the basement apartments garbage littered the alleyway and sachs knew the rooms here would be dark probably infested with roaches and would undoubtedly stink imagine she thought the wus had risked death and imprisonment and endured the physical pain of their terrible journey just for the privilege of calling this filthy place their home whats the number deng asked walking ahead of sachs one b she answered he started toward the door it was then that sachs noticed a key in the frontdoor lock of the wus apartment a key she wondered deng reached for the knob no sachs cried unholstering her weapon wait but it was too late deng was pushing the door open anyway he leapt back away from the slight dark man with his arm around a sobbing teenage girls waist holding her in front of him as a shield a pistol pressed against her neck chapter twentyfive ting ting eddie deng shouted in panic the young detectives weaponless hands rose above his spiny hair no one moved sachs heard a multitude of sounds the girls whimpering the low hiss of traffic horns from the street the gunmans desperate orders in a language she didnt understand her own heartbeats she turned sideways to present a smaller target and centered the blade sights of her glock on as much of his head as presented the rule was this as difficult as it was you never sacrificed yourself you never gave up your weapon you never turned it aside in a standoff you never let a perp draw a target anywhere on your body you had to make them understand that the hostage wasnt going to save them the man started forward very slowly motioning them back still muttering in his unintelligible language neither sachs nor the young detective moved you in armor deng she whispered yeah came the shaky reply she was too an american body armor vest with a super shok heart plate but at this range a shot could easily do major damage to an unprotected part of their bodies a nick in the femoral artery could kill you faster than some chest shots would back out she whispered i need better light for shooting you going to shoot deng asked uncertainly just back out she took a step behind her another the young cop sweat gleaming between the thoms of his hair didnt move sachs stopped he was muttering something maybe a prayer eddie you with me she whispered after a pause eddie goddamn it he shook his head sorry sure come on slow to the man gripping the teenage girl sachs spoke in a cooing voice and very slowly put the gun down lets not anybody get hurt do you speak english they backed away the man followed english she tried again nothing eddie tell him well work something out hes not han deng said he wont speak chinese try it anyway a burst of sounds from dengs mouth the staccato words were startling the man didnt respond the two officers backed toward the front of the alleyway not a single goddamn cop or agent noticed them sachs thought where the hell are all of our people the assailant and the terrified girl the gun tucked against her neck moved forward and stepped outside too you the man barked to sachs in crude english on ground both on ground no sachs said were not lying down im asking you to put your gun down you cant get away hundreds of police you understand as she spoke she adjusted her target his cheek in the slightly better light here but it was a very narrow bullseye and the girls temple was a scant inch to the right of it he was of very slim build and sachs had no body shot at all the man glanced behind him up the dark alley hes going to fire and then make a run for it deng said in a quavering voice listen sachs called calmly were not going to hurt you we no the man shoved the gun harder against the girls neck she screamed then deng reached for his sidearm eddie dont sachs cried bu the assailant called and thrust his gun forward firing into dengs chest the detective grunted violently from the impact and fell backward against sachs knocking her to the ground deng rolled onto his belly retching or coughing blood she couldnt tell the round mightve pierced the body armor at this range stunned sachs struggled to her knees the gunman aimed at her before she could raise her weapon but he hesitated there was some distraction behind him the shooter looked back in the darkness of the alleyway sachs could make out a man speeding forward a small figure holding something in his hand the perp released the girl and spun around lifting the gun but before he could shoot the running figure clocked him in the side of the head with what he was carrying a brick hongse sonny li called to sachs dropping the brick and pulling the girl away from the stunned assailant li pushed her to the ground and turned back to the dark man who clutched his bleeding head but suddenly he jumped back and lifted his pistol toward li who stumbled back against the wall three fast shots from sachss gun dropped the attacker like a doll onto the cobblestones and he lay motionless judges of hell sonny li gasped staring at the body he stepped forward checked the mans pulse then lifted the gun out of his lifeless hand dead hongse he called then li turned back to the girl helping her up sobbing she ran down the alley past sachs and into the arms of a chinese officer from the fifth precinct who began comforting her in their common language med techs ran to deng to check him out the vest had indeed stopped the slug but the impact might have cracked a rib or two im sorry he gasped to sachs i just reacted your first firefight he nodded she smiled welcome to the club the medic helped him up and they took him out to be examined more thoroughly in an ems bus sachs and two esu officers cleared the apartment and found a young panicked boy about eight in the bathroom with the help of a chineseamerican cop from the fifth precinct to translate the medics checked the siblings out and found that neither of them had been hurt or molested by the ghosts partner sachs glanced back into the alley where another medic and two uniformed officers stood over the corpse of the assailant i have to process the body she reminded them i dont want it disturbed more than necessary sure officer came the reply nearby sonny li patted his pockets and finally located his pack of cigarettes if he hadnt found any she wouldntve been surprised to see him rifle the dead mans pockets putting on her tyvek suit to search the crime scenes amelia sachs glanced up to see li walking toward her she laughed to see the cheery grin on the little man how she asked how what how the hell dyou figure out the wus were here i ask you same thing you tell me first she sensed he was eager to brag and she was happy to let him okay he finished the cigarette and lit another way i work in china i go places talk to people tonight i go to gambling halls three of them lose some money win some money drink and talk and talk finally meet guy at poker table carpenter fuzhounese he tell me about man come in earlier nobody know him complaining to everybody about women about what he had to do for family cause wife sick and broke arm bragging about money he going make then he say he on dragon this morning and rescue everybody when it sink had to be wu liverspleen disharmony im saying he say he living nearby i ask around and find about this block lots meetandgreet snakeheads put people here who just arrive i come over and look around ask people see if anybody know anything and find out family just like wus move in today i check out building and look through back window and see guy with gun hey you look in back window first hongse no i didnt maybe you should done that that good rule always look in back window first i should have sonny she nodded in the direction of the dead shooter too bad he not alive li said glumly could been helpful you dont really torture people to get them to talk do you she asked but the chinese cop just gave a cryptic smile he asked hongse how you find wus sachs explained to li how theyd found the wus through the wifes injury li nodded impressed with rhymes deductions but what happen to ghost sachs explained about the premature gunshot and the snakeheads escape coe thats right she agreed big fuck i not like that man im saying when he over in china at meeting in fuzhou we not trust him much walk into room and not like us nobody there talk like we children want to do case against ghost by himself talk bad about immigrants disappear at times when we need him li looked over the tyvek overalls he frowned why you wear that suit hongse so i dont contaminate the evidence bad color shouldnt wear white color of death in my country color of funerals im saying throw it out you get red suit red is goodluck color in china not blue either get red suit its enough of a target in white not good he said bad feelings he remembered a word that deng had taught him earlier bad omen im saying im not superstitious sachs said i am li said lots people in china are always saying prayers sacrificing cutting demons tail cutting what she interrupted called cutting demons tail see demons follow you always so when you cross traffic you run fast in front of car that cut off demons tail and take his power away dont people ever get hit sometimes then dont they know it doesnt work no only know that sometimes you cut his tail sometimes demon get you cutting the demons tail sachs got li to promise hed stay out of the crime scene at least until she was finished and then processed the dead gunmans body walked the grid inside the apartment and finally searched the ghosts bulletriddled suv she bagged and tagged all the evidence and finally stripped off the space suit then she and li drove back to the clinic where she found the wu family reunited in a room guarded by two uniformed cops and a stonyfaced woman ins agent with li and the agent translating sachs got as much information as she could though wu qichen knew nothing about the ghosts whereabouts in the city the scrawny embittered man gave her some information about the changs including the name of the infant with them poyee which meant treasured child what a lovely name thought amelia sachs she said to the ins agent theyre going to detention right until the hearing do you have a problem putting them in one of our safehouses the nypd had several nondescript highsecurity town houses in the city used for witness protection ins detention centers for illegal immigrants were notoriously lax besides the ghost would be expecting them to go to an immigration facility and with his guanxi might pay someone in the detention center to let him or a bangshou inside to try to kill the family again fine with us the town house in murray hill was free sachs knew she gave the agent the address and the name of the nypd officer who oversaw the houses the ins agent then looked at wu and like a badtempered schoolteacher said why dont you people just stay at home fix your problems there you almost got your wife and family killed wus english wasnt good but apparently he understood her he rose from his wifes bedside and gestured broadly not our fault he snapped leaning toward the sour woman coming here not our fault amused the ins agent asked not your fault who do you want to blame you country how do you figure that you not see look around all you money and richnesses you advertising you computers you nikes and levis cars hair spray you leonardo dicaprio you beautiful women you pills for everything you makeup you television you tell whole world you got fuck everything here meiguo is all money all freedom all safe you tell us everybody how good is here you take our money but you say to us meiyou go away you tell us our human rights terrible but when we try come here you say meiyou the thin man lapsed into chinese then calmed he looked the woman up and down nodded at her blond hair what your ancestor italians englishes germans they in this country first huh tell me he waved angrily and sat down on the bed put his hand on his wifes uninjured arm the agent shook her head smiling in a condescending way as if astonished that the immigrant couldnt figure out the obvious sachs left the somber family behind and motioned li after her to the clinic exit they paused at the curb then jogged between two fastmoving taxis sachs wondered if shed been close enough to the second one to cut the tail off any demons pursuing her the building and the garage beneath it were virtually impregnable but the parking garage annex in an underground structure across the street was far less so concern about terrorist bombs had prompted the government services administration to limit access to the garage under manhattan federal plaza there were so many federal employees that it would create huge bottlenecks to check every vehicle that entered the garage under the building itself so that facility was closed to all but the most senior government officials and the one next door constructed for other employees there was still security in the annex of course but since the garage sat beneath a small park even the worst bomb damage would be limited in fact tonight at pm the security was not at its best because the one guard on duty at the entrance booth was watching some excitement a car fire on broadway an old van was burning down to its tires a conflagration observed by hundreds of happy passersby the chunky guard had stepped out of his booth watching the black smoke and orange flames dancing through the windows of the van so he didnt notice the slight man dressed in a suit and carrying an attaché case step quickly into the autos only entrance and hurry down the ramp into the halfdeserted garage the man had memorized the license plate number of the car he sought and it took him only five minutes to find it the navy blue governmentissue vehicle was very close to the main exit door the driver had this choice spot because hed arrived only a half hour ago long after the offices had closed and most of the federal employees had left for the day like nearly all federal cars the man had been assured there was no alarm after a fast glance around the garage he pulled on cloth gloves quickly drove a wedge between the window and the side of the door slipped a slimjim tool inside the space and popped the lock he opened his attaché case and took out a heavy paper bag glanced inside for one final check he saw the cluster of footlong yellow sticks on whose side were the words explosive danger see instructions before use wires ran from a detonator in one of the sticks to a battery box and from there to a simple pressure switch he placed the bag under the drivers seat unwound a length of wire then slipped the pressure switch between the springs of the seat anyone who weighed more than ninety pounds would complete the circuit and set off the detonator simply by sitting down the man clicked the power switch on the battery box from off to on and locked the door of the car closed it as quietly as he could and left the garage walking matteroffactly past the stilloblivious security guard raptly watching the nyfd douse the flames of the burning van though with a little disappointment in his face as if he was sorry that the gas tank hadnt blown up spectacularly as they always did in action flicks and tv shows chapter twentysix they sat in silence watching the small television set william translating those words that his parents didnt understand the special news report didnt give the names of the people whod nearly been killed on canal street but there was no doubt that it was wu qichen and his family the story said theyd been passengers on the fuzhou dragon that morning one of the ghosts confederates had been killed but the snakehead himself had escaped with one or two others the story ended and commercials came on the television screen william rose and walked to the window looked out at the dark street get back chang snapped to his son but the boy remained where he was for a defiant moment children chang thought william the boy finally stepped away and walked into the bedroom ronald flipped through channels on the television no sam chang told his younger son read get a book and practice your english the boy dutifully stood he went to the shelf and found a volume and returned to the couch to read meimei finished stitching together a small stuffed animal for poyee a cat it seemed the woman made the toy pounce onto the arm of her chair and the girl took it in both hands studying it with happy eyes together they played with the cat laughing chang heard a moan on the couch where his own father rested curled in a blanket that was virtually the same gray shade as his skin baba chang whispered and rose immediately he found the mans medicine opened it and gave him a tablet of morphine he held the cup of cold tea so that the man could take the pill when hed first gotten sick the heat and dampness spreading quickly through the yang organs of his body the stomach and intestines theyd gone to their local doctor whod given them herbs and tonics soon though that hadnt been enough for the pain and another doctor had diagnosed cancer but changs dissident status had kept his father waiting on the bottom of the list at the hospitals huge queues for treatment medical care in china was changing the state hospitals were giving way to private clinics but they were extremely expensive a single visit could cost two months salary and treating cancer would have been out of the question for a family struggling to survive the best chang had been able to find was a barefoot doctor in the countryside north of fuzhou one of those individuals simply proclaimed by the government to be paramedics and practicing with minimal training the man had prescribed morphine to ease chang jiechis pain but there was little else he could do the bottle of the drug was large but it wouldnt last more than a month and his father was quickly worsening on the internet chang had done a lot of research on the united states there was a famous hospital in new york that did nothing but treat cancer patients he knew that his fathers condition was advanced but the man wasnt old not by american standards only sixtynine and he was strong from daily walks and exercise surgeons could operate and remove those portions of his body destroyed by the cancerous dampness and give him radiation and medicine to keep the disease at bay he could live for many more years as he gazed at his father the old man suddenly opened his eyes the ghost is angry now that theyve killed one of his own people and that hes failed to kill the wus hell come after us i know his sort he wont stop until he finds us this was his fathers way to sit and to absorb then give his assessments which were invariably right for instance hed always considered mao zedong a psychopath and had predicted some cataclysm would descend upon the country under his reign and hed been right the near annihilation of the chinese economy in the fifties thanks to maos great leap forward and the cultural revolution a decade later of which his father like all openminded artists and thinkers was a victim but chang jiechi had survived the disasters hed said to his family in the s this will pass the madness cannot be sustained we have only to stay alive and wait that is our goal within ten years mao was dead the gang of four was imprisoned and chang jiechi had been proven right and he was right now too sam chang thought in despair the ghost would come after them the very name snakehead comes from the image of the smugglers crawling furtively through borders to deliver their human cargo to their final destination chang sensed the ghost was doing this now prowling calling in favors wielding his guanxi threatening perhaps even torturing people to find the changs whereabouts he might outside a screech of brakes chang his wife and father all froze footsteps shut the lights out quickly chang ordered meimei scurried through the apartment dowsing them chang walked quickly to the closet pulled williams pistol out from its hiding place and walked to the curtained front window hands trembling he looked outside across the street was a delivery truck with a large sign for pizza hanging from the window the driver was carrying a cardboard carton up to an apartment its all right he said a delivery across the street but then he looked through the dim apartment detecting the vague forms of his father his wife and the infant illuminated only by the blue light of the television screen his smile of relief faded and like the black cloud from an ink stick in a calligraphy well he was consumed with intense regret for what his decisions had done to these people he loved so much in america chang had learned guilt for transgressions tortures ones psyche in china though shame at letting down family and friends is the essential torment and that is what he now felt searing shame so this is to be the life ive brought to my father and my family fear and darkness nothing but fear and darkness the madness cannot be sustained perhaps not chang thought but that doesnt mean that its not any less deadly while it persists sitting on a bench in battery park city the ghost was watching the lights of the ships on the hudson river far more peaceful but less picturesque than the waterfront in hong kong there was a break in the rain but the wind was still rowdy pushing low purple clouds quickly overhead their bellies lit by the vast spectrum of city lights how had the police found the wus the ghost wondered he considered this question but could come to no answer probably through the broker theyd killed and through mah the investigators hadnt believed that the italians had killed the tong leader despite the message hed written in mahs blood the news had reported that the one uighur theyd left behind was dead and that would mean a big reparation payment to the head of the cultural center how had they found the family maybe it was magic no not magic at all he had yet more proof that his adversary and those working with him were relentless and talented there was something very different about the people who were after him this time better than the taiwanese better than the french better than your typical ins agent if not for the first gunshot on canal street he would now be in custody or dead and who exactly was this lincoln rhyme that his intelligence source had reported to him about well he believed he was safe now he and the turks had taken great care to hide the lexus which theyd carjacked to escape in hidden it better than the honda hed stolen at the beach in fact theyd split up immediately hed worn the mask at the wus no one had followed them from the shooting and kashgari had had no identification on him to link him to either the ghost or the cultural center in queens tomorrow he would find the changs two young american women slowly walked past enjoying the view and chatting in a way he found irritating but the ghost tuned out their words and stared at their bodies resist he wondered no the ghost thought decisively he pulled out his phone and before his will stopped him called yindao and they arranged to meet later she was he noted pleased to hear from him who was she with at the moment he wondered what was she doing and saying he wouldnt have much time tonight to see her he was exhausted from this endless day and needed sleep but how badly he wanted to be close to her to feel her firm body beneath his hands watch her lying underneath him touching her eradicating the shock and anger of the neardisaster from earlier on canal street after he hung up he held the memory of the womans sultry voice in his mind as he continued to watch the fast clouds the choppy waves disappointed you can be fulfilled hungry you can be satiated defeated you can be victorious at pm fred dellray stood and stretched then plucked four empty coffee containers off his desk in the fbis manhattan office he pitched them into his brimming trash can time to call it a night he flipped through the report about the shootout on canal street it was mostly finished but he knew hed have to revise it tomorrow dellray enjoyed writing and he was good at it under a pseudonym hed contributed to various historical and philosophical magazines on many different topics over the years but this particular opus was going to require some serious massaging hunched over the desk he glanced at the pages compulsively jotting changes here and there and all the while wondering why exactly he was working on ghostkill frederick dellray with degrees in criminology psychology and philosophy tucked under his belt eschewed brainy law enforcement he was to undercover work what rhyme was to criminalistics known as the chameleon he could portray anybody from any culture provided of course that the role could be played by someone well over six feet with skin dark as an ethiopians which still left an amazing range of parts for the agent crime being perhaps the only aspect of society where one is judged solely on skill and not on race dellrays talent and lifelong passion for law enforcement however had proved his undoing hed been too good in addition to working undercover jobs for his own outfit the fbi hed been borrowed regularly by the drug enforcement administration alcohol tobacco and firearms and the police departments in new york la washington dc bad guys have computers cell phones and email too of course and little by little dellrays reputation spread within the underworld it became too dangerous to put him into the field he was promoted and put in charge of running undercover agents and cis confidential informants in new york for his part dellray wouldve preferred a different assignment his partner special agent toby doolittle had been killed in the oklahoma city federal building bombing and the death had sent dellray on a perennial quest to be reassigned to the bureaus antiterrorist unit but he reluctantly recognized that a passion to collar a perp wasnt enough to excel at that area of law enforcement look at alan coe for instance and so he was content to remain where his talents lay being assigned to what would become ghostkill had confused dellray at first hed never run any human smuggling cases before hed assumed that he was recruited because of his extensive undercover network in manhattan queens and brooklyn where the chineseamerican communities in this area were located but dellray soon learned that his traditional techniques for running snitches and undercover agents didnt work a viewer of thoughtful movies dellray had seen the famous film chinatown which made the point that the namesake neighborhood in oldtime los angeles operated outside of western laws this he found wasnt a scriptwriters device and it was true about new york s chinatowns as well justice was administered through the tongs and the number of calls to and to the local police stations in chinese communities of new york was much lower than in other neighborhoods nobody snitched to outsiders and undercover agents were sniffed out almost immediately so with ghostkill he found himself running a complicated operation dealing with a type of crime he had little experience with but after his efforts tonight at the office he felt much better tomorrow he was going to meet with the special agents in charge of the southern and eastern districts and one of the assistant directors from washington hed get himself named supervising special agent which would open up a lot of the bureaus resources to him and the ghostkill team as ssa hed bully and connive his way into getting what they needed for the case the fbis ie his complete jurisdiction the spectac team in town and the ins relegated to an exclusively advisory role which meant virtually cutting them out of the case altogether peabody and coe would be pissed but that was just too bad hed already framed his argument yes the ins was vital in gathering intelligence about snakeheads and smuggling operations and interdicting their ships but now ghostkill was a fullout manhunt for a killer that was the bureaus expertise he was confident the brass would buy his pitch undercover agents like himself dellray had learned are among the best persuaders and extorters in the world dellray snagged his office phone and called his own number his apartment in brooklyn hello a womans voice answered ill be home in thirty he said softly with serena he never used the unique patois hed developed working on the streets of new york and slung about as his trademark on the job see you then love he hung up no one in the bureau or the nypd knew a single thing about dellrays personal life nothing about serena a choreographer with the brooklyn academy of music hed been seeing off and on for years she worked long hours and traveled he worked long hours and traveled the arrangement suited them walking through the halls of the bureaus headquarters which resembled the digs of a big moderately unsuccessful corporation he nodded at two agents in shirtsleeves ties loose in a way that the boss j edgar hoover would not have tolerated just as dellray reflected he himself wouldnt have been tolerated by the old gman now that he thought about it so much crime dellray intoned as he stalked past them on his long legs so little time they waved good night then down the elevator and out the front door he crossed the street heading for the federal parking annex he noticed the scorched frame of a van that had burned earlier in the evening still smoldering he remembered hearing the sirens wondered what had happened past the guard down the ramp into the dim garage which smelled of wet concrete and car exhaust dellray found his governmentissue ford and unlocked the door he opened it and tossed in his battered briefcase which contained a box of mm ammunition a yellow pad filled with his jottings various memos on the kwan ang case and a wellread book of goethes poems as dellray started to climb inside the ford he noticed on the drivers side of the car the window weather stripping was unsealed which told him immediately somebody had wedged the window to open the door shit he glanced down and saw the wires protruding from under his seat he lunged for the top of the door with his right hand to keep from putting all his weight on the seat and compressing what he knew was the bombs pressure switch but it was too late the tips of his long fingers flapped against the open door frame and slipped off he began to fall sideways onto the seat beneath him save your eyes he thought instinctively lifting his long hands toward his face chapter twentyseven the changsre somewhere in queens sachs said writing this bit of information on the whiteboard driving a blue van no tag no make do we have anything specific about it rhyme muttered cerulean navy sky baby blue wu couldnt remember oh my now thats helpful as sachs paced thom took over as the scribe the information about the ghosts fourbyfour which the snakehead had abandoned at the site of the wu shootout wasnt any better the blazer had been stolen and had current but fake dealer tags tracing the vehicle identification number revealed only that it had been stolen in ohio months ago sonny li sat nearby but wasnt offering his asian detective insights at the moment he was rummaging through a large shopping bag hed brought back from chinatown a short while before lon sellitto was on his phone apparently learning that the ghost had successfully vanished after the shootout to judge from his scowl sachs mel cooper and the criminalist turned to the trace evidence shed found in the blazer shed located a few small grayish carpet fibers under the brake and accelerator pedals and two matching fibers in the cuff of the dead shooter outside the wus apartment the fibers didnt match the carpet in the blazer or any of the prior scenes and therefore mightve come from the ghosts safehouse burn em and lets check the database cooper ran two of the fibers through the gas chromatographmass spectrometer which produced a record of the exact substances that went into this type of carpet as they waited for the results there was a knock on the door outside and a moment later thom ushered in the visitor it was harold peabody rhyme assumed that hed come here to talk to them about coes carelessness at the wus apartment but there was a grimness on his face that suggested something more then behind him another man appeared rhyme recognized him as the assistant special agent in charge the asac of the manhattan office of the fbi a toohandsome man with a perfect chin and smug manners rhyme had worked with him several times and found him efficient and unimaginative and given as dellray had complained to bureauspeak thick as honey he too was grimfaced then a third man appeared his crisp navyblue suit and white shirt suggested to rhyme that he was bureau as well but he identified himself tersely as webley from state so the state department was now involved rhyme thought that was a good sign dellray mustve indeed used his guanxi in high places to get them reinforcements sorry to intrude lincoln peabody said the asac we need to talk to you something happened downtown tonight what about the case sachs asked we dont think its related but its going to have some implications im afraid well get on with it rhyme thought and hoped his impatient glare conveyed this message someone planted a bomb in the garage across from the federal building tonight my god mel cooper whispered it was in fred dellrays car oh lord no thought rhyme no sachs cried a bomb sellitto blurted snapping closed his cell phone hes okay the asac said quickly the main charge didnt go off rhyme closed his eyes both he and dellray had lost people close to them thanks to explosive devices it was even unemotional rhyme believed the most insidious and cowardly way to kill someone not hurt li asked concerned no the chinese cop muttered something a prayer perhaps what happened the criminalist asked dynamite with a pressure switch dellray triggered it but only the detonator fired maybe the cap wasnt seated right they dont know yet the asac said our bomb unit rendered safe and handed the parts over to pert rhyme knew most of the agents and the techs in the bureaus physical evidence response team and respected them if there was anything to find he had confidence that they would why dont you think its related anonymous nineoneone call about twenty minutes before the blast male voice undetermined accent said the cherenko family was planning some retaliation for the bust last week it said more would follow dellray rhyme recalled had just finished running a huge covert operation in brooklyn the home of the russian mob theyd nailed three international money launderers their staffs and several supposed hitmen and had confiscated millions of dollars and rubles origin of the call pay phone in brighton beach the largest russian community in the area i dont believe in coincidences rhyme said the ghost spent some time in russia remember to pick up the immigrants he glanced at sachs an inquiring eyebrow raised she answered the ghost and his buddies were pretty hot to get the hell away from the scene of the wu shooting i cant see them detouring down to the federal building to set up a bombing not to say they couldnt have hired somebody rhyme observed that webley from state had said not a word since the three men arrived he was standing silent arms crossed in front of the evidence charts staring at them howd they plant the device sellitto asked the asac team of two we think somebody set a van on fire in front of the parking garage distracted the guard the other guy got into the garage and set it dismayed rhyme suddenly understood what implications the asac had been referring to and fred wants off the ghost case right the asac nodded the thing with his partner you know toby doolittle rhyme recalled the partner killed in the oklahoma city bombing hes already cleared the decks ands calling in markers from his snitches in brighton beach rhyme could hardly blame the agent but he said we need some help harold fred was getting a spectac team together and some more agents he knew too that dellray had been arranging to have the inss role cut down to intelligence gathering and advising a fact which even rhyme never a practitioner of diplomacy decided it was best not to mention at the moment the ghosts network is too good hes too far underground we need more people better support the asac said reassuringly oh were downcourt with that one lincoln well have a new field ops agent for you in the morning and some more news about spectac peabody unbuttoned his suit jacket revealing a badly sweatstained shirt he said i heard what happened with alan coe at the wus apartment i mean im sorry we wouldve catch the ghost li said if coe not fire shot i know look hes a good man i dont have many agents as dedicated as he is he works twice as hard as most of my people hes just impulsive i try to cut him some slack had a tough time after that informant of his disappeared i guess he blamed himself after his suspension he took a leave of absence he wont talk about it but i heard he went overseas to find out what happened to her on his own nickel finally came back to work ands been going like a greyhound ever since one of my best agents except for minor flaws like letting suspects escape rhyme thought wryly peabody and the asac left reassuring rhyme and sellitto once again that theyd have a new fbi liaison agent in the morning and the spectac team en route its definitely agendaed the asac called good night said webley from state formally and followed the men out the door okay back to work the criminalist said to sellitto sachs cooper and li eddie deng was at home nursing his badly bruised chest what else did the wus tell you sachs she gave them the details shed learned at the clinic the wus included qichen his wife yongping a teenage daughter named chinmei and a young son lang the changs were sam meimei william and ronald as well as changs father who was known by his full chinese name chang jiechi in china sam had arranged for jobs for himself and william but wu didnt know where or even in what line of work then she said that the family also had a baby whose mother had drowned on the dragon poyee it means treasured child rhyme noticed a certain look in sachss eyes when she mentioned the infant he knew how much sachs wanted a child and wanted a child with him as bizarre as this idea would have seemed to him several years ago he now secretly liked it part of his motive wasnt completely paternal though amelia sachs was one of the best crime scene searchers hed ever seen most important was her empathy she more than any other cs professional hed known except himself had the ability to transport herself into the mind of the perpetrator at the scene and in that persona find evidence that most other officers would have missed sachs however had another aspect to her psyche what drove her to perfection at crime scenes drove her into danger a champion pistol shot an expert driver she was often first on the scene at takedowns ready to pull her weapon and engage a perp just like tonight in the alleyway beside the wus apartment rhyme would never ask her to give that up but with a child at home he hoped shed restrict herself to the crime scene work where her true talent as a cop lay then mel cooper interrupted his thoughts chromatograph results from the carpet he explained that it was a woolnylon blend he determined the color temperature of the gray shade and then went online logging into the fbis carpetfiber database a few minutes later the results popped onto the screen its lustrerite brand and the manufacturers arnold textile and carpeting in wallingham mass ive got phone numbers the slim man said get somebody calling them rhyme said we want to know about installations in lower manhattan recent you think mel probably with this many fibers why that li asked the tech explained most fiber loss from carpets happens within six months of installation give or take ill do it sellitto said only dont hope for miracles considering the companys probably been closed for hours he nodded at the clock it was nearly pm rhyme said its a manufacturing company and what does that mean i dont know linc why dont you tell me sellitto grumbled nobody was in the mood for object lessons that theres probably a night shift and a night shift means a foreman and a foremanll have the bosss number at home in case of fire or some such ill see what i can do cooper was testing the trace sachs had found in the blazer more of the bentonite he said on both the ghosts shoes and on his partners the slim man turned to the microscope and examined another bit of material what do you think lincoln is this mulch he looked up from the scope came from the suvs carpet drivers side command input microscope rhyme ordered the image that cooper was looking at in the microscope came up on rhymes computer screen the criminalist saw what he recognized immediately as traces of fresh cedar mulch the sort used in decorative gardens good lot of landscaping around battery park city sellito pointed out referring to the large residential development in downtown manhattan where the trace evidence theyd found earlier had suggested the ghost might maintain his safehouse too much landscaping though thought rhyme trace it to a particular manufacturer nup cooper said generic well this sample alone wouldnt pin down a particular location the fact that the mulch was still damp however might help if we find a number of possible locations we can eliminate the ones that didnt have mulching done in the past few days long shot but its something then rhyme asked how about the body not much she said she explained that the man had had no identification on him only some cash about extra ammo for his weapon cigarettes and a lighter oh and a knife which had traces of blood on it cooper had already ordered the typing test on the blood but rhyme knew it would match jerry tangs or jimmy mahs afis results came back on the prints from the blazer and from the dead man all negative sonny li pointed to a polaroid of the face of the corpse hey i got it right loaban his face check it out hes kazakh kyrgyz tajik uighur a minority like i telling you remember i remember sonny rhyme said to him call our friend from the tong cai tell him that we think the gang is of those minorities you mentioned sonny might help him narrow things down then he asked ballistics the ghost was still using his model sachs said li offered im saying very solidrock gun i found some ninemillimeter casings too she held the evidence bag up but no distinctive ejection marks probably a new beretta sig sauer smittie or colt and the dead guys weapon i processed it she explained his prints only it was an old walther ppk sevenpointsixfive where is it rhyme studied the evidence bag and saw no sign of the weapon a look passed between sachs and sonny li a look decidedly not for detective lon sellitto she said i think the feds have it ah li looked away from rhyme and he knew immediately that sachs had slipped the chinese cop the weapon after she was through processing it well good for him the criminalist thought if not for the chinese detective then deng sachs and the wus daughter mightve been killed tonight let him have some protection sachs gave cooper the serial number of the walther and he ran it through the firearms database zip he said made in the s probablys been stolen a dozen times since then sellitto called just got through to a senior vp at arnold textile woke him up but he was pretty cooperative considering that particular carpeting is for commercial sale only original developers and installers and its the top of their line he gave me a list of twelve big developers in the area who buy directly from the manufacturer and twentysix distributors who market to installers and subcontractors hell rhyme said it would be a marathon of canvassing to find the addresses of buildings where lustrerite had been installed he said get somebody on it sellitto said ill have em start waking people up fuck im awake why the hell shouldnt the rest of the world be he made a call to the big building to line up some detectives to help and faxed the list downtown to them then rhymes private line rang and he answered it lincoln a womans voice asked through the speakerphone he was thrilled to hear the callers voice dr weaver rhymes neurosurgeon whod be performing the operation next week i know its late am i interrupting anything you busy not a thing rhyme said and ignored thoms exaggerated glance at the whiteboard which attested to the fact that he was somewhat occupied at the moment ive got the details for the surgery manhattan hospital week from friday at am neurosurgery preop third floor excellent he replied thom jotted the information down and rhyme and the doctor said good night you going to doctor loaban yes he said about the chinese cop couldnt seem to think of a way to summarize rhymes condition and he waved toward his body thats right sachs said nothing just stared at the sheet of instructions that dr weaver had dictated to thom rhyme knew that she would prefer he not have the operation most of the successes with the technique had occurred with patients whose injuries were far less severe than rhymes those with the damage much lower on the spinal cord at the lumbar or thoracic level the surgery as shed told him would probably produce no discernible benefit and was risky it might even make him worse and given his lung impairment it was possible that he could die on the table but sachs understood how important it was to him and was going to support him so she finally said a stoic smile on her face well make sure we nail the ghost before next friday rhyme noticed that thom had been studying him closely what the criminalist snapped the aide took rhymes blood pressure too high and you dont look good well thank you very much he snapped back but i dont think my appearance has anything to do its quitting time the aide said firmly and he wasnt speaking to his boss sellitto and cooper also voted to call it a night mutiny rhyme muttered no thom retorted common sense sellitto made a call to check on the wus and john sung the family was now in the nypd safehouse in the murray hill section of new york john sung had declined sachss invitation to join them afraid that it would remind him too much of the many chinese security bureau facilities hed been detained in as a dissident instead sellitto added another cop to the team guarding him all of the protective officers reported that the immigrants were safe rhyme said to sachs you taking those herbs with you i hope you are they stink i was going to leave them as air freshener but if you dont like them she leaned close how are you feeling you look pale just tired he said which was the truth oddly tired he supposed he should be concerned about it but he believed his exhaustion was nothing more than the demands of the case which had been consuming him for days but the fatigue was something that he knew he should pay attention to did it indicate anything more serious one of the major problems plaguing sci patients of course isnt just paralysis there are related problems because the nerves arent responding lung impairment and resulting infections but perhaps the worst problem is the absence of pain you have no early warning system of pain from cancer say which rhymes own father had died of as had sachss he remembered that his dad had first learned of the disease after hed gone to the doctor complaining about stomach pain good night mel cooper called wan an li called whatever sellitto grumbled and walked into the corridor sonny rhyme said youll stay here tonight not got other place to go loaban sure thomll make up a room ill be upstairs taking care of a few things come up and visit if you feel like it give me twenty minutes li nodded then turned back to the whiteboard ill take you up sachs said rhyme wheeled into the tiny elevator that ran between the first and second floors formerly a closet she joined him and closed the door rhyme glanced at her face it was thoughtful but in a way that didnt have to do with the case he sensed anything you want to talk about sachs without answering she closed the elevator door and pressed the up button ghostkill easton long island crime scene two immigrants killed on beach shot in

meimei william and ronald sams father chang jiechi and infant poyee sam has job arranged but employer and location unknown driving blue van no make no tag number changs apartment is in queens the wus qichen yongping chinmei and lang chapter twentyeight in chinese many words are combinations of their opposites for instance advanceretreat means to move one of these is the word for doing business which is literally translated as buysell and this was what the four men sitting in the smoky storefront office of the east broadway workers association were now engaged in late on this stormy august night buying and selling that the object of the negotiations was human life selling the ghost the location of sam changs family didnt appear to give these men any pause at all there were of course many legitimate tongs in chinatown and they provided important services for their members resolving conflicts among competing businesses protecting schoolchildren from gangs running centers for senior citizen and child day care discouraging inroads by the restaurant and garment workers unions and serving as a liaison to the other government that is city hall and the nypd but this particular tong did none of these it had one specialty only and that was to serve as a base of snakehead operations in the new york area now nearly midnight the three leaders of the workers association all in their forties or fifties sat on one side of the table across from a man whom none of them knew but he was a man who could be very valuable since he knew where the changs were hiding how do you know these people the director of the association asked the man whod given only his family name tan presumably so that the ghost couldnt track him down and torture him to find the changs location chang is a friend of my brothers in china i got them an apartment and chang and his boy a job where is the apartment the director of the tong asked casually tan gesturing abruptly said thats what im here to sell if the ghost wants it he has to pay for it you can tell us an associate said smiling well keep it to ourselves i deal only with the ghost of course the tong bosses knew this but it was always worth a try there were many stupid people in this world you have to understand one of the associates offered the ghost is hard to find ah tan scoffed youre not the only ones i can deal with you know then why are you here the other associate asked quickly tan paused because im told you are the most informed its dangerous the director said to tan the police are after the ghost if they find out that weve contacted him well they could disrupt our organization tan shrugged you have ways to get in touch with him that are secure dont you lets get to the money what will you pay us to put you in touch with the ghost ten percent of whatever he pays me the director waved his arm this meeting is over go find your other sources laughing in ridicule at the directors comment tan said and how much did you want half you are making a poor joke the battle lines being drawn they got down to business the buysell continued for nearly a half hour finally they agreed on thirty percent provided it was us dollars the director pulled out a cell phone and placed a call the ghost came on the line and the director identified himself yes the snakehead asked i have someone here who rented an apartment to some of the survivors of the dragon the changs he wants to sell you that information the ghost was silent for a moment he asked tell him to prove it the director relayed this request to tan who replied the fathers western name is sam there is an old man too changs father and two boys oh a wife meimei and they have a baby she isnt theirs she was on the ship her mother drowned how does he know them the director explained hes the brother of a friend of changs in china the ghost considered tell him ill pay one hundred thousand onecolor for the information the director asked tan if this was acceptable he said immediately that it was some people you do not buysell with keeping a straight face despite his pleasure at this sum the director added delicately to the ghost hes agreed to pay us a fee perhaps sir if it wouldnt be too much trouble yes ill pay you your portion directly if the informations accurate what is your cut thirty percent youre a fool the ghost scoffed you were robbed i wouldve taken sixtyfive percent if id been you the director flushed and began to defend himself but the ghost cut him off send him to see me tomorrow morning at eightthirty you know where he hung up the director told tan the arrangement and they shook hands in the confucian order of duty to others friendships were on the lowest rung after rulersubject fatherson husbandwife and older brotheryounger brother still there was something abhorrent the director thought about this kind of betrayal but no matter whenever he arrived in hell tan would be judged for his acts and as for the director and his associates well was not bad for an hours work his hands shaking his breath fast sam chang left the storefront of the east broadway workers association and had to walk three blocks before he found a bar which are rare in chinatown he sat on an uneven stool and ordered a tsingtao beer he drank it fast and ordered another he was still surprised no astonished that the three men at the tong had believed that he was joseph tan and had actually told him where he could meet the ghost in the morning he laughed to himself what an appalling idea he was actually bargaining with these men over the price of his familys life sitting in their dark apartment in brooklyn several hours before chang had been thinking so this is to be our life darkness and fear and his fathers keen eyes had narrowed what are you thinking of doing hed asked his son the ghost is looking for us yes he wont expect me to be looking for him chang jiechis eyes remained on his son for a long moment then slid to the name plaque on the improvised altar chang archer and what would you do if you found him he said to the old man kill him why not go to the police chang laughed sourly do you trust the police here any more than in china no his father answered i will kill him chang repeated he had never in his life disobeyed his father and he wondered if the man would now forbid him to do what hed decided must be done but to his surprise his father asked only you would be able to do that yes for my family yes chang then pulled his windbreaker on ill go to chinatown ill see what i can do to find him listen to me his father said whispering do you know how to find a man how baba you find a man through his weaknesses whats the ghosts weakness he cannot accept failure chang jiechi said he must kill us or his life will suffer from great disharmony and so sam chang had done just what his father had suggested offered the ghost the chance to find his prey and it had worked holding the cold beer bottle to his face chang now reflected that he himself would probably die hed shoot the ghost immediately as soon as he opened the door but the man would have associates and bodyguards who would in turn kill him and thinking this the first image in his mind was william his firstborn son the young man who would sooner than anyone thought inherit the mantle of the changs the father now heard the sons insolence saw the contempt in his eyes oh william he thought yes i neglected you but if only you understood that i did so solely in the hopes of making a better homeland for you and your children and when it grew too dangerous in china i brought you here leaving my beloved country behind to give you what i couldnt back home love son is not manifest in the gift of gadgets or coddling foods or rooms of ones own love shows itself in discipline and example and sacrifice even giving up ones life oh my son sam chang paid for the beer and left the bar though the hour was late some stores were still open to tempt the last of the tourists chang went into a variety and gift shop and bought a small shrine box a brass plate electric candles with red bulbs some incense he spent some time trying to find the right buddha statue he picked a smiling one because even though he would kill a man tomorrow and would himself die a cheerful buddha would bring comfort and solace and ultimately good fortune to the family he was leaving behind the thing is amie amelia sachs was driving downtown uncharacteristically close to the posted speed limit the thing is honey her father had said to her in his dissipated state ravaged by the greedy cells that were dismantling his body you got to look out for yourself sure pop naw naw you say sure but you dont really mean sure you mean im agreeing with the old man cause he looks like you know what even lying in west brooklyn hospice on fort hamilton parkway near death the man hadnt let her get away with a single thing i dont think i mean that at all ah listen amie listen im listening i hear your stories about walking the beat sachs like her father had been a portable at the time a beat patrolman in fact her nickname was pd for the portables daughter i make up a lot of stuff pop be serious her smile faded and she indeed grew serious feeling the dusty summer breeze flow through the halfopen window tousling her unencumbered red hair and her fathers overwashed sheets as they sat and lay in that difficult place go on she said thank you i hear your stories about your beat you dont look out for yourself enough but youve got to amie wheres all this coming from pop they both knew it was coming from the cancer that would soon kill him and from the urgency to pass along to his only child something more substantive than an nypd shield a nickelplated colt pistol and an old dodge charger in need of a transmission and cylinder heads but his role as father required him to say humor an old man so lets tell jokes remember the first time you flew we went to see grandma sachs in florida it was a hundred and eighty degrees by the pool and a chameleon attacked me unfazed herman sachs continued and the stewardess or whatever you call them nowadays said in case of emergency put your oxygen mask on and then assist anyone who needs help thats the rule they say that she conceded buffeted by the emotions she felt the old cop with stains of axle grease permanently seated in the lattice of his hands continued thats gotta be a patrolmans philosophy on the street you first then the vic and its gotta be your personal philosophy too whatever it takes look out for yourself first if youre not whole youll never be able to take care of anybody else driving now through the faint rain she heard her fathers voice fade and another replace it the doctor from several weeks ago ah ms sachs here you are hello doctor ive just been meeting with lincoln rhymes physician yes ive got to talk to you about something youre looking like its bad news doctor why dont we sit down over there in the corner heres fine tell me let me have it straight her whole world in turmoil everything shed planned for the future altered completely what could she do about it well she reflected pulling to a stop at the curb heres one thing amelia sachs sat for a long moment this is crazy she thought but then impulsively she climbed out of the camaro and head down walked quickly around the corner and into an apartment building she climbed the stairs and knocked on the door when it opened she smiled at john sung he smiled back and nodded her inside whatever it takes look out for yourself first if youre not whole youll never be able to take care of anybody else suddenly she felt a huge weight lifted off her shoulders chapter twentynine midnight but despite the exhausting day which had led him from a sinking ship to a central park west apartment half the globe away from his home sonny li didnt seem tired he walked into lincoln rhymes bedroom carrying a shopping bag when i down in chinatown with hongse loaban i buy some things got present for you present rhyme asked from his throne the new hillrom flexicair bed which hed been told was exceedingly comfortable li took an object from the bag and began unwrapping a small wad of paper look what i got here in his hands was a jade figurine of a man with a bow and arrow and looking fierce li looked around the room which way north thats north rhyme nodded li put the figurine on top of a table against the wall then returned to the bag and took out some sticks of incense youre not going to burn that in here have to loaban not kill you despite lis assertion that chinese have a difficult time saying no this was not a trait the cop apparently shared he set the incense into a holder and lit it he then found a dixie cup in the bathroom and filled it with some liquor from a light green bottle which had also appeared from the shopping bag whatre you doing making a temple shrine loaban not a temple li was amused by rhymes failure to miss the obvious distinction who is that buddha confucius with a bow and arrow li scoffed loaban you know so much about so little and so little about so much rhyme laughed thinking that when hed been married his wife had often said much the same though at a higher volume and less articulately li continued this is guan di god of war we make sacrifice to him he like sweet wine and that what i bought for him rhyme wondered how sellitto and dellray not to mention sachs would react when they saw the transformation of his room into a shrine to the god of war li bowed toward the icon and whispered some words in chinese he extracted a white bottle from the shopping bag and sat in the rattan chair by rhymes bed he filled a dixie cup for himself and then fiddled with one of rhymes tumblers taking off the lid filling it halfway up and then replacing the lid and fitting a straw inside and that rhyme asked good stuff loaban chuyeh ching chiew we make sacrifice to us now this stuff good like whisky no it wasnt like whisky at all definitely not delicately peatsmoked eighteenyearold scotch but although the taste was pretty bad it had one hell of a kick to it li nodded toward the impromptu sacristy i find guan di at store in chinatown he very popular god thousands shrines all over china devoted to him but i not buy him because of war he is god of detectives too im saying youre making that up joke no im saying is true every security bureau i ever been in has guan di there case dont go so good detectives burn offerings just like we do another shot of the liquor li sniffed that strong stuff im saying the baijiu the what he nodded at the bottle of chu yeh ching chiew what was your prayer rhyme asked i translate guan di please let us find the changs and catch the fuck ghost thats a good prayer sonny rhyme drank more of the liquor it grew better with every sip or maybe it was that you tended to forget how bad it was the chinese cop continued that surgery you talk about that make you better it might a little i wont be able to walk but i could regain a little movement how it work he explained to li about dr cheryl weaver whose neurology unit at a branch of the university of north carolina was performing experimental surgery on spinal cord injury patients he could still remember almost verbatim the doctors explanation of how the technique worked the nervous system is made up of axons which carry nerve impulses in a spinal cord injury those axonsre cut or crushed and they die so they stop carrying impulses and the message doesnt get from the brain to the rest of the body now you hear that nerves dont regenerate thats not completely true in the peripheral nervous system like our arms or legs damaged axons can grow back but in the central nervous system the brain and the spinal cord they dont at least they dont on their own so when you cut your finger your skin grows back and you regain your sense of touch in the spinal cord that doesnt happen but there are things that were learning to do that can help regrowth our approach at the institute here is an allout assault on the site of the injury we attack sci on all fronts we use traditional decompression surgery to reconstruct the bony structure of the vertebrae themselves and to protect the site where your injury occurred then we graft two things into the site of the injury one is some of the patients own peripheral nervous system tissue and the other substance we graft is some embryonic central nervous system cells from a shark rhyme added to sonny li the cop laughed fish exactly sharks are more compatible with humans than other animals are then the criminalist continued ill take drugs to help the spinal cord regenerate hey loaban li said looking him over carefully this operation it dangerous again rhyme heard dr weavers voice of course there are risks the drugs themselves arent particularly dangerous but therere risks associated with the treatment any c quad is going to have lung impairment youre off a ventilator but with the anesthetic theres a chance of respiratory failure then the stress of the procedure could lead to autonomic dysreflexia and the resulting severe blood pressure elevation im sure youre familiar with that which in turn could lead to a stroke or a cerebral event theres a risk of surgical trauma to the site of your initial injury you dont have any cysts now and no shunts but the operation and resulting fluid buildup could increase that pressure and cause additional damage yes its dangerous rhyme told him sound to me like yi luan tou shi which means li considered then said words translate throwing eggs against rocks means doing something bound to fail im saying so why you do this operation it seemed obvious to rhyme to move a step closer to independence perhaps to be able to close his hand around the tumbler for instance and lift it to his lips to scratch his head to become more normal using the term that was very politically incorrect within the disabled community to be closer to amelia sachs to be a better father to the child that sachs wanted so badly he said its just something i have to do sonny then he nodded at the nearby bottle of macallan scotch lets try my baifu now li barked a laugh baijiu loaban what you just say was lets try my department store baijiu rhyme corrected himself li filled the cup and the tumbler with the aged scotch rhyme sipped from the straw ah yes much better li tossed down a whole dixie cup of scotch he shook his head im saying you should not do this operation ive weighed the risks and no no embrace who you are embrace your limitations but why when i dont have to i see all this science shit you have here in meiguo we not have science everywhere in china like you do oh beijing hong kong guangdong fuzhou sure sure we got mostly everything you got a little behind thank you chairman mao but we got computers we got internet we got missiles yeah sometime they blow up but usually they go in space okay but doctors they not use so much science they put us back in harmony in china doctors not gods we have a different view here yeah yeah li scoffed doctors make you look younger give you hair give women bigger xiong you know he pointed to his chest we not understand that that not in harmony you think im in harmony like this rhyme asked with an exasperated laugh fate make you this way loaban and make you this way for purpose maybe you best detective you can be because of what happen your life balanced now im saying rhyme had to laugh i cant walk i cant pick up evidence how the hell is that better maybe your brain it work better now im saying maybe you have stronger will your jizhong your focus maybe is better sorry sonny i dont buy it but as hed learned once sonny li took a position on an issue he didnt let go let me explain you loaban you remembering john sung has that goodluck stone of monkey king i remember you are monkey im what you are like monkey im saying monkey do miracle things magic smart tough had temper too im saying like you but he ignore nature look for ways to cheat gods and stay alive forever he steal peaches of immortality got names erased from register of living and dead that when he got in trouble got burned and beat up and buried under mountain finally monkey give up wanting to live forever found some friends and they all make pilgrimage to holy land in the west he was happy in harmony im saying i want to walk again rhyme whispered adamantly wondering why he was baring his soul to this strange little man thats not too much to ask but maybe is too much ask li responded listen loaban look at me i could wish to be tall and look like chow yunfat have all girls chase me could wish to run big commune and have hundreds productivity awards so everybody respect me could wish to be hong kong banker but not my nature my nature is being fuck good cop maybe you start walking again you lose some other else something more important why you drink this crap he nodded at the scotch its my favorite baijiu yeah how much it cost about seventy dollars a bottle li made a sour face still he downed the glass and poured another listen loaban you know the tao me that new age crap youre talking to the wrong person okay i am telling you something in china we got two big philosophs confucius and laotzu confucius think what is best is for people to obey superiors follow orders kow tow to betters keep quiet but laotzu he say opposite what is best is for each person follow the way of life on his own find harmony and nature english name of tao is way of life he write something i try to say it all about you loaban about me rhyme asked reminding himself that his interest in the mans words mustve had its source in the well of alcohol within him at the moment li squinted as he translated in tao laotzu say there no need to leave house for better seeing no need to peer from window instead live in the center of your being the way to do is to be does everybody in china have a goddamn saying for everything rhyme snapped we got lots sayings true you should have thom write that down and put up on wall next to altar to guan di the men fell silent for a minute there is no need to leave house for better seeing no need to peer from window finally the conversation resumed and li talked at length

no unkindness but either they struggled to ignore his condition as most of them referred to it or they celebrated his disability making jokes and comments about it to show how closely they connected with him when in fact they didnt connect at all and as soon as they caught a glimpse of the catheter or the box of adult diapers in the corner of the bedroom they started counting down the minutes until they could escape these people would never disagree with him theyd never fight back they never got below the appearance of a relationship but in sonny lis face rhyme could see complete

with a number of perpendicular lines on it he then took out two bags one containing hundreds of tiny white pebbles the other black ones suddenly rhyme had a huge desire to play and he forced himself to pay careful attention to sonny lis animated voice as he explained the rules and object of weichi seems simple enough rhyme said players alternated putting their stones on the board in an attempt to

not play before that only reason experience players do that always is customary rhyme understood and appreciated lis reassurance still he said adamantly no you make the first move go ahead and watched lis eyes lower and focus on the wooden grid between them iv cutting the demons tail wednesday the hour of the dragon am to the hour of the rooster pm in weichi the more equally matched two players are the more interesting the game the game of weichi chapter thirty on the morning of the day he was to die sam chang awoke to find his father in the back courtyard of their brooklyn apartment going through the slow movements of taichi he watched the elderly man for a few moments and a thought occurred to him chang jiechis seventieth birthday was in three weeks in china theyd been so poor and so persecuted the family had not been able to have the mans sixtieth birthday celebration traditionally a huge party that signified the move into old age the time for veneration but his family would do so for the seventieth sam changs animate body would not make it to the party but his spirit perhaps would he gazed at the old man who moved like a leisurely dancer in the small backyard taichi was beneficial to the body and to the soul but it always saddened chang to watch the exercise it reminded him of a humid night in june years ago chang and a cluster of students and fellow teachers had been sitting together in beijing watching a group of people nearby engaged in the balletic movements it was after midnight and they were all enjoying the pleasant weather and the exhilaration of being among likeminded friends in the center of what was becoming the greatest nation on earth the new china the enlightened china chang had turned to a young student next to him to point out a spry elderly woman lost under the spell of taichi when the boys chest exploded and he dropped to the ground the peoples liberation army soldiers had begun firing on the crowd in tiananmen square the tanks came through a moment later driving the people in front of them crushing many beneath the treads the famous televised image of the student stopping the tank with a flower was the rare exception that terrible night chang could never watch taichi without thinking of that moment which solidified his stance as an outspoken dissident and changed his life and that of his father and family forever he now looked down at his wife and next to her the little girl who slept with her arm around the white stuffed cat meimei had sewn for her he gazed at them for a moment then walking into the bathroom he turned the water on full he stripped off his clothes and stepped into the shower resting his head against the tiles that meimei had somehow found the time to scrub last night he showered shut off the scalding water and dried himself with a towel he cocked his head hearing the sounds of clanking metal in the kitchen meimei was still asleep and the boys knew nothing of cooking alarmed he climbed out of bed and pulled the pistol from beneath the mattress and walked cautiously into the main room of the apartment he laughed his father was making tea baba he said ill wake meimei she can do that no no let her sleep the old man said when your mother died i learned to make tea i can cook rice too and vegetables though not very well let us take tea together chang jiechi lifted the iron pot the handle wrapped with a rag and took cups and hobbled into the living room they sat and he poured the tea last night when chang had returned he and his father had taken a map and located the ghosts apartment building which was not to their surprise in chinatown but farther to the west near the hudson river when you get to the ghosts apartment his father now asked how will you get inside wont he recognize you chang sipped the tea i dont think he will no he only came to the hold of the ship once it was dark too how will you get in if there is a doorman ill tell him im there on business and give the name tan i practiced my english all night then ill just take the elevator up to his door and knock on it and if he has bodyguards chang jiechi said theyll search you ill hide the gun in my sock they wont search carefully they wont be expecting me to be armed chang tried to picture what would happen he knew they would have guns too even if they shot him as soon as they saw the gun he would still be able to shoot one or two bullets into the ghost he realized that his father was gazing at him and he looked down i will come back he said firmly i will be here to take care of you baba you are a good son i could not have asked for a better one i have not brought you all the honor i should have yes you have the old man said and poured more tea i named you well changs given name jingerzi meant shrewd son they lifted their cups and chang drained his meimei came to the door glanced at the teacups have you taken rice yet she asked the expression meaning simply good morning it wasnt a reference to food wake william chang told meimei there are some things i want to say to him but his father waved for her to stop no she did why not chang asked he will want to come with you ill tell him no chang jiechi laughed and that will stop him that impetuous son of yours chang fell silent for a moment then said i cant go off like this without talking to him its important but his father asked what is the only reason that a man would do something like you are about to do something foolhardy and dangerous chang replied for the sake of his children his father smiled yes son yes keep that in mind always you do something like this for the sake of your children then he grew stern how well sam chang knew this look of his fathers imperial unyielding he had not seen it for some time ever since the man had grown sick with the cancer i know exactly what you intend to say to your son i will do it its my wish that you dont wake william chang nodded as you say baba he looked at his wristwatch the time was seventhirty he had to be at the ghosts apartment in an hour his father poured him more tea which chang drank down quickly then he said to meimei i have to leave soon but i wish that you come sit by me she sat beside her husband lowering her head to his shoulder they said nothing but after five minutes poyee began to cry and meimei rose to take care of the girl sam chang was content to sit in silence and watch his wife and their new daughter and then it was time to leave and go to his death rhyme smelled cigarette smoke thats disgusting he called what asked sonny li the only other person in the room the chinese cop was groggy and his hair stuck out comically the hour was the cigarettes rhyme explained you should smoke li barked relaxes you good for you mel cooper arrived with lon sellitto and eddie deng not far behind him the young chineseamerican cop walked very slowly even his hair was wilted no stylish spikes today how are you eddie rhyme asked you should see the bruise deng said referring to his runin with a lead slug yesterday during the shootout on canal street i wouldnt let my wife see it put on my pajamas in the bathroom redeyed sellitto carried a handful of pages from the overnight team of officers whod been canvassing recent contractors that had installed gray arnold lustrerite carpet in the past six months the canvassing wasnt even finished and the number of construction locations was discouragingly large thirtytwo separate installations in and around battery park city hell rhyme muttered thirtytwo and each one could have multiple floors that had been carpeted thirtytwo hed hoped thered be no more than five or six ins agent alan coe arrived walking brightly into the lab he didnt seem the least contrite and began asking questions about how the investigation was going as if the shootout yesterday had never happened and the ghost hadnt escaped thanks to him more footsteps in the corridor outside hey sachs said in greeting entering the room she kissed rhyme he started to tell her about the list of recently carpeted buildings but sellitto interrupted get some rest last night he asked her the detectives voice had a definite edge to it what she asked rest sleep you get plenty of rest not exactly she replied cautiously why i tried you at home about one had some questions for you rhyme wondered what the reason for the interrogation was well i got home at two she answered a flare in her eyes i went to see a friend did you yeah i did well i couldnt get in touch with you you know detective she said i can let you have my mothers phone number she can give you some pointers on checking up on me even though she hasnt done it for about fifteen years ho boy that was good said sonny li watch yourself patrolman sellitto said to sachs watch whatshe snapped you got a point to make make it the homicide cop backed down he muttered i couldnt get in touch with you thats all your cell phone was off was it well i had my pager did you try to page me no then she asked the argument mystified rhyme true when she was working rhyme insisted that she be instantly available but after hours it was different amelia sachs was independent she liked to go for fast drives she had interests and friends other than him whatever drove her to scratch her skin to mourn her father to mourn her former lover a cop busted for being one of the most crooked in recent history whatever drove her at the crime scenes the same force drove her off by herself at times just as there were times when he booted her out sometimes asking nicely sometimes ordering her away a crip needs time alone to gather strength to let the aide take care of the piss n shit stuff and to consider little questions like do i want to kill myself today rhyme called the federal building and asked for dellray but he was in brooklyn checking out leads to the attempted bombing last night then he spoke to the assistant special agent in charge and was told that they were meeting that morning about assigning another fbi agent to ghostkill to replace dellray rhyme was angry hed assumed the bureau had already picked an ssa for the team what about spectac the asac replied thats on the scroll for the powwow this morning too the scroll for the powwow well we need people and we need them now rhyme snapped the slick man said were prioritized oh thats fucking reassuring im sorry mr rhyme i missed that i said call us as soon as you know something we need more people just after he disconnected the phone rang again rhyme snapped command answer phone there was a click and a chineseaccented voice asked mr li please li sat down absently pulled out a cigarette which thom swooped by and lifted from his hand li leaned toward the speaker and began to talk rapidly in chinese there was an explosive exchange between him and the caller rhyme thought they were arguing but li finally sat back jotting notes in chinese then he hung up and smiled okay okay li said here i got something that was cai from the tong he ask around about minorities there this group of chinese called uighurs they muslims turks tough guys they got take over by china like tibet and dont like it so good treated bad cai find that ghost hire people from turkestan community and islamic center of queens the guy hongse shot he one of them here address and phone number hey was i right loaban i say he from minority you sure were sonny eddie deng translated the information into english on a second slip of paper should we raid it sellitto asked not yet might tip off the ghost rhyme said ive got a better idea deng was right with him pen register yep these were phone company records of incoming and outgoing calls for a particular number since they didnt record the content of a conversation it was far easier for law enforcers to access these records than to monitor the actual transmissions under a title or state wiretap whats that going to do coe asked the ghost got to town yesterday morning and called the center at some point presumably to arrange for his muscle well check out all incoming and outgoing calls to the number of the place after say am yesterday in a half hour the phone company had provided a list of about thirty numbers into and out of the uighur center in queens in the past two days most of those numbers they could eliminate immediately like those called before the ghost arrived as rhyme had pointed out but four were cell phones with local exchanges and theyre hot phones right the mobiles stolen as bad as the mets second base sellitto said because the phones were stolen this meant there was no billing address where the ghost might be but the cell phone providers were able to give the team information about where the callers were located when each call had been made or received one phone had been in the battery park city area and as the security chief from the company dictated intersections to delineate the cell zone thom drew them on the map the result was a wedge about a half mile square downtown near the hudson river now rhyme shouted to sachs feeling the excitement of narrowing in on his prey did any of the buildings in that area have arnold lustrerite carpet installed crossing my fingers eddie deng said finally sachs looked up from the list and shouted yes got one thats the ghosts safehouse rhyme announced she said a new building eightohfive patrick henry street not far from the river she circled it on the map then she sighed looking over the information from the arnold company hell she muttered they installed carpet on nineteen floors lots of apartments to check then rhyme said impatiently you better get going ghostkill easton long island crime scene two immigrants killed on beach shot in back one immigrant wounded

you are part of the old do you repent the ghost stood at the window of his highrise apartment on patrick henry street in lower manhattan and watched the boats sailing through the harbor fifty meters below him a mile away some streaking fast some bobbing awkwardly some pristine some rusty like the fuzhoudragon part of the old your decadent way of life is disgusting he greatly enjoyed watching the panorama below him he rarely had such views in china once away from beijing and the big cities in fujian and guangdong there were few towering buildings because there were few elevators which was a condition that the ghosts father came close to rectifying in the s his father was a man blessed with the rare combination of careening ambition backed up by sensible schemes the stocky businessman had his hands in many ventures selling military products to the vietnamese who were gearing up to defeat the americans in their appendix of a country to the south operating junkyards lending money building private housing and importing russian machinery the most lucrative of which were lemarov elevators which were cheap functional and rarely killed anyone under the auspices of a fuzhou collective kwan baba the given nickname meaning father had signed contracts to buy thousands of these elevators sell them to the building collectives and bring in russian technicians to install them he had every reason to believe that his efforts would change the skylines of china and make him even wealthier than he was and why wouldnt he succeed he wore conformist unisex suits he attended every ccp rally he possibly could he had guanxi throughout the southeast and his cooperative was one of the most successful in the province of fujian sending a cascade of yuan to beijing but his career was doomed and the reason for this was simple a solid humorless soldierturnedpolitician named mao zedong whose capricious cultural revolution incited students across the country to rise up and destroy the four olds old culture customs ideas and habits the house of the ghosts father in an elegant part of fuzhou was one of the first targets of the rampaging young men who took to the streets practically shivering with idealism on the orders of the great helmsman you are part of the old the leader raged do you repent do you confess to clinging to the old values kwan baba had met them in his living room which had shrunk to the size of a prison cell due to the number of shouting youths surrounding the family and had gazed at them not only in fear but in bewilderment too he honestly hadnt been able to see the evil in what hed done confess and seek reeducation and we will spare you another cried you are guilty of old thought old values old culture you have built a lackeys empire on the backs of the people in fact the students had no idea what kwan baba did for a living or whether the cooperative he headed was based on the purest principles of j p morgan capitalism or marxistleninistmaoist communism they knew only that his house was nicer than theirs and that he could afford to buy art from an abhorred old era art that did nothing to inform the peoples struggle against the oppressive forces of the west kwan and his wife along with the twelveyearold ang and his older brother stood speechless before the seething crowd you are part of the old much of that night was a terrible confused blur to young ang but one part was permanently branded into his memory and he thought of it now standing in his luxurious highrise overlooking the harbor awaiting the changs betrayer the tall student leader of the cadre stood in the middle of the living room wearing blackrimmed glasses lenses slightly askew because theyd been made at one of the local collectives spittle flying from his mouth he engaged in a furious dialectic with young kwan ang who hovered meekly beside the kidneyshaped coffee table on which his father had taught him to use the abacus years before you are part of the old the student raged into the boys face do you repent for emphasis with every line he spoke he swung the thick baton heavy as a cricket bat to the floor between them it landed with a loud thud yes i repent the boy said calmly i ask the people to forgive me you will reform your decadent ways thud yes i will reform my ways he said though he didnt know what decadent meant the old ways are a threat to the collective good of the people you will die if you retain your old beliefs thud then i will reject them thud thud thud so it continued for endless minutes until the blows the student rained down finally stole the life from what the student had been striking with the irontipped baton the ghosts parents who lay bound and gagged on the floor at their feet the boy gave not a single glance at the bloody forms as he recited the catechism the students thirstily sought to hear i repent my ways i reject the old i regret that i have been seduced by unbeneficial and decadent thought he was spared but not his older brother who fled to the gardeners shed and returned with a rake the only weapon the foolish boy could find within minutes the students reduced him to a third bloody pile on the carpet as lifeless as his parents the fervent youngsters took loyal kwan ang with them welcoming the young boy into the heart of the glorious red banner fuzhou youth brigade as they spent the rest of the night ferreting out more of the pernicious old none of the students noticed that the next morning ang slipped away from their impromptu headquarters it seemed that with so much reform to perpetrate none of them even remembered him he however remembered them his short time as an olddespising maoist revolutionary no more than a few hours had been spent quite productively memorizing the names of the youths in the cadre and planning their deaths still he bided his time naixin the boys sense of survival was strong and he escaped into one of his fathers junkyards near fuzhou he lived there for months he would prowl through the huge place hunting rats and dogs for food tracking them through the skeletons of machinery and mounds of trash with a homemade spear and a club a rusty shock absorber from a wrecked russian truck when he grew more confident and learned that the cadres were not searching for him he began making forays into town to steal food from trash bins behind fuzhounese restaurants because of their seafaring history and extensive contact with the rest of the world the fuzhounese have always been among the most independent of chinese teenage kwan ang found that the communist party and the maoist cadres steered clear of the waterfront and docks where snakeheads and smugglers didnt give a shit about downtrodden masses and spouting ideology was a sure way to get yourself killed the boy was informally adopted by several of these men and began running errands for them earning their trust eventually being allowed to head up some of their smaller schemes like thefts from the docks and extorting protection money from businesses in town he killed his first man at thirteen a vietnamese drug dealer who had robbed the snakehead ang was working for and at fourteen he finally tracked down tortured and killed the students whod robbed him of his family young ang was not a fool he looked around him and realized that the thugs he worked with tended to rise only so far largely because of their poor education he knew that he needed to master business accounting and english the coming language of international crime he would sneak into the state schools in fuzhou which were so crowded that the teachers never knew that one of the students was not officially enrolled the boy worked hard amassing money learning which crimes to avoid stealing from the state and importing drugs each of which would assure that you were the headline act at the wellattended tuesday morning executions in the local football stadium and which crimes were acceptable stealing from the foreign businesses that were stumbling obliviously into the chinese market dealing in guns and human smuggling his experience on the waterfronts had given him an expertise in smuggling extortion and money laundering and these were the areas in which he made his money first in fuzhou then in hong kong and expanding throughout china and the far east he made a fetish of staying out of the limelight of never being photographed of going to desperate lengths never to be spotted much less arrested he was thrilled when he learned that some local public security bureau officer had dubbed him gui the ghost he immediately adopted the nickname he was successful because the money itself was not what excited him rather it was the challenge itself to lose was to be shamed to win was glorious the driving force in his life was the hunt in gambling dens for instance he would play only games of skill he was contemptuous of the fools who would pay money for a chance at a wheel of fortune or a lottery challenges like finding the wus and the changs he wasnt displeased with how the hunt was going the ghost had learned from his sources that the wus were in a special safehouse not an ins one but a facility run by the nypd which he never would have expected yusuf had talked to a colleague who would check out the place see what the security was like and perhaps even kill the wus if he had an opportunity as for the changs theyd be dead by nightfall betrayed by their own friend this tan fellow whom the ghost would of course kill after the man revealed the familys address he was also pleased to hear from his source that the police werent having much success tracking him down the fbi side of the case was stalling and most of the case had fallen to the city police department his luck was changing these meditations were interrupted by a knock on the door the betrayer had arrived the ghost nodded toward a uighur who pulled his gun out of his waistband he opened the door slowly pointing his pistol toward the visitor the man in the hallway said i am tan i am here to see the man who is called the ghost kwan is his real name we have a business matter its about the changs come in the ghost said stepping forward do you want some tea no the old man replied hobbling inside looking around i wont be here long chapter thirtytwo with his still eyes beneath drooping lids chang jiechi surveyed the men in the room the ghost himself then two men from some chinese minority uighurs or kazahks like many older han chinese chang jiechi thought of them by the word barbarians the old man continued farther into the room thinking what a journey it had been to come here to this place that would be the site of his death thinking too about his son sam chang who he hoped was still unconscious from the tea chang jiechi had given him generously laced with some of the old mans morphine what is the only reason that a man would do something like you are about to do something foolhardy and dangerous for the sake of his children no father of course would willingly let a son go to his death chang jiechi had decided as soon as sam had returned from chinatown last night that he himself would drug his son and come here in his stead sam had half a life span ahead of him here in the beautiful country he had his sons to raise and now miraculously the daughter that meimei had always wanted here was freedom here was peace here was a chance for success he would not let his son miss out on these things as the drugged tea had taken effect and his sons lids fell heavily and the cup dropped from his hand meimei had risen alarmed but chang jiechi had told her about the morphine and what he intended to do she tried to stop him but she was a woman and she was his daughterinlaw she acquiesced to his wishes chang jiechi had taken the gun and some money and embracing meimei and touching his sons forehead one last time left the apartment with instructions not to wake william under any circumstances hed found a taxi and used the church van map to show the driver where he wished to go now he walked stiffly into the ghosts elegant apartment the barbarian with the gun hovered close and chang jiechi understood that he would have to put the men at ease before he would have a chance to pull out his own pistol and put a bullet into the heart of the snakehead do i know you the ghost asked eyeing him curiously perhaps chang jiechi replied making up something he believed was reasonable and would make the ghost less suspicious im involved in the tongs here in chinatown ah the ghost sipped his tea the barbarian remained nearby looking suspiciously at the old man the other young man dark and brooding sat down in the back of the apartment as soon as the thug that was closest turned his attention away chang jiechi would shoot the ghost sit down old man the ghost said thank you my feet arent well dampness and heat in my bones and you know where the changs are yes how do i know i can trust you chang jiechi laughed regarding trust i think i have more to worry about than you do please he prayed to the spirit of his own father a man gone from this earth for fortysix years and the primary god in chang jiechis pantheon higher even than the buddha father make that man put his gun away and give me five seconds let me save my family give me the chance for one bullet thats all i ask im only three meters away i cannot miss how do you know the changs the ghost asked through a relative in fuzhou you know i wish them harm what reason do you have to betray them i need the money for my son he is not well he needs doctors the ghost shrugged and said to the barbarian search him let me see any papers he has on him no thought chang jiechi in alarm the barbarian stepped forward blocking his view and aim of the ghost chang jiechi held up a hand and stopped the barbarian please i am an old man i deserve your respect dont touch me i will give you my papers myself the barbarian glanced back at the ghost with a raised eyebrow and when he did chang jiechi drew the pistol from his pocket and without hesitation shot the barbarian in the side of the head he dropped hard and lay motionless sprawled on a footstool but the ghost reacted immediately and leapt behind a heavy couch as chang jiechi fired again the bullet snapped through the leather but he had no idea whether or not hed hit the snakehead he turned toward the second barbarian in the back of the apartment but the man had already raised his gun and was aiming it chang jiechi heard a shot and felt a huge fist strike his thigh as the heavy bullet spun him around and he landed on his back on the floor the barbarian hurried toward him the old man might have fired at the man and possibly hit him instead he turned to the couch and repeatedly fired his gun toward where the ghost was hiding then he realized that the weapon had stopped firing he was out of bullets had he hit the ghost oh please guan yin goddess of mercy please but a shadow grew on the wall the ghost rose from behind the couch unhurt his own pistol in his hand breathing heavily he pointed the black muzzle toward chang jiechi and walked around the furniture a glance at the dead barbarian youre changs father yes and youre the devil whos on his way back to hell but not the ghost said on your ticket the other barbarian moaning and whispering hysterically in a language that chang jiechi did not understand hovered over the body of his countryman he then rose and started toward the old man pointing the gun at him no yusuf the ghost said impatiently waving him back hell tell us where the rest of them are never was the defiant response the ghost said to his confederate we dont have much time somebody will have heard the shots well have to leave use the stairs not the elevator have the van waiting by the back door the agitated man continued to stare at chang jiechi with wide eyes hands shaking in rage did you hear me the ghost raged yes then go ill join you in a minute go chang jiechi began to crawl desperately toward the closest doorway which led to a dim bedroom he glanced back the ghost was in the kitchen taking a long filleting knife from a drawer just ahead of amelia sachs driving her beeyellow camaro at seventy miles an hour was the building that contained the ghosts safehouse apartment the structure was huge though many stories tall and wide finding which apartment was the ghosts would be a chore a sharp crackle in her motorola speaker be advised all rmp units in the vicinity of battery park city we have a tenthirtyfour reports of shots fired standby all units further to that tenthirtyfour have a location eightohfive patrick henry street all units in area respond the very building she was now bearing down on the ghosts was it a coincidence she doubted it though what had happened did he have the changs inside the building had he lured them there the families the children she pushed the accelerator farther down and depressed the button of her mike pinned to her windbreaker crime scene five eight eight five to central approaching scene of that tenthirtyfour anything further k nothing further five eight eight five no apartment number k negative k a few seconds later sachss camaro was up on the curb leaving room for the ambulances and other emergency vehicles which would soon be converging on the building as she ran inside minding the slick rosy marble floors she noted that the flower beds near the front door overflowed with mulch which was scattered on the sidewalks undoubtedly the source of the trace that theyd found at the earlier scene there was no security guard or doorman station in the building but several people were standing in the lobby looking uneasily at the elevators sachs asked a middleaged man wearing workout clothing did you report the shots i heard something i dont know where from though anybody sachs asked glancing at the other tenants i think it was west an elderly woman said high up but im not sure where two other responding rmps pulled up out front and the uniformed officers ran inside sellitto li and alan coe were behind them an ambulance appeared and then two emergency services unit trucks we heard the tenthirtyfour sellitto said thiss his building right the ghosts yep sachs confirmed jesus the homicide detective muttered thereve gotta be three hundred units here two hundred seventyfour the elderly woman said sellitto and sachs conferred the name on the apartment directory would be fake of course the only way to find the ghost would be a dangerous doortodoor search crewcut bo haumann strode into the lobby with more esu officers weve sealed all the exits he said sachs nodded what floor she asked the elderly woman i was on nineteen west wing they seemed awfully close a young man in a business suit had joined them no no no he said im sure they were from fifteen south not west you sure haumann asked absolutely i dont think so the woman offered in gentle disagreement they were higher and it was definitely the west wing of the building great haumann muttered well weve gotta move we could have injureds well search everywhere sachss motorola clattered again central to crime scene five eight eight five go ahead central landline patch go ahead k sachs are you there lincoln rhymes voice said yeah go ahead im here with lon and bo and esu listen the criminalist said ive been talking to dispatch and correlating the reports from the people in the building who called nineoneone it looks like the shots came from either the eighteenth or nineteenth floors somewhere in the middle of the west side of the building the speaker was a squawk box not a headset anyone nearby could hear the transmission okay you all hear that haumann asked his officers they nodded were going to sweep rhyme she said ill call you back haumann divided his officers into three teams one for each floor eighteen and nineteen and one to divide up further and sweep the stairwells sachs noticed coe nearby he was checking his own pistol the large glock with which he was a proven bad shot and had sidled over to one of the esu teams she whispered to haumann keep him off the entry hes trouble in a tac situation sachs had some credibility with the head of esu hed seen her under fire and haumann agreed he walked over to coe and spoke with him sachs didnt hear the exchange but since this was an nypd operation haumann mustve pulled jurisdictional rank and ordered the agent to stand down after a moment of heated discussion the ins agents face was nearly as red as his hair but haumann had never lost the will and demeanor of the drill sergeant he had once been and coe soon gave up his futile protests he turned away and stormed out the front door pulling out his cell phone undoubtedly to lodge a protest with peabody or somebody at the federal building the esu head left a small team to guard the lobby then he sachs and a group of officers stepped into one of the elevators and started up to the eighteenth floor they crowded away from the door when it opened and one officer looked out with a metal mirror attached to a wand clear out they stepped moving cautiously along the carpet trying to remain quiet though their equipment rang like mountain climbers haumann gave the hand signals that meant to spread out two officers armed with mp machine guns joined sachs and together they deployed to start the search bracketed by the two large cops machine guns ready sachs picked a door and knocked there was an odd sound from inside a faint clunk as if something heavy was being set down next to the door she glanced at the esu officers who leveled their weapons at the doorway with a satisfying zip of velcro sachs drew her pistol from her holster and stood back slightly another clunk from inside a scraping of metal what the hell was that noise a chain rattled sachs put a few pounds of nervous pressure on the trigger guard of her weapon though not on the trigger itself and tensed as the door opened a tiny grayhaired woman looked up at them youre the police she said youre here about those firecrackers i complained about she stared at the large machine guns the esu officers carried oh well look at this thats right maam sachs said noticing that the clunking sound had been a stool which the woman had apparently set on the floor to be able to look out through the security peephole she grew wary but you wouldnt have those guns if they were just firecrackers right were not sure what they were maam were trying to find out where the sounds came from i think its k up the hall thats why i thought they were firecrackers because an oriental man lives there or asian or whatever youre supposed to say nowadays they use firecrackers in their religion theyre supposed to scare away dragons or maybe its ghosts i dont know are there any other asians on this floor no i dont believe so okay maam thank you could you go back inside and lock your door whatever you hear dont open it oh dear she looked at the men with the guns again and nodded uncertainly could you tell me now please sachs said smiling but in a firm voice she pulled the womans door shut herself she called in a whisper to haumann think its k haumann gave hand signals to his team directing them to the apartment he knocked hard on the door police open the door no response again nothing haumann nodded to the officer whod lugged the teams large battering ram with him he and another cop took hold of the handles on the sides of the thick metal tube and looked at haumann who nodded the officers eased the ram back and then swung it forward hard into the door near the knob the lock gave way immediately and the door slammed inward they dropped the ram chipping the marble floor a halfdozen officers guns to their shoulders raced into the room amelia sachs moved in fast too though behind the others who sported full body armor nomex hoods helmets and visors weapon in hand she paused in the entryway and looked over the luxurious apartment painted in subtle grays and pinks the esu entry team fanned out and checked every room and any possible hiding places a human being might fit into their gruff voices began reverberating through the place clear here clear clear in the kitchen no back entrance clear the ghost was gone but just like at easton beach yesterday hed left death in his stead in the living room was the body of a man who bore a resemblance to the one shed shot outside the wus apartment last night another uighur she assumed hed been shot at close range he lay near a leather couch that had been riddled with bullets a street gun a cheap chrome automatic with the serial number etched out lay on the floor in front of the couch the other body was in the bedroom he was an elderly chinese man lying on his back his eyes glazed there was a bullet wound in his leg but the slug had missed the major arteries and veins it hadnt bled much sachs could see no other wounds even though a long kitchen knife lay near his side she pulled on rubber gloves and felt his jugular no pulse emergency medical services technicians arrived and checked the man over verifying that he was dead whats the cod one of the techs mused sachs studied him then leaned forward ah got it she said nodding at the mans hand in which was clutched a brown bottle sachs worked it out of his fingers the characters on the label were in both chinese and english morphine she said suicide this might have been one of the immigrants on the fuzhou dragon perhaps sam changs father whod come here to kill the ghost she speculated about what had happened the father had shot the uighur but the ghost had jumped for cover behind the couch and the old man had run out of ammunition the ghost took the knife and was going to torture him to learn where the rest of the family was but the immigrant had killed himself haumann listened into his headset and reported that the rest of the building was clear the ghost had escaped oh no she muttered crime scene arrived two techs carrying large metal suitcases into the hallway outside the apartment sachs knew them and nodded a greeting she opened the cases donned the tyvek suit and then announced to the esu team i need to process the room could i have everybody out of here please for a half hour she worked the scene and though she collected some evidence none of it gave an obvious indication of where the ghost might have gone to as she finished the search sachs was aware of cigarette smoke she looked up to see sonny li standing in the doorway surveying the room i know him from boat li said shaking his head with a sadness in his eyes that sam changs father i figured whyd he try it one old man against the ghost and the others for family li said quietly for family i suppose you want to run the scene too she asked without any irony lis correct prediction about jerry tang and his surprise appearance at the wus apartment yesterday had bolstered his credibility as a detective what you think i doing now hongse i walking grid she laughed loaban and me talk last night he tell me about walking grid only i walk grid in my mind now sort of like rhyme does sachs reflected you finding anything good oh plenty im saying she turned back to the more tangible evidence and wrote out the chain of custody cards and packaged the evidence for transport in the corner of the room she noticed a small altar and several statues of chinese gods the words from the woman up the hall echoed in her mind they use firecrackers in their religion theyre supposed to scare away dragons or maybe its ghosts chapter thirtythree dozens of flashing lights surrounded the highrise the ghost turned and looked back at them yusuf the silent turk drove along church street away from the place he was grim and badly shaken from the loss of yet another comrade but he drove calmly and was careful not to draw attention to the stolen windstar van after the old man had killed himself without revealing anything he had nothing in his pockets either the ghost had fled down the stairs and sprinted into the parking lot just as hed heard sirens in front of the building he was now still struggling to catch his breath and to calm his heart the police had arrived too quickly to be responding to the sound of the gunshots theyd known that he was there how gazing absently at the people on the morning streets he considered this the safehouse had absolutely no connection to him finally he decided that they had probably tracked the place down through phone calls to and from the uighur center in queens that had given the police his cell phone number and theyd traced the location of the safehouse probably there was other evidence too his intelligence about this lincoln rhyme suggested that he was fully capable of making a deduction like that but he was troubled that hed gotten no advance warning that the police were on their way there hed thought his guanxi was better than this yusuf said something in his native turkic and the ghost said in english repeat where you go the ghost had several other safehouses in the city but only one nearby he gave him directions then the ghost handed the man another five thousand in onecolor go find somebody else to help us youll do that yusuf hesitated im sorry about your friends the ghost said masking the contempt in his voice with as much faux sympathy as he could add but they were careless youre not careless i need you to help me therell be another ten thousand for you cash to you alone you dont have to split it he nodded okay go find someone else but not at the uighur center dont go back there the police will be watching it and get another cell phone call me on mine and give me your new number he recited the number of his new mobile phone another one hed kept in the highrise and had taken with him along with the money when hed escaped a few minutes before drop me on the corner up there the turk rolled to a stop at canal street not far from where they had nearly killed the wus yesterday the ghost climbed out then leaned down and had the turk reiterate his instructions in english made sure that he remembered the number of the ghosts new cell phone the van sped off the ghost stretched his eyes following a chinese teenager in a tight knit blouse short skirt and implausibly high heels which gave her a stuttering gait he watched her disappear in the crowd he wasnt the only man watching her though the ghost suspected that only he wanted to hurt her very badly before he fucked her turning the opposite way he started down disheveled canal street he still had a long walk to get to his other safehouse it was nearly a kilometer east as he walked he considered what he needed to do foremost was a new gun something big a sig or a glock it seemed this was going to be a neckandneck race to see who got to the changs first he or the police and if it came to a shootout he wanted good firepower he also needed some new clothes a few other things as well the battle was growing more and more challenging he thought of the days of his youth when hed hide from maos cadres in the junkyard patiently stalking rats and vicious dogs for food he thought too of the search for his fathers killers in the youth brigade those times had taught him a lot about the art of hunting and one lesson he learned was this the stronger adversary expects you to seek out and exploit his weakness and he prepares his defense accordingly but the only effective way to prevail against such an enemy is to use his strength against him and this is what the ghost now intended to do naixin he asked himself no the time for patience was over chang meimei set a cup of tea in front of her groggy husband he blinked at the pale green cup but his attention as was that of his wife and sons was wholly on the television set the news story they learned with the translation assistance of william was about two men found dead in lower manhattan one of the men was a chineseturkestan immigrant from queens the other was a sixtynineyearold chinese national believed to have been a passenger on the fuzhoudragon sam chang had wakened from his heavy sleep cottonmouthed and disoriented a half hour ago hed tried to stand but fell crashing to the floor bringing the children and his wife running as soon as he noticed the gun was gone hed understood what his father had done and stumbled toward the door but meimei had stopped him its too late shed said no hed cried falling back onto the couch hed turned to her his loss and sorrow tipped him into fury and he raged at her you helped him didnt you you knew what he was going to do the woman holding poyees toy kitten looked down at it she said nothing chang had made a fist and drawn back to strike her meimei had squinted and turned away anticipating the blow william shifted from one foot to the other ronald cried but then chang had lowered his hand thinking ive taught her and my children to respect their elders my father most of all chang jiechi would have ordered her to help him and she would have obeyed as the pernicious effects of the powerful medicine had worn off chang had then sat for a time racked by worry hoping for the best but the television report confirmed that the worst had come to be the turkestan had been shot to death the reporter explained by the elderly man who had then died of an overdose of morphine apparently a suicide the apartment was believed to have been a hideout for kwan ang the human smuggler wanted in connection with the sinking of the fuzhou dragon early yesterday kwan had escaped before the police arrived and was still at large ronald continued to cry and looked back and forth from the tv to his mother then his father yeye he said yeye sitting crosslegged rocking back and forth anxiously william bitterly spat out the translation of the pretty newscasters words by coincidence the reporter was chineseamerican the story concluded and as if the televised confirmation of chang jiechis death signaled the moment meimei rose and went into the bedroom she returned with a sheet of paper she handed it to her husband then hefted poyee onto her hip and wiped the girls face and hands numb sam chang took the folded piece of paper and opened it the letter had been written in pencil not a brush charged with rich ink but the characters were beautifully drawn a true artist the old man had taught his son can excel in any medium no matter how base my son my life has been full beyond my hopes i am old and i am sick seeking a year or two more of life on earth gives me no comfort rather i find solace in my duty to return to the soul of nature at the hour inscribed for me in the register of the living and the dead and that moment is now i could say many things to you summarize for you all the lessons of my life all that i have learned from my father and from your mother and from you son as well but i choose not to do so truth is unwavering but the path to truth is often a maze that we each must struggle to find on our own i have planted healthy bamboo and it has grown well continue your journey away from the earth and toward the light and nurture your own young crops be vigilant as any farmer but give them space i have seen the stock of the plant they will grow straight your father sam chang was seized with bottomless anger he rose fast from the couch and groggy from the drug struggled to stay upright he flung the teacup against the wall and it shattered ronald shied away from his enraged father i am going to kill him he screamed the ghost is going to die his tirade started the baby crying meimei whispered something to her sons william hesitated but then nodded toward ronald who hefted poyee together they walked into the bedroom the door closed chang said to her i found him once and im going to find him again this time no meimei said firmly he turned to face his wife what she swallowed and looked down you will not dont speak to me like that youre my wife yes she said to him her voice quavering i am your wife and im the mother of your children and what will happen to us if you die have you thought about that wed live on the street wed be deported do you know what life in china would be like for us when we returned a widow of a dissident with no property no money is that what you want for us my father is dead chang raged the man responsible for that has to die no he doesnt she replied breathlessly working up her courage once again your father was an old man he was sick he was not the center of our universe and we must move on how can you say that chang raged shocked at her impudence hes the reason i exist he lived a full life and now hes gone you live in the past jingerzi our parents deserve our respect yes but nothing more than that he realized that shed used his chinese given name he didnt think shed done so in years not since theyd been married when she addressed him she always used the respectful zhangfu husband in a steadier voice now meimei said you wont avenge his death youll stay here with us in hiding until the ghost is captured or killed then you and william will go to work at joseph tans printing company and ill stay here and teach ronald and poyee well all study english well make money and when theres another amnesty well become citizens she paused for a moment and wiped her face from which tears streamed i loved him too you know its my loss as well as yours she resumed cleaning up chang fell onto the couch and sat for a long time in silence staring at the shabby red and black carpet on the floor then he walked to the bedroom william holding poyee stared out the window chang began to speak to him but changed his mind and silently motioned his younger son out the boy warily stepped into the living room and followed his father to the couch they both sat after a moment chang composed himself he asked ronald son do you know the warriors of qin shi huang yes baba these were thousands of fullsize terracotta statues of soldiers charioteers and horses built near xian by chinas first emperor in the third century bc and placed in his tomb the army was to accompany him to the afterlife were going to do the same for yeye he nearly choked on his sorrow were going to send some things to heaven so your grandfather will have them with him what ronald asked things that were important to him when he was alive we lost everything on the ship so well draw pictures of them will that work the boy asked frowning yes but i need you to help me ronald nodded take some paper there and that pencil he nodded toward the table why dont you draw a picture of his favorite brushes the wolfhair and the goat and his ink stick and well you remember what they looked like ronald took the pencil in his small hand he bent over the paper began his task and a bottle of the rice wine he liked meimei suggested and a pig the boy asked pig chang asked he liked pork rice remember then chang was aware of someone behind him and he turned to see william looking down at his brothers drawing somberfaced the teenager said when grandmother died we burned money it was a tradition at chinese funerals to burn slips of paper printed to look like millionyuan notes issued by the bank of hell so that the deceased would have money to spend in the afterworld maybe i can draw some yuan william said chang was swept with emotion at his words but he didnt embrace the boy as he wanted desperately to do he said simply thank you son the lean boy crouched down beside his brother and began to draw the bills when the children had finished their drawings chang led his family outside into the backyard of their new home and as if this were chang jiechis actual funeral he set two burning incense sticks in the ground to mark the spot where the body would have lain and then setting afire the pictures the sons had drawn they watched the smoke disappear into the gray sky and the ash melt into black curls chapter thirtyfour somebody made another move on the wus sellitto said glancing up at rhyme from his cell phone what sachs asked astonished in our murray hill safehouse rhyme wheeled around to face the detective who said darkcomplected man slight build wearing gloves was spotted on one of the security cameras in the alleyway he was checking out one of the rear windows coincidence you think sonny li laughed bitterly with ghost there not coincidences with a concurring nod rhyme asked what happened two of our people went after him but he got away the criminalist then asked how the hell did the ghost find out where they were whod know sellitto asked sachs considered this after the shootout on canal street one of his bangshous couldve followed me to the clinic then followed the wus to the safehouse hard to do but possible she walked to the whiteboard and tapped an entry or how bout this ghost is reported to have govt people on payroll a spy you thinking sellitto asked she said nobody at the bureau knew we sent them to murray hill dellray had left by the time i thought of it that leaves somebody at the ins or nypd well sellitto said we damn well cant keep the wus there anymore ill call the us marshals and have them taken to a witness protection facility upstate he looked at the team around him and that information doesnt leave this room he placed the call and arranged to have the wus transported in a bulletproof van rhyme was growing impatient somebody check with the bureau where the hell is dellrays replacement eddie make the call deng got in touch with the bureaus asac it turned out that thered been some delay with the magical powwow that was supposed to result in additional agents to work ghostkill they said everythingll be in place this afternoon whats everything rhyme asked caustically and what fucking place does it have to be in before we get the agents dont they know theres a killer out there you want to call them back he snapped no i want to look at the evidence sachss search of the crime scene at the ghosts safehouse on patrick henry street had mixed results one discouraging fact was that the cell phone that had been instrumental in tracking down the ghost had been abandoned in the highrise had he still been using it they might have been able to trace him moreover the fact hed left it meant that hed probably figured out that this was how theyd found him and would now be far more careful when calling on mobiles unlike the shooter killed on canal street the uighur in the safehouse did have some identification on him a drivers license and a card with the address of the turkestan cultural center in queens but bedding and saul and a team of tactical agents were at the center now and the head of the organization had said only that hed heard that some unidentified chinese man had hired a few people in the neighborhood to move furniture he didnt know anything else they would continue to lean on him the twins assured but their assessment was that hed rather go to jail than dime out the ghost the name on the lease of the ghosts apartment didnt help either harry lee his social security number and references were fake and the certified rental check came from a bank in the caribbean lee was the equivalent of smith in english deng reported the body of the old man found dead from the morphine overdose though did reveal some clues hed carried in his wallet an id card very blurred from the seawater that identified him as chang jiechi they also found a very old scrap of paper hidden behind the id deng smiled sadly look at that its an autograph from chiang kaishek the nationalist leader the inscription thanked chang jiechi for his efforts to resist the communists and keep the chinese people free from dictatorship rhymes gaze then slipped to the row of pictures below the ones of the old mans corpse they were closeups of his hands the criminalist moved his own finger slightly and eased the storm arrow up to the board look at that he said his hands i shot them because of the blotches sachs said chang jiechis fingers and palms were covered with blueblack stains paint or ink clearly not the purple shade of postmortem lividity which in any case wouldntve occurred so soon after death the fingers rhyme called look at the fingers she squinted and walked close indentations she pulled the printout of sam changs fingerprints off the wall and held it close to that of the fathers hand the palms and digits were different sizes and the old mans were far more wrinkled but the indentations rhyme had spotted on sam changs fingers and thumb were similar to the lines clearly evident on his fathers theyd assumed that the marks on sam changs fingers were from an injury of some kind but clearly that wasnt the case whats it mean mel cooper asked genetic no cant be rhyme said his eyes scanning the picture of the old mans hand he closed his eyes for a moment and let his mind fly like one of the peregrine falcons lifting off from its bedroom window perch ink on his hands indentations then his head jerked back in the chair and he looked at sachs theyre painters father and sonre both artists remember the logo of the home store on the van one of them painted it no li said looking at the photo not painters calligraphers calligraphy in china lots important hold brush like this he grabbed a pen and held it perfectly vertical gripped firmly in a triangle formed by the thumb and his first two fingers when he released it and held his hand up the red indentations in his fingers and thumb were identical to those in the hands of chang and his father li continued calligraphy considered art in china but during proletarian revolution artists persecuted bad lots calligraphers got jobs printing and sign painting doing useful things good for society on boat chang tell us he dissident and got fired from teaching job nobody hire him at schools make sense for him do printing sign painting and at the clinic wu said that chang had a job here lined up already sachs reminded we know the changsre in queens rhyme said lets get as many chinesespeaking officers from the fifth precinct as we can to start calling quickprint printing or signpainting companies thatve just hired somebody illegal alan coe laughed apparently at rhymes naiveté theyre not going to cooperate no guanxi heres some fucking guanxi rhyme snapped tell them if they lie about it and we find out the ins is going to raid their shop and if the changs are killed well book them for accessory to murder now you think like chinese cop sonny li said with a laugh using historically unprecedented peoples ox prod deng pulled out his cell phone and made a call to his headquarters mel cooper had run some of the trace from the safehouse on patrick henry street through the gas chromatograph he studied the results something interesting here he glanced at the bag that sachs had marked with a felttip pen it was on changs fathers shoes nitrates potassium carbon sodium biosolids in significant amounts too this caught rhymes attention biosolid was a term undoubtedly invented by some public relations expert who was clever enough to know that the marketing potential of the product would be severely limited if the stuff was sold under its real name processed human shit the fourteen waste treatment plants in new york city produced more than a thousand tons of biosolids a day and sold it throughout the country as fertilizer for there to be significant amounts on the victims shoes meant that the changs were probably living quite close to one of the plants can we search house by house near the treatment plants sellitto asked rhyme shook his head there were a number of treatment plants in queens and given the fickle winds in the new york city area the changs could be living in a several block radius around any of them without narrowing the search down further by finding the print shop where sam chang would be working say a doortodoor search would take forever the rest of the evidence didnt help much the morphine that the man had killed himself with had come from a clinic in china and therefore was of no use to them forensically morphine can kill you sellitto asked the rumor is thats how the writer jack london killed himself pointed out lincoln rhyme whose knowledge of suicide techniques was as extensive as his command of historical criminal trivia besides in the right dosage anything can kill you sachs then added that the old man had no subway transfers or other receipts on him to suggest where he mightve come from but rhyme was soon reminded amelia sachs was not the only cop to have run the crime scene in the ghosts highrise sonny li said hey loaban i found things too when i search ghosts place you want to hear go ahead got some good stuff im saying okay there a statue of the buddha across from door facing it no stereos or red color in his bedroom hallway painted white bookcases had doors on them had statue of eight horses all mirrors very tall so they not cut off part of head when you look in them had brass bells with wooden handles he keep them in western part of room he nodded at the apparent significance of this figure it out loaban no rhyme snapped keep going li patted his shirt for his cigarettes then let his arms fall to his side over my desk at security bureau office in liu guoyuan i got sign another expression ju yi fan san it mean learning three things from one example from confucius saying if i show man corner of object and he not able to figure out what other three corners look like then i not bother to teach him again not a bad motto for a forensic detective rhyme reflected and you deduced something helpful something we can use from a statue of eight horses and brass bells feng shui im saying arranging furniture and things for good luck thom said when rhyme glanced at him he added it was on a show on the home and garden channel dont worry i watched it on my own time impatient rhyme said so he lives in a goodluck apartment li whats the evidentiary point hey congratulations sonny thom said you got the lastname treatment he saves that for his really good friends note that im only thom speaking of which thom i believe youre here merely to write not to editorialize the point loaban pretty clear to me li continued the ghost hire somebody to arrange his room and guy he hire do fuck good job know his stuff maybe know other places the ghost has apartments okay rhyme said thats useful i go check feng shui men in chinatown what you think rhyme caught sachss eye and they laughed i need to write a new criminalistics textbook this time ill add a woowoo chapter hey know what our leader deng xiaoping say he say it not matter if cat black or white so long as it catches mouse well go catch yourself a mouse li then come on back here i need some more baijiu oh and sonny the chinese cop glanced at him zaijian rhyme carefully pronounced the word hed learned on a chinese language translation website li nodded goodbye yes yes you even pronounce good loaban zaijian the chinese cop left and they returned to the evidence but the team made no headway and an hour went by without any word from the officers who were canvassing the quickprint shops in queens rhyme stretched his head back into the pillow he and sachs gazed at the charts rhyme feeling a toofamiliar sensation the desperate hope that evidence long picked over would yield just one more nugget even though you knew there was nothing else for it to reveal should i talk to the wus again or john sung she asked we dont need more witnesses rhyme murmured we need more evidence i need something concrete more goddamn evidence they needed then his head swiveled fast toward the map the original one of long island he looked at the tiny red dot about a mile off the coast of orient point what sachs asked seeing him squint goddamn he whispered what we have another crime scene and i forgot all about it what the ship

because of the water sachs said although submersion in water may destroy or degrade certain types of evidence such as watersoluble chemicals other forms of physical evidence even trace may be preserved and readily discovered depending on the currents and the depth and temperature of the water indeed some may be better preserved than had the scene been on dry land howd i do rhyme good sachs im impressed the passage was from rhymes textbook on criminalistics somebody call the coast guard patch me through to whoevers in charge of the rescue out there sellitto finally got through and put the call on speakerphone this is fred ransom speaking im captain of the evan brigant the man was shouting the wind whistled loudly over the mouthpiece of his radio mike this is detective sellitto nypd i talked to you before right sir i recall im here with lincoln rhyme where are you now just above the dragon were still looking for survivors but havent had any luck rhyme asked whats the status of the ship captain shes on her starboard side about eighty ninety feet down whats the weather like now lot bettern it was tenfoot seas wind about thirty knots light rain visibility probably two hundred yards you have divers available who can check out the interior rhyme asked yessir can they dive in that weather conditions arent the best but theyre acceptable you know sir weve already scanned for survivors negative on that no im talking about searching for evidence i see we could send some folks down the thing is though that my diversve never done that theyre s and r search and rescue rhyme recalled the captain asked could somebody walk them through what to do sure rhyme said though he was discouraged at the idea of explaining a lifetime of crime scene investigation to a novice then amelia sachss voice interrupted ill search it rhyme said im talking about the ship itself sachs i understand that its ninety feet underwater she bent down and said into the speakerphone captain i can be down in battery park in thirty minutes can you have a chopper get me out to your location well we can fly in this weather but im openwater certified padi meaning she had been trained in scuba diving by the professional association of diving instructors rhyme knew that she and her former boyfriend nick had taken the course together and gone on a number of dives not surprisingly though speedlover sachs had found cigarette boats and jet skiing more to her liking but you havent been diving for years sachs he pointed out like riding a bike miss thatd be officer sachs captain she said officer theres a big difference between recreational dives and what its like down there today my peopleve been diving for years and i wouldnt feel real comfortable sending them into an unstable wreck under these conditions sachs rhyme said you cant youre not trained for that therere a million things theyd miss you know that theyd be the same as civilians all respect captain understood officer but my vote is its too risky sachs paused and then said captain you have children im sorry you have a family well he said yes i do this perp were after is the man who sank that ship and killed most of the people inside and right now hes trying to kill some immigrants who escaped a family with two children and a baby im not going to let that happen there may be some evidence inside that ship that could tell us where he is my expertise is finding clues under all conditions sellitto said use our divers both the nypd and the citys fire department had experienced scuba divers theyre not crime scene sachs argued theyre just s and r too she looked at rhyme who hesitated for a long moment but then nodded indicating that yes hed back her up will you help us out here captain rhyme asked she needs to be the one who goes down through the wind the captain said okay officer but tell you what well set the chopper down at the hudson river helipad thatll save some time its closer than battery park you know it sure she said then added one thing though captain yesm on a lot of those dives i did in the caribbean right afterward when we were sailing home the crew made rum punch for everybody it was included in the cost of the dive you have anything like that on coast guard cutters you know officer i think we may be able to rustle something up for you ill be at the pad in fifteen minutes they hung up and sachs glanced at rhyme ill call you with what i find there was so much he wanted to say to her and yet so little he was able to he settled for search well but watch my back she stroked his right hand the one whose fingers couldnt feel any sensation whatsoever not yet at any rate maybe after the surgery he glanced at the ceiling toward his bedroom where the god of detectives guan di presently sat with his evaporating cup of sweet wine but lincoln rhyme of course restrained himself from sending a prayer to a folk deity wishing sachs a safe journey and sent that message directly though tacitly to her learning three things from one example confucius hm i like that thought lincoln rhyme he said to his aide i need something from the basement what a copy of my book im not sure where they are thom replied then you better start looking dont you think with a loud sigh the aide vanished rhyme was referring to a hardcover book that hed written several years ago the scenes of the crime in it hed examined fiftyone old crime scenes in new york city some solved some not the book included a cross section of the more notorious crimes in the city ranging from mayhem in the five points section of town considered in the mids one of the most dangerous places on earth to architect stanford whites love triangle murder in the original madison square garden to joey gallos unfortunate last meal at a little italy clam house to john lennons death the illustrated book had been popular though not popular enough to keep it from being remaindered the surplus copies had been sloughed off to bargain books shelves in bookstores around the country for discounted sales still rhyme was secretly proud of the book it was his first tentative venture back into the real world after his accident an emblem that despite what had happened to him he was capable of doing something beyond lying on his ass and bitching about his state thom returned ten minutes later his shirt streaked with dirt and his handsome face dotted with sweat and dust they were in the farthest corner under a dozen cartons im a mess well id think if things were better organized down there it mightve taken less work rhyme muttered eyes on the book maybe if you hadnt said to pack them away you never wanted to see them again you hated the quote fucking things it might not have taken so much work either say is the cover torn no the covers fine let me see rhyme ordered hold it up the weary aide brushed some dirt off his slacks and then offered the book for inspection itll do the criminalist said he looked around the room uneasily his temples were pounding which meant his heart which he couldnt feel was pumping blood hard what lincoln that touchpad do we still have it a few months ago rhyme had ordered a touchpad attachment for the computer like a mouse thinking that he could use his extant finger his left ring finger to control the computer he hadnt shared with thom or sachs how important it had been for him to make the pad work but he hadnt been able to the range of motion for the digit was too limited to move the cursor in any helpful way unlike the touchpad controller that operated his storm arrow which was specifically made for people in his condition the failure had for some reason devastated him thom left the room for a moment and returned with the small gray unit he hooked up the system and placed it under rhymes ring finger what are you going to do with it thom asked rhyme grumbled just hold it still all right command cursor down command cursor stop command double click a drawing program popped up on the screen command line draw surprised thom asked when did you learn that quiet i need to concentrate rhyme took a deep breath and then he started to move his finger on the pad a shaky line appeared on the screen sweat popped out on his forehead from the tension breathing hard riddled with anxiety as if he were dismantling a bomb rhyme said through clenched teeth move the pad to the left thom carefully the aide did and rhyme continued giving him directions ten minutes of agony ten minutes of exhausting effort he gazed at the screen finally satisfied with the result he rested his head on the back of the chair command print thom walked to the printer you want to see your handiwork of course i want to see it rhyme barked thom picked up the sheet and held it in front of rhyme to my friend sonny li from lincoln i think thats the first thing youve written since the accident in your actual handwriting its a goddamn schoolchilds scrawl rhyme muttered feeling exhilarated at the accomplishment hardly legible you want me to paste that in the book thom asked if you would yes thank you rhyme said then set it aside and well give it to li when he gets back ill wrap it up the aide said i dont think we need to go that far rhyme snapped now lets get back to the evidence chapter thirtysix okay i can do this amelia sachs stood on the rippled metal floor of the coast guards sikorsky hhj helicopter fifty feet above the whipping antenna of the cutter evan brigant and let the crewman fit the harness around her it had never occurred to her when shed requested the helicopter ride out to the ship that the only way to get onto the ship would be by winching down to a bobbing deck well what did she expect she now reflected an escalator the chopper pitched in the fierce wind and beneath them through the mist she could see the gray water breaking around the cutter in ragged white ridges encased in an orange vest and battered helmet sachs gripped the handhold near the open doorway and thought again okay i can do this the crewman shouted something she didnt hear and she shouted back for him to repeat it a request he apparently didnt hear for he took her words to be an acknowledgment then a hook was attached to the harness and the rig doublechecked the crewman shouted something else sachs pointed to herself then out the door and received a thumbsup okay i can do this her essential fear was claustrophobia not heights but still then out she went holding the cable even though she thought shed been told not to she swung wildly from the momentum of stepping out the door in a moment the motion slowed and she started down buffeted by the wind and the powerful downdraft from the rotor blades down down a shroud of fog suddenly enveloped her and she was disoriented she found herself hanging in space not able to see either the chopper above or the ship below rain spattered her face and she was blinded vertigo consumed her and she couldnt tell if she was swinging like an outofcontrol pendulum or dropping toward the ship at a hundred miles an hour oh rhyme but then the cutter grew visible beneath her the evan brigant bobbed up and down and rocked but whoever was at the helm held the vessel perfectly in position despite waves that were so huge that they seemed fake something created by a specialeffects team for a movie her feet touched the deck but just as she hit the quickrelease button on the harness the ship dropped to the bottom of a wave and she fell four feet to the deck hitting hard her arthritic legs screaming in pain as two seamen ran to help her up she reflected that this was probably what the crewman on the chopper had been warning her about boating is not a sport for arthritics sachs recalled she had to flex her knees continually for stability as she made her way to the bridge she had an imaginary conversation with dr john sung reporting to him that chinese medicine had yet to score serious points over percoset and antiinflammatories on the bridge the improbably younglooking captain fred ransom greeted her with a smile and a handshake he welcomed her to the ship and led her to the chart table now heres a picture of the vessel and where shes lying sachs concentrated on the image of the ship ransom told her where the bridge was and where the cabins were located on the same deck but down a lengthy corridor toward the stern now one thing officer just to warn you he said delicately we understand there are about fifteen bodies inside and therell be some sealife activity regarding them it could be pretty grim some of my crew have sort of a tough time but his voice faded as he looked into her eyes sachs said appreciate the warning captain but i do run crime scenes for a living sure officer understood all right lets get you into your gear another trek outside into the rain and wind they made their way to the stern of the ship in a small shed open to the rear she was introduced to two other officers a man and a woman both wearing yellow and black wet suits and boots they were the chief dive officer on board the ship and his second in command understand you did padi the man asked how many dives id guess twentyfive or so this relieved them somewhat and the last time was make it a few years this response had the opposite effect well were going to walk you through all the steps again the male officer said like youre a novice i was hoping you would your deepest the woman dive officer asked eighty feet thats about the same as here the only difference is that itll be murkier the currentsre stirring up the bottom the water wasnt that cold they explained still retaining much of the summers heat but to be under for any length of time would deplete her body heat quickly and so she needed to wear a wetsuit which insulated her not only with the rubber but as the name suggested a thin layer of water between her skin and the shell of the suit behind a screen she stripped and then struggled to put the suit on are you sure this isnt a childs size she called gasping from the effort of pulling the tight rubber over her hips and shoulders we hear that a lot the woman dive officer responded then they suited her up with the rest of the equipment weights mask and the air tank attached to the bcd buoyancy control device a vest that you inflated or deflated with a control near your left hand which made you rise or sink in the water also attached to the air tank was a primary regulator the one that shed breathe through and then a secondary one nicknamed the octopus that could be used by a fellow diver to breathe off her tank if the buddys air supply was cut off they also fitted a headmounted spotlight to her hood they ran through the basic hand signals for communicating with dive partners a lot of information important information and she struggled to keep it in her mind how bout a knife she asked youve got one the dive chief said pointing to her bcd she drew the weapon only to find that it didnt have a point youre not going to be stabbing anything the woman said seeing sachss concern only cutting you know wire or something that entangles you thinking more about sharks actually she said rarely see sharks in these waters hardly ever the other officer echoed not big ones anyway ill take your word for it sachs said replacing the knife wasnt the movie jaws set here the dive chief handed sachs a large mesh bag for stowing any evidence she found into these she placed what shed brought for evidence collection plastic bags then he and his assistant donned their equipment and carrying their flippers all three walked unsteadily to the very stern of the heaving ship shouting over the noise of the wind the dive chief said too choppy to go off the deck well get into the raft put our flippers on and then fall backward into the water hold your mask and regulator to your face other hand on your weightbelt release she tapped the top of her head the hand signal for okay he did the same they climbed into the yellow raft which was already in the water and reared up and down like a bucking horse they sat on the side and checked their equipment twenty feet away was an orange buoy the dive chief pointed to it and said theres a line from there that goes straight down to the vessel well swim over to that and follow the line down whats your plan for the search she called back i want to get samples of the explosion residue from the hull and then search the bridge and cabins the other divers nodded i do the inside alone this was a breach of the fundamental scuba rule that you be able to swim to your buddy on one breath the dive chief frowned youre sure have to okay he said uneasily then he continued now sounds dont work well underwater hard to tell where theyre coming from but if youre in trouble bang on your tank with the knife and well search for you he held up her spg submersible pressure gauge which showed how much air was in her tank youve got three thousand pounds of air youll burn it fast because youre going to be pumped up on adrenaline we leave the bottom with five hundred no less than that thats an ironclad rule no exceptions we come up slow no faster than the bubbles from our regulator and we pause for three minutes fifteen feet down otherwise sachs knew there was a risk of decompression sickness the bends oh and whats the most important rule in scuba sachs remembered it from her course years ago dont ever hold your breath underwater good why otherwise your lungs could explode then they started her air and she pulled on her fins then mask gripped the regulator fiercely in her teeth the dive chief gave the other okay sign middle finger and thumb in a circle and she responded the same way she pumped some air into her bcd to allow her to float on the surface they gestured for her to roll backward she gripped the mask and regulator so they wouldnt be torn off by the entry and she held her weightbelt release so that if her buoyancy device failed and she dropped toward the bottom she could dump the weights and swim to the surface okay rhyme heres one for guinness the record for searching the most submerged crime scene one two three backward into the churning water by the time she righted herself the others were in the water beside her and gesturing toward the buoy in a few minutes theyd swum to it okay signs all around then a thumbsdown which meant descend then they took their bcd control in their left hand and deflated the vests immediately noise became silence motion became stillness heavy became weightless and they drifted downward placidly along the thick rope toward the bottom for a moment sachs was struck by the absolute peace of life underwater then the serenity was broken as she looked below her and saw the dim outline of the fuzhoudragon the image was more unsettling than shed expected the ship on her side a black gash in the hull from the explosion the rust the peeling paint the encrusting barnacles on the plates dark and jagged and foreboding and containing the bodies of so many innocent people a coffin she thought with a clenched heart its a huge metal coffin sharp pain in her ears she pinched her nose through the soft plastic portion of the mask and blew to equalize the pressure they continued downward as they got closer to the ship she began to hear the noises grating and moaning as the ships thick metal plates scraped on the rocks hate that noise hate it hate it it sounded like a huge creature dying her escorts were diligent theyd stop the descent occasionally and check on her okay signs were exchanged and they continued downward at the bottom she looked up and found that the surface didnt seem as far away as shed expected though she recalled that water has the effect of acting like a lens and magnifying everything a glance at her depth gauge ninety feet a ninestory building then a glance at her pressure gauge jesus shed already used pounds of air on the effortless descent amelia sachs pumped air into the bcd to neutralize her buoyancy so that she floated level she first pointed toward the gash in the hull and together the threesome swam toward it despite the pitching surface above them the currents here were gentle and they could move easily at the site of the explosion sachs used her blunt knife to scrape residue from the outwardly curled metal she placed some of the black ashy material into a plastic bag sealed it and put that in the mesh collection bag she looked at the dark windows of the bridge forty feet away okay rhyme here we go they swam toward it and the pressure gauge gave her its emotionless message pounds at they left the bottom no exceptions because the ship was on its side the bridge door now opened upward toward the surface it was metal and very heavy the two coast guard officers struggled to lift it and sachs swam through the opening and down into the bridge they lowered the door into the closed position it clanked shut with a chilling boom and sachs realized that she was now trapped inside the ship without her companions she probably couldnt open the door herself forget it she told herself reached up to the light mounted on her wetsuit hood and clicked it on the beam offered her faint comfort she turned and swam away from the bridge down a dark corridor that led to the cabins faint motion too from the dimness coming from what fish eels squid i dont like this rhyme but then she thought about the ghost searching for the changs about the baby poyee the treasured child think about that not about the darkness or confinement do this for her for poyee amelia sachs swam forward she was in hell no other word described it the black hallway was filled with sooty debris and refuse scraps of cloth paper food fish with piercing yellow eyes and overhead a shimmering like ice the thin layer of air trapped above her the sounds were harrowing the scraping and groaning moans squeals like human voices in agony pings and snaps the clank of metal on metal a fish gray and sleek darted past she gasped involuntarily at the motion and turned her head to follow it she found herself looking at two dull human eyes in a white lifeless face sachs screamed through her regulator and jerked back the body of a man barefoot his arms above his head like a perp surrendering floated nearby his legs were frozen in the position of a runners and as the fish sped past the small wake turned him slowly away from her clank clank no she thought i cant do this already the walls were closing in on her plagued all her life by claustrophobia sachs couldnt stop thinking of what would happen if she got caught in one of these tiny passages shed go mad two deep breaths of dry air through the regulator she thought of the chang family she thought of the toddler and she swam on the gauge pounds of pressure were doing fine keep going clank that damn noise like doors closing sealing her shut well ignore it she told herself nobodys closing any doors the rooms above her on the side of the dragon facing the surface were not she deduced the ghosts two didnt appear to have been occupied on the voyage and one was the captains in this one she found seafaring memorabilia and pictures of the bald mustachioed man she recognized as captain sen from the pictures tacked up on lincoln rhymes wall clank clank clank she swam downward to check out the rooms on the other side of the narrow corridor facing the bottom as she did her tank caught on a fire extinguisher mounted to the wall and she froze in position trapped in the narrow corridor she was seized with a flash of panic its okay sachs lincoln rhymes voice said to her in that deep lulling voice he always fell into when speaking to her through her headset at crime scenes its okay she controlled the panic and backed up freeing herself the gauge told her pounds three of the cabins below her hadnt been occupied that left only one more it had to be the ghosts a huge groan more clanks then a moaning so loud she actually felt it in her chest what was happening the whole ship was buckling the doors would be jammed shed be trapped here forever suffocating slowly dying alone oh rhyme but then the moaning stopped replaced by more clanking she paused at the entrance to the ghosts cabin below her feet the door was closed it opened inward well downward she gripped the knob and twisted the latch released and the heavy wooden door eased downward looking beneath her into the darkness things were swimming around inside the room jesus she shivered and remained where she was hovering in the narrow corridor but lincoln rhymes voice as clear as if hed been speaking through her headphones sounded in her thoughts its a crime scene sachs thats all it is and searching crime scenes is what we do remember you grid it you search it you observe it you collect evidence okay rhyme but i could live without eels she let some air out of the bcd and dropped slowly into the room two sights made her gasp in front of her a man floated in the black space eyes closed his jaw down as far as it could go arms outstretched his coat billowing out behind him his face was white as paper the second thing she saw was less macabre but far stranger what must have been a thousand hundreddollar bills floated in the water filling the room like flakes in a plastic souvenir snow globe the bills explained the mans death his pockets were filled with money and she deduced that as the ship started to go down hed run to the cabin to get as much of the ghosts cash as he could but hed been trapped here she eased farther into the room the bills swirling in her wake the money soon proved to be a major pain in the ass it stuck to her it obscured the scene like smoke add this to your book rhyme excessive money at the crime scene can make searches extremely difficult she couldnt see more than a few feet past the cloud of bills she grabbed several handfuls of the money for evidence and put them in her collection bag kicking her way to what was now the top of the room originally the side she noticed an open attaché case floating in the thin air pocket she found more currency inside chinese it seemed a handful of these bills went into the collection bag clank clank jesus this is spooky darkness around her unseen things caressing the wetsuit she could see only a few feet in front of her the tunnel of dim illumination cast by the tiny spotlight on her head she then located two weapons an uzi machine pistol and a beretta mm she examined them closely and found that the uzis serial number had been etched out she let this weapon drop to the bottom there was a number on the beretta though which meant it might yield some traceable connection to the ghost she slipped it into her evidence bag a glance at her pressure gauge pounds of air god she was going through it fast breathe slowly come on sachs concentrate right sorry rhyme clank clank clank i hate that fucking sound she searched the body of the corpse no wallet or id another shiver why was this scene so horrible so eerie shed processed dozens of bodies but then she realized the corpses at those scenes had always lain like broken toys on the ground pulled inanimate to the concrete or grass or carpet by gravity they werent real but this man wasnt still at all as cold as the heartless water around him white as snow he moved like an elegant dancer in slow motion the stateroom was very small and the body would interfere with her search so with a respect that she wouldnt have felt anywhere outside of this horrible mausoleum she eased the body upward into the corridor and pushed him away then she returned to the ghosts cabin clank clank clank ignoring the spooky moans and the clanking she looked around her in a tiny room like this where would one hide things all the furniture was attached to the walls and floors and there was only one small dresser inside were chinesebrand toiletries nothing that yielded any obvious evidence she looked for anything hidden in the closet but found only clothes clank clank what do we think rhyme i think youve got lets see about fourteen hundred pounds of air left id say if you dont find something soon get the hell out im not going anywhere yet she thought hovering she looked slowly around the room where would he hide things he left his guns he left the money that means the explosion took him by surprise too there has to be something here she glanced again at the closet the clothes maybe she kicked toward it she began to go through them nothing in any of the pockets but she kept searching and in one of his armani jackets found a slit hed made in the lining she reached in and extracted an envelope containing a document she trained the light on it dont know if its helpful or not rhyme theyre in chinese thats for us to find out back home you find it eddiell translate it ill analyze it into the bag twelve hundred pounds of pressure but dont ever ever ever hold your breath why was that again right your lungsll explode clank okay im outta here she made her way out of the small stateroom and into the corridor the treasures of evidence stashed in the bag tied to her belt clank clank clank clank clank clank she turned back down the endless corridor the route by which she could escape from this terrible place the bridge seemed miles away down the black corridor the longest journey the first step but then she stopped gripping the doorway jesus lord she thought clank clank clank amelia sachs realized something about the eerie banging shed been hearing since shed entered the ship three fast bangs three slow it was morse code for sos and it was coming from somewhere deep within the ship chapter thirtyseven s os the universal distress call so somebody was alive the coast guard had missed a survivor should she go find the other divers sachs wondered but that would take too long sachs imagined from the uneven pounding that the trapped air the survivor was breathing was nearly gone besides the sound seemed to be coming from nearby it should take only minutes to find the person but where were they exactly well obviously it hadnt come from the direction of the bridge through which shed entered the ship it wasnt coming from the cabins here either it had to be one of the holds or the engine room in the lower part of the ship now with the dragon on its side those areas were level with her on her left yes no for this she couldnt ask lincoln rhymes advice there was no one to help her here oh jesus im really going to do this arent i less than pounds of air left so you better get your butt going girl sachs glanced at the faint illumination where the bridge was then she turned away from it toward the darkness and the claustrophobia and kicked hard following the clanking sos but when she came to the end of the black corridor from which she thought she heard the code sachs found no way to get into the interior of the ship the corridor just ended she pressed her head against the wood though and could distinctly hear the clanging os training the light on the wall she discovered a small door she opened it and gasped as a green eel swam leisurely past her she let her heart calm and gazed inside looking to her left into the bowels of the ship the shaft was a dumbwaiter presumably to cart supplies up to the cabin deck and the bridge from the lower decks it measured about two feet by two feet confronting the thought of swimming into the narrow space she now thought about going back for help but shed already wasted too much time finding the doorway oh man one thousand pounds of air clank clank she closed her eyes and shook her head cant do it no way sos amelia sachs calm as tea when she hit miles per hour in her camaro ss would wake up sobbing after dreams of herself imprisoned in chambers and tunnels and mine shafts cant do it she thought again then sighed through her regulator and pulled herself into the narrow space turned left as best she could and kicked her way deeper into hell god i hate this nine hundred pounds of pressure on her gauge she eased forward moving along the shaft that was just wide enough to accommodate her and her tank ten feet her tank suddenly caught on something above her she fought down the shiver of panic clamping her teeth furiously on the mouthpiece of her regulator rotating slowly she found the wire that had snagged her and she freed herself she turned back and found another bluewhite face protruding through another doorway of the dumbwaiter shaft oh my lord the mans eyes opaque as jelly stared in her direction glowing in the bright light his hair rose outward from his head like the coat of a porcupine sachs eased forward and kicked slowly past the man struggling to ignore the chilling sensation of the crown of his head brushing her body as she swam past s the sound though still feeble was louder here o she continued down the shaft to the very bottom of the dumbwaiter and pushing aside the panic as she neared the exit she forced herself to move calmly through the doorway into what was the galley of the dragon s the black water here was filled with trash and flecks of food and several bodies clank whoever was signaling couldnt even make an entire letter now above she saw the shimmering surface of a large air pocket and a mans legs in the water dangling downward the feet in socks moved slightly almost a twitch she swam quickly toward them and burst to the surface a bald man with a mustache was clinging to a rack of shelves that were bolted to the wall now the ceiling of the kitchen turned away with a cry of shock and undoubtedly from the pain of the blinding light shooting into his eyes sachs squinted she recognized him why then realized that shed seen his picture on the evidence board in rhymes town house and the one shed seen in the cabin just a few minutes before this was captain sen of the fuzhoudragon he was muttering incoherently and shivering he was so blue he looked cyanotic the color of an asphyxia victim she spit the regulator out of her mouth to breathe the air that was trapped in the pocket and save her own store of oxygen but the atmosphere was so foul and depleted that she felt faint she grabbed the mouthpiece again and began to suck the air from her own supply pulling the secondary regulator off her vest she stuck it into sens mouth he breathed deeply and began to revive somewhat sachs pointed downward into the water he nodded a fast glance at the pressure gauge pounds and two of them were using her supply now she released air from the bcd and with her arm around the limp man they sank to the bottom of the galley pushing aside the bodies and cartons of food that floated in their way at first she wasnt able to locate the doorway to the dumbwaiter shaft she felt weak with panic for a moment afraid that the moaning shed heard meant the ship was settling and buckling and the doorway was now sealed off but then she saw that the body of a young woman had floated in front of it she gently pulled the corpse aside and opened the dumbwaiter doorway wide they couldnt both fit into the shaft side by side so she eased the captain in before her feet first eyes squeezed shut still shivering violently he gripped the black hose of his regulator desperately with both hands sachs followed him imagining all too clearly what might happen if he panicked and ripped the regulator from her mouth or tore her mask or the light off trapped in this horrible narrow place thrashing in panic as she breathed the foul water into her lungs no no stop thinking about it keep going she kicked hard moving as quickly as she could twice the captain floating backward became jammed and she had to free him a glance at the gauge pounds of pressure we leave the bottom with five hundred no less than that thats an ironclad rule no exceptions finally they got to the top deck where the cabins were located and the corridor that led to the bridge and beyond that precious outside with its orange rope that would take them to the surface and a boundless supply of sweet air but the captain was still dazed and it took a long minute to maneuver him through the opening while making certain that he kept the regulator in his mouth then they were out of the dumbwaiter and floating into the main corridor she swam beside the captain and grabbed him by his leather belt but as she started to kick forward she braked suddenly to a stop the knob on her air tank was snared she reached back and found it was caught by the jacket on the body thatd been in the ghosts stateroom the gauge pounds of pressure goddamn she thought pulling fiercely at the snag kicking but the body was jammed in a doorway and the tail of his jacket had wound tightly around the tank knob the harder she pulled the more snugly she was held the needle of the pressure gauge was now below the redline pounds remained she couldnt reach the snag behind her okay nothing to do she ripped open the velcro of the bcd vest and slipped out of it but as she turned to focus on the tangle the captain went into seizure he kicked out hard struck her in the face with his foot the spotlight went out and the regulator popped from her mouth the blow pushed her backward darkness no air no no rhyme she made a grab for the regulator but it floated somewhere behind her out of reach dont hold your breath well i fucking have to blackness all around her spinning in circles groping desperately for her regulator where were the coast guard babysitters outside because i told them i wanted to search alone how could she let them know she was in trouble fast girl fast she patted the evidence bag and reached in desperately pulled out the beretta mm she pulled the slide to chamber a round and pressed the muzzle close to the wooden wall where she knew she wouldnt hit sen and pulled the trigger a flash and loud explosion the blowback and recoil nearly broke her wrist and she dropped the weapon through the cloud of debris and gunpowder residue please she thought please no air no then lights burst on silently as the dive chief and his assistant kicked fast into the corridor another regulator mouthpiece was thrust between her lips and sachs began to breathe again the dive chief got his secondary regulator into the captains mouth the stream of bubbles was faint but at least he was breathing okay signs were exchanged then the foursome made its way out of the bridge and to the orange rope thumbsup calmer now that the risk of confinement was gone sachs concentrated on ascending leisurely no faster than her bubbles and breathing deep in deep out as they left behind the ship of corpses sachs lay in the cutters sickbay breathing deeply shed opted for natures air turning down the green oxygen mask the corpsman offered her it would she was afraid only increase her sense of confinement having something else pressed close against her body as soon as shed climbed onto the bobbing deck shed stripped off the wetsuit the tight outfit itself had become another carrier of the pernicious claustrophobia and wrapped the thick governmentissue blanket around her two sailors escorted her to the sickbay to check out her wrist which turned out not to be badly injured at all finally she felt well enough to venture up top she popped two dramamine and climbed the stairs to the bridge observing that the helicopter was back hovering over the cutter this ride wasnt for sachs however but to evacuate unconscious captain sen to a long island medical center ransom explained how theyd probably missed the captain during their search for victims our divers did a long search banging on the hull and didnt get any response we did a sound scan later and that came back negative too sen mustve wedged himself in the air pocket passed out then come to later wheres he going she asked marine station in huntington part of the hospital they have a hyperbaric chamber there is he going to make it ransom said doesnt look good but if he survived twentyfour hours under these conditions then i guess anythings possible slowly the chill subsided she dried off and dressed once more in her jeans tshirt and sweatshirt and then hurried to the bridge to call rhyme neglecting to share some of her underwater adventures she told him that shed found some evidence and maybe a wit a witness found somebody still alive in the ship the captain looks like he got some of the people trapped in the hold into the galley after the ship went down but he was the only one who survived if were lucky hell be able to give us some leads to the ghosts operation in new york did he say anything hes unconscious theyre not even sure hes going to make it hypothermia and decompression sickness the hospitalll call as soon as they know something better have lon send babysitters for him too the ghostll come after him if he finds out hes still alive hurry back sachs we miss you the royal we she knew coming from lincoln rhyme really meant i she assembled the evidence shed found underwater drying the letter shed found in the ghosts jacket with paper towels from the cutters galley this would contaminate it some but she was worried that more exposure to seawater would deteriorate the paper so much it couldnt be read crime scene work rhyme had often told her was always a compromise captain ransom walked onto the bridge theres another chopper on the way here for you officer he carried two large styrofoam coffee cups covered with lids he handed her one thanks they peeled the lids off his contained steaming black coffee she laughed in her cup was fruit juice that was mixed she could smell with a generous slug of rum chapter thirtyeight feng shui which literally means wind and water is the art of trapping good energy and luck and repelling bad its widely practiced around the world but because of the astonishing number of rules and the rarity of the ability to assess the dynamics of good and evil there are very few truly talented feng shui practitioners it entails far more than just arranging furniture as loabans assistant had suggested and the ghosts apartment had clearly been done by a master sonny li knew plenty of feng shui practitioners in china but he had no idea who here in new york could have prepared the ghosts apartment so expertly but rather than race around like hongse in her yellow car to track down someone who could help him li remained true to his taoist way the way to use life is to do nothing through acting the way to use life is to do everything through being and so detective sonny li went into the fanciest bubble tea shop he could find in chinatown sat down at a table and slouched back in the chair he ordered a cup of the odd beverage tea sweetened with sugar and lightened with milk in the bottom of the tall cup were large chewy black pearls of tapioca that you sucked up through a wide straw and ate like the famous and equally expensive foaming iced tea popular in fuzhou this was a taiwanese creation sonny didnt much care for the tea but he kept it in front of him to buy the right to sit here for what might be a long time he studied the chic room which had been planned by some tooclever designer the chairs were metal and purple leather the lighting was subdued and the wallpaper fake zen tourists would breeze into the place drink down their tea and then hurry off to see more chinatown sights leaving behind huge tips which sonny li at first thought was their forgotten change tipping is rare in china sitting sipping thirty minutes passed fortyfive do everything through being his patience was finally rewarded an attractive chinese woman in her early forties walked into the tea shop found a seat near him and ordered a tea the woman wore a beautiful red dress and high narrow heels she read the new york times through stylish reading glasses with narrow rectangular lenses and blue frames no thicker than a pencil line most of the chinese women shopping here in chinatown carried cheap plastic bags wrinkled from many uses but this woman carried one made of flawless white paper inside was a box tied with a gold cord he deciphered the name on the side of the bag saks fifth avenue she was exactly the sort of woman sonny li wanted yet knew he would forever be denied sleek stylish beautiful hair shiny and dense as a crows black pelt a lean face with some vietnamese features beautifully sharpening the han chinese keen eyes bright red lips and dowager empress nails to match he looked over her dress again her jewelry her sprayed hair and decided yes shes the one li picked up his tea walked to her table and introduced himself li sat though the chair he chose was near but not actually at her table so that she wouldnt be threatened by his presence he casually struck up a conversation with her and they talked about the beautiful country about new york about bubble tea and about taiwan where shed been born he said casually the reason i troubled you forgive me but perhaps you can help the man i work for he has bad luck i believe it is because of how his apartment is arranged you obviously have a good feng shui man he nodded at the emblems that had told him that she indeed followed feng shui diligently an ostentatious bracelet of nine chinese coins a pin in the likeness of the homely goddess guan yin and a scarf with black fish on it this was why he had selected her on this evidence and because she was obviously rich which meant that she would go to only the best practitioners of the art men of the sort that the ghost too would hire he continued if i could give my boss the name of someone good to arrange his home and office he might think more of me it might help me keep my job and raise myself in his view with these words li lowered his head but kept his eyes on her face and was pierced by what he saw pity generated by his shame what was so wrenching to him about that look though was that the phony shame emanating from sonny li the undercover cop was virtually identical to the true shame that sonny li the man felt daily from his fathers cascade of criticism perhaps he reflected this is why she believed him the beautiful woman smiled and dug into her purse she wrote out a name and address on a slip of paper not bearing her own name or phone number of course she slipped it to him and withdrew her hand quickly before he could touch her palm and grasp it in desperation and hunger which in fact he was close to doing mr wang she said nodding at the card he is one of the best in the city if your employer has money he will help him he is most expensive but he will do a good job he helped me marry well as you can see yes my boss has money then he too can change his fortune goodbye she stood gathered her glossy bag and purse and strode out of the shop on her immaculate heels leaving her check sitting prominently on the table for sonny li to pay sachs rhyme looked up from the computer screen guess what the ghost blew the ship up with give up she called amused to see the look of pleasure accompanying this gruesome question mel cooper answered grade a brandnew composition congratulations this had put rhyme in a good mood because c despite being a movie terrorists staple for bombs was actually quite rare the substance was available only to the military and a few select law enforcement agencies it wasnt used in commercial demolition this meant that there were relatively few sources for highquality c which in turn meant that the odds of finding a connection between that source and the ghost were far better than if hed used common tnt tovex gelenex or any of the other commercially available explosives more significantly though c is so dangerous that by law it must contain markers each manufacturer of the material adds inert but distinctive chemicals to its version of the explosive analysis of the trace at the scene of an explosion will reveal which marker was present and this tells investigators who manufactured it the company in turn must keep detailed records of whom its products were sold to and the purchasers must keep detailed files on where the explosive was stored or used if they could find the person who sold the ghost this batch of c he might know where the snakehead had other safehouses in new york or other bases of operation cooper had sent the trace results to quantico should hear back in the next few hours wheres coe sachs asked looking around the town house down at ins rhyme said then added acerbically dont jinx it by mentioning his name lets hope he stays there eddie deng arrived from downtown got here as soon as you called lincoln excellent eddie put your reading specs on youve got to translate for us amelia found a letter in the ghosts sports coat no shit deng said where a hundred feet underwater but thats another story dengs eyes were fine no reading glasses were required but mel cooper did have to set him up with an ultraviolet reading hood to image the ink on the letter the characters had been bleached out by the seawater and were barely visible deng hunched over the letter and examined it its hard to read deng murmured squinting okay okay its to the ghost the man who wrote it is named ling shuibian hes telling the ghost when the charter flight will be leaving fuzhou and when and where to expect it at the nagorev military base outside of st petersburg then he says hes wiring the money into an account in hong kong no number or bank then it describes the cost of the airplane charter it then says part of the money is enclosed in dollars finally theres a list of the victims the passengers on the dragon thats all im afraid so have some of our people in china check out that guy ling rhyme told sellitto then the criminalist asked mel cooper trace in the paper just what youd expect the lab man said salt water sealife excrement pollution plant particles motor oil diesel fuel how much money was there sachs rhyme asked a lot maybe a thousand but its hard to tell when youre swimming around in it the us bills shed collected were all in hundreddollar denominations freshly printed forged rhyme asked cooper examined one nope the yuan shed found the chinese paper currency were faded and crumpled there were about thirty packs this size she explained eddie deng totaled the amount in this packet thirty stacks given the exchange rate the young detective estimated equals about twenty thousand dollars us sachs continued i also found an uzi and a beretta but hed taken the serial number off the uzi and i lost the beretta on the ship knowing the ghost rhyme said any gun of his even with serial numbers is going to be untraceable the criminalist looked toward the hallway thom we need our scribe thom the harried young man entered the room he wrote down the information that rhyme had dictated about the explosives the letter and the trace on it the guns there was an electronic trill as a cell phone rang and typical nowadays everyone looked down to see if it was his or hers ringing sachs was the winner and she pulled the unit off her belt hello amelia she recognized john sungs voice her stomach did a little flip at the memory of last night john how are you been for one hell of a swim she thought but aside from that doing okay fine she said kind of busy right now of course the doctor said what a voice she thought pure bedside manner any luck finding sam chang and his family not yet were working on that right now i was just wondering if you might have some time to stop by later i think thatll work out but can i call you in a bit john im at lincoln s right now and its a little crazy of course im sorry to interrupt no no im glad you did ill call you later she hung up and started to return to the evidence but she glanced up and saw lon sellitto looking at her with what could only be described as a glare detective she said to him can i talk to you outside for a minute gruffly sellitto said whats there to now she snapped rhyme glanced at them for a moment but lost interest in the curious exchange and returned to examining the evidence boards sachs walked into the corridor and sellitto followed his feet pounding heavily on the floor thom had noticed something was wrong whats going but the aides voice was lost as sachs swung the door shut angrily they continued down the hallway to where she gestured the back of the town house and they entered the kitchen she spun around hands on her narrow hips whyve you been on my case for the past two days detective the big man pulled his belt up over his belly youre crazy its your imagination bullshit you have something to say to me say it to my face i deserve that deserve it he asked in a snide tone what is all this she snapped there was a pause while he looked at the butcher block where thom had set a halfdozen tomatoes and a pile of basil finally he said i know where you were last night yeah she asked the babysitters outside of sungs apartment told me you went there after you left here and you didnt leave till one fortyfive my personal life is my own business she said coldly the burly cop looked around and then whispered vehemently but its not just your business anymore amelia its his business too she frowned his who rhyme who dyou think whatre you talking about hes tough tougher than anybody i know but the one thing thatll break him into little pieces is you if you keep going the way youre headed she was bewildered headed look you didnt know him back then that woman he was in love with clare when she died it took him forever to get over it he came to work he did his job but it took a year for that light to come back in his eyes and his wife they had some fights sure im talking mgm grand kind of fights it wasnt the greatest marriage in the world but after the accident when he knew it wasnt going to work and he got divorced that was hard for him real hard i dont know where youre going with this you dont its pretty clear to me youre the center of his life hes let down all his defenses with you youre going to break him and im not going to let that happen his voice dropped even further just think about if you keep seeing this guy its going to kill rhyme its what the hellre you laughing at youre talking about me and john sung yeah the guy youve been sneaking off to see sachss hands rose to her face and she began shaking with laughter oh lon then she turned away quickly from the detective because a moment later as shed suddenly known would happen the laughter turned into tears ive got to talk to you about something youre looking like its bad news doctor why dont we sit down over there in the corner jesus sellitto said starting forward then stopping hands at his side awkward amelia what she held up a hand and turned away whats going on finally she caught her breath wiped her face and turned back to the detective its not what youre thinking lon another tug of his belt go on you know rhyme and ive talked about having kids yeah she gave a sour laugh it didnt work its not like we were trying that hard but i wasnt getting pregnant i was worried that there was something wrong with lincoln so a few weeks ago we went in and we both had checkups yeah i remember he went to the doctor she thought back to that day in the waiting room ah ms sachs here you are hello doctor ive just been meeting with lincoln rhymes physician yes ive got to talk to you about something youre looking like its bad news doctor why dont we sit down over there in the corner heres fine tell me let me have it straight well lincoln s doctor tells me that the results of his fertility workup are well within normal levels a slightly diminished sperm count which is typical of someone in his condition but nowadays thats a very slight hurdle to pregnancy im afraid though that you have a more serious problem me staring at the butcher block next to her she now told sellitto about this conversation with the doctor then she added ive got something called endometriosis ive always had problems but i never believed it was as bad as what the doctor told me can they cure it sachs shook her head no they can operate do hormonal therapy but it wouldnt really help the fertility thing jesus im sorry amelia she wiped her face again a sad smile blossomed on it dryness and heat in the kidney what sachs offered a hollow laugh thats what i was doing at john sungs dryness and heat in the kidney thosere the reasons for infertility according to chinese medicine last night he examined me and gave me an acupressure treatment and hes getting some herbs that he thinksll help thats what he just called about wait here sachs walked to the hallway dug into her purse and returned with what sung had just given her when shed seen him last night she handed the book to the detective the title was herbal treatments and acupressure techniques to assist fertility it turns out a lot of western doctors recommend that women with endometriosis use chinese medicine to treat it last night when i took lincoln upstairs we talked about it he thought it was pretty silly but hed noticed how upset ive been lately because of this hes right he said ive been distracted its even bothering me when im running scenes so we decided id go ahead and see what sung could do for me she fell silent finally she said theres so much death around me lon my father my relationship with my boyfriend nick when he went off to prison it was like he died then all the crime scenes i run i wanted to have some life around us lincoln and me i wanted so badly to fix whats wrong inside me whatever it takes look out for yourself first if youre not whole youll never be able to take care of anybody else sungs treatment she hoped was a way to do this to make herself whole lifting his palms sellitto said i didnt know you were real secret about it angrily she said because its nobodys business but lincolns and mine she nodded toward rhymes room dont you know what he and i are to each other how could you think id do something like that the disorderly detective couldnt hold her gaze with betty leaving and everything i was just thinking about what happened to me the big cops marriage had broken up some years before no one knew the details of sellittos divorce but it was a wellknown fact that being married to a cop was tough and many a spouse had gone looking for a more attentive alternate she supposed betty had had an affair im sorry officer i shoulda thought better he extended his hand and she reluctantly shook his huge palm will that do any good he nodded at the book i dont know she answered then smiled wistfully maybe back to work sellitto asked sure she wiped her eyes a final time and they returned to rhymes living room ghostkill easton long island crime scene two immigrants killed on beach shot in back one immigrant wounded dr john sung bangshou assistant on board identity unknown

his living room laboratory hey sachs said to the agent they let you wear shirts like that say is that a real color you gave us a hell of a scare rhyme said magine what i myself was feelin settin my

brighton beach but they aint turning up anything not a peep and i run dozens of skels there youre sure the devices russian whenre we sure bout anyfuckinthing that much was true rhyme nodded at a paper bag he carried whatve you got he dug out a plastic bag containing the bright yellow stick of explosive and tossed it across the room to sachs she caught it onehanded holy mother fred she called sonly dynamite and if it dint go off with a detonator it sure aint gonna go bang with a little lob to left field hey ayemelia you wanna play softball on the bureau team that was a good catch she examined the stick of dynamite friction ridges sellitto asked wiped clean no prints she held it up for rhyme who noticed numbers printed on the side whatd the lot numbers turn up he asked dellray nothin our boys said it was too old to trace nother dead end one mans dead end is another mans door rhyme said reminding himself to share this saying which hed just made up with sonny li when the chinese cop returned did they test it for markers nup said it was too old for marker additives too probably is but i want to test it anyway he shouted to mel cooper get it over to the lab asap i want it analyzed the works chromatography the analytical process of choice to test the dynamite usually required that the samples be burned but rhyme wasnt about to set fire to a piece of explosive in his town house the nypd lab downtown had special equipment for doing so mel cooper called one of his technicians downtown and made arrangements for the test then handed the stick back to dellray giving him instructions on where to drop it off well do what we can fred then cooper looked over a second bag dellray handed him it contained a duracell battery wires and a switch all generic nothing helpful its your tract housing of bombs the tech announced detonator a third bag appeared cooper and rhyme examined what was left of the scorched piece of metal russian military grade rhyme said a detonator was basically a blasting cap which contained a core of fulminate of mercury or a similar explosive and wires which heated up when an electrical charge was sent through them and set off the primer explosive which in turn set off the main charge there wasnt much of this one left it was the only part of the bomb that had actually gone off when dellray sat on the device cooper put it under the compound microscope not much a russian letter a and r then the numbers one and three and nobodys database has a record of that nope and we checked everbody nypd atf dea and justice well well see what the lab comes up with i owe you lincoln pay me back by getting somebody from your shop to work ghostkill fred four blocks from the bubble tea house sonny li found the address of mr wang which the woman in red had given him the storefront showed no indication of what the occupant did for a living but in the dusty front window sat a shrine illuminated by a red lightbulb and sticks of incense long burnt away the faded letters said in chinese fortunes told truth revealed luck preserved inside a young chinese woman behind a desk looked up at li on the desk in front of her were both an abacus and a laptop computer the office was shabby but the diamond rolex watch on her wrist suggested that the business was successful she asked if he was here to hire her father to arrange his home or office i was pleased to see an apartment i believe your father did can you tell me if it was his work whose apartment it was an acquaintance of another friend who sadly has gone back to china i dont know his name i do know the address though and that is what fiveoheight patrick henry street no no she said my father does not work there he does no work south of midtown only for uptown people but your office is here because people expect it to be here all of our clients are on the upper east and upper west sides and only a portion of them are chinese and you dont live in chinatown she laughed we live in greenwich connecticut do you know it no he said disappointed li asked can you tell me who mightve arranged this apartment it was very well done this friend he is wealthy yes very wealthy then i would say mr zhou he does many of the rich places downtown heres his address and name he has an office in the back of a grocery and herb store its about five blocks from here she wrote the name on another slip of paper and jotted down the directions he thanked her and she turned back to the computer outside for luck sonny li waited until a taxi speeding down the street was three meters away then jumped in front of the car the driver cursed and extended his middle finger li laughed hed cut the demons tail very close and rendered him powerless now blessed with invulnerability he would find the ghost he glanced at the slip of paper once more and started down the street toward the lucky hope shop the ghost wearing his windbreaker to conceal his new glock acaliber model was walking down mulberry street sipping the milk out of a whole coconut hed bought at the corner a short straw protruded from the opening the vendor had hacked into the top with a cleaver hed just gotten the news from the uighur that yusuf had hired to break into the special nypd safehouse where the wu family was being kept in the murray hill section of the city but the security was better than hed expected and the guards had spotted him theyd nearly caught him but the turk had escaped undoubtedly the police had moved the family already a brief setback but hed eventually find out where they were he passed a store selling statues and altars and joss sticks in the window was an effigy of his protector the archer god yi the ghost bowed his head slightly and then continued on as he walked he asked himself did he believe in spirits did he believe that the dragons inhabited hills he doubted that he did after all tian hou the goddess of sailors might have shaken her finger at the tempestuous sea and calmed it but shed done so only in a myth in reality she hadnt saved the piglets trapped in the hold of the fuzhoudragon and his own prayers to the goddess of mercy guan yin had gone unanswered years ago she hadnt stopped the hand of the pimply student from beating his parents and brother to death for the ambiguous crime of being part of the old on the other hand the ghost certainly believed in qi the life energy that flows through everyone he had felt this force a thousand times he felt it as the transfer between him and the woman he was fucking felt it as the power of victory the instant he killed an enemy felt it as a warning that he should avoid going into this room or meeting with that businessman when hed been sick or endangered hed felt his qi impaired good qi and bad qi and that meant you could channel the good force and divert or block the bad down one alley then down another then across a busy street into yet another dim cobblestoned alley finally he arrived at his destination he finished the milk in the coconut and tossed the shell into a trash can then he carefully wiped his hands on a napkin and walked through the doorway waving hello to his feng shui expert mr zhou who sat in the back of the lucky hope shop sonny li lit another cigarette and continued down a street called the bowery li knew snakeheads and he knew that they had money and a fierce sense of survival the ghost would have other safehouses in the area and since feng shui was such a personal matter if the ghost was satisfied with the work that zhou had done on patrick henry street he would have used the man for these other locations too he felt good good omens good power he and loaban had made their sacrifices to guan di the god of detectives hed been cutting demons tails and he had a loaded german automatic pistol in his pocket if this feng shui man knew he was working for one of the most dangerous snakeheads in the world he might be reluctant to talk about him but sonny li would get him to judge dee the fictional detective prosecutor and judge in old china conducted investigations very differently from loaban the techniques were similar to those used in modernday china the emphasis was on interrogation of witnesses and suspects not on physical evidence the key in criminal investigations like so much else in chinese culture was patience patience patience even the brilliant and persistent judge dee would reinterview the suspect dozens of times until a crack was found in his alibi or explanation the judge would then tear apart the mans story until the suspect delivered the allimportant goal of criminal investigation in china not a jury verdict but a confession followed by the equally important vow of contrition anything that could elicit a confession was fair even torture though in judge dees day if you tortured a suspect and it later turned out that he was innocent the judge himself would be tortured and put to death sonny li was the namesake of a great american gangster sonny corleone son of the godfather vito corleone he was a senior officer and detective in the first prefecture peoples public security bureau liu guoyuan fujian province a world traveler and the friend of loaban lincoln rhyme li would extract the ghosts other addresses from the feng shui expert no matter what it took he continued along the street past the bustling crowds the fish markets in front of which were baskets of scrabbling blue crabs and bins of ice containing clams and fish some of them sliced open their tiny black hearts still beating he came to the lucky hope shop a small place but packed with merchandise jars of twisted ginseng root packs of dried cuttlefish hello kitty toys and candies for children noodles and spices dusty bags of rice bins of melon seeds star noodles tea for the liver and kidney dried croaker oyster sauce lotus jelly and gums frozen tea buns and packs of tripe in the back he found a man sitting at a desk smoking reading a chineselanguage newspaper the office was as sonny li had expected perfectly arranged convex mirrors to trap the bad energy a large translucent jade dragon better than wood or ceramic and important for successful business a small aquarium against what would be the north wall in it swam black fish you are zhou yes thats right li said im honored to meet you sir i was at the apartment of a friend at patrick henry street i believe you arranged it zhous eyes narrowed a millimeter then he nodded cautiously a friend thats right sir unfortunately i need to get in touch with him and he is no longer at that apartment i was hoping you could tell me where he might be his name is kwan ang another faint faint contraction of the mans brows i am sorry sir i dont know anyone of that name thats unfortunate mr zhou because if you did know him and you were to direct me to any other places he might be found there would be a lot of money in it for you its important that i find him i cant help you you know that kwan ang is a snakehead and a murderer i suspect you do know that i can see it in your eyes sonny li could read faces the way loaban could read evidence no you are mistaken mr zhou began to sweat beads appeared on his scalp so li continued any money he has paid you has blood on it the blood of innocent women and children does that not trouble you i cannot help you zhou gazed down at a sheaf of papers on his desk now i must get back to work tap tap li was gently striking the desktop with his pistol zhou stared at it fearfully so you must be considered a confederate of his perhaps you are his partner you are a snakehead too i think that is so no no i honestly dont know who you mean i am simply a practitioner of feng ah li sneered im tired of this ill call the ins and let them take over from here they can deal with you and your family he nodded toward a cluster of family pictures on the wall then he turned toward the door theres no need for that zhou said quickly sir you mentioned money before five thousand onecolor if he kwan will never learn about you youll be paid in cash by the police zhou wiped his face with his shirtsleeve his eyes swept the desktop as he debated tap tap tap finally zhou blurted i am not sure of the address he and his associate picked me up here and drove me to the apartment through alleyways but if you want him i will tell you this he was here not five minutes ago he left just before you walked in what kwan ang himself yes which way did he go outside the store i saw him turn left if you hurry you can find him hes carrying a yellow bag with my stores name on it he wait sir my money but li was sprinting out of the store outside he turned to the left and jogged down the street he looked around frantically then about a hundred meters away he saw a man of medium build with short dark hair carrying a yellow shopping bag his gait was familiar li remembered it from the ship yes li thought his heart stuttering with excitement its the ghost he supposed he should try to call loaban or hongse but he couldnt risk the mans escaping li started after him gripping the pistol in his pocket sprinting breathless he closed the distance quickly he was gasping loudly and as he got nearer the ghost paused as he started to look behind him li ducked behind a dumpster when he looked out again the snakehead was continuing through the deserted alley in liu guoyuan sonny li had a pale blue uniform white gloves and a hat with a patentleather brim but here he looked like a busboy he had nothing on him to indicate that he was working with the new york police department and lincoln rhyme he was concerned that if someone saw him arrest the ghost they would think that he himself was an attacker a bandit and the police would arrest him and the snakehead would escape in the confusion and so li decided to take the man here in the deserted alley when the ghost turned down one more alley li made certain that no one was around and simply sprinted forward as fast as he could run the pistol outstretched in his hand before the snakehead realized he was being pursued sonny li was on him grabbing his collar and shoving his gun into the mans back the killer dropped the yellow bag and started to reach under his shirt but li pressed his gun against the ghosts neck dont move he took a large pistol from his prisoners belt and slipped it into his own pocket then he roughly spun the snakehead around to face him kwan ang he intoned then recited the familiar incantation im arresting you for violation of the organic laws of the peoples republic of china but as he was about to continue the litany and present the particular offenses lis voice faded he glanced at the neck of the ghosts shirt which had been tugged open as hed reached for his pistol li saw a white bandage taped to the mans chest and dangling from a leather cord around the ghosts neck was a soapstone amulet in the shape of a monkey chapter forty his eyes wide in shock sonny li stepped back holding the pistol level at the ghosts face you you he stammered his thoughts were jammed as he tried to figure out what was happening finally he whispered you killed john sung at the beach and you took his papers and the stone monkey youve been pretending to be him the ghost looked at him carefully then he smiled weve both been doing some masquerading it looks like you were one of the piglets on the fuzhoudragon he nodded waiting to get me on us soil to arrest me and turn me over to the police here li understood what the man had done hed stolen the red honda from the restaurant on the beach loaban and the police assumed hed driven it to the city but no hed stuffed sungs body into the trunk and hidden it near the beach where no one would think to look for it then hed given himself a superficial wound with his own gun and swum back into the ocean awaiting rescue by the police and the ins who helpfully transported him into the city themselves first to the hospital and then to the immigration hearing officer ten judges of hell li thought again hongse had no clue that the doctor was the snakehead himself you were using the policewoman to find out where the changs and the wus were the ghost nodded i needed information she was happy to provide it he now examined li more closely why did you do this little man why did you come all the way after me you killed three people in liu guoyuan my town did i i dont remember i was there a year ago i think why did i kill them maybe they deserved it sonny li was appalled that the man didnt even remember the deaths no you and a little snakehead started shooting you killed three bystanders then it was an accident no it was murder well listen little man im tired and i dont have much time the police are close to finding the changs and i have to get there first and then get out of this country and go home so one hundred thousand onecolor the ghost said i can give it to you in cash right now im not like most of the security bureau officers youre used to you mean youre more greedy then two hundred thousand the ghost laughed you would have to work for a hundred years to make that much money in liu guoyuan you are under arrest the smile on the ghosts face faded realizing that he was serious this will go badly for your wife and children if you dont let me go li growled you will lie down on your belly now all right an honorable and honest security bureau officer i am surprised whats your name little man my name is not your concern the ghost knelt on the cobblestones li decided to use his shoelaces to tie the ghosts wrists he then suddenly li realized in shock that the shopping bag was between them and that the ghosts right hand had disappeared behind it no he shouted the lucky hope shop bag exploded toward li as the ghost fired through it with a second gun he had hidden in an ankle holster or his sock the bullet zipped past lis hip he raised his hand in an automatic gesture flinching but by the time he was thrusting his own pistol forward the snakehead had knocked it from his hand li grabbed the ghosts wrist and tried to pull the model from his fingers together they tumbled to the slick cobblestones and this gun too fell to the ground desperately they clutched at each other clawing and striking when they could but mostly wrestling and trying to reach one of the weapons that lay on the cobblestones near them the ghost slammed his palm into lis face and stunned him then spun away struggling to pull the glock from the cops pocket li recovered quickly and tackled the ghost knocking this weapon too to the ground the cops knee struck the killers back and knocked the breath out of him still facing away from li the ghost gasping and moaning in pain struggled to his knees lis arm remained around the snakeheads throat in a choke hold unstoppable the ghost struggled toward the pistol stop him stop him li raged to himself hes the man who would kill hongse the man who would kill the changs who would kill loaban too stop him he seized the leather thong around the ghosts neck the one that held the stone monkey amulet and began to pull hard the leather tightened the ghosts hands flailed uselessly and from his throat came a gurgling noise the snakehead began to quiver his heels were nearly off the ground let go sonny li told himself arrest him dont murder him but he didnt let go he pulled harder and harder until the leather snapped the monkey figurine fell to the ground and shattered li stumbled backward falling hard into the alley striking his head on the cobblestones he nearly passed out judges of hell the cop could faintly see the ghost also on his hands and knees gasping and coughing holding his throat with one hand as his other patted the ground for a weapon an image came into lis mind his stern father reprimanding him for some foolish comment then another one the bodies of the ghosts victims in lis town in china lying bloody on the sidewalk in front of the cafe and he pictured another terrible sight one that had not yet happened hongse dead lying in darkness loaban too his face as still in death as his body had been in life sonny li rolled to his knees and began crawling toward his enemy the crime scene bus left twentyfoot skid marks on the chinatown street which was slick with runoff from the melting ice from bins at a nearby fish market amelia sachs her face grim jumped out accompanied by ins agent alan coe and eddie deng they ran through the pungent alleyway toward the cluster of uniformed officers from the fifth precinct the men and women stood casually looking as matteroffact as police always did at crime scenes even scenes of homicides sachs slowed and gazed down at the body sonny li was lying on his stomach on the filthy cobblestones eyes partially open palms flat beside him level with his shoulders as if he were about to start a series of pushups sachs paused filled with the desire to drop to her knees and grip the mans hand shed walked the grid many times in the years shed worked with rhyme but this was her first scene involving a fellow cop fellow cop and she could now say friend a friend too of rhymes still she resisted the temptation toward sentiment this was after all a crime scene no different from any other and as lincoln rhyme often pointed out one of the worst contaminants at scenes was careless cops look past it ignore who the victim is remember rhymes advice give up the dead well thatd be damn tough to do for both of them but for lincoln rhyme especially sachs had noticed that in the past two days rhyme had formed an improbable bond with this man as close as hed come to a friendship since shed known him she was now aware of the painful silence of a thousand conversations never to occur of a thousand laughs never to be shared but then she thought of someone else poyee soon to be another victim of the man whod committed this crime if they didnt find him and so sachs put the pain away the same way she closed and locked the storage box in which her colt competition shooting pistol rested we did what you wanted said another officer a detective in a gray suit nobody got closern this only the ems tech was in a nod toward the body hes dcds cop initials perfunctorily signifying the category of lifelessness deceased confirmed dead at the scene agent coe walked slowly up to her im sorry the agent said running his hand through his scarlet hair there seemed to be little genuine sadness in his voice however yeah he was a good man yes he was she said this bitterly thinking and he was a hell of a better cop than you are if you hadnt fucked up yesterday wedve gotten the ghost sonny would still be alive and poyee and the changs would be safe she motioned to the cops ive got to run the scene could i have everybody out of here oh man she thought dismayed at what she now had to do though she was anticipating not the difficult and sad task of searching the scene but something far more arduous she pulled her headset on and plugged it into her radio okay just go ahead do it she made the call to central and was patched through to the phone a click yes rhyme asked she said im here a pause then and she sensed him trying to keep hope out of his voice hes dead the criminalist gave no response for a moment i see im sorry lincoln she said softly another pause and he said no first names sachs bad luck remember his voice nearly caught all right get going run the scene times running out for the changs sure rhyme im on it she quickly dressed in the tyvek suit and went about processing the scene sachs did the fingernail scrapings the substance samples the ballistics the footprints the shell casings the slugs she took the pictures she lifted prints but she felt she was just going through the motions come on she snapped at herself youre acting like youre some damn rookie we dont have time to just collect evidence think about poyee think about the changs give rhyme something he can work with think she turned back to the body and processed it more carefully considering everything that she found demanding in her mind that every bit of evidence explain itself offer an explanation of where it had come from what it might mean one of the uniformed officers walked up to her but seeing her stony face he retreated quickly a half hour later shed finished bagging everything written her name on the chain of custody cards and assembled the evidence she made another call to the criminalist go ahead rhyme said grimly how it hurt to hear the pain in his voice for years shed heard so much flat emotion so much lethargy so much resignation that had been tough but it didnt compare to the pain now in rhymes voice he was shot three times in the chest but weve got four casings one casings from a model probably the one we saw before the others are he was killed with that one it looks like then i found the walther that sonny was carrying there was trace on his leg yellow paper flecks and some kind of dried plant material and there was a pile of the same material on the cobblestones whats your scenario sachs i think sonny spots the ghost leaving a store carrying something in a yellow bag sonny follows him he collars him in the alley here and gets the ghosts new gun the he assumes thats his only weapon sonny relaxes and tells the ghost to get onto the ground but the ghost pulls out his backup the model and shoots through the bag spattering the plant material and flecks of paper on sonny the bullet misses but the ghost jumps him theres a fight the ghost gets the and kills sonny because rhyme said the yellow paper and the plant material were on sonnys legs meaning the ghost had the model in an ankle holster and fired low the gunshot residue was high on his body from the thats what it looks like and how do we use that scenario wherever the ghost bought that stuff that was in the bag a clerk might know him and have an idea where he lives you want to canvass all the stores near there to see who has yellow bags no thatd take too long itd be better to find out what the plant material is first bring it in sachs melll run it through the chromatograph no ive got a better idea she said a glance at sonny lis body she forced herself to look away its probably chinese herbs or spices im going to stop by john sungs apartment with a sample of it he should be able to tell me right away what it is he only lives a few blocks from here v all in good time wednesday the hour of the rooster pm to monday the hour of the monkey pm to effect capture the opponents men must be entirely encircled without any adjacent places vacant exactly as in war when a post is surrounded the soldiers are taken prisoner by the enemy the game of weichi chapter fortyone he stared out the window at the gray dusk premature because of the lingering storm his head drooped forward heavy heavy immobile this wasnt from damaged fibers of nerve but from sorrow rhyme was thinking of sonny li when hed run the forensic unit hed had the chance to hire dozens probably hundreds of employees and to finagle or bully onto his staff men and women from other assignments because he knew they were damn good cops he couldnt tell exactly what appealed to him about these people oh sure they had the textbook qualifications persistence intelligence patience stamina keen powers of observation empathy yet there was another quality something that rhyme for all his rational self couldnt define though he recognized it immediately there was no better way to say it than the desire even the joy of pursuing a prey at all costs whatever else sonny lis failings his cigarettes at crime scenes his reliance on omens and the woowoo factor he had this essential aspect the lone cop had traveled literally to the ends of the earth to collar his suspect rhyme wouldve traded a hundred eager rookies and a hundred cynical veterans for one cop like sonny li a small man who wanted nothing more than to offer to the citizens on his beat some retribution for the harms done to them some justice some comfort in the aftermath of evil and for his reward li was content to enjoy a good hunt a challenge and perhaps just a little respect from those he cared about he glanced at the book hed inscribed to li to my friend okay mel he said evenly lets put this one together whatve we got mel cooper was hunched over the plastic bags the patrolman had raced here from the crime scene in chinatown footprints we sure it was the ghost rhyme asked yep cooper confirmed theyre identical looking at the electrostatic prints that sachs had taken rhyme agreed they were the same now the slugs he was examining the two bullets one flattened one intact both bloody check the lands and grooves this referred to the angular marks left in the soft lead bullet by the rifling in the barrel of the gun the spiral grooves that spin the slug to make it go faster and more accurately by examining the number of grooves and the degree of the twist a ballistics expert can often determine the type of gun the shooter used cooper wearing latex gloves measured the undamaged slug and the marks cut in the side from the rifling its a fortyfive acp octagonal profile on the lands and grooves righthand twist im guessing one complete twist every fifteen sixteen inches ill look that up and dont bother rhyme said shortly its a glock the unsexy but dependable austrian pistols were increasingly popular throughout the world among criminals and police alike whats the wear on the barrel sharp profile so its new probably the g he was surprised this compact but extremely powerful handgun was expensive and wasnt widely available yet in the united states you found it mostly among federal agents useful useful he wondered not yet all it told them was the type of gun not where the weapon or the ammunition had been purchased still it was evidence and it belonged on the board thom thom rhyme shouted we need you the aide appeared immediately therere other things i need no rhyme said there arent other things write the aide must have sensed rhymes despondency over the death of sonny li and said nothing in response to the sharp command he picked up the marker and walked to the whiteboard cooper then opened lis clothes over a large sheet of clean blank newsprint he dusted the items of clothing with a brush and examined the trace that had fallen onto the paper dirt flecks of paint the yellow paper particles that probably were from the bag and the dried plant material spices or herbs that amelia mentioned cooper said shes checking out the plant stuff right now just bag them and put them aside for the time being rhyme who over the years had grown immune to the horror of crime scenes nonetheless felt a pang as he looked at the dark blood on lis clothing the same clothing hed worn in this very room not long ago zaijian sonny goodbye fingernail scrapings cooper announced examining the label on another plastic bag he mounted the trace on a slide in the compound microscope project it mel rhyme said and turned to the computer screen a moment later a clear image appeared on the large flat screen what do we have here sonny you fought with the ghost you grabbed him was there anything on his clothes or shoes that was transferred to you and if so will it send us to his front door tobacco the criminalist said laughing sadly thinking of the cops addiction to cigarettes what else do we see what are those minerals there what do you think mel silicates looks like it lets run some through the gcms the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer would determine exactly what the substance was soon the results came back magnesium and silicate thats talc right yep the criminalist knew that talcum powder was commonly used by some people as a deodorant by workers who wore tightfitting rubber gloves for protection and by those who engaged in certain sexual practices using latex clothing go online and find out everything you can about talc and magnesium silicate will do as cooper was typing madly rhymes phone rang thom answered it and put the call on the speaker hello he asked mr rhymes please rhyme is the name yes whos this dr arthur winslow at huntington medical center yes doctor theres a patient here a chinese man his name is sen he was medevaced to us after the coast guard rescued him from a sunken ship off the north shore not exactly the coast guard rhyme thought but he said go ahead we were told to contact you with any news about him thats right well i think theres something you ought to know and what would that be rhyme asked slowly though his meaning was really get to the point he sipped the bitter coffee even though he hated it seventeenyearold william chang sat in the back of the starbucks not far from the familys apartment in brooklyn he wanted ponee tea made the way his mother prepared it brewed in an old iron pot but he kept drinking the coffee as if he were addicted to the muddy sour drink because that is what the pompadoured batu across from him was now sipping for william to drink tea would seem like a weakness wearing the same black leather jacket hed been in yesterday the kid whod identified himself only as chen finished his conversation on a tiny nokia phone and clipped the unit back onto his belt he made a point of checking the time on his gold rolex what happened to the gun we sold you yesterday he asked in english my father found it asshole he leaned forward ominously you didnt tell him where you got it no if you told anyone about us well kill you william chang hardened by his life as a dissidents son knew not to give an inch with people like this i didnt fucking tell anybody anything but i need another gun hell find that one too no he wont ill keep it with me he wont frisk me chen eyed a longhaired chinese girl nearby when he saw she was reading what seemed to be a college textbook he lost interest he looked william up and down and then asked hey you want a dvd player a toshiba its sweet two hundred a flatscreen tv eight hundred i want a gun thats all i want and why dont you get some better clothes you look like shit ill get clothes later hugo boss armani i can get you whatever you want sipping the coffee he studied william closely or you can come with us some night were going to a warehouse in queens next week theyre getting a shipment in can you drive yeah i can drive william looked out the front window he saw no sign of his father the batu asked you got balls dont you i guess your triad hijack anything in fujian william didnt exactly have a triad just some friends who would occasionally steal cars and shoplift liquor and cigarettes from time to time hell we hit dozens of places what was your job lookout getaway chen thought for a moment then asked okay were inside a warehouse and youre on guard you know you see a security guard coming toward us what would you do would you kill him what is this a fucking test just answer you have the balls to kill him sure but i wouldnt why not william sneered because only an idiot would get executed over some clothes who said clothes you did william replied armani boss well theres a guard answer me what the fuck would you do id come up behind him take his gun away and id keep him on his belly till you had all the clothes in the getaway wheels then id piss on him chen frowned piss on him why because the first thing hed do was go change his clothes before he called the police so the cops wouldnt think hed peed his pants thatd give us time to get away and he never got hurt so the cops couldnt get us for assault this is what william had heard that some gang by the waterfront near fuzhou had done once chen wouldnt allow himself to be impressed but he said youll come to queens with us ill meet you here tomorrow night ill bring some people ill see i have to get back now my fatherll notice im gone he took a wad of dollars from his pocket flashed it at the batu what do you have i sold you the only good one i had chen said that chrome baby it was a piece of shit i want a real gun you do have balls but you got a mouth too you better watch it all ive got is a colt take it or leave it loaded chen fiddled with the gun inside the bag three rounds thats all william asked like i said take it or leave it how much five hundred william laughed harshly three or i walk chen hesitated then nodded only cause i like you both young men glanced around the starbucks the bag was exchanged for the money without a word william rose chen said tomorrow eight here ill try chen laughed piss on him he turned back to his coffee outside william started quickly down the sidewalk away from starbucks the figure stepped out of the alley moving quickly toward him william stopped startled sam chang walked up to his son the boy started walking again fast head down well chang asked falling into place beside the boy i got it baba give it to me his father said he passed his father the bag which disappeared into the mans pocket you didnt tell him your name no you didnt mention the ghost or the dragon im not stupid william snapped he doesnt have any idea who we are they walked in silence for a few minutes did he charge you all the money william hesitated and began to say something then he dug into his pocket and handed his father back the remaining hundred dollars of the cash his father had given him for the gun as they approached the house chang said to his son im going to put it in the front closet well use it only if the ghost tries to get inside never take it with you anywhere understand we should each get one and carry it do you understand chang repeated firmly yes chang touched his sons arm thank you son it was a brave thing to do you do have balls yeye would be proud of you his father added william nearly said yeye would still be alive if it werent for you but he remained silent they arrived at their front door chang and william looked around no one had followed them from the coffee shop they pushed quickly inside as chang hid the gun on the top shelf of the closet where only he and william could reach it the boy dropped onto the couch next to his brother and the baby girl he picked up a magazine and thumbed through it but he paid little attention to the articles he was thinking about what chen had asked him should he meet with the other members of the triad tomorrow night he didnt think he would but he wasnt sure it was never a bad idea hed learned to keep your options open chapter fortytwo john sung had changed clothes he was wearing a turtleneck sweater which seemed odd in the heat though it made him look pretty stylish and new workout pants he was flushed and he seemed distracted out of breath are you all right amelia sachs asked yoga he explained i was doing my exercises tea i cant stay long eddie deng had gone back to the fifth precinct but alan coe was waiting for her downstairs in the crime scene bus he held up a bag heres what i wanted to give you the fertility herbs i told you about last night she took the bag absently thank you john whats wrong he asked scanning her troubled face he motioned her inside and they sat on the couch that police officer from china the man who helped us he was found dead about an hour ago sung closed his eyes for a moment and sighed was it an accident or did the ghost get to him the ghost oh no im sorry i am too she said this brusquely dismissing the emotion in the best spirit of lincoln rhyme she reached into her pocket and withdrew a plastic bag of the plant material shed found at the scene we found this where he was murdered where he asked in chinatown not far away we think its some herbs or spices that the ghost bought rhyme was hoping if we can figure out what it is we might find the store where he bought it maybe one of the clerks might know where the ghost lives he nodded let me see it sung opened the bag then shook some out onto the counter he bent down inhaled the aroma and examined the substance she thought lincoln rhyme would use a gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer to do exactly the same thing separating a mixture into its component parts and identifying them finally he said i smell astragalus ginger poria maybe some ginseng and alisma he shook his head i know youd like me to tell you its sold in only one or two stores but im afraid you can buy it at any herbalist drugstore or grocery in china i would suppose its the same here discouraged she thought of something else what do they do maybe the ghost was suffering from some sickness or injury and they could trace him through other doctors as theyd done with wu qichens wife its more of an overthecounter tonic than a medicine it improves resistance tonifies your qi many people use it to heighten the sexual experience supposedly it helps men stay erect longer its not meant to treat a specific illness so much for that theory sachs thought glumly you could check the stores closest to where the policeman was killed sung suggested but i suppose youve thought of that she nodded thats what well have to do maybe well get a break she started to stand and winced as pain shot through her shoulder a muscle shed pulled on the fuzhoudragon taking your medicine he asked chiding her yeah i am but you know how disgusting it tastes you can drink beer for pleasure here sit down again she hesitated and lowered herself painfully to the couch he moved close behind her she could sense his proximity from the way the ambient noise in the room grew mute then she felt his hands on her shoulder as they began squeezing softly at first then harder more probing his face was near the back of her head his breath caressing her neck the hands moved up and down her skin pressing hard but just short of the point of pain it was relaxing yes but she felt momentarily disconcerted when the palms and fingers nearly encircled her throat relax he whispered in that calm voice of his she tried to his hands slid to her shoulders then down her back they moved forward along her ribs but stopped before he touched her breasts and returned again to her spine and neck wondering if there really was something he could do for her to improve the chance of her and rhymes having children dryness in the kidneys she closed her eyes and lost herself in the powerful massage she felt him shift closer to her getting better leverage it seemed he was only inches away his hands moved up her spine to her neck once more encircling them his breathing was coming quickly from the effort she supposed why dont you take off that gun belt of yours he whispered bad karma she asked no he laughed its interfering with your circulation she reached for the buckle and started to undo it she felt his hand close around the thick nylon strap to help her remove it but then a harsh sound interrupted them her cell phone ringing she eased away from him and pulled the unit off her belt hello this is sachs get ready to roll what do you have rhyme there was no answer for a moment as she heard someone else in his room speaking to the criminalist a moment later he came back on the line the captain of the ship sen is conscious eddie dengs on the other line interviewing him hold on voices shouts rhymes commanding well we dont have time now now now listen sachs the captain spent some time in the hold of the dragon he overheard chang talking with his father looks like some relative or friend arranged for an apartment and job for the family in brooklyn brooklyn what about queens sam changs the clever one remember im sure he said queens to lead everybody off i narrowed down the area where i think they are red hook or owls head how do you know how else sachs the trace on the old mans shoes biosolids remember therere two waste treatment facilities in brooklyn im leaning toward owls head its more residential ands closer to sunset park the chinese community there eddie dengs having his people from the fifth precinct call printing companies and sign painters in owls head lons putting esu on alert and the inss getting together a team too i want you over there ill let you know as soon as i have an address she glanced up at sung john lincoln s found the changs neighborhood im going over there now where are they in brooklyn oh very good he said theyre safe so far may i come i can help translate chang and i speak the same dialect sure sachs said into the phone john sungs coming with me and coe hes going to translate were on our way rhyme call me when you have an address they hung up and sung stepped into the bedroom a moment later he came out wearing a bulky windbreaker its not cold out sachs said always keep warm important for the qi and blood he said then sung looked at her and took her by the shoulders sachs responding with a smile of curiosity with sincerity in his voice he said you have done a very good thing finding those people yindao she paused and looked at him with a faint frown of curiosity yindao he said its my pet name for you in chinese yindao it means close friend sachs was very moved by this she squeezed his hand then stepped back lets go find the changs on the street in front of his safehouse the man of many names ang kwan gui the ghost john sung reached his hand out and shook that of alan coe who was it seemed an ins agent this gave him some concern for coe he believed had been part of a group of chinese and american law enforcers pursuing him overseas the task force had gotten close to him troublingly close but the ghosts bangshou had done some investigating himself and learned that a young woman whod worked in a company that the ghost did business with had been giving the ins and the police information about his snakehead operations the bangshou had kidnapped the woman tortured her to find out what shed told the ins and then buried her body on a construction site but apparently coe had no idea what the ghost looked like the snakehead recalled that hed been wearing the ski mask when theyd tried to kill the wus on canal street no one would have gotten a look at his face yindao explained what rhyme had learned and the three of them got into the police station wagon coe climbing into the back before the ghost could take that strategically better seat as if the agent didnt trust an illegal alien to be sitting behind him they pulled away from the curb from what yindao was telling coe the ghost understood that there would be other cops and ins agents present at the changs apartment but hed already made plans to get a few minutes alone with the changs when yindao had come to his apartment a few moments ago yusuf and another uighur had been there the turks had slipped into the bedroom before the ghost had opened the outer door and later when hed gone to get his gun and windbreaker hed told them to follow yindaos police car in brooklyn the turks and the ghost together would kill the changs glancing back he noticed that yusufs windstar was close behind them several cars away and what about yindao he might have to wait until tomorrow for their intimate liaison naixin he reflected all in good time images of fucking her now filled his thoughts he quickly lost himself in his continuing fantasies about yindao which had grown ever more powerful since hed first seen her on the beach swimming out to save him last night hed given her only a chaste acupressure treatment accompanied by some mumbo jumbo about it helping fertility their next gettogether would be very different he would take her to a place where he could play out all the fantasies that had been reeling through his thoughts yindao pinned beneath him writhing whimpering in pain screaming he was now powerfully aroused and used the excuse of turning around to speak to coe to hide the evidence of his desire he began a conversation about the inss guidelines for political asylum the agent was blunt and rude and clearly disdainful even of the man he thought the ghost to be a poor widower doctor a dissident who loved freedom seeking a better home for his family harmless and willing to work hard keep the piglets out of the country at all costs the agent was saying the message beneath his words was that they werent fit to be americans the politics and morality of illegal immigration meant nothing to the ghost but he wondered if coe knew that there were proportionally fewer chineseamericans on welfare than any other nationality including nativeborn whites did he know that the level of education was higher the incidence of bankruptcy and tax evasion far lower it would give him pleasure to kill this man and he was sorry that he couldnt take the time to make it a long death the ghost glanced at yindaos legs and felt the churning low in his belly again he recalled their sitting together in the restaurant yesterday sharing his honest assessment of himself break the cauldrons and sink the boats why had he opened up to her in this way it was foolish she might have caught on as to who he was or at least grown suspicious hed never been that frank with anyone in describing his philosophy of life why the answer had to be more than his desire to possess her physically hed felt passion for hundreds of women but had kept most of his inner feelings to himself before during and after the act no there was something else about yindao he supposed that it was this he recognized something of his own soul within her there were so few people who understood him whom he could talk with but yindao was this sort of woman he believed as coe was rambling on ad nauseam about the necessity of quotas and the burden on the social welfare rolls due to illegal immigration even citing facts and figures the snakehead was thinking about how sad it was that he couldnt take this woman back with him to show her the beauties of xiamen walk with her around nanputou temple a huge buddhist monastery and then take her for peanut soup or noodles near the waterfront but there was no doubt that he wouldnt hesitate to do what hed planned take her to a deserted warehouse or factory and spend an hour or so fulfilling his relentless fantasy and kill her afterward of course as yindao herself had told him she too would break the cauldrons and sink the boats after she learned he was the ghost she would not rest until she had killed or arrested him she had to die the ghost glanced back at coe with a smile as if acknowledging whatever the man was talking about the snakehead focused past the agent yusuf and the other uighur were staying right with the police car yindao had not noticed the van the ghost turned back his eyes swept over her he then muttered a few words what was that yindao asked him a prayer the ghost said i am hoping that guan yin will help us find the changs home whos that shes the goddess of mercy was the answer though it came not from the ghost but from helpful agent alan coe in the backseat chapter fortythree ten minutes later lon sellittos phone rang rhyme and cooper stared at it rapt in anticipation the detective took the call listened then his eyes closed and he broke into a smile they found the changs address he shouted and hung up that was one of the patrolmen down at the fifth he found a guy in owls head who owns two quickprint shops names joseph tan our guy gave him the line about the familyd be dead in a couple hours if we didnt find out where they were tan broke down and admitted hed gotten chang and his kid a job and set em up in an apartment he have an address yep two blocks from the sewage treatment plant god love crap what can i say rhyme thought of sonny lis equally irreverent plea to the god of cops guan di please let us find the changs and catch the fuck ghost he wheeled into position in front of the whiteboards he gazed at the chart the pictures of evidence sellitto said ill call bo and the ins and get everybody going but the criminalist said hold on a minute whats the matter an itch rhyme said slowly i have an itch his initial exhilaration at locating the changs faded rhymes head moved slowly from side to side as he took in thoms careful jottings and photographs and other bits of evidence from this case each adding to the whole grim story like hieroglyphs in ancient egyptian tombs he closed his eyes and let this information speed through his mind as fast as amelia sachs in her camaro heres the answer rhyme thought opening his eyes once again and staring at the entries the only problem is that we dont know the question thom appeared in the doorway time for some roms the aide said range of motion exercises were important for quads they kept the muscles from atrophying they improved the circulation they had a beneficial psychological effect too which rhyme publicly disavowed still his sessions were partially based on the premise that there would come a day when he himself would use his muscles again and so while he groused and complained and gave thom hell when the aide expertly performed the roms then measured the results he secretly looked forward to the daily exercises today however rhyme cast a strong glance at the aide and the young man got the message he retreated to the hallway whatre you thinking sellitto asked rhyme didnt answer engaged in its own range of motion exercises his mind unlike his lifeless limbs was limited by nothing infinite height infinite depth past and future the criminalist now mentally followed the trails of evidence that they had collected while working the ghostkill case some of them as wide as the east river some as narrow and frail as thread some helpful some as seemingly useless as the broken nerves that ran from lincoln rhymes brain south into his still body but even these he didnt neglect ghostkill easton long island crime scene two immigrants killed on beach shot

murder crime scene killed by new glock caliber govt issue tobacco flecks of yellow paper unidentified plant material herbs spices drugs magnesium silicate talc under fingernails the highway took a sweep around the brooklyn army facility and yindao steered the police station wagon onto an exit ramp about as fast as the ghost himself would have taken the turn in his bmw or porsche and descended into a pleasant neighborhood of tidy yards and redbrick buildings the ghost glanced into the side mirror casually and noticed that yusuf was still behind them then he looked at yindao the profile of her beautiful face her shimmery red hair pinned into a bun the outline of her breasts beneath her black tshirt he was startled by the blare of the womans phone ringing again she answered it rhyme yeah were in the neighborhood go ahead she fell silent excellent she turned to the ghost and coe hes found them a friend of changs got him an apartment and a job near here its not that far away she turned her attention back to the phone as she listened to what rhyme was saying though the expression on her face grew momentarily dark it seemed to the ghost that she had tensed in reaction to whatever the man was now telling her the ghost wondered if rhyme had learned something about him he grew vigilant sure rhyme she said finally got it yindao disconnected the call damn coe said i never thought hed really be able to do it the ghost looked at her so he got the exact address she didnt answer for a moment finally she said yeah then she began talking just chatting like a schoolgirl about her life in brooklyn the ghost saw at once that this wasnt her nature and he grew even more suspicious whatever rhyme had told her at the end of their conversation he now understood had nothing to do with the changs he noticed her hand slip to her leg which she scratched absently she left her hand near her hip and he realized that the gesture was merely an excuse to move her hand to her gun with his eyes still on the road the ghosts hand now slipped casually to his side and then curled behind his back until it was touching the grip of his glock pistol which rested in the waistband of his workout slacks under the windbreaker silence in the car as they drove for some minutes through residential streets it seemed to the ghost though that yindao was merely driving in circles he grew even more tense and cautious another turn and looking at the house numbers she pulled up to the curb put the car in park and set the brake pointing to a small brownstone apartment building thats it the ghost glanced quickly but kept his attention wholly on yindao not the shithole i was expecting coe said cynically lets go get this over with yindao said casually wait and she turned to her right to look at coe over the seat the ghost could see easily that it was a feint she moved fast far faster than the ghost had expected before the snakehead could even close his fingers around his own pistol yindao had swept hers from her holster and was swinging the gun toward him chapter fortyfour the ghost involuntarily flinched halfexpecting yindao to shoot him without warning which is what he of course would have done had the circumstances been reversed but the muzzle of the black weapon traveled past him in a blur and came to rest on the man in the backseat not an inch coe dont move an inch keep your hands where i can see em what what is this coe asked rearing back in shock dont move she snapped one hand disappears and youre dead i dont the agent blinked you understand me yes i fucking understand you he spat out angrily you better tell me what this is all about on the phone a minute ago lincoln had a little more to tell me than just directions to the changs he looked over the evidence a second time and made some phone calls you thought you covered it up pretty well didnt you put that down officer you cant he knows all about it how youre the one working for the ghost the agent swallowed are you out of your fucking mind youre his guardian angel youre protecting him thats why you fired that shot at the wus place on canal street you werent trying to hit him you were trying to warn him and youve been feeding him information you told him the wus were in the murray hill safehouse coe looked around nervously glancing outside thiss bullshit the ghost struggled to control his breathing his hands shook he was sweating furiously he wiped his palms on his slacks dont worry john yindao said to him hes not going to hurt anybody else she continued speaking to the agent and you got the ghost a nice new gun a glock a new which happens to be the issue weapon in the ins youre crazy officer weve had reports all along that the ghost was bribing people in the government over here we just never thought itd be an ins agent why all the trips to china coe according to peabody none of the other field agents travel over there as much as you do sometimes apparently on your own nickel too you were meeting your bosss snakeheads because my informant disappeared over there and i wanted to get the asshole who did it well rhymes contacting the fuzhou security bureau right now he wants to look over the evidence in that case too youre saying i killed my own informant a woman with children well look at the evidence she said coolly if anybody said they ever saw us together the ghost and me theyre lying that doesnt mean anything hes not going to meet anybody in person who could testify against him hes got intermediaries who do that youre dreaming officer no were just examining evidence yindao said rhyme just ran your cell phone call record a halfdozen calls to a deadletter answering service in new jersey in the past two days oh bullshit i use that for my local cis you never mentioned running informants before because it didnt have anything to do with this case yindao snapped were you going to call the ghost when we got to the changs apartment or were you just going to kill them yourself and us too coe swallowed im not saying another word to you i want to talk to a lawyer youll have plenty of time for that now right hand on the door handle it moves off by one inch ill park one in your arm understand me listen understand me the ghost looked at her flinty eyes and felt a chill himself he wondered if she hoped the man would reach for his gun so that she could shoot him yes coe muttered furious left hand thumb and index finger only on your weapon grip first move real slow disgust on his face coe carefully removed the weapon and handed it to her yindao pocketed it and then said out of the car she opened her door and stepped out then she opened his the pistol unerringly targeted on the agents chest slow he followed her out she gestured him around to the sidewalk face down the ghosts heart which had been pounding like a bird trapped in a glass case calmed slowly afraid you can be brave this was the height of irony he reflected he did indeed have americans on the take even within the ins a hearing officer included which is why hed been released so fast and easily yesterday morning but he didnt know the names of everyone his agents had bribed here and as yindao had just explained to coe he rarely had direct contact with any of them as for knowing the location of the wus safehouse in murray hill yindao herself had given that information away when shed asked if he wanted to join them there since coe was apparently working for him should he now try to save the man no better to cut him off the arrest would be a good diversion and yindao and the others would be less cautious thinking theyd caught the traitor he watched as on the sidewalk she expertly cuffed the agent holstered her weapon then pulled coe roughly to his feet the ghost rolled down his window and nodded toward the apartment do you want me to talk to the changs thats not their place yindao said its still a few blocks from here i lied i had to keep coe off guard i picked it because theres a police precinct house around the corner theyre going to hold him for the fbi to pick up the ghost looked coe over and added a dismayed tone to his voice as he said you were going to tell the ghost where they were those children you were going to let him kill those children youre despicable the agent stared back angrily for a moment until yindao roughly led him to the corner where she was met by three uniformed officers who took him into custody the ghost glanced behind him and saw at the end of the block yusufs van idling at the curb five minutes later yindao returned climbed in the car fired up the engine they resumed their drive she looked at the ghost and shook her head with a grim laugh im sorry are you all right although the incident had shaken her some she now seemed more like herself relaxed and confident yes the ghost laughed too you handled that perfectly youre quite an artist at your profession his smile faded a traitor within the ins all that crap about the ghost killing his informant he suckered us she picked up her cell phone and made a call okay rhyme coes in custody at the precinct no no problems john and i are going on to the changs now wherere the teams okay ill be there in three minutes were not going to wait for esu the ghost could be on his way there right now he could indeed the snakehead reflected yindao hung up so they would be there before everyone else his liaison with yindao would not have to wait after all hed kill the changs get yindao into the turks van and escape the ghosts hand went to her shoulder and squeezed it he felt his erection grow even more powerful thanks for coming along john she smiled at him what do i say for friend yindao he shook his head thats what a man would say to a woman you would say yinjing this was the word for male genitals yinjing she said im honored he said bowing his head slightly he looked over her red hair her pale skin her long legs your friend rhyme is quite a detective i would like to visit him after all this is over ill give you a card i have one in my purse good rhyme would have to die too because the ghost knew that he also was a man who would never stop until hed defeated his enemies pofu chen thou break the cauldrons and sink the boats too dangerous to stay alive shed told him that he was paralyzed how could one torture him the ghost wondered his face eyes tongue there would be ways depending on how much time he had fire was always good yindao turned abruptly down a oneway street and stopped she examined the address numbers and then continued halfway down the block she doubleparked and left a police id on the dashboard thats the house there she pointed to a threestory redbrick house several doors away the lights on in the groundfloor apartment modest but the ghost reflected far more luxurious than the yellowandbeige clapboard or cinderblock houses for which so many chinese have mao to thank they climbed out of the car and walked to the sidewalk paused stay out of sight she whispered and led him close to a line of boxwood hedges the ghost glanced back yusuf had parked and through the faint dusk light the ghost could just see him and the other turk he leaned close and smelled scented soap on her skin and sweat he found his arousal unabated and he pressed against her arm and hip as she examined the house she nodded at the bay window in front well go through the back door if its unlocked theyd be able to see us from the front and might run she gestured him to follow her around the back of the house nearest them then together they cut through the backyards to the changs they moved slowly so they wouldnt knock into anything in the neardark and announce their presence at the back door of the piglets apartment they paused and yindao looked into the window at a small kitchen no one was inside always look through the back window first she whispered my new police tactical rule she smiled wistfully at this though she didnt explain why come on she said move slow dont startle them tell them right away were here to help we want to protect them from the ghost and tell them theres a good chance for asylum the ghost nodded and tried to imagine what their reaction would be when sam chang and his wife saw who the police translator was yindao tried the door it was unlocked she pushed it open quickly so it wouldnt squeak he supposed how should he handle this he wondered he realized that he should probably debilitate yindao immediately she was too much of a risk merely to threaten the best thing to do he decided was to shoot her in the leg the back of her knee would be ironic he decided considering her arthritis he and the turks would kill the changs then back to the windstar they would speed to a safehouse or a deserted warehouse somewhere for his hours with yindao they walked silently through the small stifling kitchen on the stove a pot of water was heating half an onion sat on a cutting board a bunch of parsley nearby what he wondered had mrs chang been making for dinner yindao walked through the kitchen she paused at the doorway of the corridor that led to the living room gestured that he stop the turks he noticed were outside in the alley beside the house yindaos back was to him and he motioned them around to the front yusuf nodded and the two men moved off the ghost decided that he would let yindao precede him give her a minute or so inside the living room with the changs to put them at ease and to give the turks a chance to get in position at the front door then he would push inside and shoot her which would be a signal for the turks to break in and help him finish off the family hanging back the ghost reached under his windbreaker and pulled his gun from the waistband of his workout slacks alone yindao began to walk slowly into the dark corridor chapter fortyfive a sound nearby a footstep wondered sam chang sitting on his couch next to his youngest son in the front in the back they sat in the dim living room of their apartment clustered around the television on which a talk show was playing the volume was up but still chang had clearly heard a noise a snap yes a footstep what was it a phoenix rising from ashes a dragon angered that this heavy house had been built on his home the spirit of his father returning here to comfort them perhaps to warn them or maybe it was gui the ghost himself who had found them its my imagination chang thought except that he looked across the room and saw william where hed been reading a yearold auto magazine the boy was sitting up his neck lifted head swiveling slowly like a heron trying to identify the source of danger what is it husband meimei whispered now seeing both their faces she pulled poyee to her another click a footstep he couldnt tell where it came from sam chang was on his feet quickly william joined him ronald started to rise but his father waved the young boy into the bedroom a firm nod at his wife she gazed into his eyes for a moment then slipped into the bedroom with the toddler and her youngest son and shut the door silently do what i told you son william took his position beside the doorway that led to the back of the apartment holding an iron pipe chang had found in the backyard together father and son had planned what they would do if the ghost came for them chang would shoot the first person through the door either the ghost or his bangshou hearing the shot the others would probably hang back giving william time to grab the fallen mans pistol so he too would have a weapon chang then shut off two of the lights in the living room so that he would not be so evident a target but could see the assailant in the doorway in silhouette hed shoot for the head from here he couldnt miss sam chang crouched down behind a chair he ignored his exhaustion from the ordeal on the ship exhaustion from the loss of his father exhaustion from the erosion of his soul in these two short days and with his steady calligraphers hands pointed the weapon at the doorway inside the town house amelia sachs stepped forward slowly into the dark corridor wait here a minute john she whispered yes came the faint reply she stepped into the corridor hesitated only a moment and then called now what the ghost asked hesitating but instead of responding she spun back toward him raising her own pistol so quickly that the motion of the black weapon was a gray blur the abyss of the muzzle settled steadily on the ghosts chest before he could even lift his own glock sachss utterance hadnt been directed to the ghost at all but to the halfdozen men and women in full combat gear bo haumann and other emergency services unit tactical cops who pushed into the small kitchen they rushed in from the back door and past her from the living room guns pointed at the shocked ghosts face screaming their deafening litany down down down police drop your weapon on the floor down his pistol was torn from his hand and he was flung facedown to the floor and cuffed and frisked he felt a tug at his ankle and the model his lucky gun was lifted away then his pockets emptied weve got the subject down an officer shouted scene clear outside weve got two both down and locked meaning on their bellies with cuffs or plastic restraints on their wrists these were the two men in the windstar sachs had spotted following them more of the uighurs from the cultural center in queens shed assumed any other minders sachs bent down and whispered harshly into the ghosts ear any weve got the two men who were following us anybody else the ghost didnt answer and sachs said into her radio i only noticed the one van thats probably it then lon sellitto and eddie deng joined her from upstairs where theyd been waiting out of the way of the takedown team they looked the ghost over as he lay on the floor breathless from the shock and the rough treatment amelia sachs thought he looked harmless just a handsome but diminutive asian man with slightly graying hair sellittos radio blared with the message snipers one and two to base okay to stand down he turned the squelch down on his motorola and said base to snipers thats a roger the big detective added to the ghost they had you in their sights from the minute you stepped out of the station wagon if youd aimed your weapon in her direction youd be dead now lucky man they dragged the ghost into the living room and pushed him into a chair eddie deng read him his rights in english putonghua and minnanhua just to make sure he confirmed that he understood with surprisingly little emotion sachs observed considering the circumstances howre the changs sachs asked sellitto theyre fine two ins teamsre at their apartment it almost got ugly the fatherd got his hands on a gun and was ready to shoot it out but the agents spotted him through a window with a nightscope they got the apartments phone number and called to tell them that they were surrounded as soon as chang realized it was a legit ins team and not the ghost he gave it up the baby shes fine social workers on the way theyre going to keep them at their place in owls head until were through with this piece of shit nodding toward the ghost then we can go over there and debrief them the town house in which they now stood about a mile from the changs was a neatly decorated place full of flowers and tchotchkes a surprise to sachs considering that it was inhabited by one of the citys best homicide detectives so thiss your house lon she asked picking up a porcelain little bo peep statuette its my better others he answered defensively using the cops pet name for rachel his girlfriend hed combined better half and significant other in a rare display of levity theyd moved in together several months ago she inherited half of this stuff from her mother he took the figurine from sachs and replaced it carefully on the shelf this was the best we could do for a takedown site on such short notice we figured if we drove too far from owls head the prickd start to get suspicious it was all fake the ghost said amused it seemed to sachs that his english was better than the dialect hed affected when hed been portraying john sung you set me up guess we did lincoln rhymes call as theyd been driving through brooklyn on their way to the changs real apartment in owls head had been to tell sachs that he now believed the ghost was masquerading as john sung another team of ins and nypd cops was on their way to the changs real apartment to detain them sellitto and eddie deng were setting up a takedown site at sellittos house where they could collar him without the risk of bystanders getting killed in a shootout with the homicidal snakehead and capture any bangshous with him rhyme assumed that they would be following sachs from the safehouse in chinatown or else would be summoned by the snakehead via cell phone when they arrived at the changs as shed listened to rhymes voice it had taken all of sachss emotional strength to nod and pretend that coe was working for the ghost and that the man who was supposedly her friend her doctor the man sitting two feet from her and undoubtedly armed wasnt the killer theyd been seeking for the past two days she thought too of the acupressure session last night coming to him with her secret with her desperate hope of being cured she shivered with repulsion at the memory of his hands on her back and shoulders she thought too with horror that shed actually mentioned to him the location of the safehouse where the wus were staying when shed asked him if he wanted to join them the ghost asked how did your friend this lincoln rhyme know that i wasnt sung she picked up the plastic bag containing the contents of the ghosts pockets inside were the fragments of the shattered monkey amulet sachs held it close to his face the stone monkey she explained i found some trace under sonny lis fingernails it was magnesium silicate like talc rhyme found out that it came from soapstone which is what the amulets carved out of sachs reached out and roughly tugged down ghosts turtleneck revealing the red line from the leather cord what happened he ripped it off your neck and it broke she released the cloth and stepped away the ghost nodded slowly before i shot him he was clawing the ground i thought he was begging for mercy but then he looked up and smiled at me so li had scraped some of the soft stone under his nails intentionally to tell them the ghost was actually sung once coopers report on magnesium silicate told them that the substance might be soapstone rhyme remembered the contamination on sachss hands yesterday he realized that it mightve come from sungs amulet hed called the officers whod guarded sungs apartment and theyd confirmed that there was a back entrance to the place which meant that the ghost had been able to come and go without their seeing him hed also asked if there was a gardening shop near the place the likely source for the mulch that theyd found and was told about the florist on the ground floor of the apartment building then he checked calls to sachss cell phone the number of the cell thatd been used to call the uighur center showed up in her records the real john sung had been a doctor and the ghost was not but as sonny li had told rhyme everyone in china knew something about eastern medicine what the ghost had diagnosed about sachs and the herbs hed given her were common knowledge among anyone whod been treated regularly by a chinese doctor and your friend from the ins the ghost asked coe sachs replied we knew he didnt have any connection with you but i had to pretend coe was the spy we needed to make sure you didnt think we were on to you and we needed him out of the way if hed found out who you were he mightve gone after you again like he did on canal street we wanted a clean takedown and we didnt want him to go to jail for killing someone sachs couldnt resist adding even you the ghost merely smiled calmly when shed handed coe over to the three cops from the precinct house shed explained to him what was going on the agent of course had been shocked to have been sitting inches from the man whod killed his informant in china and had begun to complain angrily that he wanted to be part of the takedown but the order to keep him in protective custody had been issued by one police plaza and he wasnt going anywhere until the ghost was in custody then she looked him over shook her head in disgust you shot sung hid the body then shot yourself and swam back into the ocean you nearly drowned i didnt have much choice did i jerry tang abandoned me there was no way i was going to escape from the beach without masquerading as sung what about your gun stuffed it into my sock in the ambulance then i hid it in the hospital and picked it up after the ins officer released me ins officer she mused nodding you did get released awfully fast the ghost said nothing and she added well thats something else well look into then she asked everything you told me about john sung you made it up the ghost shrugged no what i told you about him was true before i killed him i made him tell me about himself about everyone who was on the raft about chang and wu enough so i could make my performance believable i threw out his picture id and kept the wallet and the amulet wheres his body another placid smile was his response his serenity infuriated her he was caught and was going to jail for the rest of his life and might possibly be executed but he looked as if he were only being inconvenienced by a late train fury seized her and she drew back her hand to strike him in the face but when he gave no reaction no cringe no squint she lowered her arm refusing to give him the satisfaction of stoically withstanding the blow sachss ringing phone intruded she stepped away and answered yes everyone having funrhymes voice demanded sarcastically having a picnic maybe taking in a movie forgetting about the rest of us rhyme we were in the middle of a takedown i suppose somebody was going to call me eventually and let me know what happened at some point no i wont thom im pissed off weve been a little busy here rhyme she answered just wondering what was going on im not psychic you know she knew hed already heard that none of their team was injured otherwise he wouldnt be riddling her with sarcasm she responded you can stow the attitude stow spoken like a true sailor sachs because we caught him she added i tried to get him to tell me where john sungs body is but he well we can figure that out sachs cant we it is obvious after all to some people maybe she reflected though she was delighted to hear his characteristic barbs rather than the flatline voice of earlier the criminalist continued in the trunk of the stolen honda and thats still out on the eastern end of long island she asked understanding finally of course where else would it be the ghost stole it killed sung and then drove east to hide it we wouldnt look in that direction wed assume he headed west into the city sellitto hung up his phone and pointed to the street sachs nodded and said ive got to go see some people rhyme see some people see you are treating this like a goddamn picnic who she considered for a moment and said some friends chapter fortysix she found the family standing outside a rundown house near owls head park the smell of sewage was heavy in the air from the treatment plant that had both betrayed them and saved their lives none of the family was in handcuffs and sachs was pleased at that she was also pleased that two uniformed nypd police were chatting goodnaturedly with the boy who mustve been the changs youngest son his father sam chang stood with his arms crossed grim and silent head down as an asianamerican man in a suit an ins agent she assumed talked with him jotting notes at his side was an unhappy stolid woman in her forties holding the hand of poyee sachs felt a huge thud within her when she saw the treasured child the toddler was adorable a roundfaced girl with silky black hair cut in bangs and short on the sides she wore red corduroy jeans and a hello kitty sweatshirt that was about two sizes too big for her a detective recognized sellitto and walked up to him and sachs the familys fine were taking them to ins detention in queens it looks like with changs record of dissident activity he was at tiananmen and has a history of persecution hes got a good shot at asylum you have caught the ghost sam chang asked her in unsteady english as he joined them he would have heard the news but understandably couldnt get enough reassurance that the killer was in fact safely in custody yes she said her eyes not on the man she was speaking to though but on poyee hes in custody chang said you were important with his capture sachs smiled i was at the party yep thank you the man seemed to want to add more but the english was perhaps too daunting he thought for a moment and then asked i may ask you the man old man killed in ghosts apartment building where is body your father yes at the city morgue downtown in manhattan he must have proper funeral is very important sachs said ill make sure hes not moved after youre through with the ins you can arrange to have a funeral home pick him up thank you a small blue dodge with a city of new york seal pulled up to the scene a black woman in a brown pants suit got out carrying an attaché case the woman spoke to the ins agent and sachs im chiffon wilson im a social worker with childrens services an id card was flashed youre here for the baby right chang looked quickly at his wife sachs asked youre taking her we have to cant she stay with them wilson shook her head sympathetically im afraid not they have no claim to her shes an orphaned citizen of another country shell have to go back to china sachs nodded slowly then gestured the social worker aside she whispered shes a girl you know what happens to baby girl orphans in china shell be adopted maybe sachs said dubiously i dont know about that i just know that im following the law look we do this all the time and weve never heard about any problems with the kids who go back to the recipient country recipient country the phrase troubled her as much as coes harsh undocumenteds sachs asked do you ever hear anything at all after they go back wilson hesitated no she then nodded to the ins agent who spoke in chinese to the changs meimeis face went still but she nodded and directed the baby to the social worker she will meimei said then frowned trying to think of the english words yes the social worker asked she will be good take care of yes she will she very good baby lost mother make sure she good take care of ill make sure meimei looked at the girl for a long moment then turned her attention back to her youngest son wilson picked up poyee who squinted at sachss red hair and reached out to grip a handful of the strands with curiosity when she tugged hard sachs laughed the social worker started for her car ting came a womans urgent voice sachs recognized the word for wait or stop she turned to see chang meimei walking toward them yes here there is this meimei handed her a stuffed animal toy crudely made a cat sachs believed she like this make her happy wilson took it and gave it to poyee the childs eyes were on the toy meimeis on the girl then the social worker strapped the child into a car seat and drove away sachs spent a half hour talking to the changs debriefing them seeing if she could learn anything else that might help shore up the case against the ghost then the exhaustion of the past two days caught up with her and she knew it was time to go home she climbed into the crime scene bus glancing back once to see the changs climb into an ins minibus she and meimei happened to catch each others eyes for an instant then the door closed the bus pulled into the street and the vanished the piglets the undocumenteds the family began their journey to yet another temporary home evidence exists independent of perpetrators of course and even though the ghost was in custody lincoln rhyme and amelia sachs spent the next morning processing the information that continued to arrive regarding the ghostkill case an analysis of the chemical markers in the c by the fbi had determined that the likely source of the plastic explosive used to blow up the ship was a north korean arms dealer who regularly sold weaponry to china recovery divers from the evan brigant had brought up the bodies of the crewmen and the other immigrants from the fuzhou dragon as well as the rest of the money about the cash had been logged into evidence and was being stored in an fbi safe deposit box they also had learned that ling shuibian the man who had paid the money to the ghost and had written him the letter that sachs found on the ship had an address in fuzhou rhyme assumed he was one of the ghosts little snakeheads or partners and he emailed the name and address to the fuzhou public security bureau with a note telling them about lings involvement with the ghost you want it on the chart thom asked nodding at the whiteboard write write he said impatiently they still would have to present the evidence to the prosecutors and reproducing the information as it was written on the whiteboards would be the most concise and helpful way to do this the aide took the marker and wrote down the information that had just come in ghost used new c to blow up ship checking origin of explosive through chemical markers north korean arms dealer is source large quantity of new us bills found in ghosts cabin total approximately approx in used chinese yuan found in cabin list of victims air charter details and bank deposit information checking name of sender in china ling shuibian resides in fuzhou name and address sent to local police captain alive but unconscious regained consciousness now in ins detention as thom was writing on the board rhymes computer beeped command email he snapped the computer accepted his gruff tone without affront and offered him the list of new messages command cursor down command doubleclick he read the message that had just come in ah rhyme announced i was right he explained to sachs that the body of john sung had in fact been found in the trunk of the red honda that the ghost had stolen as rhyme predicted the car had been found sunk in a pond only feet from easton beach so there would be one more murder count to add to the charges against kwan ang there was another message that interested him this one was from mel cooper who was back in his office at the nypd forensics lab in queens from m cooper to l rhyme re results of chromatographic and spectrometric analyses of department of justice pert evidence sample the officialsounding heading was in contrast to the informal message below it lincoln we have met the dynamite and it is phony dellrays butt wasnt in any danger the perp screwed up and used dummy explosive stuff used for training i tried to follow up and trace it but nobody has a database on fake bomb materials might be something to think about rhyme laughed some arms dealer had scammed fred dellrays attacker by selling him the fake explosives he was relieved that the agent hadnt really been at risk the doorbell rang and thom went down to see who it was heavy footsteps on the stairs two sets he believed they belonged to sellitto and dellray the cop walked with distinctive heavy footfalls and the agent took the stairs two at a time on his long legs for a moment rhyme otherwise reclusive was glad they were here hed tell them about the fake bomb theyd all get a laugh out of it but then he was aware of something else and an alarm bell went off inside his head the men had stopped outside the doorway and were whispering it was as if they were debating between themselves who should deliver bad news he was right about whom the steps belonged to a moment later the rumpled cop and the lanky fbi agent pushed into the bedroom hey linc sellitto said one look at their faces told rhyme that he was also right about the bad news sachs and rhyme exchanged a troubled glance rhyme looked from one to the other well christ one of you say something dellray uttered a long sigh finally the detective said they took him out of our jurisdiction the ghost hes being sent back to china what sachs gasped angrily dellray said bein escorted onto a flight later today the agent shook his head once it takes off hes free chapter fortyseven extradited rhyme asked thats the fuzzy little spin theyre putting on it dellray growled but we aint seen any single solitary arrest warrant for him issued by a chinese court what does that mean no arrest warrant sachs asked that his fucking guanxis saving his ass rhyme said bitterly dellray nodded less the country that wants the extradition shows valid paper we never send nobody back over no way well theyll try him wont they sachs asked nup i talked to our folks over there the highups in china want him back lemme quote for questioning in connection with irregular matters of foreign trade not a breath bout smugglin not a breath bout murder not a breath bout nothin rhyme was stunned hell be back in business in a month the changs the wus and who knew how many others were suddenly at risk again fred can you do anything he asked dellray was well thought of in the fbi he had friends at headquarters down on pennsylvania avenue and tenth in dc and had a good stockpile of his own guanxi but the agent shook his head squeezing the cigarette that rested behind his right ear this lil decision got made in state department washington not my washington i got no clout there rhyme remembered the quiet man in the blue suit webley from state goddamn sachs whispered he knew what rhyme asked the ghost knew he was safe at the takedown he was surprised but he didnt look worried hell he told me about killing sung and taking over his identity he was proud of it if anybody elsed been collared like that they wouldve listened to their rights and shut up he was goddamn bragging it cant happen rhyme said thinking of the poor people floating dead in the fuzhou dragon and lying bloody on the sand at easton beach thinking of sam changs father thinking of sonny li well it is extremely happenin dellray said hes leaving this afternoon and theres not a single damn thing we can do in the federal mens detention center in downtown manhattan the ghost sat across the table from his lawyer in a private conference room which the lawyers handheld scanner had assured them was not bugged they spoke in minnanhua chinese quietly and quickly when the lawyer was finished telling him about the procedure for his release into the hands of the fuzhou public security bureau the ghost nodded and then leaned close i need you to find some information for me the lawyer took out a pad of paper the ghost glanced at it once and frowned the lawyer put the foolscap away there is a woman who works for the police department i need her address home address her name is amelia sachs and she lives somewhere in brooklyn sachs and lincoln rhyme spelled like in poetry hes in manhattan the lawyer nodded then there are the two families i need to find he didnt think it wise to describe them as people he was trying to kill even in the absence of listening devices so he said simply the wus and the changs from the dragonthey might be in ins detention somewhere but maybe not what are you you dont need to ask questions like that the slim man fell silent then he considered when do you need this information the ghost wasnt sure exactly what awaited him in china he guessed that he would be back in one of his luxury apartments in three months but it could be less as soon as possible you will keep monitoring them and if the addresses change you will leave a message with my people in fuzhou yes of course then the ghost realized that he was tired he lived for combat he lived to play deadly games like this he lived to win but my how tired you got when you broke cauldrons and sank boats when you simply did not accept defeat now he needed rest his qi sorely needed to be replenished he dismissed his lawyer then lay back on the cot in the antiseptically clean square cell the room reminding him of a chinese funeral parlor because the walls were blue and white the ghost closed his eyes and pictured yindao lying in a room a warehouse a garage which had been arranged by a feng shui artist in the opposite manner of most practitioners the nature of his fantasy room would maximize anger and evil and pain the art of wind and water can do this too the ghost believed yin and yang opposites in harmony the supple woman tied down on the solid floor her fair skin in darkness hard and soft pleasure and agony yindao the thought of her would get him through the difficult coming weeks he closed his eyes weve had our differences alan rhyme said i guess ins agent coe was cautious he sat in rhymes bedroom in one of the uncomfortable wicker chairs that the criminalist had furnished the room with in hopes that it would discourage visitors from staying for long periods of time coe was suspicious about the invitation but rhyme didnt want there to be any chance of someones overhearing them this had to be a completely private conversation you heard about the ghosts release of course i heard about the ghost the man muttered angrily rhyme asked tell me whats your real interest in the case no bullshit coe hesitated and then said the informant of mine he killed thats it i said no bullshit theres more to it isnt there coe finally said yeah theres more what the woman who was the informant julia we were we were lovers rhyme carefully scanned the agents face although he was a firm believer in the overarching value of hard evidence he wasnt wholly skeptical to messages in faces and eyes he saw pain he saw sorrow after a difficult moment the agent said she died because of me we shouldve been more careful we went out in public some we went to xiamen this tourist city south of fuzhou therere lots of western tourists there and i thought we wouldnt be recognized but i think maybe we were there were tears in his eyes now i never had her do anything dangerous just glance at scheduling calendars from time to time she never wore a wire never broke into any offices but i shouldve known the ghost nobody could get away with even the slightest betrayal i am coming into town on bus im saying i saw crow on road picking at food another crow tried steal it and the first crow not just scare other away he chase and try to peck eyes out not leave thief alone the ghost got her coe said she left two daughters behind thats what you were doing overseas during the time you took off he nodded looking for julia but then i gave up on that and spent my time trying to get the children placed in a catholic home they were girls and you know how tough a time orphaned girl babies have over there rhyme said nothing at first though he was thinking back to an incident in his own life that was similar to coes tragedy a woman hed grown close to before the accident a lover she was a cop too a crime scene expert and she was dead because hed ordered her into a boobytrapped scene the bomb had killed her instantly did it work the criminalist asked with the girls no the state took them and i never saw them again he looked up and wiped his eyes so thats why i go on and on about undocumenteds as long as people pay fifty thousand bucks for an illegal trip to america were going to have snakeheads like the ghost killing anybody who gets in their way rhyme wheeled closer to coe how badly do you want to stop him he whispered the ghost with my whole soul that question had been easy rhyme now asked the hard one what are you willing to risk to do it but there was no hesitation as the agent said everything chapter fortyeight there may be a problem said the mans voice through the phone sitting in the middle row of a large ins van en route to kennedy airport sweating harold peabody nodded as if the caller could see him he didnt need problems not with this case problem i see go ahead the man beside peabody stirred at these words the quiet man in the navyblue suit webley who worked for the state department and whod made peabody s life unrefined hell since hed flown in from washington the afternoon of the day the fuzhou dragon sank webley turned his head toward peabody but remained stonyfaced a skill he was extremely good at alan coe disappeared said the caller the assistant special agent in charge of the fbis manhattan office we had a report that he was talking to rhyme then he vanished again okay peabody tried to figure out what this meant behind peabody and webley were two armed ins agents on either side of the ghost whose handcuffs kept clinking as he sipped his starbucks coffee the snakehead at least seemed untroubled by the talk of problems keep going peabody said into the phone we were keeping an eye on coe like you said cause we werent sure if hed try to do harm to the subject do harm to the subject what a fuckedup way to talk peabody thought and well we cant find him or rhyme either hes in a wheelchair how hard is it to keep track of him doughy peabody was drenched the storm had passed and though the skies were still overcast the temperature was in the high s and the government van had government airconditioning there was no surveillance order the asac reminded calmly we had to handle it informally his equanimity peabody realized put the fbi agent in control of the situation and he reminded himself to try to gin up some more power bureaucracy was such a bitch whats your situational assessment peabody asked thinking hows that for jargon you asshole you know coes had a topofthedeck priority to get the ghost himself true and rhymes the best forensic detective cop in the country weve been sniffing the thought that he and coere planning to take out the ghost how do you sniff a thought peabody wondered how do you mean with rhymes grip on forensics they mightve come up with some way to make it impossible to convict coe manipulate the evidence somehow what peabody scoffed ridiculous rhyme wouldnt do that these words now brought some emotion to webley he frowned why not the asac continued ever since his accident hes not the most stable person in the world hes always had this issue about killing himself and it sounds like he got pretty close to that chinese cop maybe when the ghost shot li it pushed him over the edge this sounded crazy but who knew peabody caught people trying to sneak into the country illegally and sent them back home he didnt know the workings of the criminal mind in fact he had no experience with psychology whatsoever except resentfully paying his exwifes shrink bills as for coe well he definitely was unstable enough to try to cap the ghosts ass hed already tried to take him out at the wus apartment on canal street whats dellray say peabody asked hes operational in the field at this time hes not returning calls doesnt he work for you dellray pretty much works for dellray said the asac whatre you suggesting we do peabody asked using his wrinkled tan jacket to wipe his face do you think coes following you peabody glanced around him at the billion cars on the van wyck expressway like i could fucking tell he answered giving up entirely on the language of highlevel government if hes going to make a move itll have to be at the airport tell your people to look out for him ill tell port authority security too i just dont see it happening thanks for the assessment harold but then again it was rhyme who collared the prick in the first place not you the line went dead peabody turned around and studied the ghost who asked what was that about nothing peabody asked one of the agents we have body armor in the back naw one answered then well im in a vest me too said the other agent the tone of their voices said that they werent about to give them up nor would peabody ask his agents to do so if coe made a move on the ghost and he was successful well that was just the way it was he and rhyme would have to take the consequences he leaned forward and snapped at the driver cant you do anything about the goddamn airconditioning the shackles binding his wrists felt light as silk they would come off as soon as he was at the doorway of the airliner that would carry him back home from the beautiful country and because he knew that the metal restraints had already ceased to exist walking down the international corridor of jfk airport he was reflecting on how flying in the far east had changed thinking of the early days when he would fly on the national airline of china caac which every englishspeaking chinese knew stood for chinese airliners always crash things were different now today it would be northwest airlines to la then a china air flight to singapore with a connection to fuzhou business class all the way the entourage was a curious one the ghost two armed guards and the two men in charge peabody from the ins and the man from the united states department of state they were now joined by two armed port authority guards big men nervous as squirrels who kept their hands near their weapons as they surveyed the crowd the ghost didnt exactly know what the uneasiness and firepower were all about but he supposed that thered been death threats against him well that was nothing new hed lived with death since the night the four olds murdered his family footsteps behind mr kwan mr kwan they turned to see a thin chinese man in a suit walking quickly toward them the guards drew their weapons and the approaching man stopped eyes wide its my lawyer the ghost said you sure peabody asked what do you mean am i sure peabody nodded the man forward frisked him despite the ghosts protests and let him and the snakehead step to the side of the corridor the ghost turned his ear toward the lawyers mouth go ahead the changs and the wus are out on bond pending the hearing it looks like theyll be granted asylum the wus are in flushing queens the changs are back in owls head the same apartment and yindao the ghost whispered the man blinked at the crude word the snakehead corrected himself i mean the sachs woman oh i have her address too and lincoln rhymes do you want me to write them down for you no just tell them to me slowly ill remember them after only three repetitions the ghost had memorized them he said youll find your money in the account no need to say how much money or which account the lawyer nodded and with a glance at the ghosts guards turned and left the group continued down the corridor ahead of him the ghost could see the gate the pretty clerks behind the checkin counter and through the window he caught a glimpse of the that would soon take him west like monkey making his pilgrimage at the end of which he found enlightenment and contentment his boarding pass was protruding from his shirt pocket he had yuan in his wallet he had a us government escort he was going home to his apartments his women his money he was free he then sudden motion somebody was moving toward him fast and the guards were pulling him aside their weapons coming out of their holsters again the ghost gasping at the shock thought that he was going to die he muttered a fast prayer to his guardian yi the archer but the attacker stopped short breathing unsteadily the ghost began to laugh hello yindao she was wearing jeans tshirt and windbreaker her badge around her neck hands on her hips one of which rested very close to her pistol the policewoman ignored the ghost and glanced at the nervous young ins agents you better have a damn good reason for drawing down on me they started to reholster their weapons but peabody gestured for them not to the ghost focused past yindao behind her was a tall black man in a white suit and noisy blue shirt the fat cop whod arrested him in brooklyn was here as well as were several uniformed city policemen but the one person in this retinue who captured his full attention was a handsome darkhaired man about the ghosts age sitting in a complicated bright red wheelchair to which his arms and legs were strapped a trim young man his aide or nurse stood behind the chair this was of course lincoln rhyme the ghost studied the curious man whod miraculously discovered the location of the fuzhou dragon at sea whod found the wus and the changs and who had actually succeeded in capturing the ghost himself which no other policeman in the world had ever been able to do harold peabody wiped his face with his sleeve surveyed the situation and motioned the guards back they put their weapons away whats this all about rhyme but the man ignored him and continued to study the snakehead carefully the ghost felt a tickle of unease but then he mastered the sensation he had guanxi at the highest level he was immune even to the magic of lincoln rhyme whom he asked bluntly who exactly are you a consultant a private detective me the cripple responded im one of the ten judges of hell the ghost laughed so you inscribe names in the register of the living and the dead yes thats exactly what i do and youve come to see me off no he answered peabody said cautiously and what do you want the state department bureaucrat said impatiently all of you now just clear on out of here hes not getting on that airplane rhyme said oh yes he is said the dour official he stepped forward plucking the ghosts ticket from his pocket and striding toward the gate agent you take one more step toward that airplane the fat policeman said to him and these officersre authorized to arrest you me webley muttered angrily peabody gave a sharp laugh and looked at the black agent dellray what is this crap probably oughta listen to my friend here harold in your best innerest believe you me peabody said five minutes a regretful frown crossed lincoln rhymes face oh im afraid it may take a little longer than that chapter fortynine the snakehead was far smaller and more compact than lincoln rhyme had expected this was a phenomenon he recalled from his days running the nypd forensics unit the perpetrators he pursued took on disproportionate stature in his mind and when he saw them in person for the first time usually at trial he was often surprised at how diminutive they were the ghost stood shackled and surrounded by law enforcers concerned yes but still in control serene shoulders and arms relaxed the criminalist understood immediately how sachs could have been suckered by him the ghosts eyes were those of a healer a doctor a spiritual man they would dole out apparent comfort and invite sharing confidences but knowing the man now rhyme could see in the placid gaze evidence of a relentless ego and ruthlessness okay sir whats this all about asked peabodys friend webley from state as rhyme now thought of him echoing the mans own pompous identification of himself in rhymes living room the other day rhyme said to the two men you know what happens sometimes in our line of work gentlemen i mean forensic science webley from state started to speak but peabody waved him silent rhyme wouldnt have let anyone rush him anyway nobody hurried lincoln rhyme when he didnt wish to be hurried we sometimes lose sight of the big picture all right i admit im the one who loses sight more than say my sachs here she looks at motive she looks at why people do what they do but thats not my nature my nature is to study each piece of evidence and put it where it belongs he glanced at the ghost with a smile like placing a stone on a weichi board the snakehead who had brought so much sorrow to so many lives said nothing gave no acknowledgment the gate agent announced preboarding of the northwest airlines flight to los angeles we figured out the clues just fine a nod toward the ghost after all here he is caught right thanks to us and weve got enough evidence to convict him and sentence him to death but what happens hes going free hes not going free peabody rejoined hes going back to stand trial in china free from the jurisdiction where hes committed a number of serious felonies in the past few days rhyme corrected sharply do we have to squabble this was too much for webley from state get to the point or im putting him on that plane rhyme continued to ignore the man he had the stage and wasnt relinquishing it the big picture big picture i was thinking how bad i felt here id found out where the fuzhou dragon was and sent the coast guard after her but what happens he scuttles it killing all those people peabody shook his head of course youd feel bad he said with some sympathy we all felt bad but rhyme kept steaming forward big picture lets think about it its tuesday just before dawn on board the dragon youre the ghost a wanted man wanted for capital offenses and the coast guard is a half hour away from interdicting your smuggling ship what would you have done the gate agent continued with the boarding of the flight peabody sighed webley from state muttered something sotto voce rhyme knew it was not complimentary the ghost stirred but he remained silent since no one was helping him out rhyme continued i personally wouldve taken my money ordered the dragon back out to sea full speed ahead and escaped to shore in one of the life rafts the coast guard and cops and ins wouldve been so busy with the crew and immigrants i could easilyve gotten to land and been halfway to chinatown before they realized i was gone but whatd the ghost do rhyme glanced at sachs who said he locked the immigrants in the hold sank the ship and then hunted down the survivors and he risked getting caught or killed to do it and when he didnt kill them all on the shore rhyme took over the narrative he followed them to the city and tried to murder them there why on earth would he do that well they were witnesses peabody said he had to kill them ah whythats the question that nobodys asking rhyme asked what would it gain him peabody and webley from state were silent rhyme continued all that the passengers on the ship could do is to testify in one case of human smuggling but there were already a dozen warrants against him for smuggling around the world homicide charges too look at the interpol red notice it made no sense to go to all that trouble to murder them just because they were witnesses he paused a histrionic few seconds but killing them makes perfect sense if the passengers were his intended victims rhyme could see two different reactions in their faces peabody was perplexed and surprised in webley from states eyes there was a different look he knew exactly where rhyme was going victims rhyme continued thats a key word see my sachs found a letter when she went for her little swim in the dragon the ghost whod been staring at sachs turned slowly toward rhyme when he heard this a letter peabody asked it said more or less heres your money and a list of the victims youll be taking to america are we catching on to the big picture gentlemen the letter didnt say passengers or immigrants or piglets or your own indelicate term peabody undocumenteds the letter said quote victims i didnt realize at first when i had the letter translated that that was the exact word the writer used and the big picture becomes a lot clearer when we look at who those victims were they were all chinese dissidents and their families the ghost isnt just a snakehead hes also a professional killer he was hired to murder them this man is crazy the ghost snapped hes desperate i want to leave now but rhyme said the ghost was planning all along to scuttle the dragon he was only waiting until the ship was close enough to shore so that he and his bangshou could make it to land safely but a few things went wrong we found the ship and sent the coast guard in so he had to act sooner than hed planned some of the immigrants escaped then the explosive was too powerful and the ship sank before he could get his guns and money and find his assistant thats absurd muttered webley from state beijing wouldnt hire anybody to kill dissidents its not the s anymore beijing didnt do it rhyme responded as i suspect you probably know webley no we found out who sent the ghost his instructions and his money ling shuibian is his name the ghost glanced desperately at the boarding gate rhyme continued i sent the fuzhou police an email with lings name and address and told them that i thought he was one of the ghosts partners but they sent back a message saying i must be mistaken his address was a government building in fuzhou ling is the fujian governors assistant in charge of trade development whats that mean peabody asked that hes a corrupt warlord rhyme snapped isnt it obvious he and his peoplere getting millions in kickbacks from businesses all along the southeastern coast of china hes probably working with the governor but i dont have any evidence about that not yet anyway impossible offered webley though with much less bluster than hed displayed earlier rhyme said not at all sonny li told me about fujian province its always been more independent than the central government likes it has the most connections with the west and taiwan more money too and the most active dissidents beijing is always threatening to crack down on the province nationalize businesses again and put its own people in power if that happens ling and his boys lose their income stream so how to keep beijing happy kill the most vocal dissidents and what better way to do it than by hiring a snakehead if they die en route to another country its their own fault not the governments and more likely than not sachs said nobodyd even know that they died theyd be just one more shipload of the vanished nodding at webley from state she reminded rhyme oh right the last piece of the puzzle whys the ghost going free he said to webley youre sending him back to keep ling and his people in fujian happy to make sure our business interests arent affected southeast china is the biggest site for us investment in the world thats bullshit the man snapped in reply the ghost said this is ridiculous its the lie of a desperate man nodding toward rhyme wheres the proof proof well we have the letter from ling but if you want more remember harold you told me that other shiploads of the ghosts immigrants disappeared in the past year or so i checked the statements from their relatives in the interpol database most of those victims were dissidents from fujian too thats not true the ghost said quickly then theres the money rhyme said ignoring the snakehead money the smuggling fee when sachs went for her little paddle in the atlantic she found us dollars and maybe worth of old yuan i invited a friend of mine from the ins over to my place to help me look at the evidence he who peabody asked sharply then he understood alan coe it was him wasnt it a friend lets leave it at that in fact the friend was agent coe whod also spent the day stealing classified ins files which would probably cost him his job if not earn him a jail sentence this was the risk that rhyme had referred to earlier and that coe had been only too happy to assume the first thing he noticed was the money he told me that when immigrants contract with snakeheads they cant pay the down payment in dollars because there are no dollars in china not enough to pay for transit to the us anyway they always pay in yuan with a shipload of twentyfive or so immigrants that means sachs shouldve found at least a half million in yuan just for the down payment so why was there so little chinese money on board because the ghost charged next to nothing to make sure that the dissidents on the hit list could afford to make the trip the ghost was making his profit from the fee to kill them the well that was the down payment from ling i checked the serial numbers on some of the bills and according to the federal reserve that cash was last seen going into the bank of south china in singapore which happens to be used regularly by fujianese government ministries more rows were boarding the ghost was truly desperate now peabody had fallen silent and was considering all this he seemed to be wavering but the state department official was resolute hes getting on that plane and thats all there is to it rhyme squinted and cocked his head how high are we now on the ladder of evidence sachs how about the c right the explosive used to blow up the ship the fbi traced it to a north korean arms dealer who regularly sells to guess who peoples liberation army bases in fujian the government gave the ghost the c rhyme closed his eyes for a brief moment they sprang open then theres the cell phone that sachs found at the beach it was a governmentissue satellite phone the network he used was based in fuzhou the trucks rhyme sachs reminded tell them about the trucks rhyme nodded never able to resist delivering a lesson in his craft interesting thing about crime scene work sometimes what you dont find at a scene is as important as what you do find i was looking at our evidence board and i realized that something was missing where was the evidence of the trucks for the immigrants my ins friend told me that ground transport is part of the smuggling contract but there werent any trucks the only vehicle at the beach was jerry tangs to pick up the ghost and his bangshou well why no trucks because the ghost knew the immigrants would never get to shore alive the line of boarding passengers was shrinking webley from state leaned down and whispered viciously into rhymes face youre in way over your head here mister you dont know what youre doing rhyme gazed back at him in mock contrition nope i dont know a thing not about world politics not about les affaires detat im just a simple scientist my knowledge is woefully limited to things like say fake dynamite which shut up webley from state instantly thiss where i come in dellray said unfortunately for you folks peabody cleared his throat uneasily what are you talking about he asked but only because the script called for him to pose the question the answer to which was the last thing in the world he wanted to hear the bomb in freds car well the results came back from the lab about the dynamite interesting it wasnt dynamite at all it was sawdust mixed with resin fake used for training my ins friend told me that immigration has its own bomb squad and bomb training facility in manhattan and he stopped by the place this morning they have dummy explosives on hand to teach rookies recognition and handling the sticks in freds car match the samples from there and the numbers on the detonator are similar to some he found in an ins evidence locker they were confiscated last year when some agents arrested a dozen illegal russian nationals in coney island rhyme enjoyed the flicker of horror in peabody s eyes the criminalist was surprised that webley from state could still manage to look so indignant if youre suggesting that anyone in the federal government would hurt a fellow agent hurt how could a small detonator hurt anyone it was just a firecracker really no the important criminal charge id think of would be felonious interference with an investigation because it would seem to me that you mightve wanted fred off the case temporarily and why cause whitesuited dellray took over stepping forward driving webley from state against the wall i was makin waves gettin together the spectac team who woulda taken the ghost out no nonsense not pissin around like the ins folk were doing hell i think thats why i was on the case in the first place i dint know beans bout human smugglin an when i arranged for an expert dan wong to take over the case next thing we know his butts on a plane headin west rhyme summarized fred had to go so you could dispose of the ghost the way youd planned catching him alive and getting him safely out of the country as part of a deal between the state department and ling in fujian a nod toward the plane just like whats happened i didnt know anything about killing dissidents peabody blurted that was never expressed to me i swear watch it webley from state muttered threateningly all they said was that they needed to keep the justice department minimized there were important national security issues at stake nobody mentioned business interests nobody mentioned harold webley from state cracked the whip then he turned away from the sweaty bureaucrat to rhyme and said in a reasonable voice look if im saying if any of this is true you have to realize theres a lot more to it than just this one man lincoln the ghosts covers been blown hes not going to be sinking any more ships nobodyll hire him as a snakehead after this but the diplomat continued smoothly if we send him back thatll keep the chinese happy beijing wont crack down on the provinces and the end resultll be a better economy for the people there and with more american influence therell be improved human rights he lifted his hands palms up sometimes we have to make hard choices rhyme nodded so what youre saying is that its essentially an issue of politics and diplomacy webley from state smiled pleased that rhyme finally understood exactly for the good of both countries its a sacrifice sure but its one that i think has to be made rhyme considered this for a moment then he said to sachs we could call it the historically unprecedented great sacrifice for the beneficial good of the people webley from states face twisted at rhymes sarcasm see the criminalist explained politics are complicated diplomacy is complicated but crime is simple i dont like complicated things so heres the deal either you hand the ghost over to us for prosecution in this country or you let him fly back home and if you do that we go public with the fact youre releasing a perp in a multiple homicide for political and economic reasons and that you assaulted an fbi agent in the process he added flippantly your choice up to you dont threaten us youre just fucking city cops said webley from state the gate agent announced the final boarding of the flight now the ghost was scared sweat on his forehead face dark with rage he walked up to webley and raised his hands the shackles jangling he whispered angrily to him the bureaucrat ignored him and turned back to rhyme how the hellre you going to go public nobodys going to be interested in a story like this you think its fucking watergate were sending a chinese national back to his homeland to stand trial for various crimes harold rhyme asked miserable peabody said im sorry theres nothing i can do so thats your answer rhyme replied smiling faintly thats all i wanted a decision you made one good he thought with both amusement and sorrow that this was very much like playing a game of weichi thom could you please show him our handiwork rhyme asked his aide the young man took an envelope out of his pocket and handed it to webley from state he opened it inside was a long memo from rhyme to peter hoddins international desk reporter with the new york times it described in detail exactly what rhyme had just told peabody and webley peter and i are good friends thom said i told him we might have an exclusive about the fuzhou dragon sinking and that it had implications all the way to washington he was very intrigued peters a good reporter rhyme said then added proudly he was shortlisted for a pulitzer webley from state and peabody looked at each other for a moment then they retired to the corner of the nowempty gate area and each made phone calls we must have mr kwan on board the aircraft now the gate agent said finally the two federal telephones were hung up and a moment later rhyme had his answer webley from state turned without a word and stalked down the corridor to the main lobby wait the ghost cried there was a deal we had a deal the man kept going tearing up rhymes memo as he walked not even pausing as he tossed it toward a trash container sellitto told the gate agent to close the door to the aircraft mr kwan wouldnt be making the flight the ghosts eyes bored into rhymes and his shoulders slumped a clear flag of defeat but an instant later it seemed that the despair from this loss was immediately balanced by the hope of future victory the yang was balanced by a surge of yin as sonny li mightve said the snakehead turned toward sachs he looked her over with a chill smile im patient yindao im sure well meet again naixin all in good time all in good time amelia sachs returned his gaze and said the sooner the better her eyes rhyme decided were infinitely colder than his the uniformed nypd cops took custody of the snakehead i swear that i didnt know what this was all about harold peabody said they told me that but rhyme had grown weary of the verbal fencing without a word he moved his finger slightly on the touchpad to turn the storm arrow away from the bureaucrat it was amelia sachs who provided the final interaction between the various branches of government regarding kwan ang gui the ghost she held out her hand to troubled harold peabody and asked could you give me the cuff keys please if you want the shackles back after hes booked ill leave them at mens detention for you chapter fifty several days later the ghost had been arraigned and was being held without bail the laundry list of offenses was long state and federal charges for murder human smuggling assault firearms possession money laundering dellray and his bosses at justice had pulled some strings at the us attorneys office and in exchange for his testimony against the ghost sen zijun captain of the late fuzhou dragon was given immunity from prosecution on the charges of human smuggling he would testify at the ghosts trial and following that be deported to china rhyme and sachs were presently alone in his bedroom and the policewoman was looking herself over in a fulllength mirror you look fine the criminalist called she was due to make an appearance in court in an hour it was an important session and she was preoccupied thinking about her impending performance before the judge she shook her head uncertainly i dont know amelia sachs whod never looked back when she gave up modeling called herself a jeans and sweats girl presently she was dressed in a crisp blue suit white blouse and my god rhyme now observed a pair of highly sensible navyblue joan davids with heels that boosted her height to over six feet her red hair was perfectly arranged on top of her head still she remained his sachs her silver earrings were in the shape of tiny bullets the phone rang and rhyme barked command answer phone click lincoln a womans voice asked through the speaker dr weaver rhyme said to the neurosurgeon sachs turned her attention away from couture and sat down on the edge of the flexicair bed i got your phone call the doctor said my assistant said it was important is everything all right fine rhyme said youre following the regimen i gave you no alcohol plenty of sleep then she added with some humor no you tell me thom are you there hes in the other room rhyme responded laughing no ones here to blow the whistle on me except sachs of course but she wasnt going to snitch id like you to come into the office tomorrow for the final checkup before the surgery i was thinking doctor yes rhyme held sachss eye ive decided not to have the operation youre im canceling forfeiting my room deposit he joked and down payment silence for a moment then you wanted this more than any patient ive ever had i did want it thats true but ive changed my mind youll recall ive told you all along that the risks were high is that why he looked at sachs he said only in the end i guess i dont see that much of a benefit i think thiss a good choice lincoln its the wise choice she added were making a lot of progress with spinal cord injuries i know you read the literature i keep my finger on the pulse true he responded enjoying the irony of the metaphor but therere new things happening every week call me whenever you like we can think about options in the future or just call me to talk if you want to yes id like that id like it too goodbye lincoln goodbye doctor command disconnect silence filled the room then a flutter of wings and a shadow disturbed the peace as a peregrine falcon landed on his window ledge they both stared at the bird sachs asked are you sure about this rhyme im with you a hundred percent if you want to go ahead with it he knew that she would be but he knew too without a doubt that he didnt want the surgery now embrace your limitations fate make you this way loaban and make you this way for purpose maybe you best detective you can be because of what happen your life balanced now im saying im sure he told her she squeezed his hand then looked out the window again at the falcon rhyme watched the oblique pale light hitting her face with the demure illumination of a vermeer painting finally he asked sachs are you sure you want to do this he nodded toward the file on the table nearby which contained a picture of poyee a number of affidavits and officiallooking documents the top sheet of paper was headed petition for adoption then she glanced at rhyme the look in her eye told him that she too was sure about the decision shed made sitting in the judges chambers sachs smiled down at poyee the treasured child who sat beside her in the chair where the social worker had deposited her a few moments before the girl played with her stuffed kitten ms sachs this is a rather unorthodox adoption proceeding but i assume you know that justice margaret bensonwailes a heavyset woman sat behind her abysmally cluttered desk in the dark monolith of manhattan family court yes your honor the woman bent forward and read some more all i can say is in the past two days ive talked to more people from human services family services city hall albany one police plaza and the ins than i talk to in a month in most placements tell me officer hows a skinny girl like you get so much pull in this city im lucky i guess more to it than that the judge said returning to the file i hear good things about you apparently sachs too had good guanxi her connections reached from fred dellray to lon sellitto to alan coe who was far from being fired taking over earlyretiring harold peabodys job at the ins in the space of several days the miles of red tape that accompany most adoptions had been shredded the jurist continued you understand of course that the welfare of this child comes first no matter what and if im not convinced that the disposition is in her best interest i will not sign the papers the woman had the same benevolently gruff air that lincoln rhyme had mastered i wouldnt want it any other way your honor like many judges sachs had learned bensonwailes was prone to lecture the woman eased back in the chair and addressed her audience now the adoption procedure in new york involves taking a home study undergoing training and spending time with the child and usually a threemonth probation period i spent all morning reviewing papers and reports talking to the social workers and the law guardian that we appointed for the girl ive gotten very good reports but thiss been moving faster than the bulls slide after michael jordan left so heres what im going to do ill grant foster guardianship for a threemonth period subject to supervision by the department of social services at the end of that time if there are no problems i will grant permanent adoption subject to the standard threemonth probation period hows that sound to you sachs nodded it sounds fine your honor the justice examined sachss face carefully then with a glance at poyee she jabbed her intercom button and said send in the petitioners a moment later the door to the justices chambers opened and sam and meimei chang cautiously entered beside them was their attorney a chinese man in a light gray suit and a shirt so boldly red that it mightve come from fred dellrays closet chang nodded to sachs who rose stepped forward and shook his hand then his wifes meimeis eyes went wide when she saw the child whom sachs handed off to her she hugged poyee fiercely the judge said mr and mrs chang do you speak english i do some chang said my wife not good you are mr sing the judge asked the lawyer yes your honor if you could translate certainly usually the adoption process in this country is arduous and complicated it is virtually impossible for a couple of uncertain immigration status to be given adoptive custody a pause while sing translated meimei nodded but weve got some unusual circumstances here another pause and the chinese rattled explosively off sings tongue now both chang and his wife nodded they remained silent meimeis eyes brightened though and her breathing was coming fast she wanted to smile sachs could see but she restrained herself im told by immigration and naturalization that youve applied for asylum and because of your dissident status in china that it will probably be granted that reassures me that you can bring some stability into the childs life as does the fact that both you and your son mr chang are employed yes sir maam not sir sternly corrected justice bensonwailes a woman whose orders in court undoubtedly needed to be issued only once i am sorry maam the judge now repeated for the changs what shed told sachs about the probation and adoption their understanding of english was apparently good enough so that they could comprehend the ultimate meaning of the justices words without the need for complete translations meimei began to cry quietly and sam chang hugged her smiling and whispering in her ear then meimei stepped up to sachs and hugged her xiexie thank you thank you the justice signed a document in front of her you can take the child with you now she said dismissing them attorney sing see the clerk about the disposition of the paperwork yes your honor sam chang led his family now officially increased by one to the parking lot near the blackstone family court building this had been his second court appearance today earlier chang had testified at the wu familys preliminary hearing their asylum bid was less certain than the changs but their lawyer was guardedly optimistic that they would remain in the us the changs and the policewoman now paused beside her yellow sports car william whod been sullen and moody all day brightened when he saw it a camaro ss he said the woman laughed you know american cars whod drive anything else he asked derisively the lean boy examined the sports car closely this is fucking sweet william chang whispered threateningly and received back a cold uncomprehending look from his son meimei and the children continued on to their van and chang remained beside the policewoman translating his words slowly chang said to the redhaired woman everything you do for us you and mr rhyme i am not knowing how to thank you and the baby see my wife she has always i understand the woman said her voice was clipped and he realized that though she appreciated the gratitude she was uneasy receiving it she dropped into the seat of her car wincing slightly from a sore joint or pulled muscle the engine fired up with a powerful rattling noise and she drove quickly out of the parking lot spinning the tires as she accelerated in a moment the car was out of sight the family was due soon at a funeral home in brooklyn where the body of chang jiechi was being prepared but sam chang remained where he was gazing at the complex of gray courthouses and office buildings around him he needed a moment of solitude this man caught between the yin and the yang of life how badly he wanted to slough off the hard the masculine the traditional the authoritarian the aspects of his past life in china and embrace the artistic the feminine the intuitive the new all that the beautiful country represented but how difficult it was to do this mao zedong he reflected had tried to abolish old customs and ideas with a simple decree and had nearly destroyed his country as a result no chang reflected the past was with us always but he didnt know not yet how to find a place for it in his future it could be done look at how close in proximity was the forbidden palace with its ancient ghosts to tiananmen square with its very different spirits but he suspected that this reconciliation would be a process that lasted for the rest of his life here he was half a world away from everything familiar steeped in confusion and beset by challenges and pummeled too by the uncertainty of life in a strange land but some things sam chang did know that at the autumn tombsweeping festival he would find comfort in tidying his fathers grave leaving an offering of oranges and conversing with the mans spirit that poyee the treasured child would grow up to become a woman in complete harmony with this remarkable place and time the beautiful country at the start of a new century easily embracing the souls of both hua and meiguo china and america yet transcending each that william would eventually get a room of his own and discover something other than his father to be mad about but that little by little his anger would lift away like a phoenix rising from cooling ash and he too would find a balance and that chang himself would work hard at his job continue his efforts as a dissident and on his days off would enjoy modest pleasures strolling with meimei through their neighborhood visiting parks and art galleries and passing hours in places like the home store where they would make their purchases or just walk up and down the aisles examining the bounty on the shelves finally sam chang turned away from the tall buildings and returned to the van summoned by his desire to be with his family again still dressed for her undercover work as a manhattan businesswoman amelia sachs strode into the living room so the criminalist asked wheeling to face her a done deal she answered disappearing upstairs she returned a few minutes later as jeans and sweats as she could be he said you know sachs you couldve adopted the baby yourself if youd wanted he paused i mean we couldve done that i know why didnt you want to she considered her answer then said the other day i laid some brass on the deck with a perp in a chinatown alleyway then i went swimming ninety feet underwater then was point on a takedown team i cant not do things like that rhyme she hesitated as she thought of how best to summarize her feelings then laughed my father told me therere two kinds of drivers those who check their blind spot when they change lanes and those who dont im not a checker if i had a baby at home id be looking over my shoulder all the time that wouldnt work he understood exactly what she meant but he asked playfully if you dont check your blind spot arent you worried about an accident the trick is just to drive faster than everybody else that way theres no chance anybodyll be in your blind spot when you move they cant getcha he said yep youd be a good mother sachs and youll be a good father itll happen rhyme but lets give it a couple of years right now weve got a few other things to do with our life dont you think she nodded at the whiteboard on which were written thoms charts for the ghostkill case the same whiteboard that had been covered with notations from a dozen prior cases and would be filled with those from dozens of future ones she was of course right lincoln rhyme reflected the world represented by these notes and pictures this place on the edge that they shared was their nature for the time being at least i made the arrangements he said to her rhyme had been on the phone making plans to have sonny lis body shipped back to his father in liu guoyuan china the arrangements were being handled by a chinese funeral home there was one more task attendant to the death that rhyme needed to do he called up a word processing program sachs sat down next to him go ahead she said after a half hour of writing and rewriting he and sachs finally came up with this dear mr li i am writing to express my heartfelt condolences at the death of your son you should know how thankful my fellow police officers and i are for the privilege of having been able to work with sonny on the difficult and dangerous case that resulted in the loss of his life he saved many lives and brought a vicious killer to justice an accomplishment we alone could not have achieved his actions have brought the highest honor to his memory and he will always have a place of great respect within the law enforcement community of the united states i truly hope you are as proud of your son for his courage and sacrifice as we are lincolnrhyme det capt nypd ret rhyme read it and grumbled its too much too emotionallets start over but sachs reached down and hit the print key nope rhyme leave it sometimes too much is a good thing you sure im sure sachs set the letter aside for eddie deng to translate when the young cop arrived later in the day want to get back to the evidence sachs asked nodding toward the whiteboards there was much preparatory work that needed to be done for the ghosts trial but rhyme said no i want to play a game game yeah sure she said coyly im in the mood to win you wish he chided what game she asked weichithe boards over there and those bags of stones she found the game and set it up on the table near where rhyme was parked she glanced at his eyes which were examining the grid of the board and said i think im being hustled rhyme youve played this before sonny and i played a few games he said casually how few three is all im hardly an expert sachs howd you do the criminalist said defensively it takes a while to get the feel for a game you lost she said all of them but the last one was close she looked over the board whatll we play for with a cryptic smile rhyme replied well think of something then he explained the rules and she leaned forward raptly taking in his words finally he said thats it now youve never played so you get an advantage you can make the first move no sachs answered no advantages well flip a coin its customary rhyme assured her no advantage sachs repeated then dug a quarter out of her pocket call it she said and tossed the coin into the air acknowledgments my thanks to kim arthur and the folks at invacare and to cheryl lehman
