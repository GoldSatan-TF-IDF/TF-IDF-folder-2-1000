jeffery deaver the broken window the eighth book in the lincoln rhyme series to a dear friend the written word i something in common thursday may most privacy violations are not going to be caused by the exposure of huge personal secrets but by the publication of many little facts as with killer bees one is an annoyance but a swarm can be deadly robert oharrow jr no place to hide chapter one something nagged yet she couldnt quite figure out what like a faint recurring ache somewhere in your body or a man on the street behind you as you near your apartmentwas he the same one whod been glancing at you on the subway or a dark dot moving toward your bed but now vanished a black widow spider but then her visitor sitting on her living room couch glanced at her and smiled and alice sanderson forgot the concernif concern it was arthur had a good mind and a solid body sure but he had a great smile which counted for a lot more how bout some wine she asked walking into her small kitchen sure whatever youve got so thiss pretty funplaying hooky on a weekday two grown adults i like it born to be wild he joked outside the window across the street were rows of painted and natural brownstones they could also see part of the manhattan skyline hazy on this pleasant spring weekday airfresh enough for the citywafted in carrying the scents of garlic and oregano from an italian restaurant up the street it was their favorite type of cuisineone of the many common interests theyd discovered since theyd met several weeks ago at a wine tasting in soho in late april alice had found herself in the crowd of about forty listening to a sommelier lecture about the wines of europe when shed heard a mans voice ask about a particular type of spanish red wine she had barked a quiet laugh she happened to own a case of that very wine well part of a case now it was made by a littleknown vineyard perhaps not the best rioja ever produced but the wine offered another bouquet that of fond memory she and a french lover had consumed plenty of it during a week in spaina perfect liaison just the thing for a woman in her late twenties whod recently broken up with her boyfriend the vacation fling was passionate intense and of course doomed which made it all the better alice had leaned forward to see whod mentioned the wine a nondescript man in a business suit after a few glasses of the featured selections shed grown braver and juggling a plate of finger food had made her way across the room and asked him about his interest in the wine hed explained about a trip hed taken to spain a few years ago with an exgirlfriend how hed come to enjoy the wine theyd sat at a table and talked for some time arthur it seemed liked the same food she did the same sports they both jogged and spent an hour each morning in overpriced health clubs but he said i wear the cheapest jcpenney shorts and tshirts i can find no designer garbage for me then hed blushed realizing hed possibly insulted her but shed laughed she took the same approach to workout clothes in her case bought at target when visiting her family in jersey shed quashed the urge to tell him this though worried about coming on too strong theyd played that popular urban dating game what we have in common theyd rated restaurants compared curb your enthusiasm episodes and complained about their shrinks a date ensued then another art was funny and courteous a little stiff shy at times reclusive which she put down to what he described as the breakup from hella longterm girlfriend in the fashion business and his grueling work schedulehe was a manhattan businessman he had little free time would anything come of it he wasnt a boyfriend yet but there were far worse people to spend time with and when theyd kissed on their most recent date shed felt the low ping that meant oh yeah chemistry tonight might or might not reveal exactly how much shed noticed that arthur had furtivelyhe thoughtbeen checking out the tight pink little number shed bought at bergdorfs especially for their date and alice had made some preparations in the bedroom in case kissing turned into something else then the faint uneasiness the concern about the spider returned what was bothering her alice supposed it was nothing more than a residue of unpleasantness shed experienced when a deliveryman had dropped off a package earlier shaved head and bushy eyebrows smelling of cigarette smoke and speaking in a thick eastern european accent as shed signed the papers hed looked her overclearly flirtingand then asked for a glass of water she brought it to him reluctantly and found him in the middle of her living room staring at her sound system shed told him she was expecting company and hed left frowning as if angry over a snub alice had watched out the window and noted that nearly ten minutes had passed before he got into the doubleparked van and left what had he been doing in the apartment building all that time checking out hey earth to alice sorry she laughed continued to the couch then sat next to arthur their knees brushing thoughts of the deliveryman vanished they touched glasses these two people who were compatible in allimportant areaspolitics they contributed virtually the same amount to the dems and gave money during npr pledge drives movies food traveling they were both lapsed protestants when their knees touched again his rubbed seductively then arthur smiled and asked oh that painting you bought the prescott did you get it her eyes shone as she nodded yep i now own a harvey prescott alice sanderson was not a wealthy woman by manhattan standards but shed invested well and indulged her true passion shed followed the career of prescott a painter from oregon who specialized in photorealistic works of familiesnot existing people but ones he himself made up some traditional some not sosingle parent mixed race or gay virtually none of his paintings were on the market in her price range but she was on the mailing lists of the galleries that occasionally sold his work last month shed learned from one out west that a small early canvas might be coming available for sure enough the owner decided to sell and shed dipped into her investment account to come up with the cash that was the delivery shed received today but the pleasure of owning the piece now diminished again with a flareup of concern about the driver she recalled his smell his lascivious eyes alice rose on the pretense of opening the curtains wider and looked outside no delivery trucks no skinheads standing on the street corner and staring up at her apartment she thought about closing and locking the window but that seemed too paranoid and would require an explanation she returned to arthur glanced at her walls and told him she wasnt sure where to hang the painting in her small apartment a brief fantasy played out arthurs staying over one saturday night and on sunday after brunch helping her find the perfect place for the canvas her voice was filled with pleasure and pride as she said you want to see it you bet they rose and she walked toward the bedroom believing that she heard footsteps in the corridor outside all the other tenants should have been at work this time of day could it be the deliveryman well at least she wasnt alone they got to the bedroom door which was when the black widow struck with a jolt alice now understood what had been bothering her and it had nothing to do with the deliveryman no it was about arthur when theyd spoken yesterday hed asked when the prescott would be arriving shed told him she was getting a painting but had never mentioned the artists name slowing now at the bedroom door her hands were sweating if hed learned of the painting without her telling him then maybe hed found other facts about her life what if all of the many things they had in common were lies what if hed known about her love of the spanish wine ahead of time what if hed been at the tasting just to get close to her all the restaurants they knew the travel the tv shows my god here she was leading a man shed known for only a few weeks into her bedroom all her defenses down breathing hard nowshivering oh the painting he whispered looking past her its beautiful and hearing his calm pleasant voice alice laughed to herself are you crazy she must have mentioned prescotts name to arthur she tucked the uneasiness away calm down youve been living alone too long remember his smiles his joking he thinks the way you think relax a faint laugh alice stared at the twobytwofoot canvas the muted colors a half dozen people at a dinner table looking out some amused some pensive some troubled incredible he said the composition is wonderful but its their expressions that he captures so perfectly dont you think alice turned to him her smile vanished whats that arthur what are you doing hed put on beige cloth gloves and was reaching into his pocket and then she looked into his eyes which had hardened into dark pinpricks beneath furrowed brows in a face she hardly recognized at all ii transactions sunday may you often hear the old legend that our body is worth stripped for parts our digital identity is worth far more robert oharrow jr no place to hide chapter two the trail had led from scottsdale to san antonio to a rest area in delaware off interstate filled with truckers and restless families then finally to the improbable destination of london and the prey whod taken this route a professional killer lincoln rhyme had been pursuing for some time a man hed been able to stop from committing a terrible crime but whod managed to escape from the police with only minutes to spare waltzing as rhyme had put it bitterly out of the city like a goddamn tourist who had to be back at work monday morning the trail had dried up like dust and the police and fbi could learn nothing about where he was hiding or what he might be planning next but a few weeks earlier rhyme had heard from contacts in arizona that this very man was the likely suspect in the murder of a us army soldier in scottsdale leads suggested hed headed eastto texas then delaware the name of the perp which might have been real or a cover was richard logan it was likely that he came from the western portion of the united states or canada intense searches turned up a number of richard logans but none fit the profile of the killer then in a burst of happenstance lincoln rhyme would never use the word luck hed learned from interpol the european criminalinformation clearinghouse that a professional killer from america had been hired for a job in england hed killed someone in arizona to gain access to some military identification and information met with associates in texas and been given a down payment on his fee at some truck stop on the east coast he had flown to heathrow and was now somewhere in the uk the exact location unknown the subject of richard logans wellfunded plot which originated at high levelsrhyme could only smile when he read the polished interpol descriptionwas a protestant minister from africa whod run a refugee camp and stumbled on a massive scam in which aids drugs were stolen and sold and the money used to purchase arms the minister was relocated by security forces to london having survived three attempts on his life in nigeria and liberia and even one in a transit lounge at malpensa airport in milan where the polizia di stato armed with stubby machine guns scrutinize much and miss very little the reverend samuel g goodlight a better name for a man of the cloth rhyme couldnt imagine was now in a safe house in london under the watchful eye of officers from scotland yard the home of the metropolitan police service and was presently helping british and foreign intelligence connect the dots of the drugsforarms plan via encrypted satellite calls and emails flying around several continents rhyme and an inspector longhurst of the metropolitan police had set up a trap to catch the perp worthy of the precise plots that logan himself crafted the plan involved lookalikes and the vital assistance of a largerthanlife former arms broker from south africa who came with a network of curried informants danny krueger had made hundreds of thousands selling weapons as efficiently and dispassionately as other businessmen sell air conditioners and cough syrup but a trip to darfur last year had shaken him badly seeing the carnage his toys caused hed given up the arms trade cold and had resettled in england others on the task force included officers from mi as well as personnel from the london office of the fbi and an agent from frances version of the cia la direction générale de la sécurité extérieure they hadnt known even the region of britain in which logan was in hiding planning his hit but the boisterous danny krueger had heard that the killer would be making his move in the next few days the south african still had many contacts in the international underground and had put out hints about a secret location where the meetings between goodlight and the authorities would take place the building had an exposed courtyard that was a perfect shooting zone for the killer to assassinate the minister it was also an ideal place to spot and take down logan surveillance was in place and armed police mi and fbi agents were on twentyfourhour alert rhyme was now sitting in his red batterypowered wheelchair on the first floor of his central park west town houseno longer the quaint victorian parlor it had once been but a wellequipped forensic laboratory larger than many labs in mediumsize towns he found himself doing what hed done frequently over the past several days staring at the phone whose numbertwo speeddial button would call a line in england the phones working right rhyme asked is there any reason for it not to be thom his caregiver asked this in a measured tone which rhyme heard as a belabored sigh i dont know circuits overload phone lines get hit by lightning all kinds of things can go wrong then maybe you should try it just to make sure command rhyme said getting the attention of the voicerecognition system hooked to his ecuthe computerized environmental control unit that substituted in many ways for his physical functioning lincoln rhyme was a quadriplegic he had only limited movement below the place where his neck was broken in a crimescene accident years beforethe fourth cervical vertebra near the base of the skull he now ordered dial directory assistance the dial tone filled the speakers followed by beep beep beep this irritated rhyme more than a nonperforming phone would have why hadnt inspector longhurst called command he snapped disconnect seems to be fine thom placed a coffee mug in the cup holder of rhymes wheelchair and the criminalist sipped the strong brew through a straw he looked at a bottle of glenmorangie eighteenyearold singlemalt whisky on a shelfit was nearby but of course always just out of rhymes reach its morning thom said obviously its morning i can see its morning i dont want anyits just hed been waiting for a reason to ride the young man on the issue i seem to recall being cut off rather early last night two tumblers virtually nothing it was three if you were to add up the contents the cubic centimeters im speaking of it was the same as two small ones pettiness like liquor could be intoxicating in its own right well no scotch in the morning it helps me think more clearly no it doesnt it does and more creatively doesnt do that either thom was wearing a perfectly ironed shirt tie and slacks his clothes were less wrinkled than they used to be much of the job of a quadriplegics caregiver is physical but rhymes new chair an invacare tdx for total driving experience could fold out into a virtual bed and had made thoms job much easier the chair could even climb low stairs and speed along as fast as a middleaged jogger im saying i want some scotch there ive articulated my desire hows that no rhyme scoffed and stared at the phone again if he gets away his voice faded well arent you going to do what everybody does what do you mean lincoln the slim young man had been working with rhyme for years hed been fired on occasion and had quit too but here he still was a testament to the perseverance or perverseness of both principals i say if he gets away and you say oh but he wont dont worry and im supposed to be reassured people do that you know they give reassurance when they have no idea what theyre talking about but i didnt say that are we having an argument about something i didnt say but could have isnt that like a wife being mad at her husband because she saw a pretty woman on the street and thought he would have stared at her if hed been there i dont know what its like rhyme said absently his mind mostly on the plan in britain to capture logan were there holes in it how was security could he trust the informants not to leak information the killer might pick up on the phone rang and a callerid box opened on the flatscreen monitor near rhyme he was disappointed to see the number wasnt a london exchange but closer to homein the big building copspeak for one police plaza in downtown manhattan command answer phone click then what from five miles away a voice muttered bad mood no word from england yet whatre you on call or something detective lon sellitto asked logans disappeared he could make a move at any time like having a baby sellitto said if you say so what do you need i dont want to keep the line tied up all that fancy equipment and you dont have call waiting lon okay something you oughta know about there was a burglarymurder a week ago thursday vic was a woman lived in the village alice sanderson perp stabbed her to death and stole some painting we got the doer why was he calling about this a mundane crime and the perp in custody evidence problem nope so id be interested why the supervising detective just got a call a half hour ago the chase lon the chase rhyme was staring at the whiteboard that detailed the plan to catch the killer in england the scheme was elaborate and fragile sellitto brought him out of his reflection look im sorry linc but i gotta tell you the perps your cousin arthur rhyme its murder one hes looking at twentyfive years and the da says its an airtight case chapter three its been quite a while judy rhyme sat in the lab hands together face ashen she fiercely avoided looking at anything except the criminalists eyes two responses to his physical condition infuriated rhyme when visitors struggled agonizingly to pretend his disability didnt exist and when they considered it a reason to be his best friend joking and slinging around tough talk as if theyd been through the war together judy fell into the first category measuring her words carefully before she set them delicately in front of rhyme still she was family of sorts and he remained patient as he tried to keep from glancing at the telephone a long time the criminalist agreed thom was picking up the social details to which rhyme was forever oblivious hed offered judy coffee which now sat untouched a prop on the table in front of her rhyme had glanced at the whisky once more a longing peek that thom had no trouble ignoring the attractive darkhaired woman seemed in better shape solid and more athletic than the last time hed seen herabout two years before his accident judy risked a look at the criminalists face im sorry we never got here really i wanted to meaning not a social visit before he was injured but a sympathy call after survivors of catastrophes can read what is unsaid in conversations as clearly as the words themselves you got the flowers back then after the accident rhyme had been dazedmedication physical trauma and the psychological wrestling match with the inconceivable the fact that he would never walk again he didnt remember any flowers from them but he was sure the family had sent them a lot of people had flowers are easy visits are hard yes thanks silence an involuntary lightningfast glance at his legs people think if you cant walk theres something wrong with your legs no theyre fine the problem was telling them what to do youre looking good she said rhyme didnt know whether he did or not never really considered it and youre divorced i heard thats right im sorry why he wondered but that was a cynical thought and he gave a nod acknowledging her sympathy whats blaine up to shes out on long island remarried we dont stay in touch much without kids that usually happens i enjoyed that time in boston when you two came up for the long weekend a smile that wasnt really a smile painted on a mask it was nice yes a weekend in new england shopping a drive south to cape cod a picnic by the water rhyme remembered thinking how lovely the place was seeing the green rocks by the shore hed had a brainstorm and decided to start a collection of algae from around the new york city area for the nypd crime lab database hed spent a week driving around the metro area taking samples and on the trip to see arthur and judy he and blaine hadnt fought once even the drive home with a stop at a connecticut inn was nice he remembered making love on the back deck of their room the smell of honeysuckle overwhelming that visit was the last contact with his cousin in person theyd had one other brief conversation but only via the phone then came the accident and silence arthur kind of fell off the face of the earth she laughed an embarrassed sound you know we moved to new jersey really he was teaching at princeton but he got laid off what happened he was an assistant and a research fellow they decided not to offer him a full professors contract art says politics was behind it you know how that is in colleges henry rhyme arts father was a renowned professor of physics at the university of chicago academia was an esteemed pursuit in that branch of the rhyme family in high school arthur and lincoln would debate the virtues of university research and teaching versus a privatesector job in academia you can make a serious contribution to society art had said as the boys shared two somewhat illegal beers and managed to keep a straight face when lincoln supplied the requisite followup line that and the teaching assistants can be pretty hot rhyme wasnt surprised that art had gone for a university job he couldve continued to be an assistant but he quit he was pretty angry assumed hed get another job right away but that didnt happen he was out of work for a while ended up at a private company a medicalequipment manufacturer another automatic glancethis time at the elaborate wheelchair she blushed as if shed committed a don imus it wasnt his dream job and he hasnt been real happy im sure he wanted to come see you but probably he was ashamed he hadnt done so well i mean with you being a celebrity and all finally a sip of coffee you both had so much in common you two were like brothers i remember boston all the stories you told we were up half the night laughing things i never knew about him and my fatherinlaw henrywhen he was alive hed talk about you all the time did he we wrote quite a bit in fact i had a letter from him a few days before he died rhyme had dozens of indelible memories of his uncle but one particular image stood out the tall balding ruddyfaced man is rearing back braying a laugh embarrassing every one of the dozen or so family members at the christmas eve dinner tableembarrassing all that is except henry rhyme himself his patient wife and young lincoln who is laughing right along rhyme liked his uncle very much and would often go to visit art and the family who lived about thirty miles away on the shores of lake michigan in evanston illinois now though rhyme was in no mood for nostalgia and was relieved when he heard the door open and the sound of seven firm footsteps from threshold to carpet the stride telling rhyme who it was a moment later a tall slim redhead wearing jeans and a black tshirt under a burgundy blouse entered the lab the shirt was loose and the stern angle of a black glock pistol was visible high on her hip as amelia sachs smiled and kissed rhyme on the mouth the criminalist was aware in his periphery of judys body language response the message was clear and rhyme wondered what had dismayed her that shed made the slip of not asking if he was seeing someone or that shed assumed a crip couldnt have a romantic partnerat least not one as disarmingly attractive as sachs whod been a model before going to the police academy he introduced them sachs listened with concern to the story of arthur rhymes arrest and asked how judy was coping with the situation then do you have children rhyme realized that while hed been noting judys faux pas hed committed one himself neglecting to ask about their son whose name hed forgotten and it turned out the family had grown in addition to arthur junior who was in high school there were two others a nineyearold henry and a daughter meadow shes six meadow sachs asked in surprise for reasons rhyme couldnt deduce judy gave an embarrassed laugh and we live in jersey but its got nothing to do with the tv show she was born before id ever seen it tv show judy broke the brief silence im sure youre wondering why i called that officer to get your number but first i have to tell you art doesnt know im here no in fact to tell you the truth i wouldnt have thought of it on my own ive been so upset not getting any sleep not thinking straight but i was talking to art a few days ago in the detention center and he said i know what youre thinking but dont call lincoln its a case of mistaken identity or something well get it straightened out promise me you wont he didnt want to burden you you know how art is just so kind always thinking of everybody else rhyme nodded but the more i got to thinking about it the more sense it made i wouldnt ask you to pull strings or do anything that wasnt right but i thought maybe you could just make a call or two tell me what you thought rhyme could imagine how that would go over at the big building as a forensic consultant for the nypd his job was getting to the truth wherever that journey led but the brass definitely preferred him to help convict not exonerate defendants i went through some of your clippings clippings art keeps family scrapbooks he has clippings about your cases from the newspapers dozens youve done some amazing things rhyme said oh im just a civil servant finally judy delivered some unvarnished emotion a smile as she looked into his eyes art said he never believed your modesty for a minute is that right but only because you never believed it either sachs chuckled rhyme snorted a laugh that he thought would pass for sincere then he grew serious i dont know how much i can do but tell me what happened it was a week ago thursday the twelfth art always takes off early every thursday he goes for a long run in a state park on the way home he loves to run rhyme recalled dozens of times when the two boys born within months of each other would race along sidewalks or through the greenyellow fields near their midwestern homes grasshoppers fleeing gnats sticking to their sweaty skin when they stopped for breath art always seemed to be in better shape but lincoln had made his schools varsity track team his cousin hadnt been interested in trying out rhyme pushed aside the memories and concentrated on what judy was saying he left work about threethirty and went for his run then came home about seven seventhirty he didnt seem any different wasnt acting odd he took a shower we had dinner but the next day the police came to the house two from new york and a new jersey trooper they asked him questions and looked through the car they found some blood i dont know her voice conveyed traces of the shock she would have felt on that difficult morning they searched the house and took away some things and then they came back and arrested him for murder she had trouble saying the word what was he supposed to have done exactly sachs asked they claimed he killed a woman and stole a rare painting from her she scoffed bitterly stole a painting what on earth for and murder why arthur never hurt a single soul in his life he isnt capable of it the blood that was found have they run a dna test well yes they did and it seemed to match the victim but those tests can be wrong cant they sometimes rhyme said thinking very very rarely or the real killer could have planted the blood this painting sachs asked did arthur have any particular interest in it judy played with thick black and white plastic bracelets on her left wrist the thing is yes he used to own one by the same artist he liked it but he had to sell it when he lost his job where was the painting found it wasnt but how did they know it was taken somebody a witness said they saw a man carrying it from the womans apartment to the car around the time she was killed oh its all just a terrible mixup coincidencesthats what it has to be just a weird series of coincidences her voice cracked did he know her at first art said he didnt but then well he thought they mightve met at an art gallery he goes to sometimes but he said he never talked to her that he can remember her eyes now took in the whiteboard containing the schematic of the plan to capture logan in england rhyme was remembering other times he and arthur had spent together race you to that tree no you wimpthe maple way over there touch the trunk on three onetwogo you didnt say three theres more isnt there judy tell us sachs had seen something in the womans eyes rhyme supposed im just upset for the kids too its a nightmare for them the neighborsre treating us like terrorists im sorry to push but its important for us to know all the facts please the blush had returned and she was gripping her knees rhyme and sachs had a friend who worked as an agent for the california bureau of investigation kathryn dance she was a kinesics or body language expert rhyme considered such skills secondary to forensic science but hed come to respect dance and had learned something about her specialty he now could see easily that judy rhyme was a fountain of stress go on sachs encouraged its just that the police found some other evidencewell it wasnt really evidence not like clues butit made them think maybe art and the woman were seeing each other sachs asked whats your opinion of that i dont think he was rhyme noted the softened verb not as adamant a denial as with the murder and theft she desperately wanted the answer to be no though shed probably come to the same conclusion rhyme just had that the womans being his lover worked in arthurs favor you were more likely to rob a stranger than someone you were sleeping with still as a wife and mother judy was crying out for one particular answer then she glanced up less cautious now about looking at rhyme the contraption he sat in and the other devices that defined his life whatever else was going on he did not kill that woman he couldnt have i know it in my soul is there anything you can do rhyme and sachs shared a look he said im sorry judy were in the midst of a big case right now were real close to catching a very dangerous killer i cant drop that i wouldnt want you to but just something i dont know what else to do her lip was trembling he said well make some calls find out what we can i cant give you information you couldnt otherwise get through your lawyer but ill tell you honestly what i think about the das chance of success oh thank you lincoln whos his lawyer she gave them the name and phone number a highprofile and priced criminal defense attorney rhyme knew but hed be a man with a lot on his plate and more experience with financial than violent crimes sachs asked about the prosecutor bernhard grossman i can get you his number thats all right sachs said i have it ive worked with him before hes reasonable i assume he offered your husband a plea bargain he did and our lawyer wanted to take it but art refused he keeps saying this is just a mistake itll all get straightened out but that doesnt always happen does it even if people are innocent they go to jail sometimes dont they they do yes rhyme thought then said well make a few phone calls she rose i cant tell you how sorry i am that we let things slide inexcusable surprising him judy rhyme strode directly to the wheelchair and bent down brushing her cheek against his rhyme smelled nervous sweat and two distinct scents perhaps deodorant and hair spray no perfume she didnt seem the perfume type thank you lincoln she walked to the door and paused to them both she said whatever else you find about that woman and arthur its all right all i care about is that he doesnt go to jail ill do what i can well give you a call if we find something concrete sachs saw her out when she returned rhyme said lets check with the lawyers first im sorry rhyme he frowned and she added i just mean its got to be hard on you hows that thinking a close relative got busted for murder rhyme shrugged one of the few gestures he could manage ted bundy was somebodys son maybe a cousin too but still sachs lifted the receiver eventually she tracked down the defense lawyer got his answering service and left a message rhyme wondered which hole of which golf course he was on at that moment she then got in touch with the assistant district attorney grossman who wasnt enjoying the day of rest but was in his office downtown hed never connected the last name of the perp to the criminalist hey im sorry lincoln he said sincerely but i have to say its a good case im not blowing smoke id tell you if there were gaps but there arent a jurys going to nail him if you can talk him into a plea youd be doing him a huge favor i could probably go down to twelve solid twelve years with no parole it would kill arthur rhyme reflected appreciate that sachs said the ada added that he had a complicated trial starting tomorrow so he couldnt spend any more time talking to them now hed call later in the week if they liked he did however give them the name of the lead detective in the case bobby lagrange i know him she said dialing him at home too she got his voice mail but when she tried his cell he answered immediately lagrange the hiss of wind and the sound of slapping water explained what the detective was up to on this clearsky warm day sachs identified herself oh sure howya doin amelia im waiting for a call from a snitch weve got something going down in red hook anytime now so not on his fishing boat i may have to hang up fast understood youre on speaker detective this is lincoln rhyme a hesitation oh yeah a call from lincoln rhyme got peoples full attention pretty fast rhyme explained about his cousin waitrhyme you know i thought it was a funny name i mean unusual but i never put it together and he never said anything about you not in any of the interviews your cousin man im sorry detective i dont want to interfere with the case but i said id call and find out what the story is its gone to the ada i know just talked to him i gotta say the collar was righteous ive run homicides for five years and short of somebody from patrol witnessing a gang clip this was the cleanest wrap ive seen whats the story arts wife only gave me the bones in the stiff voice that cops fall into when recounting details of a crimestripped of emotion your cousin left work early he went to the apartment of a woman named alice sanderson down in the village shed gotten off work early too we arent sure how long he was there but sometime around six she was knifed to death and a painting was stolen rare i understand yeah but not like van gogh who was the artist somebody named prescott oh and we found some directmail things flyers you know that a couple of galleriesd sent your cousin about prescott that didnt look so good tell me more about may twelfth rhyme said at about six a witness heard screams and a few minutes later saw a man carrying a painting out to a light blue mercedes parked on the street it left the scene fast the wit only got the first three letters on the tagcouldnt tell the state but we ran everything in the metro area narrowed the list down and interviewed the owners one was your cousin my partner and me went out to jersey to talk to him had a trooper with us for protocol you know we saw what looked like blood on the back door and in the backseat a bloody washcloth was under the seat it matched a set of linens in the vics apartment and dna was positive her blood yeah the witness identified him in a lineup naw was anonymous called from a pay phone and wouldnt give their name didnt want to get involved but we didnt need any wits crime scene had a field day they lifted a shoeprint from the vics entrywaysame kind of shoe your cousin woreand got some good trace class evidence yeah class traces of shave cream snack food chips lawn fertilizer from his garage exactly matched what was at the vics apartment no it didnt match rhyme reflected evidence falls into several categories individuating evidence is unique to a single source like dna and fingerprints class evidence shares certain characteristics with similar materials but they dont necessarily come from the same source carpet fibers for instance a dna test of blood at a crime scene can definitely match the criminals blood but a comparison of carpet fiber at a scene can only be associated with fibers found in the suspects house allowing the jury to infer he was at the scene what was your take on whether or not he knew her sachs asked he claimed he didnt but we found two notes shed written one at her office and one at home one was artdrinks the other just said arthur nothing else oh and we found his name in her phonebook his number rhyme was frowning no prepaid mobile no record so you figure they were more than friends crossed our minds why else only give her a prepaid number and not his home or office he gave a laugh apparently she didnt care youd be surprised what people accept without asking questions not that surprised rhyme thought and the phone toast never found it and you think he killed her because she was pressuring him to leave the wife thats what the prosecutorll argue something like that rhyme compared what he knew of his cousin whom he hadnt seen in more than a decade against this information he could neither confirm nor deny the allegation sachs asked anybody else have a motive nope family and friends said she dated some but real casual no terrible breakups i was even wondering if the wife did itjudybut she was accounted for at the time did arthur have any alibi none claims he went for a run but nobody could confirm seeing him clinton state park big place pretty deserted im curious sachs said what his demeanor was during interrogation lagrange laughed funny you bring that upthe weirdest part of the whole case he looked like he was dazed just blown away by seeing us there ive collared a lot of people in my day some of em pros connected guys i mean and he was hands down the best at playing the innocentme game great actor you remember that about him detective rhyme the criminalist didnt reply what happened to the painting a pause thats the other thing never recovered wasnt in his house or garage but the crimescene folks found dirt in the backseat of the car and his garage it matched the dirt in the state park where he went jogging every night near his house we figured he buried it somewhere one question detective rhyme said a pause at the other end of the line during which a voice spoke indecipherable words and the wind howled again go on can i see the file the file not really a question just stalling to consider its a solid case we ran it by the book sachs said we dont doubt that for a minute the thing is though we understand hes rejected a plea oh you want to talk him into one yeah i get it thats the best thing for him well all i have is copies the adas got everything else and the evidence but i can get you the reports a day or two okay rhyme shook his head sachs said to the detective if you could talk to records and okay it ill go down there and pick up the file myself the wind filled the speakers again then stopped abruptly lagrange must have moved into shelter yeah okay ill give em a call now thanks no problem good luck after theyd disconnected rhyme gave a brief smile that was a nice touch the plea bargain thing you gotta know your audience sachs said and slung her purse over her shoulder heading out of the door chapter four sachs returned from her trip to police plaza a lot faster than if shed taken public transportationor paid attention to stoplights rhyme knew that shed slapped a flashing light on the dash of her car a camaro ss which shed had painted fiery red a few years ago to match rhymes preferred shade for his wheelchairs like a teenager she still looked for any excuse to fire up the massive engine and sear rubber off the tires copied everything she said carrying a thick folder into the room she winced as she set it on an examining table you okay amelia sachs suffered from arthritis she had all her life and popped glucosamine chondroitin and advil or naprosyn like jelly beans but she rarely acknowledged the condition fearful that the brass might stick her behind a desk on a medical if they found out even when she and rhyme were alone she downplayed the pain but today she admitted some twingesre worse than others want to sit a shake of the head so whatve we got report evidence inventory and copies of the photos no videos theyre with the da lets get everything on the board i want to see the primary crime scene and arthurs house she walked to a whiteboardone of the dozens in the laband transcribed information as rhyme watched alice sanderson homicide alice sanderson apartment traces of edge advanced gel shave cream with aloe crumbs determined to be pringles fat free barbecue flavor chicago cutlery knife mw trugro fertilizer shoeprint of alton ezwalk size fleck of latex glove references to art and a prepaid mobile number in phonebook now no longer active untraceable possible affair two notes artdrinks office and arthur

prescott paintings box of safehand latex gloves rubber composition similar to that of fleck found at primary crime scene garage man its pretty incriminating rhyme sachs said standing back hand on her hips and using a prepaid cell and references to art but no address where he lives or works that would suggest an affair any other details no other than the pictures tape them up he instructed while scanning the chart regretting that he hadnt searched the scene himselfvicariously that was with amelia sachs as they often did via a microphoneheadset or a highdefinition video camera she wore it seemed like a competent cs job but not stellar no photos of the nonscene rooms and the knifehe saw the picture of the bloody weapon beneath the bed an officer was lifting a flap of dust ruffle to get a good shot was it invisible with the cloth down which meant the perp might logically have missed it in the frenzy of the moment or was it visible suggesting it had been left intentionally as planted evidence he studied the picture of packing material on the floor apparently what the prescott painting had been wrapped in somethings wrong he whispered sachs standing at the whiteboard glanced his way the painting rhyme continued what about it lagrange suggested two motives one arthur stole the prescott as a cover because he wanted to kill alice to get her out of his life right but rhyme went on to make a homicide seem incidental to a burglary a smart perp wouldnt steal the one thing in the apartment that could be connected to him remember art had owned a prescott and he had directmail flyers about them sure rhyme that doesnt make any sense and say he really did want the painting and couldnt afford it well its a hell of a lot safer and easier to break in and cart it off during the day when the owners at work rather than murder them for it his cousins demeanor too though not high in rhymes arsenal when he assessed guilt or innocence nagged maybe he wasnt playing innocent maybe he was innocent pretty incriminating you said no too incriminating he thought to himself lets just postulate that he didnt do it if not then the consequences were significant because this wasnt simply a case of mistaken identity the evidence matched too closelyincluding a conclusive connection between her blood and his car no if art was innocent then someone had gone to a great deal of trouble to set him up im thinking he was framed why motive he muttered we dont care at this point the relevant question now is how we answer that it can point us to who we might get why along the way but thats not our priority so we start with a premise that someone else mr x murdered alice sanderson and stole the painting then framed arthur now sachs how could he have done it a winceher arthritis againand she sat she thought for several moments then said mr x followed arthur and followed alice he saw they had an interest in art put them together at the gallery and found their identities mr x knows she owns a prescott he wants one but cant afford it right sachs nodded at the evidence chart then he breaks into arthurs house sees that he owns pringles edge shave cream trugro fertilizer and chicago cutlery knives he steals some to plant he knows what shoes arthur wears so he can leave the footprint and he gets some of the dirt from the state park on arthurs shovel now lets think about may twelfth somehow mr x knows that art always leaves work early on thursdays and goes running in a deserted parkso he doesnt have an alibi he goes to the vics apartment kills her steals the painting and calls from a pay phone to report the screams and seeing a man take the painting to a car that looks a lot like arthurs with a partial tag number then he heads out to arthurs house in new jersey and leaves the traces of blood the dirt the washcloth the shovel the phone rang the caller was arthurs defense lawyer the man sounded harried as he reiterated everything that the assistant district attorney had explained he offered nothing that might help them and in fact tried several times to talk them into pressuring arthur to take a plea theyll nail him up the man said do him a favor ill get him fifteen years thatll destroy him rhyme said it wont destroy him as much as a life sentence rhyme said a chilly goodbye and hung up he stared again at the evidence board then something else occurred to him what is it rhyme sachs had noticed that his eyes were rising to the ceiling think maybe hes done this before how do you mean assuming the goalthe motivewas to steal the painting well its not exactly a onetime score not like a renoir you fence for ten million and disappear forever the whole thing smells like an enterprise the perps hit on a smart way to get away with a crime and hes going to keep at it until somebody stops him yeah good point so we should look for thefts of other paintings no why should he steal just paintings it could be anything but theres one common element sachs frowned then provided the answer homicide exactly since the perp frames somebody else he has to murder the victimsbecause they could identify him call somebody at homicide at home if you need to were looking for the same scenario an underlying crime maybe a theft the vic murdered and strong circumstantial evidence and maybe a dna link that mightve been planted good he said excited at the thought they might be on to something here and if hes sticking to his formula therell be an anonymous witness who gave nineoneone some specific identifying information she walked to a desk in the corner of the lab sat and placed the call rhyme leaned his head back in his wheelchair and observed his partner on the phone he noticed dried blood in her thumbnail a mark was just visible above her ear half hidden by her straight red hair sachs did this frequently scratching her scalp teasing her nails damaging herself in small waysboth a habit and an indicator of the stress that drove her she was nodding and her eyes took on a focused gaze as she wrote his own heartthough he couldnt feel it directlyhad speeded up shed learned something significant her pen dried up she tossed it onto the floor and whipped out another as quickly as she drew her pistol in combat shooting competitions after ten minutes she hung up hey rhyme get this she sat next to him in a wicker chair i talked to flintlock ah good choice joseph flintick his nickname intentionally or otherwise a reference to the oldtime gun had been a homicide detective when rhyme was a rookie the testy old guy was familiar with nearly every murder that had been committed in new york cityand many nearbyduring his lengthy tenure at an age when he should have been visiting his grandchildren flintlock was working sundays rhyme wasnt surprised i laid it all out for him and he came back with two cases that might fit our profile right off the top of his head one was a theft of rare coins worth about fifty g the other a rape rape this added a deeper and much more disturbing element to the case yep in both of them an anonymous witness called to report the crime and gave some information that was instrumental in iding the perplike the wit calling about your cousins car both male callers of course right and the city offered a reward but neither of them came forward what about the evidence flintlock didnt remember it too clearly but he did say that the trace and circumstantial connections were right on just what happened to your cousinfive or six types of associated class evidence at the scene and in the perps houses and in both cases the victims blood was found on a rag or article of clothing in the suspects residence and ill bet there werent any fluid matches in the rape case most rapists are convicted because they leave behind traces of the three sssemen saliva or sweat nope none and the anonymous callersdid they leave partial license plate numbers she glanced at her notes yeah how did you know because our perp needed to buy some time if he left the whole tag number the copsd head right to the fall guys house and he wouldnt have time to plant the evidence there the killer had thought out everything and the suspects denied everything yep totally rolled the dice with the jury and lost no no no thiss all too coincidental rhyme muttered i want to see i asked somebody to pull the files from the disposed cases archives he laughed one step ahead of him as often he recalled when theyd first met years ago sachs a disillusioned patrol officer ready to give up her career in policing rhyme ready to give up more than that how far theyd both come since then rhyme spoke into his stalk mike command call sellitto he was excited now he could feel that unique buzzthe thrill of a budding hunt answer the damn phone he thought angrily and for once he wasnt thinking about england hey linc sellittos brooklyninflected voice filled the room whats listen theres a problem im kinda busy here rhymes former partner lieutenant detective lon sellitto hadnt been in the best of moods himself lately a big task force case hed worked on had just tanked vladimir dienko the thug of a russian mob boss from brighton beach had been indicted last year for racketeering and murder rhyme had assisted with some of the forensics to everyones shock the case against dienko and three of his associates had been dismissed just last friday after witnesses had stonewalled or vanished sellitto and agents from the bureau had been working all weekend trying to track down new witnesses and informants ill make it fast he explained what he and sachs had found about his cousin and the rape and cointheft cases two other cases friggin weird whats your cousin say havent talked to him yet but he denies everything i want to have this looked into looked into the fucks that mean i dont think arthur did it hes your cousin of course you dont think he did it but whatta you have concrete nothing yet thats why i want your help i need some people im up to my ass in the dienko situation in brighton beach which i gotta say youd be helping on except no youre too busy sipping fucking tea with the brits this could be big lon two other cases that stink of planted evidence ill bet there are more i know how much you love your clichés lon doesnt getting away with murder move you you can throw all the clauses you want at me linc im busy thats a phrase lon a clause has a subject and predicate whatfuckingever im trying to salvage the russian connection nobody at city hall or the federal buildings happy about what happened and they have my deepest sympathies get reassigned its homicide im major cases the major cases division of the nypd didnt investigate murders but sellittos excuse brought a cynical laugh to rhymes lips you work homicides when you want to work them when the hell have department protocols meant anything to you tell you what ill do the detective mumbled theres a captain working today downtown joe malloy know him no i do said sachs hes solid hey amelia you surviving the cold front today sachs laughed rhyme snarled funny lon who the hells this guy smart no compromises and no sense of humor youll appreciate that lots of comedians round here today rhyme muttered hes good and a crusader his wife was killed in a b and e five six years ago sachs winced i didnt know that yeah and he gives the job a hundred fifty percent word is hes headed for a corner office upstairs some day or maybe even next door meaning city hall sellitto continued give him a call and see if he can get a few people released for you i want you released not gonna happen linc im running a fucking stakeout its a nightmare but keep me posted and gotta go loncommand disconnect phone you hung up on him sachs pointed out rhyme grunted and placed a call to malloy hed be furious if he got voice mail but the man answered on the second ring another senior cop working on sunday well rhyme had done so pretty often too and had the divorce to show for it malloy here rhyme identified himself a brief hesitation then well lincolni dont believe weve ever met but i know about you of course im here with one of your detectives amelia sachs were on speaker joe detective sachs afternoon said the stiff voice what can i do for you two rhyme explained about the case and how he believed arthur was being set up your cousin im sorry to hear that but he didnt sound particularly sorry malloy would be worried that rhyme wanted him to intervene and get the charges reduced uhoh appearance of impropriety at the most innocent or at the worst an internalaffairs investigation and the media weighed against that of course was the bad form of not helping out a man who provided invaluable service to the nypd and one who was a gimp political correctness thrives in city government but rhymes request of course was more complicated he added i think theres a good chance that this same perp committed other crimes he gave the details of the coin theft and the rape so not one but three individuals had been wrongly arrested by malloys nypd which meant that three crimes had in fact gone unsolved and the real perp was still at large this portended a major publicrelations nightmare well its pretty odd irregular you know i understand your loyalty to your cousin i have a loyalty to the truth joe rhyme said not caring if he sounded pompous well i just need a couple of officers assigned to us to look over the evidence in these cases again maybe do some legwork oh i see well sorry lincoln we just dont have the resources not for something like this but ill bring it up tomorrow with the deputy commissioner actually think we could call him now another hesitation no hes got something going on today brunch barbecue a sundaymatinee performance of young frankenstein or spamalot ill raise the issue tomorrow at the briefing its a curious situation but you wont do anything until you hear from me or someone of course not they disconnected rhyme and sachs were both silent for a few long seconds a curious situation rhyme gazed at the whiteboardon which sat the corpse of an investigation shot dead just as it had lurched to life snapping the quiet sachs asked wonder what rons up to lets find out why dont we he gave her a genuineand raresmile she pulled out her phone hit a speed dial number then speaker a youthful voice crackled yes maam detective sachs had been after young patrolman ron pulaski to call her amelia for years but usually he couldnt bring himself to do it youre on speaker pulaski rhyme warned yes sir and the sir bothered rhyme but he had no inclination to correct the young man now how are you pulaski asked does it matter rhyme responded whatre you doing right now and is it important right now i think i just asked that washing dishes jenny and i just had sunday brunch with my brother and his wife we went to the farmers market with the kids its a blast do you and detective sachs ever get to youre at home then and not doing anything well the dishes leave em get over here rhyme a civilian had no authority to order anybody in the nypd even traffic cops to do anything but sachs was a detective thirdclass while she couldnt order him to help them she could formally request a shift in assignment we need you ron and we might need you tomorrow too ron pulaski worked regularly with rhyme sachs and sellitto rhyme had been amused to learn that his assignments for the quasiceleb forensic detective elevated the status of the young officer within the department he was sure that the supervisor would agree to hand over pulaski for a few daysas long as he didnt call malloy or anyone else downtown and learn that the case wasnt a case at all pulaski gave sachs the name of the commander at the precinct house then asked oh sir is lieutenant sellitto working on this one should i call and coordinate with him no blurted both rhyme and sachs a brief silence followed then pulaski said uncertainly well then i guess ill be there as soon as i can just can i dry the glasses first jenny hates water spots chapter five sundays are the best because most sundays im free to do what i love i collect things everything you can imagine if it appeals to me and i can get it into my backpack or into my trunk ill collect it im not a pack rat like some people might say those rodents leave something in place of what theyve taken once i find something its mine i never let go ever sundays my favorite day because its the day of rest for the masses the sixteens who call this amazing city home men women children lawyers artists cyclists cooks thieves wives and lovers i collect dvds too politicians joggers and curatorsits amazing the number of things that sixteens do for enjoyment they roam like happy antelope through the city and the parks of new jersey and long island and upstate new york and im free to hunt them which is what im up to right now having deflected all the other boring distractions of sunday brunch movies and even an invitation to go play golf oh and worshipalways popular with the antelope provided of course that a visit to church is followed by the aforementioned brunch or nine holes of smacktheball hunting right now im thinking of my most recent transaction the memory tucked away in my mental collectionthe transaction with young alice sanderson who was looking fine very fine until the knife of course alice in that nice pink dress accentuating her breasts flirting at the hip i also think of her as but thats a joke on my part pretty enough perfume the scent of asian flowers my plans for her had only partly to do with the harvey prescott painting that she was lucky enough to snatch off the market or unlucky as it turned out for her once i was sure shed received the delivery out would come the duct tape and id spend the next few hours with her in the bedroom but shed ruined it all just as i was coming up behind her she turned and gave that nightmare scream i had no choice but to slice her neck like tomato skin grab my beautiful prescott and sneak outthrough the window so to speak no i cant stop thinking about prettyenough alice in a skimpy pink dress her skin floralscented like a tea house so bottom line i need a woman strolling along these sidewalks glancing at the sixteens through my sunglasses they on the other hand dont really see me as i intend i groom myself to be invisible and theres no place like manhattan to be invisible i turn corners slip along an alleyway make a purchasecash of coursethen plunge into a deserted area of the city formerly industrial becoming residential and commercial near soho quiet here thats good i want it peaceful for my transaction with myra weinburg a sixteen ive had my eye on for a while myra i know you very well the data have told me everything ah that debate again dataplural or singular data has told or data have told merriamwebsters assures us either is correct by myself i tend to be purist data plural but in public i try hard to treat the word as singular like most of society and hope i dont slip up language is a river it goes where it will and if you swim against that current you get noticed and that of course is the last thing in the world i want now the data on myra she lives on waverly place greenwich village in a building the owner wants to sell as coop units via an eviction plan i know this though the poor tenants dont yet and judging from incomes and credit histories most of them are totally screwed the beautiful exotic darkhaired myra is a graduate of nyu and has worked in new york for several years at an advertising agency her mothers still alive but her fathers dead hit and run the john doe warrant still outstanding after all these years police dont pull out the stops for crimes like that at the moment myra is between boyfriends and friendships must be problematic because her recent thirtysecond birthday was marked with a single order of moo shu pork from hunan dynasty on west fourth not a bad choice and a caymus conundrum white from overpriced village wines a subsequent trip to long island on saturday coinciding with local travel by other family members and acquaintances and a large bill with copious brunello at a garden city restaurant of which newsday speaks highly made up for the solitary evening i imagine myra sleeps in a victorias secret t a fact i deduce because she owns five of them in a size too big to wear out in public she wakes early to the thought of an entenmanns danish pastry never lowfat im proud of her for that and homebrewed starbucks she rarely goes to the coffee shops which is a shame since i do like to observe in person the antelope ive had my eye on and starbucks is among the best places on the veldt to do so around eighttwenty she leaves her apartment and heads for work in midtownmaple reed summers advertising where shes a junior account executive onward and upward i continue on my way this sunday wearing a nondescript baseball cap they account for percent of all mens headgear in the metro area and as always eyes down if you think a satellite cant record your smiling face from thirty miles up in space think again somewhere in a dozen servers around the world there are hundreds of pictures of you taken from on high and lets hope all you were doing when they snapped the shutter was squinting away the sun while you glanced up at the goodyear blimp or a cloud shaped like a lamb my passion for collecting includes not only these daily facts but the minds of the sixteens im interested in and myra is no exception she goes for drinks with friends after work with some frequency and ive noticed that she picks up the tab often too often in my opinion clearly shes buying their loveright dr phil possibly had acne during the adolescence terrible she still sees a dermatologist once in a while though the bills are low as if shes just debating dermabrasion completely unnecessary from what ive seen or checking to make sure the zits arent returning like ninjas in the night then after the three rounds of cosmopolitans with the gals or a visit to a fitandstart health club its home to phone calls the ubiquitous computer and basic not premium cable i enjoy tracking her viewing habits her show selections suggest extreme loyalty she changed networks when seinfeld did and she blew off two dates to spend the night with jack bauer bedtime follows and she sometimes enjoys a bit of distraction buying doublea batteries in bulk tells the tale her digital camera and ipod being rechargeable of course those are the data on her weekday life but todays a glorious sunday and sundays are different this is when myra climbs aboard her beloved and very expensive bicycle and heads out to cruise the streets of her city the routes vary central park might figure as does riverside park and prospect park in brooklyn but whatever the path myra makes one particular stop without fail toward the end of her journey hudsons gourmet deli on broadway and then food and shower beckoning she takes the fastest bike route homewhich owing to the madness of downtown traffic is right past the very spot where im standing at the moment im in front of a courtyard leading to a groundfloor loft owned by maury and stella griszinski imaginebuying ten years ago for the griszinskis arent home though because theyre enjoying a springtime cruise in scandinavia theyve stopped the mail and have hired no plant waterers or pet sitters and theres no alarm system no sign of her yet hm has something intervened i might be wrong but i rarely am five agonizing minutes pass i pull images of the harvey prescott painting out of my mental collection i enjoy them for a time and tuck them back i glance around and i resist a salivating urge to go through the fat trash bin here to see what treasures it might hold stay in the shadows stay off the grid especially at times like this and avoid the windows at all costs youd be amazed at the lure of voyeurism and how many people are watching you from the other side of the glass which to you is only a reflection or glare where is she where if i dont get my transaction soon and then ah i feel the slam within me as i see her myra moving slowly low gear beautiful legs pumping away a bike more than my first car cost ah the bicycle outfit is tight my breath is fast i need her so badly a glance up and down the street empty except for the approaching woman whos now getting close thirty feet away cell phone off but flipped open and up to my ear food emporium bag dangling i glance at her once stepping to the curb as i carry on an animated and entirely fictitious conversation i pause to let her pass frowning looking up then smiling myra she slows biking outfit so tight control it control it act casual nobody in the empty windows facing the street no traffic myra weinburg the squeal of bike brakes hi the greeting and attempted flash of recognition are due solely to the fact that people would rather do almost anything than be embarrassed im totally in the role of the mature businessman as i walk toward her telling my invisible friend ill call back and close the phone she replies im sorry a smiling frown youre mike im the ae from ogilvy i think we met atyeah thats it the national foods shoot at davids we were in the second studio i came by and met you andwhats his name richie you guys had a better caterer than we did now a hearty smile oh sure she remembers david and national foods and richie and the photo studios caterer but she cant remember me because i was never there and nobody named mike was there either but she wont focus on that because it happens to be the name of her dead father good seeing you i say giving her my best howsthisforacoincidence grin you live around here village you a nod to the griszinskis there wow a loft sweet i ask about her job she asks about mine then i wince better get inside i just ran out for lemons holding up the citrus prop got some people over my voice fades as a brilliant idea comes to mind hey i dont know if you have plans but were having a late brunch you want to join us oh thanks but im a mess pleasewe were out all day on a walk for the cure my partner and me nice touch i think and wholly improvised were sweatier than you believe me this is way casual itll be fun theres a senior ae from thompson there and a couple guys from burston cute but straight i shrug mournfully and weve got a surprise actor too i wont tell you who well oh come on you look like you need a cosmo at the photo shoot didnt we both decide that was our favorite drink chapter six the tombs okay it wasnt the tombs any longer the original one from the s that building was long gone but everybody still used the name when describing this place the manhattan detention center downtown in which arthur rhyme was now sitting his heart doing the same despairing thud thud thud it had regularly since he was arrested but whether the place was called the tombs the mdc or the bernard kerik center as it had been temporarily until the former police chief and corrections head went down in flames to arthur the place was simply hell absolute hell he was in an orange jumpsuit like everyone else but there the similarity with his fellow cons ended the fivefooteleven man pounds with corporateclipped brown hair was as different as could be from the other souls awaiting trial here no he wasnt big and inked hed learned that meant tattooed or shaved or stupid or black or latino the sort of criminal arthur would resemblebusinessmen charged with whitecollar crimesdidnt reside in the tombs until trial they were out on bond whatever sins theyd committed the infractions didnt warrant the twomilliondollar bail set for arthur so the tombs had been his home since may the longest and most wrenchingly difficult period of his life and bewildering arthur might have met the woman he was supposed to have killed but he couldnt even recall her yes hed been to that gallery in soho where apparently shed browsed too though he couldnt remember talking to her and yes he loved the work of harvey prescott and had been sick at heart when hed had to sell his canvas after losing his job but stealing one killing someone were they fucking mad do i look like a killer it was a hopeless mystery to him like fermats theorem the mathematical proof that even after learning the explanation he still didnt get her blood in his car he was being framed of course even thinking the police might have done it themselves after ten days in the tombs ojs defense seems a bit less twilight zone why why why who was behind this he thought of the angry letters hed written when princeton passed him over some were stupid and petty and threatening well there were plenty of unstable people in the academic field maybe they wanted revenge for the stink hed made and then that student in his class whod come on to him hed told her no he didnt want to have an affair shed gone ballistic fatal attraction the police had checked her out and decided she wasnt behind the killing but how hard had they worked to verify her alibi he looked around the large common area now the dozens of nearby consthe inside word for prisoners at first hed been regarded as a curiosity his stock seemed to rise when theyd learned hed been arrested for murder but then it fell at the news that the victim hadnt tried to steal his drugs or cheat on himtwo acceptable reasons for killing a woman then when it was clear he was just one of those white guys whod fucked up life got ugly jostling challenges taking his milk cartonjust like in middle school the sex thing wasnt what people thought not here these were all new arrestees and everybody could keep their dicks in their jumpsuits for a time but hed been assured by a number of his new friends that his virginity wouldnt last long once he got to one of the long hauls like attica especially if he earned a quarterpoundertwentyfive to life hed been punched in the face four times tripped twice and pinned to the floor by psycho aquilla sanchez who dripped sweat into his face as he screamed in spanglish until some bored hacks that is guards pulled him off arthur had peed his pants twice and puked a dozen times he was a worm scum not worth fucking until later and the way his heart kept thudding he expected it to pop apart at any moment as had happened to henry rhyme his father though the famed professor had died not in an ignoble place like the tombs of course but on an appropriately stately collegiate sidewalk in hyde park illinois how had this happened a witness and evidenceit made no sense take the plea mr rhyme the assistant district attorney had said id recommend it his attorney had too i know the ins and outs art its like im reading a fucking gps map i can tell you exactly where this is goingand its not the needle albany cant write a death penalty law to save its life sorry bad joke but youre still looking at twentyfive years i can get you fifteen go for it but i didnt do it uhhuh that doesnt really mean a whole lot to anybody arthur but i didnt uhhuh well im not taking a plea the juryll understand theyll see me theyll know im not a killer silence then fine though it wasnt fine clearly he was pissed off despite the six hundred plus an hour he was racking upand where the hell was that kind of money going to come from he then suddenly arthur looked up to see two cons studying him latinos they were regarding him now with no expression whatsoever on their faces not friendly not challenging not tough they seemed curious as they approached him he debated whether to get up or to stay put stay but look down he looked down one of the men stood in front of him putting his scuffed running shoes right in arthurs line of vision the other went around to the back he was going to die arthur rhyme knew it just do it fast and get it fucking over with yo the man behind him said in a high voice arthur looked up at the second in front he had bloodshot eyes and a large earring bad teeth arthur couldnt speak yo came the voice again arthur swallowed didnt want to but couldnt help himself we talking to you me an my friend you no be civil why you a prick sorry i justhello yo whatchu do for work man high voice asked his back im his mind froze what should i say im a scientist earring man fuck scientist whatchu do like make rockets they both laughed no medical equipment like that shit you know they say clear and electrocute you like er no its complicated earring man frowned i didnt mean that arthur said quickly its not that you couldnt understand it its just hard to explain qualitycontrol systems for dialysis and high voice make good money huh hear you had a nice suit when you got prossed i got oh processed i dont know i got it at nordstrom nordstrom the fuck is nordstrom a store as arthur looked back down at earring mans feet the con continued i saying good money how much you make i you going to say you dont know i yes he was how much you make i dontid guess about six figures fuck arthur didnt know if this meant the amount was a lot or a little to them then high voice laughed you got a family im not telling you anything about them this was defiant you got a family arthur rhyme was looking away at the wall nearby where a nail protruded from mortar between cinder blocks meant to hold a sign he assumed that had been taken down or stolen years ago leave me alone i dont want to talk to you he tried to make his voice forceful but he sounded like a girl approached by a nerd at a dance we trying to make civil conversation man he actually said that civil conversation then he thought hell maybe they are just trying to be pleasant maybe they couldve been friends watched his back for him christ knew he needed all the friends he could get could he salvage this im sorry its just thiss a really weird thing for me ive never been in any trouble before im just what you wife do she a scientist too she a smart girl i the intended words evaporated she got big titties you fuck her in the ass listen up science fuck heres how it gonna work you smart wife she goin to get some money from the bank ten thousand and she gonna take a drive up to my cousin in the bronx an the tenor voice faded a black prisoner sixtwo massive with muscle and fat his jumpsuit sleeves rolled up approached the trio he was gazing at the two latinos and squinting mean yo chihuahuas get the fuck outa here arthur rhyme was frozen he couldnt have moved if someone had started shooting at him which wouldnt have surprised him even here in the realm of the magnetometers fuck you nigger earring man said piece of shit from high voice drawing a laugh from the black guy who put an arm around earring man and led him away whispering something to him the latinos eyes glazed and he nodded to his buddy who joined him the two walked to the far corner of the area feigning indignity if arthur werent so frightened he would have thought this was amusingfaceddown bullies from his childrens school the black man stretched and arthur heard a joint pop his heart was thudding even harder a halfformed prayer crossed his mind for the coronary to take him away now right now thanks the black guy said fuck you them two they pricks they gotta know the way it is you unnerstand what im saying no no clue but arthur rhyme said still my names art i know the fuck yo name everbody know everthing round here cept you you don know shit but one thing arthur rhyme knew and knew it with certainty he was dead and so he said okay then tell me who the fuck you are asshole the huge face turned toward him smelling sweat and smoky breath arthur thought of his family his children first and then judy his parents mother first then father then surprisingly he thought of his cousin lincoln recalling a footrace through a hot illinois field one summer when they were teenagers race you to that oak tree see it that one over there on three you ready onetwothreego but the man just turned away and stalked across the hall to another black prisoner they tapped fists together and arthur rhyme was forgotten he sat watching their camaraderie feeling more and more forlorn then he closed his eyes and lowered his head arthur rhyme was a scientist he believed that life advanced via the process of natural selection divine justice played no role but now sunk in a depression as relentless as winter tides he couldnt help wondering if some system of retribution as real and invisible as gravity existed and was now at work punishing him for the bad hed done in his life oh hed done much good raised children taught them openminded values and tolerance been a good companion to his wife helped her through a cancer incident contributed to the great body of science that enriched the world yet there was bad too there always is sitting here in his stinking orange jumpsuit he struggled to believe that by the right thoughts and vowsand faith in the system he dutifully supported every election dayhe could work his way back to the other side of the scale of justice and be reunited with his family and life that with the right spirit and intention he could outrun fate through the same breathless effort with which hed beaten lincoln in that hot dusty field charging all out toward the oak tree that maybe he could be saved it might move he jumped at the word though the speakers voice was soft another prisoner white shaggy hair full of tats but light on teeth and twitchy as the drugs leached from his system had come up behind him he stared at the bench where arthur sat though he could have picked anywhere his eyes were just plain mean and arthurs momentary hopein some measurable and scientific system of moral justicevanished one word from this small but damaged and dangerous man killed it move struggling to hold back tears arthur rhyme moved chapter seven the phone rang and lincoln rhyme was irritated by the distraction he was thinking about their mr x and the mechanics of planting the evidence if in fact that was what had happened and wanted no distractions but then reality struck he saw the in the caller id the country code that included england command answer phone he ordered instantly click yes inspector longhurst hed given up on first names relations with scotland yard required a certain propriety detective rhyme hello she said we have some movement here go on rhyme said danny krueger heard from one of his former gunrunners it seems that the reason richard logan left london was to collect something in manchester we arent sure what but we do know that manchesters got more than its share of blackmarket weapons dealers any idea where he is exactly dannys still trying to find out it would be lovely if we could take him there rather than wait till london is danny being subtle rhyme remembered from the videoconference a big tanned loud south african with a belly and a gold pinkie ring that both jutted outward alarmingly rhyme had had a case involving darfur and he and krueger had spent some time talking about the countrys tragic conflict oh he knows what hes doing hes subtle when he needs to be fierce as a hound when the situation calls for it hell get the details if theres any way were working with our counterparts in manchester to get an assault team ready well call you back when we know something more he thanked her and they disconnected well get him rhyme sachs said not simply for his benefit she too had an interest in finding logan sachs herself had nearly died in one of his plots sachs took a call she listened and said shed be there in ten minutes the files in those other cases flintlock mentioned theyre ready ill go get them oh and pam might stop by whats she up to studying with a friend in manhattana boyfriend good for her who some kid from school cant wait to meet him hes all she talks about she sure deserves somebody decent in her life but i just dont want her getting too close too fast ill feel better when ive met him and given him the third degree in person rhyme nodded as sachs left but his mind was elsewhere he was staring at the whiteboard containing the information on the alice sanderson case as he ordered the phone to make another call hello a soft male voice answered as a waltz played in the background loud mel is that you lincoln whats that goddamn music where are you new england ballroom competition answered mel cooper rhyme sighed washing dishes theater matinees ballroom dancing he hated sundays well i need you ive got a case its unique theyre all unique with you lincoln this ones more unique than others if youll forgive the grammatical misdemeanor can you come in you mentioned new england dont tell me youre in boston or maine midtown and i guess im freegretta and i were just eliminated rosie talbot and bryan marshall are going to win its all the scandal he said this with some significance how soon now cooper chuckled how long will you need me maybe a while as in six oclock tonight or as in wednesday better call your supervisor and tell him youre being reassigned i hope it wont be longer than wednesday ill have to give him a name whos running the investigation lon let me put it this way be a little vague well lincoln you do remember being a cop dont you vague doesnt fly very specific does there isnt exactly a lead detective youre on your own his voice was uncertain not exactly theres amelia theres ron thats all you i see whos the perp actually the perpsre already in jail two are convicted ones awaiting trial and you have your doubts that we got the right parties something like that a detective with the nypd crime scene unit mel cooper specialized in lab work and he was one of the most brilliant officers on the force as well as one of the most savvy oh so you want me to help you find out how my bosses screwed up and arrested the wrong people then talk them into opening three new and expensive investigations against the real perps who by the way probably wont be real tickled either when they learn that theyre not getting off scotfree after all this is sort of a loseloselose situation isnt it lincoln apologize to your girlfriend for me mel be here soon sachs was halfway to her crimson camaro ss when she heard hey amelia she turned to see a pretty teenage girl with long chestnut hair streaked with red and a few tasteful piercings in both ears she was lugging two canvas bags her face dusted with delicate freckles was radiant with happiness youre leaving she asked sachs big case im going downtown want a ride sure ill get the train at city hall pam climbed into the car how was studying you know so wheres your friend sachs was looking around you just missed him stuart everett was a student at the manhattan high school pam was attending shed been going out with him for several months theyd met in class and immediately discovered a mutual love of books and music they were in the schools poetry club which reassured sachs at least he wasnt a biker or a knuckledragging jock pam tossed one of her bags containing schoolbooks into the backseat and opened the other one a fuzzyheaded dog looked out hey jackson sachs said petting his head the tiny havanese grabbed the milkbone the detective offered from an addon cup holder whose sole purpose was as a reservoir of dog treats sachss acceleration and cornering habits werent conducive to keeping liquids contained stuart couldnt walk you here what kind of gentleman is that hes got this soccer game hes way into sports are most guys like that pulling into traffic sachs gave a wry laugh yup it seemed an odd question from a girl this age most of whom would know all about boys and sports but pam willoughby wasnt like most girls when she was very young her father died on a un peacekeeping mission and her unstable mother had flung herself into the political and religious rightwing underground growing more and more militant she was now serving a life sentence for murder she was responsible for the un bombing some years ago in which six people died amelia sachs and pam had met back then when the detective had saved the girl from a serial kidnapper she then disappeared but by sheer coincidence sachs had rescued her again not long ago liberated from her sociopath family pam had been placed with a foster family in brooklynthough not before sachs had checked out the couple like a secret service agent planning a presidential visit pam enjoyed life with the family but she and sachs continued to hang out together and were close with pams foster mother often fully occupied with taking care of five younger children sachs took on the role of older sister this worked for them both sachs had always wanted children but complications existed shed planned on a family with her first serious livein boyfriend though he a fellow cop proved to be about the worst choice in the world extortion assault and eventually prison for a start after him shed been alone until shed met lincoln rhyme and had been with him ever since rhyme didnt quite get children but he was a good man fair and smart and could separate his stony professionalism from his home life a lot of men couldnt but starting a family would be difficult at this point in their lives they had to contend with the dangers and demands of policing and the restless energy they both feltand the uncertainty about rhymes future health they also had a certain physical barrier to be overcome though the problem theyd learned was sachss not rhymes he was perfectly capable of fathering a family so for now the relationship with pam was enough sachs enjoyed her role and took it seriously the girl was lowering her reticence to trust adults and rhyme genuinely enjoyed her company presently he was helping her outline a book about her experiences in the rightwing underground to be called captivity thom had told her that she had a chance of getting on oprah speeding around a taxi sachs now said you never answered how was studying great you set for that test on thursday got it down no problem sachs gave a laugh you didnt even crack a book today did you amelia come on it was such a neat day the weathers been sucky all week we had to get outside sachss instinct was to remind her of the importance of getting good scores on her finals pam was smart with a high iq and a voracious appetite for books but after her bizarre schooling shed find it tough to get into a good college the girl though looked so happy that sachs relented so whatd you do just walked all the way up to harlem around the reservoir oh and there was this concert by the boathouse just a cover band you know but they totally nailed coldplay pam thought back mostly like stuart and i just talked about nothing thats the best you ask me amelia sachs couldnt disagree is he cute oh yeah way cute have a picture amelia thatd be so uncool after this case is over how bout we have dinner the three of us yeah you really want to meet him any boy going out with you better know that youve got somebody watching your back somebody who carries a gun and handcuffs okay hold on to the dog im in the mood to drive sachs downshifted hard pumped the gas and left two exclamation points of rubber on the dull black asphalt chapter eight since amelia sachs had begun spending occasional nights and weekends here at rhymes certain changes had occurred around the victorian town house when hed lived here alone after the accident and before sachs the place had been more or less neatdepending on whether or not hed been firing aides and housekeepersbut homey wasnt a word that described it nothing personal had graced the wallsnone of the certificates degrees commendations and medals hed received during his celebrated tenure as head of the nypd crimescene operation nor any pictures of his parents teddy and anne or his uncle henrys family sachs hadnt approved its important she lectured your past your family youre purging your history rhyme hed never seen her apartmentthe place wasnt disabled accessiblebut he knew that the rooms were chockablock with evidence of her history hed seen many of the pictures of course amelia sachs as a pretty young girl with freckles that had long since vanished who didnt smile a lot as a high school student with mechanics tools in hand as a collegeage daughter flanked on holidays by a grinning cop father and a stern mother as a magazine and advertising model her eyes offering the chic frigidity that was au courant but which rhyme knew was contempt for the way models were considered mere coat hangers hundreds of other pix too shot mostly by her father the man with a quickdraw kodak sachs had studied rhymes bare walls and had gone where the aideseven thomdid not the boxes in the basement scores of cartons containing evidence of rhymes prior life his life in the before artifacts hidden away and as unmentioned as first wife to second many of these certificates and diplomas and family pictures now filled the walls and mantelpiece including the one he was presently studyingof himself as a lean teenager in a track uniform taken after hed just competed in a varsity meet it depicted him with unruly hair and a prominent tom cruise nose bending forward with his hands on his knees having just finished what was probably a mile run rhyme was never a sprinter he liked the lyricism the elegance of the longer distances he considered running a process sometimes he would not stop running even after crossing the finish line his family would have been in the stands both father and uncle resided in suburbs of chicago though some distance apart lincolns home was to the west in the flat balding sprawl that was then still partly farmland a target of both thoughtless developers and frightening tornados henry rhyme and his family were somewhat immune to both being on the lakefront in evanston henry commuted twice a week to teach his advanced physics courses at the university of chicago a long twotrain trek through the citys many social divides his wife paula taught at northwestern the couple had three children robert marie and arthur all named after scientists oppenheimer and curie being the most famous art was named after arthur compton who in ran the famed metallurgic lab at the university of chicago the cover for the project to create the worlds first controlled nuclear chain reaction all the children had attended good schools robert northwestern medical marie ucberkeley arthur went to mit robert had died years earlier in an industrial accident in europe marie was working in china on environmental issues as for the rhyme parents only one remained of the four aunt paula now lived in an assistedcare facility amid vivid coherent memories of sixty years ago while experiencing the present in bewildering fragments rhyme now continued to stare at the picture of himself he was unable to look away recalling the track meet in his college classes professor henry rhyme signified approval with a subtle raised eyebrow but on the playing field he was always leaping to his feet in the bleachers whistling and bellowing for lincoln to push push push you can do it encouraging him over the finish line first he often was following the meet rhyme supposed hed gone off with arthur the boys spent as much time together as they could filling the sibling gap robert and marie were considerably older than arthur and lincoln was an only child so lincoln and art adopted each other most weekends and every summer the surrogate brothers would go off on their adventures often in arthurs corvette uncle henry even as a professor made several times what rhymes father did teddy was a scientist too though he was more comfortable out of the spotlight the boys outings were typical teenage venturegirls ball games movies arguing eating burgers and pizza sneaking beer and explaining the world and more girls now sitting in the new tdx wheelchair rhyme wondered where exactly he and arthur had gone after the meet arthur his surrogate brother who never came to see him after his spine was cracked like a piece of defective wood why arthur tell me why but these memories were derailed by the ringing doorbell in his town house thom veered toward the hallway and a moment later a slightly built balding man wearing a tuxedo strode into the room mel cooper shoved his thick glasses up on his thin nose and nodded to rhyme afternoon formal rhyme asked glancing at the tux the dance competition if wed been finalists you know i wouldnt have come he took off jacket and bow tie then rolled up the sleeves of the frilly shirt so what do we have this unique case you were telling me about rhyme filled him in im sorry about your cousin lincoln i dont think you ever mentioned him what do you think of the mo if its true its brilliant cooper gazed at the evidence chart of the alice sanderson homicide thoughts rhyme asked well half the evidence at your cousins was in the car or the garage a lot easier to plant it there than in the house exactly what i was thinking the doorbell rang again a moment later rhyme heard his aides footsteps returning solo rhyme was wondering if someone had delivered a package but then his mind jumped sunday a visitor could be in street clothes and running shoes which would make no sound on the entryway floor of course young ron pulaski turned the corner and nodded shyly he wasnt a rookie any longer having been a uniformed patrolman for several years but he looked like a rookie and so to rhyme thats what he was and probably would always be the shoes were indeed quiet nikes but he was wearing a very loud hawaiian shirt over blue jeans his blond hair was stylishly spiked and a scar prominently marked his foreheada remnant from a nearly fatal attack during his first case with rhyme and sachs the assault was so vicious that hed suffered a brain injury and nearly quit the force the young man had decided to fight his way through rehab and stay on the nypd inspired largely by rhyme a fact he shared only with sachs of course not the criminalist himself she relayed the news he blinked at coopers tux and then nodded hello to both men your dishes spotless pulaski your flowers watered your leftovers tucked away in freezer bags i left right away sir the men were going over the case when they heard sachss voice from the doorway a costume party she was looking at coopers tuxedo and pulaskis brash shirt to the lab man she said youre looking pretty smart thats the word for somebody in a tux right smart sadly semifinalist is the only thing that comes to my mind is gretta taking it well his beautiful scandinavian girlfriend was he reported hanging out with her friends and drowning her sorrows with aquavit her homelands beverage but if you ask me its undrinkable hows your mom cooper lived with his mother a feisty lady who was a longterm queensean shes doing well out for brunch at the boat house sachs also asked about pulaskis wife and two young children then added thanks for coming in on sunday to rhyme you did tell him how much we appreciate it didnt you im sure i did he muttered now if we could get to work so whatve you got he eyed the large brown folder she carried evidence inventory and photos from the coin theft and rape wheres the actual pe archived in the evidence warehouse on long island well lets take a look as she had with his cousins file sachs picked up a marker and began writing on another whiteboard homicidetheftmarch march crime homicide theft of six boxes of rare coins cod blood loss shock due to multiple stab wounds location bay ridge brooklyn victim howard schwartz suspect randall pemberton evidence log from victims house grease flecks of dried hair spray polyester fibers wool

attempted to fence the particular stolen coins so if our perp stole the coins hes kept them and dust matching nothing at either crime scenethat means it probably came from the perps house but what the hell kind of dust is it didnt they analyze it rhyme shook his head okay i want to see the pictures where are they im getting them hold on sachs found some tape and mounted printouts on a third whiteboard rhyme maneuvered closer and squinted up at the dozens of photos of the crime scenes the coin collectors living space was tidy the perps less so the kitchen where the coin and knife had been found under the sink was cluttered the table covered with dirty dishes and food cartons on the table was a pile of mail most of it apparently junk next one he announced lets go he tried to keep his

below the supposed perp saved his socks with blood on them and took them home with him bullshit planted evidence rhyme read through the material again whats the note below sachs found it a few paragraphs to the prosecutor from the lead detective about possible problems with this case she showed it to rhyme stan a couple potential glitches the defense might try to bring up possible contamination issue similar tobacco flakes found at crime scene and perps home but neither the victim or the suspect smoked arresting officers and crime scene staff questioned but assured lead detective that they were not the source found no dna linking material other than victims blood suspect has an alibi eyewitness who placed him outside his own houseabout four miles away at around the time of the crime alibi witness is a homeless man who suspect gives money to occasionally had an alibi sachs pointed out who the jury didnt believe obviously what do you think mel rhyme asked im sticking to my story it all lines up too conveniently pulaski nodded the hair spray the soap the fibers the lubricanteverything cooper continued theyre obvious choices for planted evidence and look at the dnaits not the suspects at the crime scene its the victims at the suspects home thats a lot easier to plant rhyme continued to examine the charts scanning slowly sachs added but not all of the evidence matches the old cardboard and the dustthose arent related to either scene rhyme said and the tobacco neither the vic nor the fall guy smoked that means those might be from the real perp pulaski asked what about the dolls hair does that mean he has kids rhyme ordered tape up those pictures lets take a look like the other scenes the victims apartment and the perps house and garage had been well documented by the crime scene unit rhyme scanned the photos no dolls no toys at all maybe the real killer has children or some contact with toys and he smokes or has some access to cigarettes or tobacco good oh were on to something here lets do a profile chart weve been calling him mr x but we need something else for our perp whats todays date may twentysecond pulaski said okay unknown subject five twentytwo sachs if you would he nodded toward a whiteboard lets start the profile unsub profile male possibly smokes or livesworks with someone who does or near source of tobacco has children or livesworks near them or near source of toys interest in art coins nonplanted evidence dust old cardboard hair from doll basf b nylon tobacco from tareyton cigarettes well it was a start he reflected if a pretty lame one should we call lon and malloy sachs asked rhyme scoffed and tell them what he nodded at the chart i think our little clandestine operationd get closed down pretty fast you mean this isnt official pulaski asked welcome to the underground sachs said the young officer digested this information thats why were in disguise cooper added pointing at the black satin strip on his tuxedo trousers he might have winked but rhyme couldnt tell through his dense glasses whatre our next steps sachs call crime scene in queens we cant get our hands on the evidence in my cousins case with the trial coming up all the pell be in custody at the prosecutors office but see if anybody at the warehouse can send us the evidence from these earlier crimesthe rape and the coin theft i want the dust cardboard and rope and pulaski you go down to the big building i want you to look through the files of every murder in the past six months every murder the mayors cleaned up the city didnt you hear be thankful were not in detroit or washington flintlock thought of these two cases ill bet there are others look for an underlying crime maybe theft maybe rape ending in homicide clear class evidence and an anonymous call right after the crime oh and a suspect who swears hes innocent okay sir and us mel cooper asked we wait rhyme muttered as if the word were an obscenity chapter nine a wonderful transaction im satisfied now walking down the street happy content flipping through the images ive just slipped into my collection images of myra the visual ones are stored in my memory the digital tape recorder has the others walking down the street watching sixteens around me i see them streaming down sidewalks in cars buses taxis trucks i see them through windows oblivious to me as i study them sixteensah im not the only one who refers to human beings like this of course not at all its a common shorthand in the industry but im probably the only one who prefers to think of people as sixteens who feels comforted by the thought a sixteendigit number is far more precise and efficient than a name names make me edgy i dont like that its not good for me not good for anybody when im edgy namesah terrible for instance the surnames jones and brown each account for roughly percent of the population of the united states moore is percent and as for everyones favorite smitha whopping percent nearly of them in the country and given names if youre interested john nope it comes in number two percent james is the winner at percent so think of the implications i hear someone say james smith well which james smith does he mean when there are hundreds of thousands and those are just the living ones tally up all the james smiths in history oh my god drives me crazy just to think about edgy and the consequences of mistakes can be serious say its berlin is herr wilhelm frankel the jewish wilhelm frankel or the gentile one made a big difference and whatever else you feel about them those brownshirted boys were absolute geniuses at tracking identities and they used computers to do it names lead to mistakes mistakes are noise noise is contamination contamination must be eliminated there could be dozens of alice sandersons but only one alice who sacrificed her life that i might own an american family painting by dear mr prescott myra weinburgs ah not many surely but more than one yet only myra sacrificed herself so that i might be satisfied ill bet there are plenty of deleon williams but only is going to jail forever for raping and killing her so that i might remain free to do it all over again im en route to his house at the moment technically his girlfriends ive learned carrying enough evidence to make sure the poor man is convicted of the rapemurder in about one hour of deliberation deleon ive already called a transaction in which i reported an old beige dodgehis model of carspeeding away from the scene a man inside a black man i could see his hands they were all bloody oh get somebody there now the screaming was terrible what a perfect suspect youll be deleon about half of the perpetrators commit rape under the influence of alcohol or drugs he drinks beer in moderation now but was in aa several years ago the majority of rape victims know their assailant deleon had once done some carpentry for the grocery store where the late myra regularly shopped so it was logical to assume that they knew each other though they probably didnt most rapists are thirty or under the exact age of deleon as it turns out unlike drug dealers and users they dont have many prior arrests except for domestic abuseand my boy has a conviction for assaulting a girlfriend how perfect is that most rapists are from the lower social classes and economically disadvantaged hes been out of work for months and now ladies and gentlemen of the jury please note that two days prior to the rape the defendant bought a box of trojanenz condoms just like the two found near the victims body as for the two actually usedmy owntheyre long gone of course that dna stuff is very dangerous especially now that new york is collecting samples from all felonies not just rapes and in britain youll soon get swabbed when you get a citation because your dog messes the sidewalk or you make a dicey uturn theres another fact that the police might take into account if they do their homework deleon was a combat vet whod served in iraq and there was some question about what happened to hiscaliber sidearm when he left the service he had none to turn in it had been lost in combat but curiously he boughtcaliber ammunition a few years ago if the police learn this which they easily can they might conclude that their suspect is armed and digging a bit deeper theyll find that he was treated at a veterans administration hospitalfor posttraumatic stress syndrome an unstable armed suspect what police officer wouldnt be inclined to shoot first lets hope im not always completely confident about the sixteens i pick you never know about unexpected alibis or idiotic juries maybe deleon ll end today in a body bag why not dont i deserve a little good luck in compensation for the edginess god gave me its not always an easy life you know it should take about a half hour or so on foot to get to his house here in brooklyn still warmly satisfied from my transaction with myra im enjoying the walk the backpack rides heavy on my spine not only does it contain the evidence to plant and the shoe that left deleon s telltale footprint but its filled with some treasures ive found prowling the streets today in my pocket is sadly only a small trophy from myra a portion of her fingernail id like something more personal but deaths in manhattan are a big deal and missing parts draw a lot of attention i pick up my pace a bit enjoying the triplet beat of the backpack enjoying the clear spring sunday and the memories of my transaction with myra enjoying the complete comfort of knowing that though i am probably the most dangerous person in the city of new york i am also invulnerable virtually invisible to all the sixteens who would do me harm the light caught his attention a flash from the street red another flash blue the phone sagged in deleon williamss hand he was calling a friend trying to find the man he used to work for the man who skipped town after his carpentry business went under and left only debt behind including more than owed to his most dependable employee deleon williams leon the guy on the other end of the line was saying i myself dont know where the prick is he left me holding call you back click the big mans palms were sweating as he glanced through the curtain that he and janeece had just put up saturday williams feeling bad bad bad that shed had to pay for themoh he hated being unemployed he noticed that the flashes were from the grille lights of two unmarked police cars a couple of detectives climbed out unbuttoning their coats and not because the spring day was so warm the cars sped off to block the intersections they looked around cautiously thendestroying the last hope that this was some strange coincidencewalked to williamss beige dodge noted the tag glanced inside one spoke into his radio williamss lids lowered in despair as a disgusted sigh eased from his lungs she was at it again she last year williams had been involved with a woman who was not only sexy but smart and kind or so it had seemed at first not long after they started going out seriously though shed turned into a raging witch moody jealous vindictive unstablehe was with her about four months and they were the worst of his life and hed spent much of that time protecting her own children from their mother his good deeds in fact had landed him in jail one evening leticia had swung a fist at her daughter for not scrubbing a pot clean enough williams instinctively grabbed the womans arm while the sobbing girl fled hed calmed her mother down and the matter seemed settled but several hours later he had been sitting on the porch debating how he could get the children away from her perhaps back to their father when the police arrived and he was arrested leticia had pressed assault charges displaying the arm bruised by his restraint williams was appalled he explained what had happened but the officers had no choice but to arrest him the case went to trial but williams wouldnt let the daughter take the stand in his defense though the girl wanted to he was found guilty of misdemeanor assault the sentence community service but during the trial hed testified to leticias cruelty the prosecutor believed him and gave the womans name to the department of social services a social worker showed up at her house to investigate the welfare of the children and they were removed and placed in the custody of their father leticia began harassing williams it had persisted for a long time but then shed disappeared months ago and williams was just thinking recently that he was safe but now this he knew she was behind it jesus our lord how much can a man put up with he looked again no the detectives had their guns out a wave of horror zipped through him had she actually hurt one of her kids and claimed that hed done it he wouldnt be surprised williamss hands shook and he cried big tears which streamed down his broad face he felt the same panic that had slammed him in the desert war when hed turned to his buddy just in time to see the grinning alabaman turned into a red mass of nothing thanks to an iraqis rocketpropelled grenade until that moment williams had been more or less fine been shot at spattered with sand from bullets passed out from the heat but seeing jason turn into a thing had affected him fundamentally the posttraumatic stress syndrome hed wrestled with since was now kicking into high gear utter helpless fear no no no no gasping struggling to breathe hed stopped taking his meds months ago believing he was better now watching the detectives fan out around the house deleon williams thought blindly get the hell out run he had to distance himself to show that janeece had no connection to him to save her and her sontwo people he truly lovedhed vanish the man slipped the chain on the front door the deadbolt too and ran upstairs for a bag tossed into it whatever he thought of nothing made sense shave cream but no razors underwear but no shirts shoes but no socks and he took one other thing from the closet his military pistol a colt the weapon was unloadedhe wouldnt think of shooting anyonebut he could use it to bluff his way past the police or hijack a car if he had to all he could think was run go williams took a last look at the picture of janeece and him together with her son on a trip to six flags he started to cry again then wiped his eyes slung the bag over his shoulder and kneading the grip of the heavy pistol started down the stairs chapter ten the forward snipers in position bo haumann former drill sergeant and now head of the citys emergency service unitnypds swat teamgestured at a building that provided a perfect shooting location covering the tiny backyard of the detached house where deleon williams was living yes sir an officer standing nearby said and johnnys got the back covered good a graying man crew cut and tough as leather haumann ordered the two esu takedown teams into position and stay out of sight haumann had been in his own backyard not far from here coaxing last years charcoal to ignite when a call came in about a rapemurder and a solid lead to the suspect he turned over the incendiary mission to his son donned his gear and sped out thanking the good lord that he hadnt popped that first beer haumann would drive after hed had a couple of brews but he never fired a weapon within eight hours of imbibing and there was now a chance on this fine sunday that they would see some gunplay his radio crackled and through the headset earpiece he heard s and s one to base k a search and surveillance team was across the street along with the second sniper base go ahead k getting some thermals somebody could be inside no audible could be haumann thought irritated hed seen the budget for the equipment it ought to be able to say for sure if somebody was insideif not report their goddamn shoe size and whether theyd flossed that morning check again after what seemed like forever he heard s and s one okay weve got only one person inside and a visual through a window its definitely deleon williams from the dmv pic you passed out k good out haumann called the two tactical teams which were moving into position around the house now remaining nearly invisible now we didnt have much time for a briefing but listen up this perp is a rapist and a killer we want him alive but hes too dangerous to let get away if he makes any hostile gesture youre greenlighted b leader roger that be advised were in position alley and streets to the north are covered and back door k a leader to base roger the green light were in position on front door and covering all streets to the south and east snipers haumann radioed you copy the green light roger they added that they were locked and loaded the phrase was a pet peeve of haumanns since it was unique to the old m army rifle with which you had to lock the bolt back and load a clip of bullets through the top you didnt have to lock a modern rifle to load it but now wasnt the time for lectures haumann unsnapped the thong on his glock and slipped into the alley behind the house where he was joined by yet more officers whose plans on this idyllic spring sunday like his had changed so fast and dramatically at that moment a voice clattered into his earpiece s and s two to base i think weve got something on his knees deleon williams carefully looked through a crack in the dooran actual crack in the wood that hed been meaning to fixand could see that the officers were no longer there no he corrected himself theyre no longer visible big difference he saw a glint of metal or glass in the bushes maybe from one of those weird elves or deer lawn ornaments the neighbor collected or it might be a cop with a gun lugging the bag he crawled to the back of the house another peek this time risking a look through the window struggling hard to control the panic the backyard and the alley beyond were empty but once again he corrected seemed to be empty he felt another shiver of ptsd panic and an urge to race out the door pull the gun and charge down the alley threatening anybody he saw screaming for them to stand back impulsively his mind whirling he reached for the knob no be smart he sat back head against the wall working to slow his breathing after a moment he calmed and decided to try something else in the basement was a window that led into the tiny side yard across eight feet of anemic grass a similar window opened into his neighbors basement the wongs were away for the weekendhe was watering their plants for themand williams figured he could sneak inside then upstairs and through their back door if he was lucky the police wouldnt be covering the side yard then hed take the alley up to the main street and jog to the subway the plan wasnt great but it gave him more of a chance than just waiting here tears again and panic stop it soldier come on he rose and staggered down the stairs into the basement just get the hell out the copsd be at the front door at any minute kicking it in he unlatched the window and climbed up and out starting to crawl toward the wongs basement window he glanced to his right he froze oh jesus lord police a male and a female detective holding guns in their right hands were crouching in the narrow side yard they werent looking his way but staring out toward the back door and the alley the panic again slammed hard hed pull out the colt and threaten them make them sit down cuff themselves and throw away their radios he hated to do it that would be a real crime but he didnt have any choice they were obviously convinced hed done something terrible yes hed get their guns and flee maybe they had an unmarked car nearby hed take their keys was somebody covering them somebody he couldnt see a sniper maybe well hed just have to take that chance he quietly set the bag down and began to reach for the gun which was when the woman detective turned his way williams gasped im dead he thought janeece i love you but the woman glanced at a piece of paper and then squinted as she looked him over deleon williams his voice gurgled i he nodded shoulders falling he could only stare at her pretty face her red hair in a ponytail her cold eyes she held up the badge that was hanging around her neck were police officers howd you get out of your house then she noted the window and nodded mr williams were in the middle of an operation here could you go back inside youll be safer there i panic was shattering his voice i now she said insistently well be with you as soon as everythings resolved be quiet dont try to leave again please sure isure he left the bag and started to ease through the window she said into her radio thiss sachs id expand the perimeter bo hes going to be real cautious what the hell was going on williams didnt waste time speculating he awkwardly climbed back into the basement and walked upstairs once there he headed straight into the bathroom he lifted the lid off the back of the toilet and dropped the gun in he walked to the window going to peek out once more but then paused and ran back to the toilet just in time to be painfully sick a curious thing to say given this fine dayand given what ive been up to with myra but i miss being in the office first i enjoy working always have and i enjoy the atmosphere the camaraderie with the sixteens around you almost like a family then theres the feeling of being productive being involved in fastpaced new york business cutting edge one hears and thats something i do hate the corporatespeaka phrase that is itself corporatespeak no the great leadersfdr truman caesar hitlerdidnt need to wrap themselves in the cloak of simpleminded rhetoric most important of course is how my job helps me with my hobby no its more than that its vital my particular situation is good very good i can usually get away when i want to with some juggling of commitments i can find time during the week to pursue my passion and given who i am in publicmy professional face you could sayit would be very unlikely for someone to suspect that im a very different person at heart to put it mildly im often at work on weekends too and thats one of my favorite timesif of course im not engaging in a transaction with a beautiful girl like myra or acquiring a painting or comic books or coins or a rare piece of china even when there are few other sixteens present at the office on a holiday saturday or sunday the halls hum with the white noise of wheels moving society slowly forwardinto a bold new world ah heres an antiques store i pause to look into the window there are some pictures and souvenir plates cups and posters that appeal to me sadly i wont be able to return here to shop because its too close to deleon s house the odds of anyone making a connection between me and the rapist are quite minimal butwhy take chances i only shop in stores or scavenge ebay is fun to look at but buying something online youd have to be mad for the time being cash is still good but soon itll be tagged like everything else rfids in the bills its already done in some countries the bank will know which bill was dispensed to you from which atm or bank and theyll know you spent it on coke or a bra for your mistress or as a down payment to a hit man we should go back to gold i sometimes think off the grid ah poor deleon i know his face from the drivers license picture a benign gaze at the civilservant camera i can imagine his expression when the police knock on his door and display the warrant for his arrest on rape and murder charges i can see too the horrified look hell give to his girlfriend janeece and her tenyearold son if theyre home when it happens wonder if hes a crier im three blocks away and ah waitheres something unusual two new crown victorias parked on this treefilled side street statistically its unlikely that this sort of car in such pristine shape would be seen in this neighborhood two identical cars are particularly unlikely and factor in that theyre parked in tandem with no flecks of leaves or pollen unlike the others theyve arrived recently and yes a casual look inside normal passerby curiosity reveals that theyre police cars not predicted procedure for a domestic dispute or breakin yes statistically those infractions occur pretty frequently in this part of brooklyn but rarely the data show at this time of daybefore the sixpacks appear and youd probably never see hidden unmarkeds only blueandwhite squad cars in full view lets think theyre three blocks away from deleon have to consider this it wouldnt be inconceivable for their commander to tell the officers hes a rapist hes dangerous were going to go in in ten minutes park the car three blocks away and get back here pronto i casually glance down the closest alley okay getting worse parked there in the shade is an nypd esu truck emergency service they often back up police arrests of people like deleon but how did they get here so soon i dialed only a half hour ago thats always a risk but if you call too long after a transaction the cops might wonder why you were only now reporting screams or that youd seen a suspicious man earlier now there are two explanations for the polices presence the most logical is that after my anonymous call they did a database search of every beige dodge over five years old in the city of them as of yesterday and that somehow they lucked out with this one theyre convinced even without the evidence i was going to plant in his garage that deleon is the rapist and murderer of myra and theyre arresting him right now or lying in wait for him to return the other explanation is far more troubling the police have decided that hes being set up and theyre lying in wait for me im sweating now this is not good this is not good not good but dont panic your treasures are safe your closet is safe relax still whatevers happened i have to find out if the police presence here is just a perverse coincidence having nothing to do with deleon or with me then ill plant the evidence and get the hell back to my closet but if theyve found out about me they could find out about the others randall and rita and arthur cap down a little more over the eyesthe sunglasses pushed high on my nosei change course completely circling well around the house moving through alleys and gardens and backyards keeping the threeblock perimeter which they helpfully established as my safety zone by parking the crown vic beacons there this takes me in a semicircle to a grassy embankment leading up to the highway climbing up it im able to see the tiny backyards and porches of the houses on deleon s block i begin to count dwellings to find his but i dont need to i see clearly a police officer on the roof of a twostory house behind the alley from his place he has a rifle a sniper theres another with a pair of binoculars too and several more in suits or street clothes crouching in bushes right next to the structure then two cops are pointing in my direction i see that yet another officer was on the top of the house across the street hes pointing my way too and since im not six feet three pounds with skin dark as ebony they arent waiting for deleon theyve been waiting for me my hands are beginning to shake imagine if id blundered right into the middle of that with the evidence in my backpack a dozen other officers are running to their cars or jogging fast in my direction running like wolves i turn and scrabble up the embankment breathing hard panicked im not even to the top when i hear the first of the sirens no no my treasures my closet the highway four lanes total is crowded which is good because the sixteens have to drive slowly i can dodge pretty well even with my head down im sure nobody gets a good look at my face then i vault the barrier and stumble down the other embankment my collecting and other activities keep me in good shape and soon im sprinting fast toward the closest subway station i pause only once to pull on cotton gloves and rip from my backpack the plastic bag containing the evidence i was going to plant then shove it into a trash can i cant be caught with it i cant a half block closer to the subway i dodge into an alley behind a restaurant i turn my reversible jacket inside out swap hats and emerge again my backpack now stuffed into a shopping bag finally im at the subway station andthank youi can feel the musty tunnel breath preceding a train as it approaches then the thunder of the bulky car the squeal of metal on metal but before i get to the turnstile i pause the shock is now gone but its been replaced by the edgy i understand i cant leave just yet the significance of the problem crashes down on me they might not know my identity but theyve figured out what i was doing which means they want to take something away from me my treasures my closeteverything and that of course is unacceptable making sure i stay clear of the cctv camera i casually walk back up the stairs digging in my bag as i leave the subway station where rhymes voice filled amelia sachss earphone where the hell is he he spotted us took off youre sure it was him pretty sure surveillance saw somebody a few blocks away looks like he spotted some of the detectives cars and changed his route we saw him watching us and he ran weve got teams after him she was in deleon williamss front yard with pulaski bo haumann and a half dozen other esu officers some crime scene unit techs and uniformed patrolmen were searching the escape route for evidence and canvassing for witnesses any sign he has a car dont know he was on foot when we saw him christ well let me know when you find something ill click she grimaced at pulaski who was holding his handi talkie up to his ear listening to the pursuit haumann was monitoring it too the progress from what she could hear didnt seem fruitful nobody on the highway had seen him or was willing to admit it if they had sachs turned to the house and saw a very concerned and very confused deleon williams looking out through a curtained window saving the man from being yet another fall guy of had involved both happenstance and good police work and they had ron pulaski to thank for it the young officer in the brash hawaiian shirt had done what rhyme had requested immediately gone to one police plaza and started looking for other cases that matched s modus operandi he found none but as he was talking to a homicide detective the unit got a report from central about an anonymous phone call a man had heard screams from a loft near soho and seen a black man fleeing in an old beige dodge a patrolman had responded and found that a young woman myra weinburg had been raped and murdered pulaski was struck by the anonymous call echoing the earlier cases and immediately called rhyme the criminalist figured that if was in fact behind the crime he was probably sticking to his plan he would plant evidence blaming a fall guy and they needed to find which of the more than older beige dodges was the one might pick sure maybe the man wasnt but even if not they had the chance to collar a rapist and killer at rhymes instruction mel cooper crossmatched department of motor vehicle records with criminal records and came up with seven africanamerican men who had convictions for crimes more serious than traffic violations one though was the most likely an assault charge against a woman deleon williams was a perfect choice as a fall guy happenstance and police work to authorize a tactical takedown a lieutenant or higher was required captain joe malloy still had no clue about the clandestine operation so rhyme called sellitto who grumbled but agreed to call bo haumann and authorize an esu op amelia sachs had joined pulaski and the team at williamss house where theyd learned from search and surveillance that only williams was inside not there they deployed to take the killer when he arrived to plant the evidence the plan was tricky improvised on the flyand obviously hadnt worked though theyd saved an innocent man from being arrested for rape and murder and perhaps had discovered some good evidence to lead to the perp anything she asked haumann whod been conferring with some of his officers nope then his radio clattered again and sachs heard the loud transmission unit one were on the other side of the highway looks like hes rabbited clean he mustve made it to the subway shit she muttered haumann grimaced but said nothing the officer continued but weve followed the route he probably took its possible he ditched some evidence in a trash can on the way thats something she said where she jotted the address the officer recited tell them to secure the area ill be there in ten sachs then walked up the steps and knocked on the door deleon williams answered and she said sorry i havent had a chance to explain a man we were trying to catch was headed to your house mine we think so but he got away she explained about myra weinburg oh noshes dead im afraid so im sorry real sorry did you know her no never heard of her we think the perp mightve been trying to blame you for the crime me why we have no idea after we investigate a little more we may want to interview you sure thing he gave her his home and mobile numbers then frowned can i ask you seem pretty certain i didnt do it howd you know i was innocent your car and garage officers searched them and didnt find any evidence from the murder scene the killer were pretty sure was going to plant some things there to implicate you of course if wed gotten here after hed done that youdve had a problem sachs added oh one more thing mr williams whats that detective just some trivia you might be interested in do you know owning an unregistered handgun in new york city is a very serious crime i think i heard that somewhere and some more trivia is that theres an amnesty program at your local precinct no questions asked if you turn in a weaponokay you take care enjoy the rest of your weekend ill try chapter eleven im watching the policewoman as she searches the trash can where i dumped the evidence i was dismayed at first but then i realized i shouldnt have been if they were smart enough to figure out about me theyre smart enough to find the trash i doubt they got a good look at me but im being very careful of course im not at the scene itself im in a restaurant across the street forcing down a hamburger and sipping water the police have this outfit called the anticrime detail which has always struck me as absurd as if other details are procrime anticrime officers wear street clothes and they circulate at crime scenes to find witnesses and occasionally even the perps who have returned most criminals do so because theyre stupid or behave irrationally but im here for two specific reasons first because ive realized i have a problem i cant live with it so i need a solution and you cant solve a problem without knowledge ive already learned a few things for instance i know some of the people who are after me like this redheaded policewoman in a white plastic jumpsuit concentrating on the crime scene the way i concentrate on my data i see her step out of the area surrounded by yellow tape with several bags she sets these in gray plastic boxes and strips off the white suit despite the lingering horror from the disaster of this afternoon i feel that twinge inside as i see her tight jeans the satisfaction from my transaction with myra earlier today wearing off as the police head back to their cars she makes a phone call i pay the bill and walk nonchalantly out the door acting like any other patron on this fine lateafternoon sunday off the grid oh the second reason im here very simple to protect my treasures to protect my life which means doing whatevers necessary to make them go away whatd five twentytwo leave in that trash can rhyme was speaking into the handsfree phone theres not much were sure its his stuff though bloody paper towel and some wet blood in plastic bagsso he could leave some in williams car or garage ive already sent a sample to the lab for a preliminary dna match computer printout of the vics picture roll of duct tapehome depot house brand and a running shoe it looked new just one yep the right maybe he stole it from williams place to leave a print at the scene anybody get a look at him a sniper and two guys from the s and s team but he wasnt very close probably white or lightskinned ethnic medium build tan cap and sunglasses backpack no age no hair color thats it yep well get the evidence here stat then i want you to walk the grid at the weinburg rape scene theyre preserving it till you get there ive got another lead rhyme you do whats that we found a postit note stuck to the bottom of the plastic bag with the evidence in it five twentytwo wanted to ditch the bag im not sure he wanted to pitch out the note what is it a room number of a residence hotel upper east side manhattan i want to check it out you think its five twentytwos no i called the front desk and they say the tenants been in the room all day somebody named robert jorgensen well we need the rape scene searched sachs send ron he can handle it id rather you ran it i really think we need to see if theres any connection between this jorgensen and five twentytwo and fast he couldnt dispute her point besides both of them had ridden pulaski hard in teaching him how to walk the gridrhymes coined expression for searching a crime scene a reference to looking over the area according to the grid pattern the most comprehensive way of discovering evidence rhyme feeling both like a boss and a parent knew that the kid would have to run his first homicide scene solo sooner or later all right he grumbled lets hope this postit lead pays off he couldnt help adding and isnt a complete waste of time she laughed dont we always hope that rhyme and tell pulaski not to screw up they disconnected and rhyme told cooper the evidence was on its way staring at the evidence charts he muttered he got away he ordered thom to put the sparse description of on the whiteboard probably white or lightskinned how helpful is that amelia sachs was in the front seat of her parked camaro the door open lateafternoon spring air was wafting into the car which smelled of old leather and oil she was jotting notes for her crimescene report she always did this as soon as possible after searching a scene it was amazing what one could forget in a short period of time colors changed left became right doors and windows moved from one wall to another or vanished altogether she paused distracted once again by the odd facts of the case how had the killer managed to come so close to blaming an innocent man for an appalling rape and murder shed never run into a perp like this planting evidence to mislead the police wasnt unusual but this guy was a genius at pointing them in the wrong direction the street where shed parked was two blocks away from the trashcan crime scene shadowed and deserted motion caught her eye thinking of she felt a throb of uneasiness she glanced up and in the rearview mirror saw somebody walking her way she squinted studying him carefully though the man seemed harmless a cleancut businessman he was carrying a takeout bag in one hand and talking on his cell phone a smile on his face a typical resident out to get chinese or mexican for dinner sachs returned to her notes finally she was finished and tucked them into her briefcase but then something struck her as strange the man on the sidewalk should have passed the camaro by now but he hadnt had he gone into one of the buildings she turned to the sidewalk where hed been no she was staring at the takeout bag sitting on the sidewalk to the left and behind the car it was just a prop her hand went for her glock but before she could draw the right side door was ripped open and she was staring into the face of the killer eyes narrowed lifting a pistol toward her face the doorbell rang and a moment later rhyme heard yet another distinctive footfall heavy ones in here lon detective lon sellitto nodded a greeting his stocky figure was encased in blue jeans and a dark purple izod shirt and he was wearing running shoes which surprised rhyme the criminalist rarely saw him in casual clothes he was also struck by the fact that while sellitto didnt seem to own a suit that wasnt fiercely wrinkled this outfit looked hot off the ironing board the only disfigurements were a few stretch marks in the cloth where his belly jutted past his waistband and the bulge in the back where his offduty pistol was not efficiently hidden he rabbited i heard rhyme spat out gone completely the floor creaked under the big mans weight as he ambled to the evidence charts and looked them over thats what youre calling him five twentytwo may twentysecond what happened with the russian case sellitto didnt answer mr five twentytwo leave anything behind were about to find out he ditched a bag of evidence he was going to plant its on its way that was courteous iced tea coffee yeah the detective muttered to thom thanks coffee you have skim milk two percent good and any of those cookies from last time the chocolate chip ones just oatmeal thosere good too mel thom asked you want something if i eat or drink near an examining table i get yelled at rhyme snapped its hardly my fault if defense lawyers have this thing about excluding contaminated evidence i didnt make the rules sellitto observed see your mood hasnt improved whats going on in london now thats a subject i dont want to talk about well just to improve your spirits we got another problem malloy yep he heard amelia was running a scene and i okayed an esu action he got all happy thinking it was the dienko case then all sad when he found out it wasnt he asked if it was connected with you ill take a fist on the chin for you linc but not a bullet i dimed you out oh thanks nodding as thom brought him the refreshments the aide set a similar offering on a table not far from cooper who pulled on latex gloves and started on a cookie some scotch if you please rhyme said quickly no thom was gone scowling rhyme said i figured malloyd bust us as soon as esu was involved but we need brass on our side now that its a hot case what do we do better think of something fast cause he wants us to call like a half hour ago he sipped more coffee and with some reluctance set down the remaining quarter of his cookie with the apparent resolve not to finish it well i need the brass on board weve got to have people out there looking for this guy then lets call you ready yeah yeah sellitto dialed a number hit speaker lower the volume rhyme said i suspect this could be loud malloy here rhyme could hear the sounds of the wind voices and the clink of dishes or glassware maybe he was at an outdoor café captain youre on speaker with lincoln rhyme and me okay what the hell is going on you couldve told me that the esu operation was what lincoln called me about earlier did you know i deferred the decision about any operation till tomorrow no he didnt rhyme said the detective blurted yeah but i knew enough to figure it out im touched youre both taking the heat for each other but the question is why didnt you tell me sellitto said cause we had a good chance to collar a rapistmurderer i decided we couldnt afford any delays im not a child lieutenant you make your case to me and ill make the judgment thats how its supposed to work sorry captain it seemed like the right decision at the time silence then but he got away yes he did rhyme said how we got a team together as fast as we could but the cover wasnt the best the unsub was closer than we thought he saw an unmarked or one of the team i guess he took off but he ditched some evidence that could be helpful which is on its way to the lab in queens or to you rhyme glanced at sellitto people rise in rank in institutions like the nypd based on experience drive and quick minds malloy was a good halfstep ahead of them ive asked for it to come here joe rhyme said no silence this time the sound from the speaker was a resigned sigh lincoln you understand the problem dont you conflict of interest rhyme thought theres a clear conflict of interest with you as an advisor to the department and trying to exonerate your cousin and beyond that the implication is that theres been a wrongful arrest but thats exactly what happened and two wrongful convictions rhyme reminded malloy about the rape and cointheft cases that flintlock had told them about and i wouldnt be surprised if thiss happened other times too you know locards principle joe that was in your book the one from the academy right the french criminalist edmond locard stated that whenever a crime occurs theres always a transfer of evidence between the perpetrator and the crime scene or the victim he was referring specifically to dust but the rule applies to many substances and types of evidence the connection may be difficult to find but it exists locards principle guides what we do joe but heres a perp whos using it as a weapon its his mo he kills and gets away because somebody else is convicted of the crime he knows exactly when to strike what kind of evidence to plant and when to plant it the crimescene teams the detectives the lab people the prosecutors and judgeshes used everybody made them accomplices this has nothing to do with my cousin joe this has to do with stopping a very dangerous man a sighless silence now okay ill sanction it sellitto was lifting an eyebrow with caveats you keep me informed of every development in the case i mean everything sure and lon you try not being straight with me again and ill transfer you to budgets understand me yeah captain absolutely and since youre at lincolns lon i assume you want a reassignment from the vladimir dienko case petey jimenezs up to speed hes done more of the legwork than i have and hes set up the stings personally and dellrays running the snitches right and the federal jurisdiction thats right okay youre off it temporarily open a file on this unsubi mean send out a memo about the file youve already started on the sly and listen to me im not raising any issues of innocent people being convicted wrongly not raising it with anybody and youre not going to either that issue is not on the table the only crime youre running is a single rapemurder that occurred this afternoon period as part of his mo this unsub might have tried to shift the blame to somebody else but thats all you can say and only if the subject comes up dont raise the issue yourself and for gods sake dont say anything to the press i dont talk to the press rhyme said who did if they could avoid it but well need to look into the other cases to get an idea of how he operates i didnt say you couldnt the captain said firm but not strident keep me posted he hung up well we got ourselves a case sellitto said surrendering to the abandoned quarter of a cookie and washing it down with the coffee standing on the curb with three other men in street clothes amelia sachs was talking to the compact man whod ripped open the door of her camaro and leveled his weapon at her hed turned out not to be but a federal agent who worked for the drug enforcement administration were still trying to put it together he said and glanced at his boss an assistant special agent in charge of the brooklyn dea office the asac said well know more in a few minutes not long before at gunpoint in the car sachs had lifted her hands slowly and identified herself as a police officer the agent had taken her weapon and had checked her id twice hed returned the gun shaking his head i dont get it he said he apologized but his face didnt seem to suggest he was sorry mostly the expression said that well he just didnt get it a moment later his boss and two other agents had arrived now the asac got a call and listened for a few minutes he then snapped his mobile shut and explained what seemed to have happened not long before somebody had made an anonymous call from a pay phone reporting that an armed woman fitting sachss description had just shot somebody in what seemed to be a drug dispute weve got an operation going on here at the moment he said looking into some dealer and supplier assassinations he nodded toward his agent the one whod tried to arrest sachs anthony lives a block away the operations director sent him here to assess the sit while he scrambled the troops anthony added i thought you were leaving so i grabbed some old takeout bags and moved in man now the import of what hed nearly done was sinking in he was now ashen and sachs reflected that glocks have a very light trigger pull she wondered just how close shed come to being shot what were you doing here the asac asked we had a homiciderape she didnt explain about s setting up innocent people to take the fall im guessing our perp spotted me and made a call to slow up pursuit or get me killed in a friendly fire incident the federal agent shook his head frowning what sachs asked just thinking this guy is pretty sharp if he called nypdwhich most people wouldvetheyd know about your operation and who you were so he called us instead all wed know was that you were a shooter and wed approach with caution ready to take you out if you pulled a weapon a frown thats smart pretty fucking scary too anthony said his face still white the agents left and she made a call when rhyme answered she told him about the incident the criminalist digested this then he said he called the feds yep its almost as if he knew they were in the middle of a drug op and that the agent who tried to collar you lived nearby he couldnt know that she countered maybe not but he sure as hell knew one thing whats that he knew exactly where you were which means he was watching be careful sachs rhyme was explaining to sellitto how the perp had set up sachs in brooklyn he did that looks like it the men were discussing how he mightve gotten the informationand coming to no helpful conclusionswhen the phone trilled rhyme glanced at caller id and answered quickly inspector longhursts voice filled the speaker detective rhyme how are you good excellent just wanted to let you know weve found logans safe house it wasnt in manchester after all it was in oldham nearby east of the city she then explained that danny krueger had learned from some of his people that a man believed to be richard logan had inquired about purchasing some parts for guns not guns themselves mind but if you have the parts to repair guns presumably you could also make one rifles yes large caliber any identity no though they thought logan was us military apparently he promised he could get them some discount ammunition in bulk in the future he seemed to have official army documents about inventories and specifications so the shooting zone in londons in play it would seem now about the safe house we have contacts in the hindi community in oldham theyre quite impeccable they heard about an american whos rented an old house on the outskirts of town we managed to track it down we havent searched yet our team could have done it but we thought it best to talk to you first longhurst continued now detective my sense is that he doesnt know we found out about the safe house and i suspect there may be some rather helpful evidence inside it ive rung up some fellows at mi and borrowed a bit of an expensive toy from them its a highdefinition video camera wed like to have one of our officers wear it and have you guide him through the scene tell us what you think we should have the equipment on site in forty minutes or so to do a proper search of the safe house including the exits and entrances the drawers the toilets closets mattressesit would consume the better part of the night why was this happening now he was convinced that was a real threat in fact given the time linewith the earlier cases his cousins and the murder todaythe crimes seemed to be accelerating and he was particularly troubled by the latest event s turning on them and nearly getting sachs shot yes no after a moment of agonizing debate he said inspector im sorry to say somethings come up here weve had a series of homicides i need to focus on them i see unflappable british reserve ill have to hand over the case to your command of course detective i understand youre free to make any and all decisions i appreciate the vote of confidence well get it sorted out and ill keep you informed i better ring off now good luck and to you this was hard for lincoln rhyme stepping away from a hunt especially when the quarry was this particular perp but the decision had been made five twentytwo was now his only prey mel get on the phone and find out where the hell that evidence from brooklyn is chapter twelve okay this is a surprise the upper east side address and the fact that robert jorgensen was an orthopedic surgeon had led amelia sachs to expect that the henderson house residence the address on the postit note would be a lot nicer than this but it was a disgusting dive a transients hotel inhabited by druggies and drunks the flyblown lobby filled with mismatched and moldy furniture stank of garlic cheap disinfectant useless air freshener and sour human odor most homeless shelters were more pleasant standing in the grimy doorway she paused and turned still uneasy about s surveillance and the ease with which hed set up the federal officers in brooklyn she looked carefully around the street nobody seemed to be paying much attention to her but then the killer would have been nearby at deleon williamss house too and shed missed him completely she studied an abandoned building across the street was somebody gazing at her from one of the grimecovered windows or there on the second floor was a large broken window and she was sure she saw motion in the darkness was it a face or light from a hole in the roof sachs stepped closer and examined the building carefully but she found no one and decided her eyes had played tricks on her she turned back to the hotel and breathing shallowly stepped inside at the front desk she flashed her badge to the hopelessly overweight clerk he didnt seem the least bit surprised or troubled that a cop was here she was directed toward the elevator it opened to a foul stench okay the stairs wincing from the strain on her arthritic joints she pushed through the door on the sixth floor and found room she knocked then stepped aside police mr jorgensen please open the door she didnt know what connection this man might have to the killer so her hand hovered near the grip of her glock a fine weapon as dependable as the sun no answer but she believed she heard the sound of the metal cover of the peephole police she repeated put your id under the door she did a pause then several chains were undone and a deadbolt the door opened a short way but was stopped by a security bar the gap was bigger than that left by a chain but not large enough for someone to get through the head of a middleaged man appeared his hair was long and unwashed his face marred with an unruly beard the eyes were twitchy youre robert jorgensen he peered at her face then at her id again turning the card over and holding it up to the light though the laminated rectangle was opaque he handed it back and unhooked the security bar the door swung open he examined the hall behind her then gestured her in sachs entered cautiously hand still near her weapon she checked the room and closets the place was otherwise unoccupied and he was unarmed youre robert jorgensen she repeated he nodded she then looked over the sad room more carefully it contained a bed desk and chair armchair and ratty couch the dark gray carpet was stained a single pole lamp cast dim yellow light and the shades were drawn he was living it seemed out of four large suitcases and a gym bag he had no kitchen but a portion of the living room contained a miniature fridge and two microwaves a coffeepot too his diet was largely soup and ramen noodles a hundred manila file folders were carefully lined up against the wall his clothes were from a different time in his life a better time they seemed expensive but were threadbare and stained the heels of the richlooking shoes were worn down guessing he lost his medical practice due to a drug or drinking problem at the moment he was occupied by an odd task dissecting a large hardcover textbook a chipped magnifying glass on a gooseneck stand was clamped to the desk and hed been slicing out pages and cutting them into strips maybe mental illness had led to his downfall youre here about the letters its about time letters he studied her suspiciously youre not i dont know about any letters i sent them to washington but you do talk dont you all you law enforcers you publicsafety people sure you do you have to everybody talks criminal databases and all that i really dont know what you mean he seemed to believe her well then his eyes went wide looking down at her hip wait is your cell phone on well yes jesus christ in heaven whats wrong with you i why dont you run down the street naked and tell every stranger you see your address take the battery out not just shut it off the battery im not doing that take it out or you can get the hell out right now the pda too and pager this seemed to be a deal breaker but she said firmly im not dumping my memory ill do the phone and the pager okay he grumbled and leaned forward as she slipped the batteries out of the two devices and shut off the pda then she asked for his id he debated and dug out a drivers license the address was greenwich connecticut one of the ritziest towns in the metro area im not here about any letters mr jorgensen i just have some questions i wont take much of your time he gestured her toward the gamy couch and sat down on a wobbly chair at the desk as if he couldnt help himself he turned to the book and with a razor knife cut a piece off the spine he handled the knife expertly fast and sure sachs was glad the desk was between them and her gun unobstructed mr jorgensen im here about a crime that was committed this morning ah sure of course lips pursing he glanced at sachs again and his expression was clear resignation and disgust and what was i supposed to have done this time this time the crime was a rape and murder but we know you werent involved you were here a cruel grin ah keeping track of me sure then a grimace goddamnit this was in response to something he found or didnt find in the bit of book spine he was dissecting he tossed it into the trash sachs noticed halfopen garbage bags containing remnants of clothes books newspapers and small boxes that had also been cut apart then she glanced into the larger microwave and saw that it contained a book germ phobic she supposed he noticed her gaze microwavings the best way to destroy them bacteria viruses he laughed at the question as if she were joking he nodded at the volume in front of him but sometimes theyre really hard to find you have to though you need to see what the enemy looks like now a nod at the microwave and pretty soon theyll start making ones that you cant even nuke ah you better believe it theythemsachs had been a beat cop in the patrol division for some yearsa portable they were called in cop slang shed worked times square back when it was well times square before the place became disneyland north patrolwoman sachs had had lots of experience with the homeless and emotionally disturbed she recognized signs of paranoid personality maybe even schizophrenia do you know a deleon williams no she offered the names of the other victims and fall guys including rhymes cousin no never heard of any of them he seemed to be answering truthfully the book took all his attention for a long thirty seconds he removed a page and held it up grimacing again he pitched it out mr jorgensen this room number was found on a note near the crime scene today the hand with the knife froze he looked at her with scary burning eyes breathlessly he asked where where the hell did you find it in a trash bin in brooklyn it was stuck to some evidence its possible this killer discarded it in a ghastly whisper he asked you have a name what does he look like tell me he half rose and his face grew bright red his lips trembled take it easy mr jorgensen calm down were not positive hes the one who left the note oh hes the one you bet he is that motherfucker he leaned forward you have a name no tell me goddamnit do something for me for a change not to me she said firmly if i can help you i will but you have to stay calm who are you talking about he dropped the knife and sat back shoulders slumped a bitter smile spread across his face who who why god of course god and im job you know job the innocent man god tormented all the trials he inflicted thats nothing compared to what ive been through oh its him he found out where i am now and wrote it down on that note of yours i thought id escaped but hes got me again sachs thought she saw tears she asked whats this all about please tell me jorgensen rubbed his face okaya few years ago i was a practicing doctor lived in connecticut had a wife and two wonderful children money in the bank retirement plan vacation house a comfortable life i was happy but then a strange thing happened no big deal not at first i applied for a new credit cardto get miles in my frequentflier program i was making three hundred thousand a year id never missed a credit card or mortgage payment in my life but i was rejected some mistake i thought but the company said that i was a credit risk since id moved three times in the past six months only i hadnt moved at all somebody had gotten my name social security number and credit information and rented apartments as me then he defaulted on the rent but not before hed bought nearly a hundred thousand dollars worth of merchandise and had it delivered to those addresses identity theft oh the mother lode of identity theft god opened credit cards in my name ran up huge bills had the statements sent to different addresses never paid them of course as soon as id get one straightened out hed do something else and he kept getting all this information on me god knew everything my mothers maiden name her birthday my first dogs name my first carall the things companies want to know for passwords he got my phone numbersand my calling card number he ran up a tenthousanddollar phone bill how hed call time and temperature in moscow or singapore or sydney and leave the phone off the hook for hours why why because hes god and im job the son of a bitch bought a house in my name a whole house and then defaulted on it i only found out when a lawyer working for a collection agency tracked me down at my clinic in new york and asked about making payment arrangements for the three hundred and seventy thousand dollars i owed god also ran up a quarter million in online gambling debts he made bogus insurance claims in my name and my malpractice carrier dropped me i couldnt work at my clinic without insurance and nobody would insure me we had to sell the house and of course every penny went to the debt quote i had run upwhich was by then about two million dollars two million jorgensen closed his eyes briefly and then things got worse my wife was hanging in there throughout all of this it was hard but she was with meuntil god had presentsexpensive onessent in my name to some former nurses at the clinic bought with my credit card and that included invitations and suggestive comments one of the women left a message at home thanking me and saying shed love to go away for the weekend my daughter got it she was crying uncontrollably when she told my wife i think she believed i was innocent but she still left me four months ago and moved in with her sister in colorado im sorry sorry oh well thank you very much but im not through yet oh no just after my wife left the arrests started it seems guns purchased with a credit card and fake drivers license in my name were used in armed robberies in east new york new haven and yonkers one clerk was seriously wounded the new york bureau of investigation arrested me they finally let me go but ive still got an arrest on my record thatll be there forever along with the time the drug enforcement agency arrested me because a check of mine was traced to the purchase of illegally imported prescription drugs oh and i was actually in prison for a whilewell not me somebody that god sold fake credit cards to and a drivers license in my name of course the prisoner was somebody altogether different who knows what his real name is but as far as the world is concerned government records show that robert samuel jorgensen social security number nine two three six seven four one eight two formerly of greenwich connecticut was a prisoner its on my record too forever you mustve followed up called the police he scoffed oh please youre a cop you know where something like this falls in the priority of police work just above jaywalking did you learn anything that might help us anything about him age race education location no nothing everywhere i looked there was only one person me he took me away from myself oh they say there are safeguards there are protections bullshit yes if you lose a credit card maybe youre protected to a point but if somebody wants to destroy your life theres nothing you can do about it people believe what computers tell us if they say you owe money you owe money if it says youre a bad insurance risk youre a bad risk the report says you have no credit then you have no credit even if youre a multimillionaire we believe the data we dont care about the truth ah want to see what my most recent job was he jumped up and opened his closet displaying a fast food franchise uniform jorgensen returned to his desk and set to work on the book again muttering ill find you you fucker he glanced up and do you want to know the worst part of all she nodded god never lived in the apartments he rented in my name he never took delivery of the illegal drugs or got any of the merchandise he had shipped the police recovered everything and he never lived in the beautiful house he bought get it his only point was to torment me hes god im job sachs noticed a picture on his desk it was of jorgensen and a blond woman about his age their arms around a teenage girl and young boy the house in the background was very nice she wondered why would go to all the trouble to destroy a mans life if in fact their perp was behind this was he testing out techniques to use to get close to victims and to implicate fall guys was robert jorgensen a guinea pig or was a cruel sociopath what hed done to jorgensen might be called a nonsexual rape i think you should find another place to live mr jorgensen a resigned smile i know its safer that way always be harder to find sachs thought to herself of an expression her father had used she thought it described her own life view pretty well when you move they cant getcha he nodded at the book you know how he found me here this ive got a feeling everything started to go bad just after i bought it i keep thinking its got the answer i nuked it but that didnt workobviously theres got to be an answer inside theres got to be what are you looking for exactly dont you know no well tracking devices of course they put them in books and clothes pretty soon theyll be in almost everything so not germs microwaves destroy tracking devices she asked playing along most of them you can break the antennae too but theyre so small nowadays almost microscopic jorgensen fell silent and she realized he was staring at her intently as he considered something he announced you take it what the book his eyes were dancing madly around the room its got the answer in it the answer to everything thats happened to me please youre the first one who hasnt rolled their eyes when i told them my story the only one who hasnt looked at me like im mad he sat forward you want to get him as much as i do you have all sorts of equipment ill bet scanning microscopes sensorsyou can find it and itll lead you to him yes he thrust it toward her well i dont know what were looking for he nodded sympathetically oh you dont have to tell me thats the problem they change things all the time theyre always one step ahead of us but please they she took the book debating about slipping it into a plastic evidence bag and attaching a chainofcustody card she wondered how loud the ridicule would be in rhymes town house probably better just to carry it he leaned forward and pressed her hand hard thank you he was crying again so youll move she asked he said he would and gave her the name of another transient hotel one down on the lower east side dont write it down dont tell anybody dont mention me on the phone theyre listening all the time you know call me if anything else comes to mind aboutgod she gave him her card he memorized the information on it then tore the cardboard up he stepped into the bathroom flushed half down the toilet he noticed her curiosity ill flush the other half later flushing something all at once is as stupid as leaving bills in your mailbox with the red flag up people are such fools he walked her to the door leaned close the stink of unwashed clothing hit her his redrimmed eyes gazed fiercely at her officer listen to me i know you have that big gun on your hip but that wont do any good against somebody like him you have to get close before you can shoot him but he doesnt have to get close at all he can sit in a dark room somewhere sip a glass of wine and bring your life down in pieces jorgensen nodded at the book in her hand and now that youve got that youre infected too chapter thirteen ive been checking the newsthere are so many efficient ways to get information nowadaysand ive heard nothing about any redheaded police officers gunned down by fellow law enforcers in brooklyn but at the least theyre afraid theyd be edgy now good why should i be the only one as i walk i reflect how did this happen how could it possibly have happened this isnt good this isnt good this this they seemed to know exactly what i was doing who my victim was and that i was on the way to deleon s house at just that moment how running through the data permutating them analyzing them no i cant understand how they did it not yet have to think some more i dont have enough information how can i draw conclusions if i dont have the data how ah slow down slow down i tell myself when sixteens walk quickly they shed data revealing all sorts of information at least to those who are smart who can make good deductions up and down the gray urban streets sunday no longer beautiful an ugly day ruined the sunlights harsh and tainted the citys cold its edges ragged the sixteens are mocking and snide and pompous i hate them all but keep your head down pretend to enjoy the day and most of all think be analytical how would a computer confronted with a problem analyze the data think now how could they have found out one block two blocks three blocks four no answers only the conclusion theyre good and another question who exactly are they i suppose im struck with a terrible thought please noi stop and dig through my backpack no no no its gone the postit stuck to the evidence bag and i forgot to pull it off before i threw everything out the address of my favorite sixteen my petknown to the world as dr robert jorgensen id just found where hed fled to trying to hide and jotted it on a postit im furious i didnt memorize it and throw away the note i hate myself hate everything how could i be so careless i want to cry to scream my robert for two years hes been my guinea pig my human experiment public records identity theft credit cards but most of all ruining him was a huge high orgasmic indescribable like coke or heroin taking a perfectly normal happy family man a good caring doctor and destroying him well i cant take any chances i have to assume someone will find the note and call him hell fleeand ill have to let him go something else has been taken away from me today i cant describe how i feel when that happens its pain like fire its fear like blind panic its falling and knowing youll collide with the blurring earth at any moment but notquiteyet i blunder through the herds of antelope these sixteens roaming on their day of rest my happiness is destroyed my comfort gone whereas just hours ago i looked at everyone with benign curiosity or lust but now i simply want to storm up to someone and slice his pale flesh thin as tomato skin with one of my eightynine straight razors maybe my krusius brothers model from the late s it has an extralong blade a fine stags horn handle and is the pride of my collection evidence mel lets look it over rhyme was referring to what had been collected in the trash can near deleon williamss house friction ridges the first items cooper examined for fingerprints were the plastic bagsthe one holding the evidence had presumably intended to plant and the bags inside containing some stillwet blood and a bloody paper towel but there were no prints on the plastica disappointment since it preserves them so well often theyre visible not latent and can be observed without any special chemicals or lighting cooper did find indications that the unsub had touched the bags with cotton glovesthe sort experienced criminals prefer to latex gloves which retain the perps prints inside the fingers very efficiently using various sprays and alternative light sources mel cooper examined the rest of the items and found no prints on these either rhyme realized that this case like the others he suspected was behind was different from most in that it presented two categories of evidence first false evidence that the killer intended to plant to implicate deleon williams hed undoubtedly made sure that none of this would lead back to himself personally second real evidence that hed left accidentally and that could very well lead to his homesuch as the tobacco and the dolls hair the bloody paper towel and wet blood were in the first category intended to be left similarly the duct tape meant to be slipped into williamss garage or car would undoubtedly match strips used to gag or bind myra weinburg but it would have been kept carefully protected from s dwelling so it didnt pick up any trace the size suretrack running shoe probably wasnt going to be stashed at williamss house but it was still planted evidence in the sense that had undoubtedly used it to leave a print of a shoe similar to one of williamss mel cooper tested the shoe anyway and found some trace beer on the tread according to the database of fermented beverage ingredients created for the nypd by rhyme years ago it was most likely miller brand that could be in either categoryplanted or real theyd have to see what pulaski recovered from the myra weinburg crime scene to know for sure the bag also contained a computer printout of myras photo probably included to suggest williams had been stalking her online it was therefore meant to be planted as well still rhyme had cooper check it carefully but a ninhydrin test revealed no fingerprints microscopic and chemical analyses revealed generic untraceable paper printed with hewlettpackard laser toner also untraceable beyond the brand name but they did make a discovery that might prove helpful rhyme and cooper found something embedded in the paper traces of stachybotrys chartarum mold this was the infamous sick building mold since the amounts found in the paper were so small it was unlikely that meant it to be planted more likely it came from the killers residence or place of work the presence of this mold which was found indoors almost exclusively meant that at least part of his home or workplace would be dark and humid mold cant grow in a dry location the postit note also probably not intended to be planted was a m brand not the cheaper generic but still impossible to source cooper had found no trace in the note other than a few more spores of the mold which at least told them that the postits source probably was the ink was from a disposable pen sold in countless stores around the country and that was it for the evidence though as cooper was jotting the results a tech from the outside lab rhyme used for expedited medical analysis called and reported that the preliminary test confirmed the blood found in the bags was that of myra weinburg sellitto took a phone call had a brief conversation then hung up zipthe dea traced the call about amelia to a pay phone nobody saw the caller and nobody on the expressway saw anyone running the canvass at the two closest subway stations didnt turn up anything suspicious around the time he got away well hes not going to do anything suspicious now is he what did the canvassers think an escaping murderer would jump a turnstile or strip his clothes off and change into a superhero outfit just telling you what they said linc grimacing he asked thom to write the results of the search up on the whiteboard street near deleon williamss house three plastic bags ziploc freezer style onegallon one right size suretrack running shoe dried beer in tread probably miller brand no wear marks no other discernible trace bought to leave imprint at scene of crime paper towel with blood in plastic bag preliminary test confirms its the victims ccs blood in plastic bag preliminary test confirms its the victims postit with address of the henderson house residence room occupied by robert jorgensen note and pen untraceable paper untraceable evidence of stachybotrys chartarum mold in paper picture of victim apparently computer printout color hewlettpackard printer ink otherwise untraceable paper untraceable evidence of stachybotrys chartarum mold in paper duct tape home depot house brand not traceable to particular location no frictionridge prints the doorbell rang and ron pulaski walked briskly into the room carrying two milk crates containing plastic bags evidence from the scene where myra weinburg had been killed rhyme noted immediately that his expression had changed his face was still pulaski often cringed or seemed perplexed or occasionally looked proudhe even blushedbut now his eyes seemed hollow not at all like the determined gaze of earlier he glanced at rhyme with a nod walked sullenly to the examination tables handed off the evidence to cooper and gave him the chainofcustody cards which the tech signed the rookie stepped back looking over the whiteboard chart thom had created hands in his jeans pockets hawaiian shirt untucked he wasnt seeing a single word you all right pulaski sure you dont look all right sellitto said naw its nothing but that wasnt true something about running his first solo homicide scene had upset him finally he said she was just lying there faceup staring at the ceiling its like she was alive and looking for something frowning kind of curious i guess i expected her to be covered up yeah well you know we dont do that sellitto muttered pulaski looked out the window the thing isokay its crazy its just she looked a little like jenny his wife kind of weird lincoln rhyme and amelia sachs were similar in many ways when it came to their work they felt you needed to summon empathy in searching crime scenes which allowed you to feel what the perp and the victim experienced this helped to better understand the scene and find evidence you otherwise might not those who had this skill as harrowing as its consequences might be were masters at walking the grid but rhyme and sachs differed in one important aspect sachs believed it was important never to become numb to the horror of crime you needed to feel it every time you went to a scene and afterward if you didnt she said your heart grew hard you moved closer to the darkness within the people you pursued rhyme on the other hand felt you should be as dispassionate as possible only by coldly putting aside the tragedy could you be the best police officer you couldand more efficiently stop future tragedies from occurring its not a human being anymore hed lectured his new recruits its a source of evidence and a damn good one pulaski had the potential to be more like rhyme the criminalist believed but at this early stage of his career he fell into amelia sachss camp rhyme felt for the young man now but they had a case to solve at home tonight pulaski could hold his wife close and silently mourn the death of the woman she resembled he asked gruffly you with us pulaski yes sir im fine not exactly but rhyme had made his point you processed the body a nod i was there with the mes tour doctor we did it together i made sure he wore rubber bands on his booties to avoid confusion when it came to footprints rhyme had a policy of his crime scene searchers putting rubber bands around their feet even when they were in the hooded plastic jumpsuits worn to prevent contamination from their own hair skin cells and other trace good rhyme then glanced eagerly at the milk crates lets get going we ruined one plan of his maybe hes mad about it and is out targeting somebody else maybe hes buying a ticket to mexico either way i want to move fast the young cop flipped open his notebook i thom come on in here thom where the hell are you oh sure lincoln said the aide with a cheerful smile walking into the room always happy to drop everything in the face of such polite requests we need you againanother chart do you please you dont mean it thom all right myra weinburg crime scene the aide wrote the heading and stood ready with the marker as rhyme asked now pulaski i understand it wasnt her apartment thats right sir a couple owned it theyre on vacation on a cruise ship i managed to get through to them theyd never heard of myra weinburg man you shouldve heard them they were way upset they didnt have any idea who it mightve been and to get in he broke the lock so he knew it was empty and that there was no alarm cooper said interesting whatta you think sellitto was shaking his head he just picked it for location it was real deserted around there pulaski put in and what was she doing do you think i found her bike outsideshe had a kryptonite key in her pocket and it fit biking could be that hed checked out her route and knew shed be by there at a certain time and somehow he knew the couple were going to be away so he wouldnt have any disturbances okay rookie run through what you found thom if you would be so kind as to write this down youre trying too hard ha cause of death rhyme asked pulaski i told the doctor to have the medical examiner expedite the autopsy results sellitto laughed gruffly and whatd he say to that something like yeah right and a couple other things too you need a bit more starch in your collar before you can make requests like that but i appreciate the effort what was the preliminary he looked over his notes suffered several blows to the head to subdue her the me thought the young officer paused perhaps recalling his own similar injury a few years ago he continued cause of death was strangulation there were petechiae in the eyes and inside the eyelidspinpoint hemorrhages i know what they are rookie oh sure right and venous distention in the scalp and face this is the probable murder weapon he held up a bag containing a length of rope about four feet long mel cooper took the rope and carefully opened it over a large sheet of clean newsprint dusting to dislodge trace he then examined what hed found and took a few samples of the fibers what rhyme asked impatiently checking the rookie took refuge in his notes again as far as the rape it was vaginal and anal postmortem the tour doctor thought posing of the body nobut one thing i noticed detective pulaski said all her fingernails were long except one it was cut really short blood yes it was cut right down to the quick he hesitated probably premortem so s a bit of a sadist rhyme reflected he likes pain check the other crimescene photos from the earlier rape the young officer hurried off to find the pictures he shuffled through them and found one squinting look at this detective yeah he cut off a fingernail there too the same finger our boy likes trophies thats good to know pulaski nodded enthusiastically and think about itthe wedding ring finger probably something about his past maybe his wife left him maybe he was neglected by his mother or a mother figure good point pulaski reminds mewe forgot something else whats that sir did you check your horoscope this morning before we started the investigation my oh and who got the tealeafreading assignment i forget sellitto was chuckling pulaski was blushing rhyme snapped psychological profiling isnt helpful whats helpful about the nail is knowing that five twentytwo now has in his possession a dna connection to the crime not to mention that if we can decide what kind of implement he used to remove the trophy we might be able to trace the purchase and find him evidence rookie not psychobabble sure detective got it lincoln is fine okay sure the rope mel cooper was scrolling through the fiber database generic hemp available in thousands of retail outlets around the country he ran a chemical analysis no trace crap what else pulaski sellitto asked he went through the list fishing line binding her hands and cutting through the skin which resulted in the bleeding duct tape covered her mouth the tape was home depot brand of course torn off the roll had ditched the ragged ends matched perfectly two unopened condoms were discovered near the body the young officer explained holding up the bag they were trojanenz brand and here are the swabs mel cooper took the plastic evidence bags and checked the vaginal and rectal swabs the mes office would give a more detailed report but it was clear that among the substances were traces of a spermicidal lubricant similar to that used with the condoms there was no semen anywhere at the scene another swab from the floor where pulaski found the treadmark of a running shoe revealed beer it proved to be miller brand the electrostatic image of the tread was naturally a size suretrack right shoethe same that had ditched in the trash can and the owners of the loft had no beer right you did search the kitchen and pantry right yes sir and i didnt find any lon sellitto was nodding bet you ten bucks that miller is deleons brew of choice i wont take you up on that one lon what else was there pulaski held up a plastic bag containing a brown fleck that hed found just above the victims ear analysis revealed it to be tobacco whats the story with that mel the techs examination revealed that it was a finecut piece the sort used in cigarettes but it was not the same as the tareyton sampler in the database lincoln rhyme was one of the few nonsmokers in the country who decried the bans on smoking tobacco and ash were wonderful forensic links between criminal and crime scene cooper couldnt tell the brand he decided though that because the tobacco was so desiccated it was probably old did myra smoke or the people in the loft i didnt see any evidence of it and i did what youre always telling us i smelled the scene when i got there no smell of smoking good rhyme was pleased with the search so far whats the frictionridge situation checked fingerprint samples of the homeownersfrom the medicine cabinet and things in the bedside table so you werent fudging you really did read my book rhyme had devoted a number of paragraphs in his forensic text to the importance of collecting control prints at crime scenes and where to best find them yes sir im so pleased did i make any royalties i borrowed my brothers pulaskis twin was a cop down at the sixth precinct in greenwich village lets hope he paid for it most of the prints found in the loft were the coupleswhich they determined from the samples the others were probably from visitors but it wasnt impossible that had been careless cooper scanned all of them into the integrated automated fingerprint identification system the results would be available soon okay tell me pulaski what was your impression of the scene the question seemed to throw him impression those are the trees rhyme lowered his eyes toward the evidence bags what did you think of the forest the young officer thought well i did have a thought its stupid though you know ill be the first one to say if youve come up with a stupid theory rookie its just when i first got there my impression was that the struggle seemed off how do you mean see her bike was chained to a lamppost outside the loft like shed parked it not thinking anything was wrong so he didnt just grab her on the street right and to get into the loft you went through a gate and then down a long corridor to the front door it was real narrow and it was packed with things the couple stored outsidejars and cans sports things some stuff to be recycled tools for their garden but nothing was disturbed he tapped another photo but look insidethats where the struggle began the table and the vases right by the front door his voice went soft again looks like she fought real hard rhyme nodded all right so five twentytwo lures her to the loft smoothtalking her she locks up the bike walks down the corridor and they go into the loft she stops in the entryway sees hes lying and tries to get out he considered this so he mustve known enough about myra to put her at ease and make her feel that she could trust him sure think about it hes got all this informationabout who people are what people buy when theyre on vacation whether they have alarms where theyre going to be not bad rookie now we know something concrete about him pulaski struggled to keep a smile off his face coopers computer dinged he read the screen no hits on the prints zero rhyme shrugged not surprised im interested in this ideathat he knows so much somebody give deleon williams a call was five twentytwo right about all the evidence sellittos brief conversation revealed that yes williams wore size suretrack shoes he regularly bought trojanenz brand condoms he had fortypound fishing line he drank miller beer and hed recently been to home depot for duct tape and hemp rope to use as a tiedown looking at the evidence chart of the earlier rape rhyme noted that the condoms used by in that crime were durex the killer had used those because joseph knightly bought that brand on the speakerphone he asked williams is one of your shoes missing no sellitto said so he bought a pair same type same size as youve got howd he know that have you seen anybody on your property recently maybe in your garage going through your car or trash or have you had a breakin recently no we sure havent im out of work and here most days taking care of the house id know and its not the best neighborhood in the world weve got an alarm we always put it on rhyme thanked him and they disconnected he stretched his head back and gazed at the chart as he dictated to thom what to write myra weinburg crime scene cod strangulation awaiting final me report no mutilation or arranging of body but ring fingernail left hand was cut short possible trophy premortem most likely condom lubricant from trojanenz unopened condoms trojanenz no used condoms or body fluids traces of miller beer on floor source other than crime scene fishing line pound monofilament generic brand fourfoot length of brown hemp rope mw duct tape on mouth tobacco flake old from unidentified brand footprint suretrack mans running shoe size no fingerprints rhyme asked our boy called nineoneone right to report the dodge yeah sellitto confirmed find out about the call what he said what his voice sounded like the detective added the earlier cases tooyour cousins and the coin theft and earlier rape good sure i didnt think about that sellitto got in touch with central dispatch nineoneone calls are recorded and kept for varying periods of time he requested the information ten minutes later he received a callback the reports from arthurs case and todays murder were still in the system the dispatch supervisor reported and had been sent to coopers email address aswav files the earlier cases had been sent to archives on cd it could take days to find them but an assistant had sent in a request for them when the audio files arrived cooper opened and played them they were of a male voice telling the police to hurry to an address where hed heard screaming he described the getaway vehicles the voices sounded identical voice print cooper asked if we get a suspect we can compare it voice prints were more highly regarded in the forensic world than lie detectors and were admissible in some courts depending on the judge but rhyme shook his head listen to it hes talking through a box cant you tell a box is a device that disguises a callers voice it doesnt produce a weird darth vader sound the timbre is normal if a little hollow many directory assistance and customer service operations use them to make employees voices uniform it was then that the door opened and amelia sachs strode into the parlor carrying a large object under her arm rhyme couldnt tell what it was she nodded then gazed at the evidence chart saying to pulaski looks like a good job thanks rhyme noted that what she held was a book it seemed half disassembled what the hell is that a present from our doctor friend robert jorgensen what is it evidence hard to say it was really an odd experience talking to him whatta you mean by odd amelia sellitto asked think batboy elvis and aliens behind the kennedy assassination that sort of odd pulaski exhaled a fast laugh drawing a withering look from lincoln rhyme chapter fourteen she told a story of a troubled man whose identity had been stolen and his life ruined a man who described his nemesis as god and himself as job clearly he was unhinged odd didnt go far enough yet if even partly true his story was moving and hard to listen to a life completely in tatters and the crime pointless but then sachs caught rhymes complete attention when she said jorgensen claims the man behind its been keeping track of him ever since he bought this book two years ago he seems to know everything hes doing knows everything rhyme repeated looking at the evidence charts just what we were talking about a few minutes ago getting all the information he needs on the victims and the fall guys he filled her in on what theyd learned she handed the book to mel cooper and told him jorgensen believed it held a tracking device tracking device rhyme scoffed hes been watching too many oliver stone movies all right search it if you want but lets not neglect the real leads sachss calls to the police in the various jurisdictions where jorgensen had been victimized werent productive yes thered been identity theft no question but one cop in florida asked you know how much of this goes on we find a fake residence and raid it but by the time we get there its empty theyve taken all the merch theyd charged to the vics account and headed off to texas or montana most of them had heard of jorgensen he sure writes a lot of letters and were sympathetic but none had any specific leads to an individual or gang who might have been behind the crimes and they couldnt devote nearly enough time to the cases as they would have liked we could have another hundred people on staff and still not be able to make any headway after shed hung up sachs explained that since knew jorgensens address shed told the residence hotel clerk to let her know immediately if anyone called or came around asking about him if the clerk agreed sachs would neglect to bring up the residence hotel with the citys building inspection office nicely done rhyme said you knew there were violations not until he agreed at oh about the speed of light sachs walked to the evidence that pulaski had gotten from the loft near soho looking it over any thoughts amelia sellitto asked she stood staring at the boards one fingernail taking on another as she tried to make sense out of the disparate collection of clues whered he get this she picked up the bag containing the printout of myra weinburgs facelooking sweet and amused her eyes on the camera that had snapped her picture we should find out good point rhyme hadnt considered the source of the picture merely that had downloaded it from a web site somewhere hed been more interested in the paper as a source of clues in the photo myra weinburg was standing beside a flowering tree gazing back at the camera a smile on her face she was holding a pink drink in a martini glass rhyme noticed pulaski gazing at the picture too his eyes troubled again the thing isshe looked a little like jenny rhyme noted distinctive borders and what appeared to be the strokes of some letters to the right disappearing out of frame hedve got it online to make it look like deleon williams was checking her out sellitto said maybe we could trace him through the site he downloaded it from how can we tell where he got it google her name rhyme suggested cooper tried this and found a dozen hits several referring to a different myra weinburg the ones that related to the victim were all professional organizations but none of the photos of her was similar to the one that had printed out sachs said got an idea let me call my computer expert who that guy at computer crimes sellitto asked no somebody even better than him she picked up the phone and dialed a number pammy hi where are yougood ive got an assignment go online for a web chat well do audio by phone sachs turned to cooper can you boot up your webcam mel the tech typed and a moment later his monitor filled with an image of pams room at her foster parents house in brooklyn the face of the pretty teenager appeared as she sat down the image was slightly distorted by the wideangle lens hi pam hi mr cooper came the lilting voice through the speakerphone ill take over sachs said and replaced cooper at the keyboard honey weve found a picture and we think it came from the internet could you take a look and tell us if you know where sure sachs held up the sheet to the webcam its kind of glary can you take it out of the plastic the detective pulled on latex gloves and carefully slipped the sheet out held it up again thats better sure its from ourworld whats that you know a socialnetworking site like facebook and myspace its the hot new one everybodys on it you know about those rhyme sachs asked he gave a nod curiously hed been thinking about this recently hed read an article in the new york times about networking sites and virtual existence worlds like second life hed been surprised to learn that people were spending less time in the outside world and more in the virtualfrom avatars to these socialnetworking sites to telecommuting apparently teenagers today spent less time out of doors than in any other period in us history ironically thanks to an exercise regimen that was improving his physical condition and his changing attitudes rhyme himself was becoming less virtual and was venturing out more the dividing line between abled and disabled was blurring sachs now asked pam you can tell for sure its from that site yeah theyve got that special border if you look close its not just a line its little globes like the earth over and over again rhyme squinted yes the border was just as shed described it he thought back recalling ourworld from the article hello pamthere are a lot of members arent there oh hi mr rhyme yeah like thirty or forty million people whose realm is that one realm sachs asked thats what they call your page your realm who is she im afraid she was killed today sachs said evenly thats the case i told you about earlier rhyme wouldnt have mentioned the murder to a teenager but this was sachss call shed know what to share and what not to oh im sorry pam was sympathetic but not shocked or dismayed by the hard truth rhyme asked pam can anybody log on and get into your realm well youre supposed to join but if you dont want to post anything or host your own realm you can crack in just to look around so youd say that the man who printed this out knows computers yeah hed have to i guess only he didnt print it out what you cant print or download anything even with the print screen command theres a filter on the systemto prevent stalkers you know and you cant crack it its like what protects copyrighted books online then how did he get the picture rhyme asked pam laughed oh he probably did what we all do at school if we want a shot of a cute guy or some weird goth chick we just take a picture of the screen with a digital camera everybody does that sure rhyme said shaking his head never occurred to me oh dont worry mr rhyme the girl said a lot of times people miss the obvious answer sachs glanced at rhyme who smiled at the girls reassurance okay pam thanks ill see you later bye lets fill in the portrait of our friend sachs picked up the marker and stepped to the whiteboard unsub profile male possibly smokes or livesworks with someone who does or near source of tobacco has children or livesworks near them or near source of toys interest in art coins probably white or lightskinned ethnic medium build strongable to strangle victims access to voicedisguise equipment possibly computer literate knows ourworld other socialnetworking sites takes trophies from victims sadist portion of residenceworkplace dark and moist nonplanted evidence dust old cardboard hair from doll basf b nylon tobacco from tareyton cigarettes old tobacco not tareyton but brand unknown evidence of stachybotrys chartarum mold rhyme was looking over the details when he heard mel cooper laugh well well well what this is interesting be specific i dont need interesting i need facts its still interesting the lab man had been shining a bright light on the slitopen spine of robert jorgensens book you were thinking the doctor was crazy talking about tracking devices well guess what oliver stone may have a movie herethere is something implanted in it in the spine tape really sachs said shaking her head i thought he was nuts let me see rhyme said his curiosity piqued and skepticism on temporary hold cooper moved a small highdefinition camera closer to the examining table and hit the book with an infrared light it revealed underneath the tape a tiny rectangle of crisscrossed lines take it out rhyme said carefully cooper slit the spine tape and removed what appeared to be an inchlong piece of plasticized paper printed with what looked like computer circuit lines also a series of numbers and the manufacturers name dms inc sellitto asked the fuck is it really a tracking device i dont see how theres no battery or power source that i can find cooper said mel look up the company a fast business search revealed it was data management systems based outside boston he read a description of the outfit one division of which manufactured these little devicesknown as rfid tags for radio frequency identification ive heard about those pulaski said it was on cnn oh the definitive source for forensic knowledge rhyme said cynically no thats csi sellitto said drawing another aborted laugh from ron pulaski sachs asked what does it do this is interesting again interesting essentially its a programmable chip that can be read by a radio scanner they dont need a battery the antenna picks up the radio waves and that gives them enough juice to work sachs said jorgensen was talking about breaking off antennas to disable them he also said you could destroy some of them in a microwave but that oneshe gesturedhe couldnt nuke or so he said cooper continued theyre used for inventory control by manufacturers and retailers in the next few years nearly every product sold in the us will have its own rfid tag some major retailers already require them before theyll stock a product line sachs laughed thats just what jorgensen was telling me maybe he wasnt as national enquirer as i thought every product rhyme asked yep so stores know where the stuff in inventory is how much stock they have whats selling faster than other things when to restock the shelves when to reorder theyre also used for baggage handling by airlines so they know where your luggage is without having to visually scan the bar code and theyre used in credit cards drivers licenses employee ids theyre called smart cards then jorgensen wanted to see my department id he looked it over real carefully maybe thats what he was interested in theyre all over the place cooper continued in those discount cards you use in grocery stores in frequentflier cards in tollbooth smart pass transponders sachs nodded at the evidence boards think about it rhyme jorgensen was talking about this man he called god knowing all about his life enough to steal his identity to buy things in his name take out loans get credit cards find out where he was rhyme felt the excitement of moving forward in the hunt and five twentytwo knows enough about his victims to get close to them get inside their defenses he knows enough about the fall guys to plant evidence thats identical to what they have at home and sellitto added he knows exactly where they were at the time of the crime so they wont have an alibi sachs looked over the tiny tag jorgensen said his life started to fall apart around the time he got that book whered he buy it any receipts or price stickers mel nope if there were he cut them out call jorgensen back lets get him in here sachs pulled out her phone and called the transient hotel where shed just met with him she was frowning already she asked the clerk doesnt bode well rhyme reflected hes moved out she said after hanging up but i know where hes going she found a slip of paper placed another call though after a brief conversation she hung up sighing jorgensen wasnt at that hotel either she said he hadnt even called to make a reservation do you have a cell number he doesnt have a phone he doesnt trust them but he knows my number if were lucky hell call sachs walked closer to the tiny device mel cut the wire off the antenna what jorgensen said now that weve got the book were infected too cut it off cooper shrugged and glanced at rhyme who thought the idea was absurd still amelia sachs didnt spook easily sure go ahead just make a notation on the chainofcustody card evidence rendered safe a phrase usually reserved for bombs and handguns rhyme then lost interest in the rfid he looked up all right until we hear from him lets speculate come on folks be ballsy i need some thoughts here weve got a perp who can get his hands on all this goddamn information about people how he knows everything the fall guys bought fishing line kitchen knives shave cream fertilizer condoms duct tape rope beer thereve been four victims and four fall guysat least he cant follow everybody around he doesnt break into their houses maybe hes a clerk at one of those big discount stores cooper suggested but deleon bought some of the evidence at home depotyou cant buy condoms and snack food there maybe five twentytwo works for a credit card company pulaski suggested he can see what people buy that way not bad rookie but some of the time the vics mustve paid cash it was thom surprisingly who provided one answer he fished out his keys i heard mel mention the discount cards earlier he displayed several small plastic cards on his key chain one for a p one for food emporium i swipe the card and get a discount even if i pay cash the store still knows what i bought good rhyme said but where do we go from there were still looking at dozens of different sources the victims and fall guys shopped at ah rhyme looked at sachs who was staring at the evidence board with a faint smile on her face i think ive got it what rhyme asked expecting the clever application of a forensic principle shoes she said simply the answers shoes chapter fifteen its not just about knowing generally what people buy sachs explained its knowing the specifics about all the vics and the fall guys look at three of the crimes your cousins case the myra weinburg case and the coin theft five twentytwo not only knew the kind of shoe the fall guys wore he knew the sizes rhyme said good lets find out where deleon williams and arthur buy their footwear a fast call to judy rhyme and one to williams revealed that the shoes were bought mail orderone through a catalog one through a web site but both directly from the companies all right rhyme said pick one give them a call and find out how the shoe business works flip a coin suretrack won and it took only four phone calls to reach somebody connected with the company the president and ceo no less water was sounding in the background splashing children laughing as the man asked uncertainly a crime nothing to do with you directly rhyme reassured him one of your products is evidence but not like that guy who tried to blow up the airplane with a bomb in his shoe he stopped talking as if even bringing this up was a breach of national security rhyme explained the situationthe killers getting personal information about the victims including specifics about suretrack shoes as well as his cousins altons and the other fall guys bass walkers do you sell through retail locations no only online do you share information with your competitors information about customers a hesitation hello rhyme asked the silence oh we cant share information that would be an antitrust violation well how could somebody have gotten access to information about customers of suretrack shoes thats a complicated situation rhyme grimaced sachs said sir the man were after is a killer and rapist do you have any thoughts about how he couldve learned about your customers not really lon sellitto barked then well get a fucking warrant and take your records apart line by line not the subtle way rhyme would have handled it but the sledgehammer approach worked just fine the man blurted wait wait wait i might have an idea which is sellitto snapped maybe heokay if he had information from different companies maybe he got it from a data miner whats that rhyme asked this pause was one of surprise it seemed you never heard of them rhyme rolled his eyes no what are they what it sounds like information service companiesthey dig through data about consumers their purchases and houses and cars credit histories everything about them they analyze it and sell it you know to help companies spot market trends find new customers target directmail pieces and plan advertising things like that everything about them rhyme thought maybe were on to something here do they get information from rfid chips sure they do thats one of the big sources for data what data miner does your company use oh i dont know several of them his voice was reticent we really need to know sachs said playing good cop to sellittos bad we dont want anybody else to get hurt this man is very dangerous a sigh floated over the mans debate well i suppose ssd is the main one theyre pretty big but if youre thinking that somebody from there was involved in a crime impossible theyre the greatest guys in the world and theres security theres where are they based sachs asked another hesitation come on damnit rhyme thought in new york city five twentytwos playground the criminalist caught sachss eye he smiled this was looking promising any others in the area no axciom experian and choicepoint the other big ones arent around here but believe me nobody from ssd could be involved i swear what does ssd stand for rhyme asked strategic systems datacorp do you have a contact there not anybody in particular exactly he said this fast too fast you dont well there are sales reps we deal with i cant recall their names at the moment i could check it and find out who runs the company another pause that would be andrew sterling hes the founder and ceo look i guarantee nobody there would do anything illegal impossible then rhyme realized something the man was scared not of the police of ssd itself what are you worried about its just in a confessional tone he said we couldnt function without them were reallypartnered with them though from his tone the spurious verb seemed to mean desperately dependent on well be discreet sachs said thank you really thank you the relief was obvious sachs politely thanked him for his cooperation drawing an eye roll from sellitto rhyme disconnected data mining anybody heard of it thom said i dont know ssd but ive heard of data miners its the business of the twentyfirst century rhyme glanced at the evidence chart so if five twentytwo works for ssd or is one of their customers he could find out everything hed need about who bought shave cream rope condoms fishing lineall the evidence he could plant then another idea struck him the head of the shoe company said that they sell the data for mailing lists arthur had gotten some direct mail about that prescott painting remember five twentytwo could have found out about it from their mailing lists maybe alice sanderson was on a list too and lookthe crimescene photos sachs walked to the whiteboards and pointed to several pictures from the cointheft scene directmail pieces sat prominently on the tables and floor pulaski said and sir detective cooper mentioned ezpass if this ssd mines their data then the killer mightve been able to find out exactly when your cousin was in the city and when he headed home jesus sellitto muttered if its true this guys stumbled on one hell of an mo check out this data mining mel google it i want to know for sure if ssd is the only one in the area a few keystrokes later hmm i got over twenty million hits for data mining twenty million over the next hour the team watched as cooper narrowed the list of the top data miners in the countryabout a half dozen he downloaded hundreds of pages of information from their sites and other details comparing the various data miners client lists with the products used as evidence in the case it appeared that ssd was the most likely single source of all the information and was in fact the only one based in or near new york if you want cooper said i can download their sales brochure oh we want mel lets see it sachs sat next to rhyme and they looked over the screen as the ssd web site appeared

twentytwo can get his hands on all this informationwell hes the man who knows everything mel cooper said okay listen to this i was looking at the companies that ssd owns guess one of them rhyme replied ill go with whatever the hell their initials weredms the maker of that rfid tag in the book right yep you got it no one said anything for some moments rhyme noticed everyone in the room was looking at the glowing window logo of ssd on the computer screen so sellitto muttered eyes on the chart where do we go from here surveillance suggested pulaski that makes sense sellitto said ill give s and s a call set up some teams rhyme gave a cynical glance surveillance at a company with what a thousand employees he shook his head then asked you know occams razor lon who the fuck is occam a barber a philosopher the razors a metaphorcutting away unnecessary explanations for a phenomenon his theory was that when you have multiple possibilities the simplest is almost always the correct one so whats your simple theory rhyme staring at the brochure the criminalist answered sachs i think you and pulaski should go pay a visit to ssd tomorrow morning and do what he gave a shrug ask if anybody who works there is the killer chapter sixteen ah home at last i close the door and lock out the world i breathe deeply and setting my backpack on the couch go into the spotless kitchen and drink some pure water no stimulants for me at the moment that edgy thing again the town house is a nice one prewar huge it would have to be when you live the way i do given my collections not easy to find the perfect place it took me some time but here i am largely unnoticed its obscenely easy to be virtually anonymous in new york what a marvelous city here the default mode of existence is life off the grid here you have to fight to be noticed many sixteens do that of course but then the worlds always had more than its share of fools still listen you need to keep up appearances the front rooms of my town house are simple and tastefully decorated thank you scandinavia i dont socialize here much but you need a façade to seem normal you have to function in the real world if you dont sixteens begin to wonder if theres something going on if youre someone other than you seem and its a short step from that to someone coming round poking into your closet and taking everything away from you everything youve worked so hard for everything and thats the worst of the worst so you make sure your closet is secret you make sure your treasures are hidden behind curtained or blocked windows while you maintain your other life in full view the sunlit side of the moon to stay off the grid its best to have a second living space you do what ive done keep this danish modern patina of normalcy clean and ordered even if it grates on your nerves like steel on slate to be there you have a normal house because thats what everybody has and you maintain a pleasant connection with associates and friends because thats what everyone does and you date occasionally and entice her to spend the night and you go through the motions because that too is what everyone does no matter that she doesnt get you as hard as when youve smooth talked your way into a girls bedroom smiling arent we soul mates look at everything we have in common with a tape recorder and a knife in your jacket pocket now i pull the shades in the bay windows and head to the back of the living room wow this is like a really neat place it looks bigger from the outside yeah funny how that happens hey youve got a door in your living room whats through there oh that just storage a closet nothing to see want some wine well whats through there debby sandra susan brenda is where im headed right now my real home my closet i call it its like a keepthat last defensible spot of a medieval castlethe sanctuary in the center when all else failed the king and his family would retreat to the keep i enter mine through that magic doorway it actually is a closet a walkin and inside youll see hanging clothes and shoe boxes but push them aside and youll find a second door it opens on to the rest of the house which is far far bigger than the façades horrifying blond swedish minimalism my closet i enter it now and lock the doors behind me and turn on the light trying to relax but after today after the disaster im having trouble shaking the edgy this isnt good this isnt good this i drop into my desk chair and boot up the computer as i stare at the prescott painting in front of me courtesy of alice what a touch he had the eyes of the family members are fascinating prescott managed to give each one a different gaze its clear theyre all related the expressions are similar in that way yet theyre also different as if each is imagining a different aspect of life as a family happy troubled angry mystified controlling controlled its what a family is all about i suppose i open the backpack and take out the treasures ive acquired today a tin canister a pencil set an old cheese grater why would somebody throw these away i also unload some practical items ill use in the next few weeks some preapproved credit mailings that people carelessly discarded credit card vouchers phone bills fools i was saying theres another item for my collection of course but ill get to the tape recorder later its not as great a find as it could be since myra s throaty screams while i detached the fingernail had to be muted by duct tape i was worried about passersby still everything in a collection cant be a crown jewel you need the mundane to make the special soar i then wander through my closet depositing the treasures in the appropriate places it looks bigger from the outside as of today i have newspapers magazines national geographics being the cornerstone of course matchbooksand forgoing the numbers coat hangers kitchen utensils lunch boxes soda pop bottles empty cereal boxes scissors shaving gear shoe horns and trees buttons cuff links boxes combs wristwatches clothes tools useful and tools long outmoded phonograph records in colors records in black bottles toys jam jars candles and holders candy dishes weapons it goes on and on and on the closet consists of what else sixteen galleries like a museums ranging from those holding cheerful toys though that howdy doody is pretty damn scary to rooms of some things that i treasure but most people would find oh unpleasant hair and nail clippings and some shriveled mementoes from various transactions like this afternoons i deposit myra s fingernail in a prominent spot and while this would normally give me enough pleasure to make me hard again now the moment is dark and spoiled i hate them so much with quivering hands i close the cigar box taking no pleasure from my treasures at the moment hate hate hate back at the computer im reflecting maybe theres no threat maybe its just an odd set of coincidences that led them to deleon s house but i cant take any chances the problem the risk that my treasures will be taken from me which is consuming me now the solution to do what i started in brooklyn to fight back to eliminate any threats what most sixteens including my pursuers dont understand and what puts them at a pathetic disadvantage is this i believe in the immutable truth that there is absolutely nothing morally wrong with taking a life because i know that there is eternal existence completely independent of these bags of skin and organ we cart around temporarily i have proof just look at the trove of data about your life built up from the moment youre born its all permanent stored in a thousand places copied backed up invisible and indestructible after the body goes as all bodies must the data survive forever and if thats not the definition of an immortal soul i dont know what is chapter seventeen the bedroom was quiet rhyme had sent thom home to spend sunday night with peter hoddins the caregivers longtime partner rhyme gave the aide a lot of crap he couldnt help that and sometimes he felt bad about it but he tried to compensate and when amelia sachs was staying with him as tonight he shooed thom off the young man needed more of a life outside the town house here taking care of a feisty old crip rhyme heard tinkering in the bathroom the sounds of a woman getting ready for bed clinks of glass and snaps of plastic lids aerosol hisses water running fragrances escaping on humid bathroom air he liked moments like these they reminded him of his life in the before which in turn brought to mind the pictures downstairs in the laboratory beside the one of lincoln in his tracksuit was another in black and white it showed two men wearing suits on their lanky frames in their twenties standing side by side their arms hung straight as if they were wondering whether to embrace rhymes father and uncle he thought often of uncle henry his father not so much this had been true throughout his life oh there was nothing objectionable about teddy rhyme the younger of the two siblings was simply retiring often shy he loved his ninetofive job crunching numbers in various labs loved to read which he did every evening while lounging in a thick wellworn armchair while his wife anne sewed or watched tv teddy favored history especially the american civil war an interest that rhyme supposed was the source of his own given name the boy and his father coexisted pleasantly though rhyme recalled many awkward silences present when father and son were alone what troubles also engages what challenges you makes you feel alive and teddy never troubled or challenged uncle henry did though in spades you couldnt be in the same room with him for more than a few minutes without his attention turning to you like a searchlight then came the jokes the trivia recent family news and always the questionssome asked because he was genuinely curious to learn most though asked as a call to debate with you oh how henry rhyme loved intellectual jousting you might cringe you might blush you might grow furious but youd also burn with pride at one of the rare compliments he offered because you knew youd earned it no false praise or unwarranted encouragement ever slipped from uncle henrys lips youre close think harder youve got it in you einstein had done all his important work when he was just a little older than you if you got it right you were blessed with a raised eyebrow of approval tantamount to winning the westinghouse science fair prize but all too often your arguments were fallacious your premises straw your criticisms emotional your facts skewed at issue though wasnt his victory over you his only goal was arriving at the truth and making sure you understood the route once hed diced your argument to fine chop and made sure you saw why the matter was over so you understand where you went wrong you calculated the temperature with an incorrect set of assumptions exactly now lets make some callsget some people together and go see the white sox on saturday i need a ballpark hot dog and we sure as hell wont be able to buy one at comiskey park in october lincoln had enjoyed the intellectual sparring often driving all the way to hyde park to sit in on his uncles seminars or informal discussion groups at the university in fact he had gone more frequently than arthur who was usually busy with other activities if his uncle were still alive hed undoubtedly stroll into rhymes room now without a glance at his motionless body point at the gas chromatograph and blurt why are you still running that piece of crap then settling down across from the evidence whiteboards hed start questioning rhyme about his handling of the case yes but is it logical for this individual to behave in this manner state your givens once more for me he thought back to the night hed recalled earlier the christmas eve of his senior year in high school at his uncles house in evanston present were henry and paula and their children robert arthur and marie teddy and anne with lincoln some aunts and uncles other cousins a neighbor or two lincoln and arthur had spent much of the evening playing pool downstairs and talking about plans for the next fall and college lincolns heart was set on mit arthur too planned to go there they were both confident of admission and that night were debating rooming together in a dorm or finding an offcampus apartment male camaraderie versus a babe lair the family then assembled at the massive table in his uncles dining room lake michigan churning nearby the wind hissing through bare gray branches in the backyard henry presided over the table the way he presided over his class in charge and aware a faint smile below quick eyes taking in all the conversations around him hed tell jokes and anecdotes and ask about his guests lives he was interested curiousand sometimes manipulative so marie now that were all here tell us about that fellowship at georgetown i think we agreed itd be excellent for you and jerry can come visit on weekends in that fancy new car of his by the way whens the deadline for the application coming up i seem to recall and his wispyhaired daughter avoided his eyes and said what with christmas and final exams she hadnt quite finished the paperwork but she would definitely henrys mission of course was to get his daughter to commit in front of witnesses no matter that shed be separated from her fiancé for another six months rhyme had always believed that his uncle would have made an excellent trial lawyer or politician after the remnants of the turkey and mincemeat pie were cleared away and the grand marnier coffee and tea had appeared henry ushered everyone into the living room dominated by a massive tree busy fireplace flames and a stern painting of lincolns grandfathera triple doctorate and a professor at harvard it was time for the competition henry would throw out a science question and the first to answer it would win a point the top three players would receive prizes picked by henry and meticulously wrapped by paula tensions were palpablethey always were when henry was in chargeand people competed seriously lincolns father could be counted on to nail more than a few chemistry questions if the topic involved numbers his mother a parttime math teacher answered some before henry had even finished asking the front runners throughout the contest though were the cousinsrobert marie lincoln and arthurand maries fiancé toward the end nearly pm the contestants were literally on the edge of their chairs the rankings changed with every question palms were sweaty with only minutes remaining on timekeeper paulas clock lincoln answered three questions in a row and nosed ahead for the firstplace win marie was second arthur third amid the clapping lincoln took a theatrical bow and accepted the top prize from his uncle he still remembered his surprise as he unwrapped the dark green paper a clear plastic box containing a oneinch cube of concrete it wasnt a joke prize though what lincoln held was a piece of stagg field at the university of chicago where the first atomic chain reaction had occurred under the direction of his cousins namesake arthur compton and enrico fermi henry had apparently acquired one of the pieces when the stadium was torn down in the s lincoln had been very touched by the historic prize and suddenly glad hed played seriously he still had the rock somewhere tucked away in a cardboard box in the basement but lincoln had no time to admire his award because that night he had a late date with adrianna like his family unexpectedly thrust into his thoughts today the beautiful redhaired gymnast had figured in his memories too adrianna waleskapronounced with a soft v echoing her secondgeneration gdansk rootsworked in the college counselors office in lincolns high school early in his senior year delivering some applications to her hed spotted stranger in a strange land on her desk the heinlein novel wellthumbed theyd spent the next hour discussing the book agreeing often arguing some with the result that lincoln realized hed missed his chemistry class no matter priorities were priorities she was tall lean had invisible braces and an appealing figure under her fuzzy sweaters and flared jeans her smile ranged from ebullient to seductive they were soon dating the first foray into serious romance for both of them theyd attend each others sports meets go to the thorne rooms at the art institute the jazz clubs in old town and occasionally visit the backseat of her chevy monza which was hardly any backseat at all and therefore just the ticket adrianna lived a short run from his house by lincolns trackandfield standards but that would never docant show up sweatyso hed borrow the family car when he could and head over to see her theyd spend hours talking as with uncle henry he and adie engaged obstacles existed yes he was leaving next year for college in boston she for san diego to study biology and work in the zoo but those were mere complications and lincoln rhyme then as now would not accept complications as excuses afterwardafter the accident and after he and blaine divorcedrhyme often wondered what would have happened if he and adrianna had stayed together and pursued what theyd started that christmas eve night in fact hed come very close to proposing hed considered offering her not a ring but as hed cleverly rehearsed a different kind of rockhis uncles prize from the science trivia contest but hed balked thanks to the weather as theyd sat clutching each other on a bench the snow had begun to tumble suicidally from the silent midwest sky and in minutes their hair and coats were covered with a damp white blanket shed just made it back to her house and lincoln to his before the roads were blocked he lay in bed that night the plastic box containing the concrete beside him and practiced a proposal speech which was never delivered events intruded in their lives sending them on different paths seemingly minute events though small in the way of invisible atoms tricked to fission in a chilly sports stadium changing the world forever everything wouldve been different rhyme now caught a glimpse of sachs brushing her long red hair he watched her for some moments glad shed be staying tonightmore pleased than usual rhyme and sachs werent inseparable they were staunchly independent people preferring often to spend time apart but tonight he wanted her here enjoying the presence of her body next to his the sensationin those few places he was able to feelall the more intense for its rarity his love for her was one of the motivators for his exercise regimen working on a computerized treadmill and electrologic bike if medical science crept past that finishing lineallowing him to walk againhis muscles were going to be ready he was also considering a new operation that might improve his condition until that day arrived experimental and controversial it was known as peripheral nerve rerouting a technique that had been talked aboutand occasionally triedfor years without many positive results but recently foreign doctors had been performing the operation with some success despite the reservation of the american medical community the procedure involved surgically connecting nerves above the site of the injury to nerves below it a detour around a washedout bridge in effect the successes were mostly in bodies less severely damaged than rhymes but the results were remarkable return of bladder control movement of limbs even walking the latter would not be the result in rhymes case but discussions with a japanese doctor whod pioneered the procedure and with a colleague at an ivy league university teaching hospital gave some hope of improvement possibly sensation and movement in his arms hands and bladder sex too paralyzed men even quads are perfectly capable of having sex if the stimulus is mentalseeing a man or woman who appeals to usthen no the message doesnt make it past the site of the damaged spinal cord but the body is a brilliant mechanism and theres a magic loop of nerve that operates on its own below the injury a little local stimulus and even the most severely disabled men can often make love the bathroom light clicked out and he watched her silhouette join him and climb into what shed announced long ago was the most comfortable bed in the world i he began and his voice was immediately muffled by her mouth as she kissed him hard what did you say she whispered moving her lips along his chin then to his neck hed forgotten i forgot he gripped her ear with his lips and was then aware of the blankets being pulled down this took some effort on her part thom made up the bed like a soldier afraid of his drill sergeant but soon he could see that the blankets were bunched up at the foot sachss tshirt had joined them she kissed him again he kissed her back hard which is when her phone rang uhuh she whispered i didnt hear that after four rings blessed voice mail took over but a moment later it rang again could be your mother rhyme pointed out rose sachs had been undergoing some treatments for a cardiac problem the prognosis was good but shed had some recent setbacks sachs grunted and flipped it open bathing both of their bodies in a blue light looking at caller id she said pam i better take it of course hey there whats up as the onesided conversation continued rhyme deduced that something was wrong okaysurebut im at lincolns you want to come over here she glanced at rhyme who was nodding agreement okay honey well be awake sure she snapped the phone shut what is it i dont know she wouldnt say she just said dan and enid had two emergency placements tonight so all the older kids had to room together she had to get out and she doesnt want to be at my place alone its fine with me you know that sachs lay back down and her mouth explored energetically she whispered i did the math shes got to pack a bag get her car out of the garageitll take her a good fortyfive minutes to be here weve got a little time she leaned forward and kissed him again just as the doorbell rang jarringly and the intercom clattered mr rhyme amelia hi its pam can you buzz me in rhyme laughed or she mightve called from the front steps they sat in one of the upstairs bedrooms pam and sachs the room was the girls for whenever she wished to stay a stuffed animal or two sat neglected on the shelf when your mother and stepfather are running from the fbi toys dont figure much in your childhood but she had several hundred books and cds thanks to thom there always were plenty of clean sweats and tshirts and socks a sirius satellite radio set and a disk player her running shoes too pam loved to speed along the mile path surrounding the central park reservoir she ran from love of running and she ran from hungry need the girl now sat on the bed carefully painting gold polish on her toenails cotton balls separating the canvases her mother had forbidden this as well as makeup out of respect for christ however that was supposed to work and once sprung from the farright underground she took up small comforting additions to her persona like this some ruddy hair tint and the three ear piercings sachs was relieved she didnt go overboard if anybody had a reason to slingshot herself into the weird it was pamela willoughby sachs was lounging in a chair feet up her own toenails bare a breeze carried into the small room the complicated mix of spring scents from central park mulch earth dewdamp foliage vehicle exhaust she sipped her hot chocolate ouch blow on it first pam whistled into her cup and tasted it its good yeah hot she returned to her nails in contrast to her visage earlier in the day the girls face was troubled you know what those are called sachs was pointing feet toes no the bottoms sure the bottoms of feet and the bottoms of toes they laughed plantars and they have prints too just like fingerprints lincoln convicted somebody once because the perp kicked somebody unconscious with his bare foot but he missed once and whacked the door left a print on it thats cool he should write another book im after him to sachs said so whats up stuart go on maybe i shouldntve come its stupid come on im a cop remember ill sweat it out of you just emily called and it was weird her calling on sunday like she never does and im thinking okay somethings going on and its like she really doesnt want to say anything but then she does and she said she saw stuart today with somebody else this girl from school after the soccer game only he told me he was going right home well what are the facts were they just talking nothing wrong with that she said she wasnt sure but it you know kind of looked like he was hugging her and then when he saw somebody looking at him he kind of walked away real fast with her like he was trying to hide the toenail project came to a stop halfway done i really really like him itd suck if he didnt want to see me anymore sachs and pam had been to a counselor togetherand with pams agreement sachs had spoken to the woman alone pam would be undergoing a lengthy period of posttraumatic stress not only from her lengthy captivity with a sociopath parent but from a particular episode in which her stepfather had nearly sacrificed her life while trying to murder police officers incidents like this one with stuart everett small to most people were amplified in the girls mind and could have devastating effects sachs had been told not to add to her fears but not to downplay them either to look at each one carefully and try to analyze it have you guys talked about seeing other people he saidwell a month ago he said he wasnt im not either i told him that any other intelligence sachs asked intelligence i mean have any of your other friends said anything no do you know any of his friends kind of but not like i could ask them anything about it thatd be way uncool sachs smiled so spies arent going to work well what you should do is just ask him pointblank you think i think what if he says he is seeing her then you should be thankful hes honest with you thats a good sign and then you convince him to dump the bimbo they laughed what you do is say that you just want to date one person the startup mother in sachs added quickly were not talking about getting married not moving in just dating pam nodded quickly oh absolutely relieved sachs continued and hes the one you want to see but you expect the same thing from him you have something important you relate to each other you can talk youve got a connection and you dont see that very much like you and mr rhyme yeah like that but if he doesnt want it then okay no its not pam frowned no im just telling you what you say but then tell him youre going to be dating other people too he cant have it both ways i guess but what if he says fine her face was dark at the thought a laugh sachs shook her head yep its a bummer when they call your bluff but i dont think he will all right im going to see him tomorrow after class ill talk to him call me let me know sachs rose lifted away the polish and capped it get some sleep its late but my nails im not finished dont wear opentoed amelia she paused at the doorway are you and mr rhyme going to get married sachs smiled and closed the door iii the fortune teller monday may with uncanny accuracy computers predict behavior by sifting through mountains of data about customers collected by businesses called predictive analytics this automated crystal ball gazing has become a billion industry in the united states and is on track to reach billion by chicago tribune chapter eighteen theyre pretty big amelia sachs sat in strategic systems datacorps skyhigh lobby and reflected that the shoe company presidents description of ssds data mining operation was well pretty understated the midtown building was thirty stories high a gray spiky monolith the sides smooth granite flashing with mica the windows were narrow slits which was surprising given the stunning views of the city from this location and elevation she was familiar with the building dubbed the gray rock but had never known who owned it she and ron pulaskino longer in play clothes but wearing a navy suit and navy uniform respectivelysat facing a massive wall on which were printed the locations of the ssd offices around the world among them london buenos aires mumbai singapore beijing dubai sydney and tokyo pretty big above the list of satellite offices was the company logo the window in the watchtower her gut twisted slightly as she recalled the windows in the abandoned building across the street from robert jorgensens residence hotel she recalled lincoln rhymes words about the incident with the federal agent in brooklyn he knew exactly where you were which means he was watching be careful sachs looking around the lobby she saw a half dozen businesspeople waiting here many of them uneasy it seemed and she recalled the shoe company president and his concern about losing ssds services she then saw almost en masse their heads swivel looking past the receptionist they were watching a short man youthful enter the lobby and walk directly toward sachs and pulaski over the blackandwhite rugs his posture was perfect and his stride long the sandyhaired man nodded and smiled offering a fast greetingby nameto nearly everybody here a presidential candidate that was sachss first impression but he didnt stop until he came to the officers good morning im andrew sterling detective sachs this is officer pulaski sterling was shorter than sachs by several inches but he seemed quite fit and had broad shoulders his immaculate white shirt featured a starched collar and cuffs his arms seemed muscular the jacket was tightfitting no jewelry crinkles radiated from the corners of his green eyes when that easy smile crossed his face lets go to my office the head of such a big companyyet hed come to them rather than having an underling escort them to his throne room sterling walked easily down the wide quiet halls he greeted every employee sometimes asking questions about their weekends they ate up his smiles at reports of an enjoyable weekend and his frowns at word of ill relatives or canceled games there were dozens of them and he made a personal comment to each hello tony he said to a janitor who was emptying the contents of shredded documents into a large plastic bag did you see the game no andrew i missed it had too much to do maybe we should start threeday weekends sterling joked id vote for that andrew and they continued down the hall sachs didnt think she knew as many in the nypd as sterling said hello to in their fiveminute walk the decor of the company was minimal some small tasteful photographs and sketchesnone in coloroverwhelmed by the spotless white walls the furniture also black or white was simpleexpensive ikea it was a statement of some kind she guessed but she found it bleak as they walked she ran through what shed learned last night after saying good night to pam the mans bio patched together from the web was sparse he was an intensely reclusive mana howard hughes not a bill gates his early life was a mystery shed found no references at all to his childhood or his parents a few sketchy pieces in the press had put him on the radar at age seventeen when hed had his first jobs mostly in sales working doortodoor and telemarketing moving up to bigger more expensive products finally computers for a kid with of a bachelors degree from a night school sterling told the press he found himself a successful salesman hed gone back to college finishing the last oneeighth of the degree and completing a masters in computer science and engineering in short order the stories were all very horatio alger and included only details that boosted his savvy and status as a businessman then in his twenties had come the great awakening he said sounding like a chinese communist dictator sterling was selling a lot of computers but not enough to satisfy him why wasnt he more successful he wasnt lazy he wasnt stupid then he realized the problem he was inefficient and so were a lot of other salesmen so sterling learned computer programming and spent weeks of eighteenhour days in a dark room writing software he hocked everything and started a company one based on a concept that was either foolish or brilliant its most valuable asset wouldnt be owned by his company but by millions of other people much of it free for the takinginformation about themselves sterling began compiling a database that included potential customers in a number of service and manufacturing markets the demographics of the area in which they were located their income marital status the good or bad news about their financial and legal and tax situations and as much other informationpersonal and professionalas he could buy steal or otherwise find if theres a fact out there i want it he was quoted as saying the software he wrote the early version of the watchtower database management system was revolutionary at the time an exponential leap over the famed sqlpronounced sequel sachs had learnedprogram in minutes watchtower would decide which customers would be worthwhile to call on and how to seduce them and which werent worth the effort but whose names might be sold to other companies for their own pitches the company grew like a monster in a science fiction film sterling changed the name to ssd moved it to manhattan and began to collect smaller companies in the information business to add to his empire though unpopular with privacy rights organizations thered never been a hint of a scandal at ssd à la enron employees had to earn their salariesno one received obscenely high wall street bonusesbut if the company profited so did they ssd offered tuition and homepurchasing assistance internships for children and parents were given a year of maternity or paternity leave the company was known for the familial way it treated its workers and sterling encouraged hiring spouses parents and children every month he sponsored motivational and teambuilding retreats the ceo was secretive about his personal life though sachs learned that he didnt smoke or drink and that no one had ever heard him utter an obscenity he lived modestly took a surprisingly small salary and kept his wealth in ssd stock he shunned the new york social scene no fast cars no private jets despite his respect for the family unit among ssd employees sterling was twice divorced and unmarried at the moment there were conflicting reports about children hed fathered in his youth he had several residences but he kept their whereabouts out of the public record perhaps because he knew the power of data andrew sterling appreciated its dangers too sterling sachs and pulaski now came to the end of a long corridor and entered an exterior office where two assistants had their desks both of which were filled with perfectly ordered stacks of papers file folders printouts only one assistant was in at the moment a young man handsome in a conservative suit his nameplate read martin coyle his area was the most orderedeven the many books behind him were arranged in descending order of size sachs was amused to see andrew he nodded a greeting to his boss ignoring the officers as soon as he noted that they hadnt been introduced your phone messages are on your computer thank you sterling glanced at the other desk jeremys going to look over the restaurant for the press junket he did that this morning hes running some papers over to the law firm about that other matter sachs marveled that sterling had two personal assistantsapparently one for the inside work the other handling outoftheoffice matters at the nypd detectives shared if they had help at all they continued on to sterlings own office which wasnt much bigger than any other shed seen in the company and its walls were free of decoration despite the ssd logo of the voyeuristic window in the watchtower andrew sterlings were curtained cutting off what would be a magnificent view of the city a ripple of claustrophobia coursed through her sterling sat in a simple wooden chair not a leather swivel throne he gestured them into similar ones though padded behind him were low shelves filled with books but curiously they were stacked with spines facing up not outward visitors to his office couldnt see his choice of reading matter without walking past the man and looking down or pulling out a volume the ceo nodded at a pitcher and a half dozen inverted glasses thats water but if youd like some coffee or tea i can have some fetched fetched she didnt think shed ever heard anyone actually use the word no thank you pulaski shook his head excuse me just one moment sterling picked up his phone dialed andy you called sachs deduced from the tone that it was someone close to him though it was clearly a business call about a problem of some sort yet sterling spoke emotionlessly ah well youll have to i think we need those numbers you know theyre not sitting on their hands theyll make a move any day now good he hung up and noticed sachs watching him closely my son works for the company a nod at a photo on his desk showing sterling with a handsome thin young man who resembled the ceo both were wearing ssd tshirts at some employee outing maybe one of the inspirational retreats they were next to each other but there was no physical contact between them neither was smiling so one question about his personal life had been answered now he said turning his green eyes on sachs whats this all about you mentioned some crime sachs explained thereve been several murders in the past few months in the city we think that someone mightve used information in your computers to get close to the victims kill them and then used that and other information to frame innocent people for the crimes the man who knows everything information his concern seemed genuine he was perplexed too though im not sure how that could happen but tell me more well the killer knew exactly what personal products the victims used and he planted traces of them as evidence at an innocent persons residence to connect them to the killing from time to time the eyebrows above sterlings emerald irises narrowed he seemed genuinely troubled as she gave him the details about the theft of the painting and coins and the two sexual assaults thats terrible troubled by the news he glanced away from her rapes sachs nodded grimly and then explained how ssd seemed to be the only company in the area that had access to all the information the killer had used he rubbed his face nodding slowly i can see why youre concerned but wouldnt it be easier for this killer just to follow the people he victimized and find out what they bought or even hack into their computers break into their mailboxes their homes jot down their license plate numbers from the street but see thats the problem he could but hed have to do all of those things to get the information he needed thereve been four crimes at a minimumwe think there could probably be moreand that means uptodate information on the four victims and four men hes setting up the most efficient way to get that information would be to go through a data miner sterling gave a smile a delicate wince sachs frowned and cocked her head he said nothing wrong with that term data miner the press has latched on to it and you see it everywhere twenty million searchengine hits but i prefer to call ssd a knowledge service providera ksp like an internet service provider sachs had a strange sensation he seemed almost hurt by what shed said she wanted to tell him she wouldnt do it again sterling smoothed a stack of papers on his organized desktop at first she thought they were blank but then she noticed they were all turned facedown well believe me if anyone at ssd is involved i want to find out as much as you do this could look very bad for usknowledge service providers havent been doing very well in the press or in congress lately first of all sachs said the killer would have bought most of the items with cash were pretty sure sterling nodded he wouldnt want to leave any trace of himself right but the shoes he bought mail order or online would you have a list of people who bought these shoes in these sizes in the new york area she handed him a list of the altons the bass and the suretracks the same man would have bought all of them what time period three months sterling made a phone call he had a brief conversation and no more than sixty seconds later he was looking at his computer screen he swiveled it so sachs could see though she wasnt sure what she was looking atstrings of product information and codes the ceo shook his head roughly eight hundred altons sold twelve hundred bass two hundred suretracks but no one person bought all three or even two pairs rhyme had suspected that the killer if he used information from ssd would cover his tracks but theyd hoped this lead would pay off staring at the numbers she wondered if the killer had used the identitytheft techniques hed perfected on robert jorgensen to order the shoes sorry she nodded sterling uncapped a battered silver pen and pulled a notepad toward him in precise script he wrote several notes sachs couldnt read stared at it nodded to himself youre thinking id imagine that the problem is an intruder an employee one of our customers or a hacker right ron pulaski glanced at sachs and said exactly all right lets get to the bottom of it he checked his seiko watch i want some other people in here it may take a few minutes we have our spirit circles every monday around this time spirit circles pulaski asked inspirational team meetings by the group leaders they should be finished soon we start at eight on the dot but some go a little longer than others depending on the leader he said command intercom martin sachs laughed to herself he was using the same sort of voicerecognition system that lincoln rhyme had yes andrew the voice came from a tiny box on the desk i want tomsecurity tomand sam are they in spirit circles no andrew but sams probably going to be in washington all week he wont be back till friday mark his assistants in him then yes sir command intercom disconnect to sachs he said should just be a moment she imagined that when andrew sterling summoned you you materialized pretty quickly he jotted a few more notes as he did she glanced at the company logo on the wall when he was through writing she said im curious about that the tower and the window whats the significance of it on one level it just means observing data but theres a second meaning he smiled pleased to be explaining this do you know the concept of the broken window in social philosophy no i learned about it years ago and never forgot it the thrust is that in order to improve society you should concentrate on the small things if you control thoseor fix themthen the bigger changes will follow take housing projects with a highcrime problem you can sink millions into increased police patrols and security cameras but if the projects still look dilapidated and dangerous theyll stay dilapidated and dangerous instead of millions of dollars put thousands into fixing the windows painting cleaning the halls it may seem cosmetic but people will notice theyll take pride in where they live theyll start to report people who are threats and who dont look after their property as im sure you know that was the thrust of crime prevention in new york in the nineties and it worked andrew came martins voice from the intercom tom and mark are here sterling ordered send them in he set the paper hed been jotting notes on directly in front of him he gave sachs a grim smile lets see if anybodys been peeking through our window chapter nineteen the doorbell rang and thom ushered in a man in his early thirties disheveled brown hair jeans a weird al yankovic tshirt under a shabby brown sports coat you couldnt be in the forensics game nowadays without being computer literate but both rhyme and cooper recognized their limitations when it was clear that there were digital implications of the case sellitto had requested some help from the nypd computer crimes unit an elite group of thirtytwo detectives and support staff rodney szarnek strode into the room glanced at the nearest monitor and said hey as if he were speaking to the hardware similarly when he glanced toward rhyme he expressed no interest in his physical condition whatsoever only in the wireless environmental control unit attached to the armrest he seemed impressed your day off sellitto asked glancing at the slim young mans outfit his voice making it clear he didnt approve rhyme knew the detective was old school police officers should dress appropriately day off szarnek replied missing the dig no why would i have a day off just wondering heh so now whats the story we need a trap lincoln rhymes theory about strolling into ssd and just plain asking about a killer wasnt as naive as it seemed when hed seen on the company web site that ssds publicsure division supported police departments his hunch was that nypd was a customer if that was the case then the killer might have access to the department files a fast call revealed that yes the department was a client publicsure software and ssd consultants provided data management services for the city including consolidation of case information reports and records if a patrolman on the street needed a warrant check or a detective new to a homicide needed the cases history publicsure helped get the information to his desk or squadcar computer or even his pda or cell phone in minutes by sending sachs and pulaski to the company and asking who might have accessed the data files about the victims and fall guys could learn they were on to him and try to get into the nypd system through publicsure to look at the reports if he did they might be able to trace who had accessed the files rhyme explained the situation to szarnek who nodded knowinglyas if he set up traps like this every day he was taken aback though when he learned what company the killer might have a connection to ssd the biggest data miner in the world they got the scoop on all of gods children is that a problem his carefree geek image faltered and he answered softly i hope not and he set to work with their trap explaining what he was doing he stripped from the files any details about the case they didnt want to know and manually transferred those sensitive files to a computer that had no internet access he then put an alarmed visual traceroute program in front of the myra weinburg sexual assaulthomicide file on the nypd server and added subfiles to tempt the killer like suspects whereabouts forensic analysis and witnesses all of which contained only general notes about crimescene procedures if anyone accessed it either hacking in or through authorized channels a notice of the persons isp and physical location would be instantly sent to szarnek they could tell immediately if the one checking out the file was a cop with a legitimate inquiry or was somebody on the outside if so szarnek would notify rhyme or sellitto whod have the esu team head to the location immediately szarnek also included a large amount of material and background such as public information on ssd all of it encrypted to make sure that the killer spent plenty of time in the system deciphering the data and giving them a better chance to find him how long will it take fifteen twenty minutes good and when youve got that finished i also want to see if somebody could have hacked in from the outside cracked ssd uhhuh heh theyll have firewalls on their firewalls on their firewalls still we need to know but if one of their people is the killer i assume you dont want me to call the company up and coordinate with them right szarneks face clouded ill just try to break in i guess you can do that legally yes and no ill only test the walls its not a crime if i dont actually get into their system and bring it crashing down in a really embarrassing media event that lands us all in jail he added ominously or worse okay but i want the trap first asap rhyme glanced at the clock sachs and pulaski were already spreading the word about the case down at the gray rock szarnek pulled a heavy portable computer out of his satchel and set it on a table nearby any chance i could get aoh thanks thom was bringing around a coffeepot and cups just what i was going to ask for extra sugar no milk you cant take the geek out of the geek even when hes a cop never got in the habit of this thing called sleep he dumped in sugar swirled it and drank half while thom stood there the aide refilled the cup thanks now whatve we got here he was looking over the workstation where cooper was perched ouch ouch youre running on a cable modem with one point five mbps you know they make computer screens in color now and theres this thing called the internet funny rhyme muttered talk to me when the case is over well do some rewiring and lan readjustment set you up with fe weird al fe lan szarnek pulled on tinted glasses plugged his computer into ports on rhymes computer and began pounding on the keys rhyme noticed certain letters were worn off and the touchpad was seriously sweatstained the keyboard seemed to be dusted with crumbs the look sellitto shot rhyme said it takes all kinds the first of the two men who joined them in andrew sterlings office was slender middleaged with an unrevealing face he resembled a retired cop the other younger and cautious was pure corporate junior exec he looked like the blond brother on that sitcom frazier regarding the first sachs was near the mark he hadnt been blue but was a former fbi agent and was now head of ssds security tom oday the other was mark whitcomb the assistant head of the companys compliance department sterling explained tom and his security boys make sure people on the outside dont do anything bad to us marks department makes sure we dont do anything bad to the general public we navigate a minefield im sure that the research you did on ssd showed you were subject to hundreds of state and federal laws on privacythe grahamleachbliley act about misuse of personal information and pretexting the fair credit reporting act the health insurance portability and accountability act the drivers privacy protection act a lot of state laws too the compliance department makes sure we know what the rules are and stay within the lines good she thought these two would be perfect to spread the word about the investigation and encourage the killer to sniff out the trap on the nypd server doodling on a yellow pad mark whitcomb said we want to make sure that when michael moore makes a movie about data purveyors were not center stage dont even joke sterling said laughing though with genuine concern evident in his face then he asked sachs can i share with them what you told me sure please sterling gave a succinct and clear account hed retained everything shed told him even down to the specific brands of the clues whitcomb frowned as he listened oday took it all in unsmiling and silent sachs was convinced that fbi reserve was not learned behavior but originated in the womb sterling said firmly so thats the problem were facing if there is any way ssd is involved i want to know about it and i want solutions weve identified four possible sources of the risk hackers intruders employees and clients your thoughts oday the former agent said to sachs well lets deal with hackers first we have the best firewalls in the business better than microsoft and sun we use ics out of boston for internet security i can tell you were a duck in an arcade gameevery hacker in the world would like to crack us and nobodys been able to do it since we moved to new york five years ago weve had a few people get into our administrative servers for ten fifteen minutes but not a single breach of innercircle and thats what your unsub would have to get into to find the information he needed for these crimes and he couldnt get in through a single breach hed have to hit at least three or four separate servers sterling added as for an outside intruder thatd be impossible too we have the same physical perimeter protections used by the national security agency we have fifteen fulltime security guards and twenty parttime besides no visitor could get near the innercircle servers we log everybody and dont let anyone roam freely even customers sachs and pulaski had been escorted to the sky lobby by one of those guardsa humorless young man whose vigilance wasnt diminished one bit by the fact they were police oday added we had one incident about three years ago but nothing since he glanced at sterling the reporter the ceo nodded some hotshot journalist from one of the metro papers he was doing an article on identity theft and decided we were the devil incarnate axciom and choicepoint had the good sense not to let him into their headquarters i believe in free press so i talked to him he went to the restroom and claimed he got lost he came back here cheerful as could be but something didnt seem right our security people went through his briefcase and found a camera on it were pictures of tradesecretprotected business plans and even pass codes oday said the reporter not only lost his job but was prosecuted under criminal trespass statutes he served six months in state prison and as far as i know he hasnt had a steady job as a journalist since sterling lowered his head slightly and said to sachs we take security very very seriously a young man appeared in the doorway at first she thought it was martin the assistant but she realized that was only because of the similarity in build and the black suit andrew im sorry to interrupt ah jeremy so this was the second assistant he looked at pulaskis uniform then at sachs then as with martin when he realized he wasnt being introduced he ignored everyone in the room except his boss carpenter sterling said i need to see him today yes andrew after he was gone sachs asked employees is there anyone youve had disciplinary problems with sterling said we run extensive background checks on our people i wont allow hiring anybody whos had any convictions other than traffic violations and background checks are one of our specialties but even if an employee wanted to get into innercircle it would be impossible for him to steal any data mark tell her about the pens sure andrew to sachs he said we have concrete firewalls im not a technical person sachs said whitcomb laughed no no its very lowtech literally concrete as in walls and floors we divide up the data when we receive them and store them in physically separate places youll understand better if i tell you how ssd operates we start with the premise that data is our main asset if somebody was to duplicate innercircle wed be out of business in a week so number oneprotect our asset as we say here now where does all this data come from from thousands of sources credit card companies banks governmentrecords offices retail stores online operations court clerks dmv departments hospitals insurance companies we consider each event that creates data a quote transaction which could be a call to an eight hundred number registering a car a health insurance claim filing a lawsuit a birth wedding purchase merchandise return a complaint in your business a transaction could be a rape a burglary a murderany crime also the opening of a case file selecting a juror a trial a conviction whitcomb continued any time data about a transaction comes to ssd it goes first to the intake center where its evaluated for security we have a data masking policyseparating the persons name and replacing it with a code social security number a flicker of emotion crossed sterlings face ah no those were created solely for government retirement accounts ages ago it was a fluke that they became identification inaccurate easy to steal or buy dangerouslike keeping a loaded gun unlocked around the house our code is a sixteendigit number ninetyeight percent of adult americans have ssd codes now every child whose birth is registeredanywhere in north americaautomatically gets a code why sixteen digits pulaski asked gives us room for expansion sterling said we never have to worry about running out of numbers we can assign nearly one quintillion codes the earth will run out of living space before ssd runs out of numbers the codes make our system much more secure and its far faster to process data than using a name or social also using a code neutralizes the human element and takes the prejudice out of the equation psychologically we have opinions about adolf or britney or shaquilla or diego before we even meet them simply because of their name a number eliminates that bias and improves efficiency please go on mark sure andrew once the name is swapped for the code the intake center evaluates the transaction decides where it belongs and sends it to one or more of three separate areasour data pens pen a is where we store personal lifestyle data pen b is financial that includes salary history banking credit reports insurance pen c is public and government filings and records then the datas cleansed sterling took over once again the impurities are weeded out and its made uniform for instance on some forms your sex is given as f in others its female sometimes its a one or a zero you have to be consistent we also remove the noisethats impure data it could be erroneous could have too many details could have too few details noise is contamination and contamination has to be eliminated he said this firmlyanother dash of emotion then the cleansed data sits in one of our pens until a client needs a fortuneteller how do you mean asked pulaski sterling explained in the nineteen seventies computer database software gave companies an analysis of past performance in the nineties the data showed how they were doing at any given moment more helpful now we can predict what consumers are going to do and guide our clients to take advantage of that sachs said then youre not just predicting the future youre trying to change it exactly but what other reason is there to go to a fortuneteller his eyes were calm almost amused yet sachs felt uneasy thinking back to the runin with the federal agent yesterday in brooklyn it was as if had done just what he was describing predicted a shootout between them sterling gestured to whitcomb who continued okay so data which contain no names but only numbers go into these three separate pens on different floors in different security zones an employee in the public records pen cant access the data in the lifestyle pen or the financial pen and nobody in any of the data pens can access the information in the intake center and link the name and address to the sixteendigit code sterling said thats what tom meant when he said that a hacker would have to breach all of the data pens independently oday added and we monitor twentyfourseven wed know instantly if someone unauthorized tried to physically enter a pen theyd be fired on the spot and probably arrested besides you cant download anything from the computers in the pensthere are no portsand even if you managed to break into a server and hardwire a device you couldnt get it out everybodys searchedevery employee senior executive security guard fire warden janitor even andrew we have metal and densematerial detectors at every entrance and exit to the data pens and intakeeven the fire doors whitcomb took up the narrative and a magnetic field generator that you have to walk through it erases all digital data on any medium youre carryingipod phone or hard drive no nobody gets out of those rooms with a kilobyte of information on them sachs said so stealing the data from these penseither by hackers outside or intruders or employees insidewould be almost impossible sterling was nodding data are our only asset we guard them religiously what about the other scenariosomebody who works for a client like tom was saying the way this man operates hed have to have access to the innercircle dossiers of each of the victims and the men arrested for the crimes right sterling lifted his hands like a professor but customers dont have access to dossiers they wouldnt want them anyway innercircle contains raw data and wouldnt do them any good what they want is our analysis of the data customers log on to watchtowerthats our proprietary database management systemand other programs like xpectation or fort the programs themselves search through innercircle find the relevant data and put them into usable form if you want to think of the mining analogy watchtower sifts through tons of dirt and rock and finds gold nuggets she said in response but if a client bought a number of mailing lists say they could come up with enough data about one of our victims to commit the crimes couldnt they she nodded at the evidence list shed shown sterling earlier for instance our perp could get lists of everyone who bought that kind of shave cream and condoms and duct tape and running shoes and so on sterling lifted an eyebrow hm it would be a huge amount of work but its theoretically possible all right ill get a list of all our customers whove bought any data that included your victims namesin the past say three months no maybe six that should do it she dug through her briefcaseconsiderably less organized than sterlings desktopand handed him a list of the victims and fall guys our client agreement gives us the right to share information about them there wont be a problem legally but it will take a few hours to put together thanks now one final question about employees even if theyre not allowed in the pens could they download a dossier in their office he was nodding impressed by her question it seemed even though it suggested an ssd worker might be the killer most employees cantagain we have to protect our data but a few of us have whats called allaccess permission whitcomb gave a smile well but look who that is andrew if theres a problem here we need to explore all possible solutions whitcomb said to sachs and pulaski the thing is the allaccess employees are senior people here theyve been with the company for years were like a family we have parties together we have our inspirational retreats sterling held up a hand cutting him off and said we have to follow up on it mark i want this rooted out whatever it takes i want answers who has allaccess rights sachs asked sterling shrugged im authorized our head of sales the head of technical operations our human resources director could put together a dossier i suppose though im sure he never has and marks boss our compliance department director he gave her the names sachs glanced at whitcomb who shook his head i dont have access oday didnt either your assistants sachs asked sterling referring to jeremy and martin nonow as for the repair folksthe techiesthe line people couldnt assemble a dossier but we have two service managers who could one on the day shift one at night he gave her their names too sachs looked over the list theres one easy way to tell whether or not theyre innocent how we know where the killer was on sunday afternoon if they have alibis theyll be off the hook let me interview them right now if we can good sterling said and gave an approving look at her suggestion a simple solution to one of his problems then she realized something every time hed looked at her this morning his gaze had met her eyes unlike many if not most men sachs met sterling hadnt once glanced over her body hadnt offered a bit of flirt she wondered what the bedroom story was she asked could i see the security in the data pens for myself sure just leave your pager phone and pda outside and any thumbdrives if you dont all the data will be erased and youll be searched when you leave okay sterling nodded to oday who stepped into the hall and returned with the stern security guard whod walked sachs and pulaski here from the massive lobby downstairs sterling printed out a pass for her signed it and handed it to the guard who led her out into the halls sachs was pleased that sterling hadnt resisted her request she had an ulterior motive for seeing the pens for herself not only could she make yet more people aware of the investigationin the hope theyd go for the baitbut she could question the guard about the security measures to verify what oday sterling and whitcomb had told her but the man remained virtually silent like a child told by his parents not to speak to strangers through doorways up corridors down a staircase up another one she was soon completely disoriented her muscles shivered the spaces were increasingly confined narrow and dim her claustrophobia began to kick in while the windows were small throughout the gray rock hereapproaching the data pensthey were nonexistent she took a deep breath it didnt help she glanced at his name badge say john yes maam whats the story with the windows theyre either smallor there arent any andrews concerned that people might try to photograph information from outside like passcodes or business plans really could somebody do that i dont know were told to check sometimesscan nearby observation decks windows of buildings facing the company nobodys ever seen something suspicious but andrew wants us to keep doing it the data pens were eerie places all colorcoded personal lifestyle was blue financial red governmental green they were huge spaces but that did nothing to allay her claustrophobia the ceilings were very low the rooms dim and aisles narrow between the rows of computers a constant churning filled the air a low tone like a growl the airconditioning was working like mad given the number of computers and the electricity theyd require but the atmosphere was close and stifling as for the computers shed never seen so many in her life they were massive white boxes and were identified curiously not by numbers or letters but by decals depicting cartoon characters like spiderman batman barney the road runner and mickey mouse spongebob she asked nodding at one john offered his first smile its another layer of security andrew thought of we have people looking online for anybody talking about ssd and innercircle if theres a reference to the company and a cartoon name like wile e coyote or superman it might mean somebodys a little too interested in the computers themselves the names jump out more than if we just numbered the computers smart she said reflecting on the irony that sterling preferred people to be numbered and his computers named they entered the intake center painted a grim gray it was smaller than the data pens and boosted her claustrophobia even further as in the pens the only decorations here were the logo of the watchtower and illuminated window and a large picture of andrew sterling a posed smile on his face below it was the caption youre number one maybe it referred to market share or to an award the company had won or maybe it was a slogan about the importance of employees still to sachs it seemed ominous as if you were at the top of a list you didnt want to be on her breathing was coming quickly as the sense of confinement grew gets to you doesnt it the guard asked she gave a smile a little we make our rounds but nobody spends more time in the pens than we have to now that shed broken the ice and gotten john to answer in more than monosyllables she asked him about the security to verify if sterling and the others were being straight they were it seemed john reiterated what the ceo had said none of the computers or workstations in the rooms had a slot or port to download data merely keyboards and monitors and the rooms were shielded the guard said no wireless signals could get out and he explained too what sterling and whitcomb had told her earlier about data from each pen being useless without the data from the others and from intake there wasnt much security on the computer monitors but to get into the pens you needed your id card a passcode and a biometric scanor apparently a big security guard watching your every move which was just what john had been doing and not so subtly the security outside the pens was tight too as the executives had told her both she and the guard were searched carefully when they left each one and had to walk through both a metal detector and a thick frame called a dataclear unit the machine warned passing through this system permanently erases all digital data on computers drives cell phones and other devices as they returned to sterlings office john told her that to his knowledge nobody had ever broken into ssd still oday regularly had them run drills to prevent security intrusions like most of the guards john didnt carry a gun but sterling had a policy that at least two armed guards be present twentyfour hours a day back in the ceos office she found pulaski sitting on a huge leather sofa near martins desk though not a small man he seemed dwarfed a student whod been sent to the principals office in her absence the young officer had taken the initiative to check on the compliance department head samuel brocktonwhitcombs boss who had allaccess rights he was staying in washington dc hotel records showed hed been at brunch in the dining room at the time of the killing yesterday she noted this then glanced over the allaccess permission list andrew sterling president chief executive officer sean cassel director of sales and marketing wayne gillespie director of technical operations samuel brockton director compliance department alibihotel records confirm presence in washington peter arlonzokemper director of human resources steven shraeder technical service and support manager day shift faruk mameda technical service and support manager night shift she said to sterling id like to interview them as soon as possible the ceo called his assistant and learned that other than brockton everyone was in town though shraeder was handling a hardware crisis in the intake center and mameda would not be coming in until three that afternoon he instructed martin to have them come upstairs for interviews hed find a vacant conference room sterling told the intercom to disconnect and said all right detective its up to you now go clear our nameor find your killer chapter twenty rodney szarnek had their mousetrap in place and the young shaggyhaired officer was happily trying to hack into ssds main servers his knee bobbed and he whistled from time to time which irritated rhyme but he let the kid alone the criminalist had been known to talk to himself when searching crime scenes and considering possible approaches to a case takes all kinds the doorbell rang it was an officer from the cs lab in queens with a present some evidence from one of the earlier crimes the murder weapon a knife used in the coin theft and killing the rest of the physical evidence was in storage somewhere a request had been made but no one could say when or if it could be located rhyme had cooper sign the chainofcustody formeven after trial protocols must be followed thats strange most of the other evidence is missing rhyme remarked though he realized that being a weapon the knife would have been retained in a locked facility in the labs inventory rather than archived with nonlethal evidence rhyme glanced at the chart about the crime they found some of that dust in the knife handle lets see if we can figure out what it is but first whats the story on the knife itself cooper ran the manufacturers information through the nypd weapons database made in china sold in bulk to thousands of retail outlets cheap so we can assume he paid cash for it well hadnt expected much lets move on to the dust cooper donned gloves and opened the bag he carefully brushed the handle of the knife whose blade was dark brown with the victims blood and it shed traces of white dust onto the examination paper dust fascinated rhyme in forensics the term refers to solid particles less than five hundred micrometers in size and made up of fibers from clothing and upholstery dander from human and animal skin fragments of plants and insects bits of dried excrement dirt and any number of chemicals some types are aerosol others settle quickly on surfaces dust can cause health problemslike black lungand be dangerously explosive flour dust in grain elevators for instance and can even affect the climate forensically thanks to static electricity and other adhesive properties dust is often transferred from perpetrator to crime scene and vice versa which makes it extremely helpful to police when rhyme was running the crime scene division of the nypd hed created a large database of dust gathered from all five boroughs of the city and parts of new jersey and connecticut only small amounts adhered to the knife handle but mel cooper collected enough to run a sample through the gas chromatographmass spectrometer which breaks substances down into their component parts then identifies each one this took some time it wasnt coopers fault his hands surprisingly large and muscular for such a slight man moved quickly and efficiently it was the machines that plodded away slowly performing their methodical magic while they waited for the results cooper ran additional chemical tests on another sample of the dust to reveal materials the gcms might not find eventually the results were available and mel cooper explained the combined analysis as he wrote the details on the whiteboard all right lincoln weve got vermiculite plaster synthetic foam glass fragments paint particles mineral wool fibers glass fibers calcite grains paper fibers quartz grains lowtemperature combustion material metal flakes chrysotile asbestos and some chemicals looks like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons paraffin olefin napthene octanes polychlorinated biphenyls dibenzodioxinsdont see those very oftenand dibenzofurans oh and some brominated diphenyl ethers the trade center rhyme said it is yep the dust from the collapsed world trade towers in had been the source of health problems for workers near ground zero and variations of its composition had been in the news lately rhyme was well aware of its composition so hes downtown possibly rhyme said but you could find the dust all over the five boroughs lets leave it a question mark for the time being he grimaced so our profile so far a man who might be white or a lightskinned ethnic who might collect coins and might like art and his residence or place of work might be downtown he might have children might smoke rhyme squinted at the knife let me see it up close cooper brought the weapon to him and rhyme stared at every millimeter of the handle his body was defective but his eyesight was as good as a teenagers there whats that where between the hasp and the bone it was a tiny fleck of something pale you could see that the tech whispered i missed it completely with a needle probe he worked it out and put it on an examination slide he looked at it through a microscope he started with lower magnifications which are enough to power unless you need the magic of a scanning electron microscope crumb of food looks like something baked orange tint spectrum suggests oil maybe junk food like doritos or potato chips not enough to run through the gcms no way cooper confirmed he wasnt going to plant something as small as that at the fall guys house its some other bit of real information about five twentytwo what the hell was it something from his lunch the day of the killing i want to taste it what theres blood on it the handle not the blade just where that fleck is i want to find out what it is theres not enough to taste this little chip you can hardly see it i didnt see it no the knife itself maybe i can find a flavor or spice thatll tell us something you cant lick a murder weapon lincoln wheres that written down mel i dont remember reading that we need information about this guy wellokay the tech held the knife close to rhymes face and the criminalist leaned forward and touched his tongue to the place where theyd found the fleck jesus christ he reared his head back whats wrong cooper asked alarmed get me some water cooper tossed the knife onto the examination table and went to call thom as rhyme spit on the floor his mouth was on fire thom came running whats wrong manthat hurts i asked for water i just ate some hot sauce hot sauce like tabasco i dont know what kind well you dont want water you want milk or yogurt then get some thom came back with a carton of yogurt and fed rhyme several spoonfuls to his surprise the pain went away immediately phew that hurt okay mel weve learned something elsemaybe our boy likes his chips and salsa well lets just go with a snack food and hot sauce put it on the chart as cooper wrote rhyme glanced at the clock and snapped where the hell is sachs well shes at ssd cooper looked confused i know that what i mean is why the hell isnt she back hereand thom i want some more yogurt unsub

hot sauce chapter twentyone the conference room where sachs and pulaski had been led was as minimalist as sterlings office she decided a good way to describe the entire company would be austere deco sterling himself escorted them to the room and gestured to two chairs beneath the logo of the window atop the watchtower he said i dont expect to be treated any differently than anyone else since i have allaccess rights im a suspect too but i have an alibi for yesterdayi was on long island all day i do that a lotdrive to some of the big discount stores and the membership shopping clubs to see what people are buying how they buy what times of day im always looking for ways to make our business more efficient and you cant do that unless you know our clients needs who were you meeting with nobody i never tell anyone who i am i want to see the operation the way it actually works blemishes and everything but my cars ezpass records should show that i went through the midtown tunnel tollbooth about nine am eastbound and then came back through about fivethirty you can check with dmv he recited his tag number oh and yesterday i called my son he took the train up to westchester to go hiking in some forest preserve he went by himself and i wanted to check on him i called about two in the afternoon the phone recordsll show a call from my hampton house or you can take a look at the incoming call list on his mobile it should have the date and time his extension is seven one eight seven sachs wrote this down along with the number of sterlings summer houses phone she thanked him then jeremy the outside assistant arrived and whispered something to his boss have to take care of something if theres anything you need anything at all just let me know a few minutes later the first of their suspects arrived sean cassel the director of sales and marketing he struck her as quite young probably midthirties but shed seen very few people in ssd who were over forty data was perhaps the new silicon valley a world of youthful entrepreneurs cassel with a long face classically handsome seemed athletic solid arms broad shoulders he was wearing the ssd uniform in his case a navy suit the white shirt was immaculate and the cuffs clasped with heavy gold links the yellow tie was thick silk he had curly hair rosy skin and peered steadily at sachs through glasses she hadnt known dolce gabbana made frames hi hello im detective sachs this is officer pulaski have a seat she shook his hand noting the firm grip that lingered longer than the clasp with pulaski so youre a detective the sales director had not a shred of interest in the patrolman thats right would you like to see my id no thats okay now were just getting information about some of the employees here do you know a myra weinburg no should i she was the victim of a murder oh a flash of contrition as the hip façade vanished momentarily i heard something about a crime i didnt know it was a murder though im sorry was she an employee here no but the person who killed her might have had access to information in your companys computers i know you have full access to innercircle is there any way somebody who works for you could assemble an individuals dossier he shook his head to get a closet you need three passcodes or a biomet and one closet he hesitated oh thats what we call a dossier we use a lot of shorthand in the knowledge service business like secrets in a closet she assumed but nobody could get my passcode everyones very careful about keeping them secret andrew insists on it cassel removed his glasses and polished them with a black cloth that appeared magically in his hand hes fired employees whove used other peoples passcodes even with their permission fired on the spot he concentrated on his glasspolishing task then looked up but lets be honest what youre really asking about isnt passcodes but alibis am i right wed like to know that too where were you from noon to four pm yesterday running im training for a minitriathlon you look like you run too youre pretty athletic if standing still while punching holes in targets at twentyfive and fifty feet is athletic then yes could anybody verify that that youre athletic its pretty obvious to me smile sometimes it was best to play along pulaski stirredwhich cassel noted with amusementbut she said nothing sachs didnt need anybody to defend her honor with a sideways glance at the uniformed officer cassel continued no im afraid not a friend stayed over but she left about ninethirty am i a suspect or anything were just getting information at this point pulaski said are you now he sounded condescending as if he were talking to a child just the facts maam just the facts a line from an old tv show sachs couldnt remember which one sachs asked where hed been at the times of the other killingsthe coin dealer the earlier rape and the woman whod owned the prescott painting he replaced the glasses and told her he didnt recall he seemed completely at ease how often do you go into the data pens maybe once a week do you take any information out he frowned slightly wellyou cant the security system wont let you and how often do you download dossiers i dont know if i ever have its just raw data too noisy to be helpful for anything i do all right well i appreciate your time i think thatll do it for now the smile and flirt faded so is this a problem something i should be worried about were just doing some preliminary investigation ah not giving anything away a glance at pulaski play it close to the chest right sergeant friday ah that was it sachs realized dragnet the old police show she and her father would watch in rerun years ago after hed left another employee joined them wayne gillespie who oversaw the technical side of the companythe software and hardware he didnt exactly fit sachss impression of a geek not at first he was tanned and in good shape wore an expensive silveror platinumbracelet his grip was strong but on closer examination she decided he was a classic techie after all somebody dressed by his mother for class photographs the short thin man wore a rumpled suit and a tie that wasnt knotted properly his shoes were scuffed his nails ragged and not properly scrubbed his hair could use a trim it was as if he was playing the role of corporate exec but infinitely preferred to be in a dark room with his computer unlike cassel gillespie was nervous hands constantly in motion fiddling with three electronic devices on his belta blackberry a pda and an elaborate cell phone he avoided eye contactflirt was the last thing on his mind though like the sales director his wedding ring finger was bare maybe sterling preferred single men in positions of power at his company loyal princes rather than ambitious dukes sachss impression was that gillespie had heard less than cassel about their presence here and she snagged his attention when she described the crimes interesting okay interesting thats sleek hes pianoing data to commit crimes hes what gillespie flicked his fingers together with nervous energy i mean hes finding data collecting it no comment about the fact that people had been murdered was this an act the real killer might have feigned horror and sympathy sachs asked his whereabouts on sunday and he too had no alibi though he launched into a long story of code he was debugging at home and some roleplaying computer game he was competing in so thered be a record of when you were online yesterday a hesitation now oh i was just practicing you know i wasnt online i looked up and suddenly it was late youre so nod everything else kind of disappears nod he realized he was speaking a foreign language oh i mean like youre in a zone you get caught up in the game like the rest of your life dozes off he claimed not to know myra weinburg either and no one could have gotten access to his passcodes he assured her as for cracking my words good lucktheyre all sixteendigit random characters ive never written them down im lucky ive got a good memory gillespie was on his computer in the system all the time he added defensively i mean its my job though he frowned in confusion when asked about downloading individual dossiers theres like no point reading about everything john doe bought last week at his local grocery store helloive got better things to do he also admitted that he spent a lot of time in the data pens tuning the boxes her impression was that he liked it there found it comfortablethe same place that she couldnt escape from fast enough gillespie too was unable to recall where hed been at the times of the other killings she thanked him and he left pulling his pda off his belt before he was through the doorway and typing a message with his thumbs faster than sachs could use all her fingers as they waited for the next allaccess suspect to arrive sachs asked pulaski impressions okay i dont like cassel im with you there but he seems too obnoxious to be five twentytwo too yuppie you know if he could kill somebody with his ego then yeah in a minuteas for gillespie im not so sure he tried to seem surprised about myras death but im not sure he was and that attitude of hispianoing and nod you know what those are expressions from the street pianoing means looking for crack like your fingers are all over the place you know frantic and nod means being drugged out on smack or a tranquilizer its how kids from the burbs talk trying to sound cool when theyre scoring from dealers in harlem or the bronx you think hes into drugs well he seemed pretty twitchy but my impression i asked its not drugs hes addicted to its this the young officer gestured around him the data she thought about this and agreed the atmosphere in ssd was intoxicating though not in a pleasant way eerie and disorienting it was like being on painkillers another man appeared in the doorway he was the human resources director a young trim lightskinned african american peter arlonzokemper explained that he rarely went into the data pens but had permission to so that he could meet with employees at their job stations he did go online into innercircle from time to time on personnelrelated issuesbut only to review data on employees of ssd never the public so he had accessed closets despite what sterling had said about him the intense man pasted a smile on his face and answered in monotones frequently changing the subject the gist of his message being that sterlingalways andrew sachs had noticedwas the kindest most considerate boss anybody could ask for nobody would ever think about betraying him or the ideals of ssd whatever those might be he couldnt imagine a criminal within the hallowed halls of the company his admiration was tedious once she got him off the worship he explained that he had been with his wife all day on sunday making him the only married employee shed talked to and hed been cleaning out his recently deceased mothers house in the bronx on the date alice sanderson had been killed hed been alone but imagined he could find someone whod seen him arlonzokemper couldnt recall where hed been during the times of the other killings when they had finished the interviews the guard escorted sachs and pulaski back to sterlings outer office the ceo was meeting with a man about sterlings age solid and with combedover dark blond hair he sat slouching in one of the stiff wooden chairs he wasnt an ssd employee he wore a polo shirt and a sports jacket sterling looked up and saw sachs he ended the meeting and rose then escorted the man out sachs looked at what the visitor was holding a stack of papers with the name associated warehousing on top apparently the name of his company martin could you call a car for mr carpenter yes andrew were all together are we bob yes andrew carpenter towering over sterling somberly shook the ceos hand then turned and left a security guard led him down the hall the officers accompanied sterling back into his office what did you find he asked nothing conclusive some people have alibis some dont well keep pursuing the case and see if the evidence or witnesses lead us anywhere theres one thing i was wondering could i get a copy of a dossier arthur rhymes who hes one of the men on the listone that we think was wrongly arrested of course sterling sat at his desk touched his thumb to a reader beside the keyboard and typed for a few seconds he paused eyes on the screen then more keyboarding and a document began printing out he handed the thirty or so pages to herarthur rhymes closet well that was easy she noted then sachs nodded at the computer is there a record of you doing that a record oh no we dont log our internal downloads he looked over his notes again ill have martin pull the client list together it might take two or three hours as they walked into the outer office sean cassel stepped inside he wasnt smiling whats this about a list of clients andrew youre going to give that to them thats right sean why clients pulaski said we were thinking that somebody who works for an ssd client got information he used in the crimes the young man scoffed obviously thats what you think but why none of them has direct innercircle access they cant download closets pulaski explained they mightve bought mailing lists that had the information in them mailing lists do you know how many times a client would have to be in the system to assemble all the information youre talking about itd be a fulltime job think about it pulaski blushed and looked down well mark whitcomb of the compliance department was standing near martins desk sean he doesnt know how the business works well mark im thinking its more about logic really doesnt it seem each client would have to buy hundreds of mailing lists and there are probably three four hundred of them whove been in the closets of the sixteens theyre interested in sixteens sachs asked it means people he waved vaguely toward the narrow windows presumably suggesting humanity outside the gray rock it comes from the code we use more shorthand closets sixteens pianoingthere was something smug if not contemptuous about the expressions sterling said coolly we need to do everything we can to find the truth here cassel shook his head its not a client andrew nobody would dare use our data for a crime itd be suicide sean if ssds involved in this we have to know all right andrew whatever you think best sean cassel ignored pulaski gave a cold nonflirtatious smile to sachs and left sachs said to sterling well pick up that client list when we come back to interview the tech managers as the ceo gave instructions to martin sachs heard mark whitcomb whisper to pulaski dont pay any attention to cassel he and gillespietheyre the golden boys of this business young turks you know im a hindrance youre a hindrance not a problem the young officer said noncommittally though sachs could see he was grateful he has everything but confidence she thought whitcomb left and the two officers said goodbye to sterling then the ceo touched her arm gently theres something i want to say detective she turned to the man who stood with his arms at his side feet spread looking up at her with his intense green eyes it was impossible to look away from his focused mesmerizing gaze im not going to deny that im in the knowledge service provider field to make money but im also in it to improve our society think about what we do think about the kids whore going to get decent clothes and nice christmas presents for the first time because of the money their parents save thanks to ssd or about the young marrieds who can now find a bank thatll give them a mortgage for their first house because ssd can predict that in fact theyll be acceptable credit risks or the identity thieves thatre caught because our algorithms see a glitch in your credit card spending patterns or the rfid tags in a childs bracelet or wristwatch that tell the parents where they are every minute of the day the intelligent toilets that diagnose diabetes when you dont even know youre at risk and take your line of work detective say youre investigating a murder therere traces of cocaine on a knife the murder weapon our publicsure program can tell you who with a cocaine arrest in his background used a knife in the commission of a felony any time in the past twenty years in any geographic area you like and whether they were right or lefthanded and what their shoe sizes are before you even ask their fingerprints pop up on the screen along with their pictures and details of their mos distinguishing characteristics disguises theyve used in the past distinctive voice patterns and a dozen more attributes we can also tell you who bought that particular brand of knifeor maybe even that very knife and possibly we know where the purchaser was at the time of the crime and where he is now if the system cant find him it can tell you the percentage likelihood of his being at a known accomplices house and display their fingerprints and distinguishing characteristics and this whole bundle of data comes to you in a grand total of about twenty seconds our society needs help detective remember the broken windows well ssd is here to help he smiled thats the windup heres the pitch im asking that you be discreet in the investigation ill do whatever i canespecially if it seems this is somebody from ssd but if rumors get started about breaches here careless security our competitors and critics would jump on that and jump hard it could badly interfere with ssds job to fix as many windows as we can and make this world better are we in agreement amelia sachs suddenly felt bad about this duplicitous mission planting the seeds to encourage their perp to go after the trap without telling sterling she struggled to maintain eye contact as she said i think were in complete agreement wonderful now martin please show our guests out chapter twentytwo broken windows sachs was telling rhyme about the ssd logo i like that you do yeah think about it its a metaphor for what we do here we find the small bits of evidence and that leads us to the big answer sellitto nodded toward rodney szarnek sitting in the corner oblivious to everything but his computer and still whistling kid in the tshirts got the trap in place and hes trying to hack in now he called any luck officer hehthose folk know what theyre doing but ive got a dozen tricks up my sleeve sachs told them that the head of security didnt believe that anyone could hack into innercircle only makes the game sweeter szarnek said he finished another coffee and resumed the faint whistling sachs then told them about sterling the company and how the datamining process worked despite what thom had explained yesterday and despite their preliminary research rhyme hadnt realized how extensive the industry was he acting fishy sellitto said this sterling rhyme grunted at the to him pointless question no hes cooperative and good for us hes a true believer datas his god anything that jeopardizes his company he wants to root out sachs then described the tight security at ssd how very few people had access to all three data pens and how it was impossible to steal data even if you got inside theyve had one intrudera reporterwho was just after a story not even stealing trade secrets he did time and his career is over with vindictive hm sachs considered this no id say protective now as for employees i interviewed most of them who had access to peoples dossiers there are a few that werent accounted for yesterday afternoon oh and i asked if they log downloads they dont and well be getting a list of clients whove bought data about the vics and fall guys but the important thing is you let them know about an investigation and gave them all the name myra weinburg right then sachs took a document from her briefcase arthurs dossier she explained thought it might be helpful if nothing else you might be interested in it seeing what your cousins been up to sachs removed the staple and mounted it on the reading frame near rhymea device that turned pages for him he glanced at the document then back to the charts dont you want to look through it she asked maybe later she returned to her briefcase heres the list of ssd employees who have access to the dossierstheyre called closets as in secrets right pulaskis out checking their alibis we have to go back to talk to the two technical managers but heres what we have so far on a whiteboard she wrote their names and some comments andrew sterling president chief executive officer alibion long island to be verified sean cassel director of sales and marketing no alibi wayne gillespie director of technical operations no alibi samuel brockton director compliance department alibihotel records confirm presence in washington peter arlonzokemper director of human resources alibiwith wife to be verified steven shraeder technical service and support manager day shift to be interviewed faruk mameda technical service and support manager night shift to be interviewed client of ssd awaiting list from sterling mel rhyme called check ncic and the department cooper ran the names through the national crime information center and the nypd equivalent as well as the justice departments violent criminal apprehension program waitmay have a hit here what is it sachs asked moving forward arlonzo kemper juvie in pennsylvania assault twentyfive years ago the records still sealed the age would be right hes about thirtyfive and hes lightskinned sachs nodded at the profile chart well get the record unsealed or at least find out if its the same guy ill see what i can do cooper typed some more any references to the others rhyme nodded toward the suspect list nope just him cooper ran various state and federal database searches and checked some professional organizations the tech shrugged went to uchastings no connection with pennsylvania that i can find seems like a loner aside from college credentials his only organization is the national association of human resource professionals he was on the technology task force two years ago but hasnt done much since okay heres what they have on the juvie he attacked another kid in a detention home oh oh what its not him no hyphen the names different the juvenile was first name arlonzo last name kemper he glanced at the chart hes peter last name arlonzokemper i typed it in wrong if id included the hyphen it wouldnt have shown up at all sorry not the worst of sins rhyme shrugged this was a sobering lesson about the nature of data he reflected they seemingly had found a suspect and even coopers characterization of him suggested he might be the onehe seems to be a loneryet the lead was completely wrong due to the minuscule error of missing a single keystroke they might have come down hard on the manand misdirected resourcesif cooper hadnt realized his mistake sachs sat down beside rhyme who seeing her eyes asked what is it funny but now that im back i feel like some kind of spells been broken i think i want an outside opinion about ssd i lost perspective when i was there its a disorienting place how so sellitto asked you ever been to vegas sellitto and his ex had rhyme gave a brief laugh las vegas where the only question is how much disadvantage you have and why would i want to give money away sachs continued well it was like a casino the outside doesnt exist smallor nowindows no watercooler conversation nobody laughing everybodys completely focused on their jobs its like youre in a different world and you want somebody elses opinion on the place sellitto said right rhyme suggested journalist thoms partner peter hoddins was a former reporter for the new york times and was now writing nonfiction books about politics and society hed probably know people from the business desk who covered the datamining industry but she shook her head no somebody whos had firsthand contact with them a former employee maybe good lon can you call somebody at unemployment sure sellitto called the new york state unemployment department after ten minutes or so of bouncing around from office to office he found the name of a former ssd assistant technical director hed worked for the data miner for a number of years but had been fired a year and a half ago calvin geddes was his name and he was in manhattan sellitto got the details and handed the note to sachs she called geddes and arranged to see him in about an hour rhyme had no particular opinion about her mission in any investigation you need to cover all bases but leads like geddes and pulaskis checking on alibis were to rhyme like images seen in an opaque windows reflectionsuggestions of the truth but not the truth itself it was only the hard evidence scant though it was that held the real answer to who their killer was and so he turned back to the clues move arthur rhyme had given up being scared of the lats who were ignoring him anyway and he knew the big fuckyou black guy wasnt any threat it was the tattooed white guy who bothered him the tweakerwhat methheads were apparently calledscared arthur a lot mick was his name his hands twitched he scratched his welty skin and his eerie white eyes jumped like bubbles in boiling water he whispered to himself arthur had tried to avoid the man all yesterday and last night hed lain awake and in between bouts of depression spent a lot of time wishing mick away hoping that hed go to trial today and vanish from arthurs life forever but no such luck he was back this morning and seemed to be staying close he continued to glance at arthur you and me he once muttered sending a chill right down to arthurs tailbone even the lats didnt seem to want to hassle mick maybe you had to follow certain protocols in jail some unwritten rules of right and wrong people like this skinny tattooed druggie might not play by those rules and everybody here seemed to know it everbody know everthing round here cept you you don know shit once he laughed looked at arthur as if recognizing him and started to rise but then seemed to forget what hed intended and sat down again picking at his thumb yo jersey man a voice in his ear arthur jumped the big black guy had come up behind him he sat down next to arthur the bench creaked antwon antwon johnson should he make a fist and tap it dont be a fucking idiot he told himself and just nodded arthur i know johnson glanced at mick and said to arthur that tweaker fucked up dont do that meth shit fuck you up forever after a moment he said so you a brainy guy sort of the fuck sorta mean dont play games i have a physics degree and one in chemistry i went to mit mitt its a school good one pretty good so you know science shit chemistry and physics and everything this line of questioning wasnt at all like that of the two lats the ones whod tried to extort him it seemed like johnson was really interested some things yeah then the big guy asked so you know howta make bombs one big enough to blow that motherfucking wall down i heart thudding again harder than before well antwon johnson laughed fuckin wit you man i fuckin wit you oh arthur laughed and wondered if his heart would explode right at this moment or would wait till later he hadnt gotten all of his fathers genes but had the faulty cardiac messages been included in the package mick said something to himself and took an intense interest in his right elbow scratching it raw both johnson and arthur watched him tweaker johnson then said yo yo jersey man lemme ask you somethin sure my momma she religious you know what im saying and she tellin me one time the bible was right i mean all of it was exactly the way that shit was wrote okay but listen up im thinking wheres the dinosaurs in the bible god created man and woman and earth and rivers and donkeys and snakes an shit why dont it say god created dinosaurs i mean i seen their skeletons you know so they was real so whatsa fuckin truth man arthur rhyme looked at mick then at the nail pounded in the wall his palms were sweating and he was thinking that of all the things that could happen to him in jail he was going to get killed because he took a scientists moral stand against intelligent design oh what the fuck he said it would be against all the known laws of sciencelaws that have been acknowledged by every advanced civilization on earthfor the earth to be only six thousand years old it would be like you sprouting wings and flying out that window there the man frowned im dead johnson fixed him with an intense gaze then he nodded i fuckin knew it didnt make no sense at all six thousand years fuck i can give you the name of a book to read about it theres this author richard dawkins and he don wanna read no fuckin book take yo word fo it mr jersey man arthur really felt like tapping fists now but he refrained he asked whats your mother going to say when you tell her the round black face screwed up in astonishment i ain gonna tell her thatd be fucked up you never win no arguments gainst yo mother or your father arthur said to himself johnson then grew serious he said yo word up you dint do what they busted you fo of course not but you got yo ass collared anyway yep the fuck that happen i wish i knew ive been thinking about it since i got arrested its all i think about how he couldve done it whos he the real killer yo like in the fugitive or oj the police found all kinds of evidence linking me to the crime somehow the real killer knew everything about me my car where i lived my schedule he even knew things i boughtand he planted them as evidence im sure thats what happened antwon johnson considered this and then laughed man that yo fucking problem whats that you went out an you bought everthing shoulda just boosted it man then nobody know shit what you about chapter twentythree another lobby but a lot different from ssds amelia sachs had never seen anything quite so messy maybe when she was a beat officer responding to domestics among druggies in hells kitchen but even then a lot of those people had had dignity they made the effort this place made her cringe the notforprofit organization privacy now located in an old piano factory in the citys chelsea district won the prize for slovenly stacks of computer printouts booksmany of them law books and yellowing government regulationsnewspapers and magazines then cardboard boxes which contained more of the same phonebooks too federal registers and dust a ton of dust a receptionist in blue jeans and a shabby sweater pounded furiously on an old computer keyboard and spoke sotto voce into a handsfree telephone harried people in jeans and tshirts or corduroys and wrinkled work shirts walked into the office from up the hall swapped files or picked up phonemessage slips and disappeared cheap printed signs and posters filled the walls bookstores burn your customers receipts before the government burns their books on one wrinkled rectangle of art board was the famous line from george orwells novel about a totalitarian society big brother is watching you and sitting prominently on the scabby wall across from sachs guerrillas guide to the privacy war never give out your social security number never give out your phone number hold loyalty card swap parties before you go shopping never volunteer for surveys opt out every chance you can dont fill out product registration cards dont fill out warranty cards you dont need one for the warranty theyre information gathering devices rememberthe nazis most dangerous weapon was information stay off the grid as much as possible she was digesting this when a scuffed door opened and a short intenselooking man with pale skin strode up to her shook her hand and then led her back into his office which was even messier than the lobby calvin geddes the former employee of ssd now worked for this privacy rights organization i went over to the dark side he said smiling hed abandoned the conservative ssd dress code and was wearing a yellow buttondown shirt without a tie jeans and running shoes the pleasant grin faded quickly though as she told him the story of the murders yep he whispered his eyes hard and focused now i knew something like this would happen i absolutely knew it geddes explained that he had a technical background and had worked with sterlings first company ssds predecessor in silicon valley writing code for them he moved to new york and lived a nice life as ssd skyrocketed to success but then the experience had soured we had problems we didnt encrypt data back then and were responsible for some serious identity thefts several people committed suicide and a couple of times stalkers signed up as clientsbut only to get information from innercircle two of the women they were looking for were attacked one almost died then some parents in custody battles used our data to find their exes and kidnapped the children it was tough i felt like the guy who helped invent the atom bomb and then regretted it i tried to put more controls in place at the company and that meant that i didnt believe in the quote ssd vision according to my boss sterling ultimately yes but he didnt actually fire me andrew never gets his hands dirty he delegates the unpleasantries that way he can appear to be the most wonderful kindest boss in the world and as a practical matter theres less evidence against him if other people do his butchery well when i left i joined privacy now the organization was like epic the electronic privacy information center he explained pn challenged threats to individuals privacy from the government businesses and financial institutions computer providers telephone companies and commercial data brokers and miners the organization lobbied in washington sued the government under the freedom of information act to find out about surveillance programs and sued individual corporations that werent complying with privacy and disclosure laws sachs didnt tell him about the data trap rodney szarnek had put together but explained in general terms how they were looking for ssd customers and employees who might be able to patch together dossiers the security seems very tight but that was what sterling and his people told us i wanted an outside opinion happy to help mark whitcomb told us about the concrete firewalls and keeping the data divided up whos whitcomb hes with their compliance department never heard of it its new sachs explained the department is like a consumer advocate within the company to make sure all government regulations are complied with geddes seemed pleased though he added that didnt come about out of the goodness of andrew sterlings heart they probably got sued once too often and wanted to make a good show for the public and congress sterlings never going to give one inch if he doesnt have to but about the data pens thats true sterling treats data like the holy grail and hacking in probably impossible and there is no way anybody could physically break in and steal data he told me that very few employees can log on and get dossiers from innercircle as far as you know is that true oh yeah a few of them have to have access but nobody else i never did and i was there from the beginning do you have any thoughts maybe any employees with a troubling past violent its been a few years and i never thought anybody was particularly dangerous though ive got to say despite the big happy family façade sterling likes to put on i never really got to know anyone there what about these individuals she showed him the list of suspects geddes looked it over i worked with gillespie i knew cassel i dont like either of them theyre caught up in the whole datamining curve like silicon valley in the nineties hotshots i dont know the others sorry then he studied her closely so youve been there he asked with a cool smile whatd you think of andrew her thoughts jammed as she tried to come up with a brief summary of her impressions finally determined polite inquisitive smart but her voice petered out but you dont really know him right because he presents the great stone face in all the years i worked with him i never really knew him nobody knows him unfathomable i love that word thats andrew i was always looking for clues you notice something odd about his bookshelves you couldnt see the spines of the books exactly i snuck a peek once guess what they werent about computers or privacy or data or business they were mostly history books philosophy politics the roman empire chinese emperors franklin roosevelt john kennedy stalin idi amin khrushchev he read a lot about the nazis nobody used information the way they did and andrew doesnt hesitate to tell you first major use of computers to keep track of ethnic groups thats how they consolidated power sterlings doing the same in the corporate world notice the company name ssd the rumor is he chose it intentionally ssfor the nazi elite army sdfor their security and intelligence agency you know what his competitors say it stands for selling souls for dollars geddes laughed grimly oh dont get me wrong andrew doesnt dislike jews or any other group politics nationality religion and race mean nothing to him i heard him say once data have no borders the seat of power in the twentyfirst century is information not oil or geography and andrew sterling wants to be the most powerful man on earth im sure he gave you the dataminingisgod speech saving us from diabetes helping us afford christmas presents and houses and solving cases for the police thats the one and all of its true but tell me if those benefits are worth somebody knowing every detail about your life maybe you dont care provided you save a few bucks but do you really want consumerchoice lasers scanning your eyes in a movie theater and recording your reactions to those commercials they run before the movie do you want the rfid tag in your car key to be available to the police to know that you hit a hundred miles an hour last week when your route only took you along roads that were posted fifty do you want strangers knowing what kind of underwear your daughter wears or exactly when youre having sex what well innercircle knows you bought condoms and ky this afternoon and your husband was on the sixfifteen e train home it knows youve got the evening free because your sons at the mets game and your daughters buying clothes at the gap in the village it knows you put on cabletv porn at seveneighteen and that you order some nice tasty postcoital takeout chinese at quarter to ten that information is all there oh ssd knows if your children are maladjusted in school and when to send you directmail flyers about tutors and childcounseling services if your husband is having trouble in the bedroom and when to send him discreet flyers about erectile dysfunction cures when your family history buying patterns and absences from work put you in a presuicidal profile but thats good so a counselor can help you geddes gave a cold laugh wrong because counseling potential suicide victims isnt profitable ssd sends the name to local funeral homes and grief counselorswho could snag all of the family as customers not just a single depressed person after he shoots himself and by the way that was a very lucrative venture sachs was shocked did you hear about tethering no ssd has defined a network based just on you call it detective sachs world youre the hub and the spokes go to your partners spouses parents neighbors coworkers anybody it might help ssd to know about and profit from that knowledge everybody who has any connection is tethered to you and each one of them is his or her own hub and there are dozens of people tethered to them another thought and his eyes flashed you know about metadata whats that data about data every document thats created by or stored on a computerletters files reports legal briefs spreadsheets websites emails grocery listsis loaded with hidden data who created it where its been sent all the changes that have been made to it and who made them and whenall recorded there second by second you write a memo to your boss and for a joke you start out with dear stupid prick then delete it and write it correctly well the stupid prick part is still in there seriously oh yes the disk size of a typical wordprocessing report is much larger than the text in the document itself whats the rest metadata the watchtower databasemanagement program has special botssoftware robotsthat do nothing but find and store metadata from every document it collects we called it the shadow department because metadatas like a shadow of the main dataand its usually much more revealing shadow sixteens pens closetsthis was a whole new world to amelia sachs geddes enjoyed having a receptive audience he leaned forward you know that ssd has an education division she thought back to the chart in the brochure that mel cooper had downloaded yes eduserve but sterling didnt tell you about it did he no because he doesnt like to let on that its main function is to collect everything it possibly can about children starting with kindergarten what they buy what they watch what computer sites they go to what their grades are medical records from schooland thats very very valuable information for retailers but you ask me whats scarier about eduserve is that school boards can come to ssd and run predictive software on their students and then gear educational programs to themin terms of whats best for the communityor society if you want to be orwellian about it given billys background we think he should go into skilled labor suzy should be a doctor but only in public health control the children and you control the future another element of adolf hitlers philosophy by the way he laughed okay no more lecturingbut you see why i couldnt stomach it anymore but then geddes frowned just thinking about your situationwe had an incident once at ssd years ago before the company came to new york there was a death probably just a coincidence but no tell me in the early days we farmed out a lot of the actual datacollection part of the business to scroungers to what companies or individuals who procure data a strange breed theyre sort of like oldtime wildcattersprospectors you could say see data have this weird allure you can get addicted to the hunt you can never find enough however much they collect they want more and these guys are always looking for new ways to collect it theyre competitive ruthless thats how sean cassel started in the business he was a data scrounger anyway one scrounger was amazing he worked for a small company i think it was called rocky mountain data in colorado what was his name geddes squinted maybe gordon somebody or that mightve been his last name anyway we heard that he wasnt too happy about ssd taking over his company the word is he scrounged everything he could find about the company and sterling himselfturned the tables on them we thought maybe he was trying to dig up dirt and blackmail sterling into stopping the acquisition you know andy sterlingandrew juniorworks for the company she nodded wed heard rumors that sterling had abandoned him years ago and the kid tracked him down but then we also heard that maybe it was another son he abandoned maybe by his first wife or a girlfriend something he wanted to keep secret we thought maybe gordon was looking for that kind of dirt anyway while sterling and some other people were out there negotiating the purchase of rocky mountain this gordon guy diesan accident of some kind i think thats all i heard i wasnt there i was back in the valley writing code and the acquisition went through yep what andrew wants andrew shall have now let me throw out one thought about your killer andrew sterling himself he has an alibi does he well dont forget he is the king of information if you control data you can change data did you check out that alibi real carefully we are right now well even if its confirmed he has men who work for him and would do whatever he wants i mean anything remember other people do his dirty work but hes a multimillionaire whats his interest in stealing coins or a painting then murdering the victim his interest geddess voice rose as if he were a professor talking to a student who just wasnt getting the lesson his interest is in being the most powerful person in the world he wants his little collection to include everybody on earth and hes particularly interested in law enforcement and government clients the more crimes that are successfully solved using innercircle the more police departments here and abroad are going to sign on hitlers first task when he came to power was to consolidate all the police departments in germany what was our big problem in iraq we disbanded the army and the policewe should have used them andrew doesnt make mistakes like that geddes laughed think im a crank dont you but i live with this stuff all day long remember its not paranoia if somebodys really out there watching everything you do every minute of the day and thats ssd in a nutshell chapter twentyfour awaiting sachss return lincoln rhyme listened absently as lon sellitto explained that none of the other evidence in the earlier casesthe rape and coin theftcould be located thats fucking weird rhyme agreed but his attention veered from the detectives sour assessment to his cousins ssd dossier sitting beside him on the turning frame he tried to ignore it but the document drew him needle to magnet looking at the stark sheets black type on white paper he told himself that as sachs had suggested perhaps something helpful could be found in it then he admitted that he was simply curious strategic systems datacorp inc innercircledossiers arthur robert rhyme ssd subject number lifestyle dossier a consumer products

the use hereof is subject to the licensing agreement between ssd and customer as defined in the master client agreement strategic systems datacorp inc all rights reserved instructing the turning frame to flip through the pages he skimmed the dense document all thirty pages of it some categories were full some sparse the voter registration was redacted and the compliance and portions of the credit history referred to separate files presumably because of legislation limiting access to such information he paused at the extensive lists of the consumer products bought by arthur and his family they were described by the creepy phrase tethered individuals there was no doubt that anybody reading the dossier could have learned enough about his buying habits and where he shopped to implicate him in the murder of alice sanderson rhyme learned about the country club arthur belonged to until he had quit several years ago presumably because hed lost his job he noted the package vacations hed bought rhyme was surprised hed taken up skiing also he or one of the children might have a weight problem somebody had joined a dieting program a health club membership for the entire family too rhyme saw a layaway purchase for some jewelry around christmastime a chain jewelry store in a new jersey mall rhyme speculated small stones socketed in a large settinga makedo gift until times were better seeing one reference he gave a laugh like him arthur seemed to favor singlemalt whiskyrhymes new favorite brand in fact glenmorangie his cars were a prius and a cherokee the criminalists smile faded at that reference though as he recalled another vehicle he was picturing arthurs red corvette the car hed received from his parents on his seventeenth birthdaythe car in which arthur had driven off to boston to attend mit rhyme thought back to the boys respective departures for college it was a significant moment for arthur and for his father too henry rhyme was ecstatic that his son had been accepted by such a fine school but the cousins plansrooming together jousting over girls outshining the other nerdsdidnt work out lincoln wasnt accepted by mit but went instead to the university of illinoischampagneurbana which offered lincoln a full scholarship and had some panache back then because it was located in the town where hal the narcissistic computer in stanley kubricks a space odyssey was born teddy and anne were pleased their son was going to a homestate school as was his uncle henry had told his nephew that he hoped the boy would return to chicago often and continue to help him with his research possibly even assist in his classes from time to time sorry you and arthur wont be rooming together henry said but youll see each other summers holidays and im sure your father and i can swing some trips out to bean town for a visit that might work out lincoln had said keeping to himself that while he was devastated he hadnt been accepted by mit there was an upside to the rejectionbecause he wanted never to see his goddamn cousin ever again all because of the red corvette the incident had occurred not long after the christmas eve party at which hed won the concrete piece of history on a breathlessly cold day in february which sun or cloud is chicagos most heartless month lincoln was competing in a science fair at northwestern in evanston he asked adrianna if she wanted to accompany him thinking that he might go for the marriage proposal afterward but she couldnt make it she was going shopping with her mother at marshall fields department store in the loop lured by a big sale lincoln had been disappointed but thought nothing more of it and concentrated on the fair he won first place in the senior division then he and his friends packed up their projects and carted everything outside fingers blue and breath clouding around them in the painful air they loaded the gear in the belly of the bus and sprinted for the door it was then that somebody called hey check it out excellent wheels a red corvette was streaking through campus his cousin arthur was at the wheel which wasnt odd the family lived nearby what did surprise lincoln though was that the girl beside arthur he believed was adrianna yes no he couldnt be sure the clothes matched a brown leather jacket and a fur hat which looked identical to the one lincoln had given her at christmas linc jesus get your ass in here we gotta close the door still lincoln remained where he was staring at the car as it fishtailed around the corner on the graywhite street could she have lied to him the girl he was considering marrying it didnt seem possible and cheating on him with arthur trained in science he examined the facts objectively fact one arthur and adrianna knew each other his cousin had met her months ago in the counselors office where she worked after class at lincolns high school they could very easily have exchanged phone numbers fact two arthur lincoln now realized had stopped asking about her this was odd the boys had spent plenty of time talking about girls but recently art hadnt once mentioned her suspicious fact three on reflection he decided that adie sounded evasive when shed demurred about the science fair and he hadnt mentioned its site as evanston which meant she wouldnt hesitate to cruise around the gridded streets with art lincoln was slammed with jealousy i was going to give her a piece of stagg field for gods sake a splinter of the true cross of modern science he considered other times when shed begged off seeing him under circumstances that in retrospect seemed strange he counted three or four still he refused to believe it he crunched through the snow to a pay phone and called her house and asked to speak to the girl sorry lincoln shes out with friends said adriannas mother friends oh ill try her later say mrs waleska did you two ever get downtown for that sale at fields today no the sales next week i have to get supper ready lincoln you stay warm its freezing outside it sure is lincoln knew this for a fact he was standing at a phone kiosk his jaw shivering no desire to pick up the cents that had leapt from his quivering hands into the snow after hed tried repeatedly to feed the coins into the phone jesus christ lincoln get in the bus later that night he called and managed to maintain a normal conversation for a time before asking how her day had gone she explained that shed enjoyed the shopping with mom but the crowds were terrible garrulous rambling digressive she sounded dead guilty still he couldnt take the matter on faith and so he kept up appearances the next time art was visiting he left his cousin in the rec room downstairs and slipped outside with a dog hair rollerexactly the sort used now by crimescene teamsand collected evidence from the corvettes front seat he slipped the tape into a baggie and when he saw adrianna next he took some samples of fur from her hat and coat he felt cheap scalded with shame and embarrassment but that didnt stop him from comparing the strands with one of the high schools compound microscopes they were the sameboth fur from the hat and synthetic fibers from the coat the girlfriend he was considering marrying had been cheating on him and from the quantity of fibers in arthurs car he concluded shed been there more than once finally a week later he spotted them in the car leaving no doubt lincoln didnt bow out graciously or angrily he just bowed out without the heart for a confrontation he let his relationship with adrianna wind down the few times they went out were stiff and riddled with awkward silences to his further dismay she actually seemed upset about his growing distance damn it did she think she could have it both ways she seemed mad at himeven while she was cheating he distanced himself from his cousin too lincolns excuse was final exams track meets andthe blessing in disguise lincolns rejection by mit the two boys saw each other occasionallyfamilial obligations graduation ceremoniesbut everything had changed between them changed fundamentally and of adrianna neither boy had said a single word at least not for many years after that my whole life changed if it werent for you everything wouldve been different even now rhyme found his temple throbbing he couldnt feel any coolness on his palms but he supposed they were sweating these hard thoughts though were interrupted by amelia sachs striding through the door any developments she asked a bad sign if shed had a breakthrough with calvin geddes she would have said so up front no he admitted still waiting to hear from ron about the alibis and no bites on the trap that rodney put together sachs took the coffee thom offered and lifted half a turkey sandwich from a tray the tuna salads better said lon sellitto he made it himself thisll do she sat beside rhyme offered him a bite he had no appetite and shook his head hows your cousin doing she asked glancing at the open dossier on the turning frame my cousin hows he doing in detention this has to be hard for him havent had a chance to talk to him hes probably too embarrassed to contact you you really should call i will whatd you find out from geddes she admitted that the meeting had yielded no great revelations mostly it was a lecture on the erosion of privacy she gave him some of the more alarming bullet points the personal data collected daily the intrusions the danger of eduserve the immortality of data the metadata records of computer files anything useful to us he asked acerbically two things first hes not convinced sterlings innocent you said hes got an alibi sellitto pointed out taking another sandwich maybe not him personally he might be using somebody else why hes a ceo of a big company whats in it for him the more crime the more society needs ssd to protect them geddes says he wants power described him as the napoléon of data so hes got a hired gun breaking windows so he can step in and fix them rhyme nodded somewhat impressed with the idea only it backfired he never thought wed tip to the fact the ssd database was behind the crimes okay put it on the list of suspects an unsub working for sterling now geddes also told me that a few years ago ssd acquired a colorado data company their main scroungerthats a data collectorwas killed any link between sterling and the death no idea but its worth checking out ill make some calls the doorbell rang and thom answered ron pulaski entered he was grimfaced and sweaty rhyme sometimes had an urge to tell him to take it easier but since the criminalist himself didnt he figured the suggestion would be hypocritical the rookie explained that most of the alibis for sunday checked out i checked with the ezpass people and they confirmed sterling went through the midtown tunnel when he said i tried his son to see if his dad called from long island just to doublecheck but he was out pulaski continued something elsethe human resources director his only alibi was his wife she backed him up but she was acting like a scared mouse and she was like her husband ssd is the greatest place in the world blah blah blah rhyme distrustful of witnesses in any event didnt make much of this one thing hed learned from kathryn dance the body language and kinesics expert with the california bureau of investigation was that even when people are telling the gods truth to police they often look guilty sachs went to their suspect list and updated it andrew sterling president chief executive officer alibion long island verified awaiting sons confirmation sean cassel director of sales and marketing no alibi wayne gillespie director of technical operations no alibi samuel brockton director compliance department alibihotel records confirm presence in washington peter arlonzokemper director of human resources alibiwith wife verified by her biased steven shraeder technical service and support manager day shift to be interviewed faruk mameda technical service and support manager night shift to be interviewed client of ssd awaiting list from sterling unsub recruited by andrew sterling sachs looked at her watch ron mameda should be in by now could you go back and talk to him and shraeder see where they were yesterday at the time of the weinburg murder and sterlings assistant should have the client list ready if not perch in his office until he gets it look important better yet look impatient go back to ssd right for some reason he didnt want to rhyme could see sure just let me call jenny and check up on things at home he pulled out his phone and hit speed dial rhyme deduced from part of the conversation that he was talking to his young son and then sounding even more childish presumably the baby girl the criminalist tuned it out it was then that his own phone rang was the first number on caller id ah good command answer phone detective rhyme inspector longhurst i know youre working on that other case of yours but i thought you might like an update of course please go ahead hows the reverend goodlight hes fine if a bit scared hes insisting that no new security people or officers come into the safe house he only trusts the ones whove been with him for weeks hardly blame him i have a man screening everyone who gets close former sas chap theyre the best in the business now we went through the oldham safe house from top to bottom wanted to share with you what we found traces of copper and lead consistent with bullets that had been milled or shaved a few grains of gunpowder and a few very small traces of mercury my ballistics expert says he might be making a dumdum bullet yes thats right liquid mercurys poured into the core causes hideous damage they also found some grease used in lubricating the receivers of rifles and there were traces of hair bleach in the sink and several dark gray fiberscotton quite thick with laundry starch our databases suggest they match the fabric in uniforms do you think that the evidence was planted our forensics people say not the traces were quite minuscule blond sniper uniform now one other incident set off alarms here an attempted breakin at an ngo near piccadillythats a nongovernmental organization a nonprofit the office was the east african relief agency reverend goodlights outfit guards came by and the culprit fled he threw away his lock pick down the sewer but we had a stroke of luck fellow on the street saw where well to summarize our people found it and discovered some soil on the tool it contained a type of hop thats grown exclusively in warwickshire this hop had been processed for use in making bitter bitter like beer ale yes now it so happens that we have a database of alcoholic drinks here at the met and their ingredients just like mine he reflected you do put that together myself she said excellent and the only brewery that uses this hop is near birmingham now we got an image of the ngo intruder on cctv and because of the hop i thought id check the birmingham cctv tapes indeed the same man arrived at new street station several hours later getting off the train with a large rucksack we lost him in the crowds im afraid rhyme considered this the big question was were the hops planted on the tool to lead them off that was the sort of thing that he could only get a feel for if he had examined the scene himself or had possession of the evidence but now it was just down to what sachs called a gut feel planted or not rhyme decided inspector i dont believe it i think logans pulling a double reversal hes done this before he wants us focused on birmingham while he goes ahead with the hit in london im glad you say that detective i was leaning that way myself we should play along where is everyone on the team danny kruegers in london with his people sos your fbi man the french agent and the interpol chap were checking out leads in oxford and surrey they didnt play out though id get them all to birmingham immediately in a subtle but obvious way the inspector laughed making sure logan thinks weve swallowed the bait exactly i want him to think we believe we have a chance to catch him there and send some tactical people too make a noise about it make it look as if youre pulling them back from the shooting zone in london but in fact beef up the surveillance there right and tell them hes going for the long shot hell be blond and dressed in a gray uniform brilliant detective ill get right to it keep me posted cheers rhyme ordered the phone to disconnect just as a voice from across the room intruded heh the long and the short of it is your friends at ssd are good i cant get to first base hacking in it was rodney szarnek rhyme had forgotten about him he rose and joined the officers innercircles tighter than fort knox and so is their database management system watchtower i really doubt somebody could break in without a massive array of supercomputers which you just arent going to find at best buy or radioshack but rhyme could see that his face was troubled well ssds got some security on the system ive never seen before its pretty robust and ive got to say scary i had an anonymous id and was wiping my tracks as i went but what happens their security bot broke into my system and tried to identify me from what it found in the free space and rodney what exactly does that mean rhyme was trying to be patient free space he explained that fragments of data even deleted data could be found in the empty space of hard drives software could often reassemble it into readable form the ssd security system knew that szarnek had covered his tracks so it had slipped inside his computer to read the data in the empty space and find out who he was its pretty freaky i just happened to catch it otherwise he shrugged and took comfort in his coffee rhyme had a thought the more he considered the idea the more he liked it he looked over at the skinny szarnek hey rodney howd you like to play real cop for a change the carefreegeek visage disappeared you know i dont really think im up for that sellitto finished chewing the last of his sandwich you havent lived till a bullet breaks the sound barrier right next to your ear wait wait waitthe only time i do any shooting is roleplaying games and oh you wouldnt be the one at risk rhyme said to the computer man as his amused gaze slipped to ron pulaski who was closing his phone what the rookie asked with a frown chapter twentyfive anything else you need officer sitting in the ssd conference room ron pulaski looked up into the emotionless face of sterlings second assistant jeremy mills he was the outside assistant the young officer recalled no im fine thanks but i wonder if you could check with mr sterling about some files he was getting together for us a list of clients i think martin was handling it id be happy to bring it up with andrew when hes out of his meeting then the broadshouldered man walked around the room pointing out the airconditioning and light switches like the bellboy whod escorted jenny and pulaski to their fancy room on their honeymoon which reminded pulaski again of how jenny resembled myra the woman whod been raped and killed yesterday the way her hair lay the slightly crooked smile he loved the officer pulaski glanced up realized his mind had been wandering sorry the assistant was studying him as he pointed out a small refrigerator soda and water in here thanks im all set pay attention he told himself angrily forget jenny forget the children peoples lives are at stake here amelia thinks you can handle these interviews so handle them you with us rookie i need you with us if you want to make a call you can use this one dial nine for an outside line or you can just push this button then speak the number its voice activated he pointed at pulaskis cell phone that probably wont work too well here lot of shielding you know for security really okay pulaski thought back hadnt he seen somebody using a phone or blackberry here earlier he couldnt recall ill have those employees come in if youre ready thatd be great the young man headed down the hall pulaski took his notebook out of his briefcase glanced at the names of the employees he had yet to interview steven shraeder technical service and support manager day shift faruk mameda technical service and support manager night shift he rose and peered into the hall nearby a janitor was emptying trash cans he recalled hed seen him yesterday doing the same it was as if sterling was afraid that any brimming garbage would give the company a bad name the solid man glanced at pulaskis uniform without reaction and returned to his task which he performed methodically looking farther down the immaculate corridor the young cop could see a security guard standing at attention pulaski couldnt even get to the restroom without passing him he returned to his seat to await the two men on the suspect list faruk mameda was first a young man of middle eastern ancestry pulaski judged he was very handsome solemnfaced and confident he held pulaskis eye easily the young man explained that hed been with a small company ssd had acquired five or six years ago his job was to supervise the technicalservice staff single with no family he preferred working nights the cop was surprised that he didnt have a trace of foreign accent pulaski asked if mameda had heard about the investigation he claimed he hadnt heard the detailswhich could have been true since he worked the night shift and had just gotten to work all he knew was that andrew sterling had called and told him to speak to the police about a crime that had occurred he frowned as the police officer explained thereve been several murders recently we think information from ssd was used in planning the crimes information about the victims whereabouts some items theyd bought curiously mamedas next question was are you talking to all the employees how much to tell how much not to that was one thing pulaski never knew amelia always said it was important to grease the interview wheel to keep the conversation going but never to give too much away after the head injury he believed his judgment had worsened and was nervous about what to say to wits and suspects not all of them no just certain ones whore suspicious or youve decided ahead of time are suspicious the employees voice was defensive now his jaw tight i see sure happens a lot nowadays the person were interested in is a man and he has full access to innercircle and watchtower were talking to everyone who fits that description pulaski had figured out mamedas concern nothing to do with your nationality the attempt at reassurance missed the mark mameda snapped ah well my nationality is american im a us citizen like you that is i assume youre a citizen but maybe not after all very few people in this country were here originally im sorry mameda shrugged some things in life you have to get used to its unfortunate the land of the free is also the land of the prejudiced i his voice faded as he glanced past and above pulaski as if someone were standing behind him the cop turned slightly no one was there mameda said andrew said he wants full cooperation so im cooperating could you ask me what you need to please its a busy evening peoples dossiersclosets you call them yes closets do you ever download them why would i download a dossier andrew wouldnt tolerate that interesting the wrath of andrew sterling was the first deterrent not the police or the courts so you havent never if theres a bug of some sort or the data are corrupt or theres an interface problem i may look at a portion of the entries or the headers but thats it only enough to figure out the problem and write a patch or debug the code could somebody have found your passcodes and gotten into innercircle and downloaded dossiers that way he paused not from me they couldnt i dont have them written down and you go to the data pens frequently all of them and intake too yes of course thats my job repair the computers make sure the data are flowing smoothly could you tell me where you were on sunday afternoon between twelve and four ah a nod so thats what this is really about was i at the scene of the crime pulaski had trouble looking at the mans dark angry eyes mameda put his hands flat on the table as if he were going to rise in anger and storm out but he sat back and said i had breakfast in the morning with some friends he added theyre from the mosqueyoull probably want to know i after that i spent the rest of the day alone i went to the movies by yourself fewer distractions i usually go alone it was a film by jafar panahithe iranian director have you ever see his mouth tightened never mind you have the ticket stub noafter that i did some shopping i got home at six id guess checked to see if they needed me here but the boxes were running smoothly so i had dinner with a friend in the afternoon did you buy anything with a credit card he bristled it was windowshopping i got some coffee a sandwich paid cash for it he leaned forward whispered harshly i dont really think you asked everybody all these questions i know what you think of us you think we treat women like animals i cant believe youd actually accuse me of raping someone thats barbaric and youre insulting pulaski struggled to look mameda in the eye as he said well sir we are asking everybody with access to innercircle about their whereabouts yesterday including mr sterling were just doing our job he calmed slightly but continued to fume when pulaski asked his whereabouts at the times of the other killings i dont have any idea he refused to say any more and with a grim nod stood and walked out pulaski tried to figure out what had just happened was mameda acting guilty or innocent he couldnt tell mostly he felt outmaneuvered think harder he told himself the second employee to be interviewed shraeder was the opposite of mameda pure geek he was gawky the clothes illfitting and wrinkled ink stains on his hands his glasses were owlish and the lenses smeared definitely not in the ssd mold while mameda was defensive shraeder seemed oblivious he apologized for being latewhich he wasntand explained that hed been in the middle of debugging a patch he then embarked on the details speaking as if the cop had a degree in computer science and pulaski had to steer him back on track his fingers twitching as if he were typing on an imaginary keyboard shraeder listened in surpriseor feigned surprisewhen pulaski told him about the murders he expressed sympathy and then in answer to the young officers questions said he was in the pens frequently and could download dossiers though he never did he too expressed confidence that nobody could get access to his passcodes as for sunday he had an alibihed come into the office around pm to follow up after a big problem on friday which he again tried to explain to pulaski before the cop cut him off the young man walked to the computer in the corner of the conference room typed and then swiveled the screen for pulaski to see it was his time sheets pulaski looked over the entries for sunday he had indeed clocked in at pm and didnt leave until after five since shraeder had been here at the time myra was killed pulaski didnt bother to ask about the other crimes i think thatll be all thanks the man left and pulaski sat back staring out a narrow window his palms were sweating his stomach in a knot he pulled his cell phone off its holster jeremy the sullen assistant was right no damn reception hi there pulaski jumped gasping he looked up to see mark whitcomb in the doorway several yellow pads under his arm and two cups of coffee in his hands he lifted an eyebrow beside him was a slightly older man with prematurely saltandpepper hair pulaski figured this had to be an ssd employeesince he was in the uniform of white dress shirt and dark suit what was this about he struggled to put a casual smile on his face and nodded them in ron wanted you to meet my boss sam brockton they shook hands brockton looked pulaski over carefully and said with a wry smile so you were the one who had the maids checking up on me down at the watergate hotel in dc afraid so at least im off the hook as a suspect brockton said if theres anything we can do in the compliance department let mark know hes brought me up to speed on your case appreciate that good luck brockton left whitcomb who offered pulaski a coffee for me thanks hows it going whitcomb asked its going the ssd executive laughed and dusted a flop of blond hair off his forehead you folksre as evasive as we are i guess we are but i can say everybodys been cooperative good you finished just waiting for something from mr sterling he poured sugar into the coffee he overstirred nervously then stopped himself whitcomb lifted his cup to pulaskis as if toasting he looked out at the clear day the sky blue the city rich green and brown never liked these small windows middle of new york and no views i was wondering why is that andrews worried about security people taking pictures from outside really its not entirely paranoid whitcomb said lot of money involved in data mining huge i suppose pulaski wondered what kind of secrets somebody could see through a window from four or five blocks away the closest office building this high you live in the city he asked pulaski yep were in queens im out on the island now but i grew up in astoria off ditmars boulevard near the train station hey im three blocks from there really you go to st tims st agnes ive been to tims a few times but jenny didnt like the sermons they guilt you too much there whitcomb laughed father albright ooooo yeah hes the one my brotherhes a cop in phillyhe decided that all you had to do if you wanted a murderer to confess is to put him in a room with father albright five minutes and hell confess to anything your brothers a cop pulaski asked laughing narcotics task force detective yeah pulaski said my brothers in patrol sixth precinct down in the village thats too funny both our brothersso you went in together yeah weve kind of done everything together were twins interesting my brothers three years older hes a lot bigger than i am i might be able to pass the physical but i wouldnt want to have to tackle a mugger we dont do much tackling its mostly reasoning with the bad guys probably what you do in the compliance department whitcomb laughed yeah pretty much i guess that hey look who it is sergeant friday pulaskis gut thudded as he looked up to see slick handsome sean cassel and his sidekick the toohip technical director wayne gillespie who joined the act by saying back to get more facts maam just the facts he gave a salute since hed been talking to whitcomb about church the moment took pulaski right back to the catholic high school where he and his brother had been continually at war with the boys from forest hills richer better clothes smarter and fast with the cruel snipes hey its the mutant brothers a nightmare pulaski sometimes wondered if hed gone into police work simply for the respect a uniform and gun would bring him whitcombs lips tightened hey mark gillespie said hows it going sergeant cassel asked the officer pulaski had been glared at on the street been sworn at dodged spit and bricks and sometimes hadnt dodged so well none of those incidents had upset him as much as the sly words slung around like this smiling and playful but playful the way a shark teases its meal before he devours it pulaski had looked up sergeant friday on google on his blackberry and learned this was a character from an old tv show called dragnet even though friday was the hero he was considered a square which apparently meant a straight arrow somebody extremely uncool pulaskis ears had burned as he read the information on the tiny screen realizing only then that cassel had been insulting him here you go cassel handed pulaski a cd in a jewel box hope it helps sarge whats this the list of clients whove downloaded information about your victims you wanted it remember oh i was expecting mr sterling well andrews a busy man he asked me to deliver it well thanks gillespie said youve got your work cut out for you over three hundred clients in the area and none of them got less than two hundred mailing lists thats what i was telling you cassel said youre gonna be burning the midnight oil so do we get junior gman badges sergeant friday was often mocked by the people he interviewed pulaski was grinning though he didnt want to come on guys chill whitcomb cassel said were joking around jesus dont be so uptight whatre you doing down here mark gillespie asked shouldnt you be looking for more laws were breaking whitcomb rolled his eyes and gave a sour grin though pulaski saw he too was embarrassedand hurt the officer said you mind if i look it over here in case i have some questions you go right ahead cassel walked him to the computer in the corner and logged on he put the cd in the tray loaded it and stepped back as pulaski sat the message on the screen asked what he wanted to do flustered he found himself with a number of choices he didnt recognize any of them cassel stood over his shoulder arent you going to open it sure just wondering what programs best you dont have many options cassel said laughing as if this were obvious excel xl pulaski asked he knew his ears were red hated it just hated it the spreadsheet whitcomb offered helpfully though to pulaski that was no help whatsoever you dont know excel gillespie leaned forward and typed so fast his fingers were a blur the program loaded and a grid popped up containing names addresses dates and times youve read spreadsheets before right sure but not excel gillespies eyebrows were lifted in surprise no some others pulaski hated himself for playing right into their hands just shut up and get to work some others really cassel asked interesting its all yours sergeant friday good luck oh thats excel gillespie spelled well you can see it on the screen you might want to check it out its easy to learn i mean a high school kid could do it ill look into that the two men left the room whitcomb said like i said earliernobody around here likes them very much but the company couldnt function without them theyre geniuses which im sure theyll let you know youve got that right okay ill let you get to work you all right here ill figure things out whitcomb said if you get back here to the snake pit come by and say hi will do or lets meet in astoria get some coffee you like greek food love it pulaski flashed on an enjoyable time out after his head injury the officer had let some friendships slide uncertain if people would enjoy his company hed like hanging out with another guy a beer maybe catching an action flick most of which jenny didnt care for well hed think about it laterafter the investigation was over of course when whitcomb was gone pulaski looked around no one was nearby still he recalled mameda glancing up uneasily behind and above pulaskis shoulder he thought of the special he and jenny had recently seen about a las vegas casinothe eyes in the sky security cameras everywhere he recalled too the security guard up the hall and the reporter whose life had been ruined because hed spied on ssd well ron pulaski sure hoped there was no surveillance here because his mission today entailed something much more than just collecting the cd and interviewing suspects lincoln rhyme had sent him here to break into what was probably the most secure computer facility in new york city chapter twentysix sipping strong sweet coffee in the café across the street from the gray rock thirtynineyearold miguel abrera was flipping through a brochure hed received in the mail recently it was yet another in a recent series of unusual occurrences in his life most were merely odd or irritating this one was troubling he looked through it yet again then closed it and sat back glancing at his watch he still had ten minutes before he had to return to the job miguel was a maintenance specialist as ssd called it but he told everybody he was a janitor whatever the title the tasks he performed were a janitors tasks he did a good job and he liked the work why should he be ashamed of what he was called he could have taken his break in the building but the free coffee that ssd provided was lousy and they didnt even give you real milk or cream besides he wasnt one for chitchat and preferred enjoying a newspaper and coffee in solitude he missed smoking though hed bargained away cigarettes in the emergency room and even though god hadnt kept his side of the deal miguel had given up the habit anyway he glanced up to see a fellow employee enter the café tony petron a senior janitor who worked executive row the men exchanged nods and miguel was worried that the man would join him but petron went to sit in the corner by himself to read email or messages on his cell phone and once again miguel looked over the flyer which was addressed to him personally then as he sipped the sweet coffee he considered the other unusual things that had happened recently like his time sheets at ssd you simply walked through the turnstile and your id card told the computer when you entered and when you left but a couple of times in the past few months his sheets had been off he always worked a fortyhour week and was always paid for forty hours but occasionally hed happened to look at his records and saw that they were wrong they said he came in earlier than he had then left earlier or he missed a weekday and worked a saturday but he never had hed talked to his supervisor about it the man had shrugged software bug maybe as long as they dont short you no problemo and then there was the issue of his checkingaccount statement a month ago hed found to his shock that his balance was ten thousand dollars higher than it should be by the time hed gone to the branch to have them correct it though the balance was accurate and that had happened three times now one of the mistaken deposits was for and that wasnt all recently hed had a call from a company about his mortgage application only he hadnt applied for a mortgage he rented his house he and his wife had hoped to buy something but after she and their young son died in the auto accident he hadnt had the heart to consider a house concerned he checked his credit report but no mortgage application was listed nothing out of the ordinary though he noted that his credit rating had been raisedsignificantly that too was odd though of course he didnt complain about this particular fluke but none of those things troubled him as much as this flyer dear mr abrera as you are quite aware at various times in our lives we go through traumatic experiences and suffer difficult losses its understandable that at moments like this people have trouble moving on in life sometimes they even have thoughts that the burden is too great and they consider taking impulsive and unfortunate measures we at survivor counseling services recognize the difficult challenges facing persons like you whove suffered a serious loss our trained staff can help you get through the difficult times with a combination of medical intervention and oneonone and group counseling to bring you contentment and remind you that life is indeed worth living now miguel abrera had never considered suicide even at his worst just after the accident eighteen months ago taking his own life was inconceivable that he received the flyer in the first place was worrying but two aspects of the situation really unnerved him the first was that the brochure had been sent to him directlynot forwardedat his new address no one involved in his counseling or at the hospital where his wife and child died knew that hed moved a month ago the second was the final paragraph now that youve taken that vital first step of reaching out to us miguel wed like to set up a nocost evaluation session at your convenience dont delay we can help he had never taken any steps to contact the service how had they gotten his name well it was probably just an odd set of coincidences hed have to worry about it later time to get back to ssd andrew sterling was the kindest and most considerate boss anybody could ask for but miguel had no doubt that the rumors were true he reviewed every employees time sheets personally alone in the conference room at ssd ron pulaski looked at the cell phone window as he wandered franticallywalking in a grid pattern he realized not unlike searching a crime scene but he had no reception just like jeremy had said hed have to use the landline was it monitored suddenly he realized that although hed agreed to help lincoln rhyme do this he was at serious risk of losing the most important thing in his life after his family his job as an nypd cop he was thinking now how powerful andrew sterling was if hed managed to ruin the life of a reporter with a major newspaper a young cop wouldnt stand a chance against the ceo if they caught him hed be arrested his career would be over what would he tell his brother what would he tell his parents he was furious with lincoln rhyme why the hell hadnt he protested the plan to steal the data he didnt have to do this oh sure detectiveanything you say it was totally crazy but then he pictured the body of myra weinburg eyes gazing upward hair teasing her forehead looking like jenny and he found himself leaning forward crooking the phone under his chin and hitting for the outside line rhyme here detective its me pulaski rhyme barked where the hell have you been and where are you calling from its a blocked number first time ive been alone he snapped and my cell doesnt work here well lets get moving im on a computer okay ill patch in rodney szarnek the object of the theft was what lincoln rhyme had heard their computer guru comment on the empty space on a computer hard drive sterling had claimed the computers didnt keep track of employees downloading dossiers but when szarnek had explained about information floating around in the ether of ssds computer rhyme had asked if that might include information about who had downloaded files szarnek thought it was a real possibility he said that getting into innercircle would be impossiblehed tried thatbut there would be a much smaller server that handled administrative operations like time sheets and downloads if pulaski could get into the system szarnek might be able to have him extract data from the empty space the techie could then reassemble it and see if any employees had downloaded the dossiers of the victims and the fall guys okay szarnek now said coming on the phone youre in the system im reading a cd they gave me heh that means theyve only given you passive access well have to do better the tech gave him some commands to type incomprehensible its telling me i dont have permission to do this ill try to get you root szarnek gave the young cop a series of even more confusing commands pulaski flubbed them several times and his face grew hot he was furious with himself for transposing letters or typing a backward slash instead of a forward head injury cant i just use the mouse look for what im supposed to find szarnek explained that the operating system was unix not the friendlier ones made by windows or apple it required lengthy typed commands which had to be keyboarded exactly oh but finally the machine responded by giving him access pulaski felt a huge burst of pride plug the drive in now szarnek said from his pocket the young officer took a portable gigabyte hard drive and slipped the plug into the usb port on the computer following szarneks instructions he loaded a program that would turn the empty space on the server into separate files compress them and store them on the portable drive depending on the size of the unused space this could take minutes or hours a small window popped up and the program told pulaski only that it was working pulaski sat back scrolling through the customer information from the cd which was still on the screen in fact the information on customers was mostly gibberish to him the name of the ssd client was obvious along with the address and phone number and names of those authorized to access the system but much of the information was inrar orzip files apparently compressed mailing lists he scrolled to the endfront matter chapter fourteen brotherit would take a long long time to pick through them and find if any customers had compiled information on the victims and pulaskis thoughts were interrupted by voices in the hall coming closer to the conference room oh no not now he carefully picked up the small humming hard drive and slipped it into his slacks pocket it gave a clicking sound faint but pulaski was sure it could be heard across the room the usb cable was clearly visible the voices were closer now one was sean cassels closer yetplease go away on the screen in a small square window working hell pulaski thought to himself and scooted the chair forward the plug and the window would be clearly visible to anybody who stepped only a few feet into the room suddenly a head appeared in the doorway hey sergeant friday cassel said hows it going the officer cringed the man would see the drive he had to good thanks he moved his leg in front of the usb port to obscure the wire and plug the gesture felt way obvious how dyou like that excel good i like it a lot excellento its the best and you can export the files you do much powerpoint not too much of that no well you might some day sargewhen youre police chief and excel is great for your home finances keep on top of all those investments of yours oh and it comes with some games youd like em pulaski smiled while his heart pounded as loudly as the hard drive whirred with a wink cassel disappeared if excel comes with games ill eat the disk you arrogant son of a bitch pulaski wiped his palms on his dress slacks which jenny had ironed that morning as she did every morning or the night before if he had an early tour or a predawn assignment please lord dont let me lose my job he prayed he thought back to the day when he and his twin brother had taken the police officer exam and the day theyd graduated the swearingin ceremony too his mother crying the look he and his father shared those were among the best moments of his life would all that be wasted goddamnit okay rhymes brilliant and no one cared more about collaring perps than he did but breaking the law like this hell he was home sitting in that chair of his being waited on nothing would happen to him why should pulaski be the sacrificial lamb nonetheless he concentrated on his furtive task come on come on he urged the collection program but it continued to churn away slowly assuring him only that it was on the job no bar easing to the right no countdown like in the movies working what was that pulaski rhyme asked some employees theyre gone hows it going okay i think you think it a new message popped up completed do you want to write to a file okay its finished it wants me to write to a file szarnek came on the line this is critical do exactly what i tell you he gave instructions on how to create the files compress them and move them to the hard drive hands shaking pulaski did as instructed he was covered in sweat in a few minutes the job was done now youre going to have to erase your tracks put everything back the way it was to make sure nobody does what you just did and finds you szarnek sent the officer into the log files and had him type more commands finally he got these taken care of thats it okay get out of there rookie rhyme urged pulaski hung up unplugged the hard drive and slipped it back into his pocket then logged off he rose and walked outside blinking in surprise to see that the security guard had moved closer pulaski realized he was the same one whod escorted amelia through the data pens walking just behind heras if he were taking a shoplifter to a store managers office to await the police had the man seen anything officer pulaski ill take you back to andrews office his face was unsmiling and his eyes didnt reveal a thing he led the officer up the hall with every step the hard drive chafed against his leg and felt as if it were red hot more glances at the ceiling it was acoustic tile he couldnt see any damn cameras paranoia filled the halls brighter than the stark white lighting when they arrived sterling waved him into the office turning over several sheets of paper he was working on officer you got what you needed i did yes pulaski held up the client list cd like a kid at showandtell in school ah good the ceos bright green eyes looked him over and hows the investigation going its going okay these were the first words that came to pulaskis mind he felt like an idiot what would amelia sachs have said he had no clue is it now anything helpful in the client list i just looked through it to make sure we could read it okay well go over it back at the lab the lab in queens is that where youre based we do work there a few other places too sterling gave no response to pulaskis evasion just smiled pleasantly the ceo was about four or five inches shorter but the young officer felt he was the one looking up sterling walked with him into the outer office well if theres anything else just let us know were one hundred percent behind you thanks martin make those arrangements we talked about earlier then take officer pulaski downstairs oh i can find my way hell show you out you have a good night sterling returned to his office the door closed ill just be a few minutes martin said to the policeman and picked up the phone and turned slightly out of earshot pulaski strolled to the door and looked up and down the hall a figure emerged from an office he was speaking in hushed tones on his mobile apparently in this part of the building cell phones worked fine he squinted at pulaski said a brief farewell and flipped the phone shut excuse me officer pulaski he nodded im andy sterling sure mr sterlings son the young mans dark eyes confidently looked right into pulaskis though his handshake seemed tentative i think you called me and my father left a message that i was supposed to talk to you yeah thats right you have a minute what do you need to know were checking into certain peoples whereabouts on sunday afternoon i went hiking up in westchester i drove up there about noon and got back oh no its not you were interested in im just checking where your father was he said he called you at around two from long island well yes he did i didnt take the call though i didnt want to stop on my hike he lowered his voice andrew has trouble separating business from pleasure and i thought he might want me to come into the office and i didnt want to screw up my day off i called him back later about threethirty do you mind if i take a look at your phone no not at all he opened the phone and displayed the incomingcall list hed received and made several calls on sunday morning but in the afternoon only one call was on the screen from the number sachs had given himsterlings long island house okay thatll do it appreciate it the young mans face was troubled its terrible from what ive heard someone was raped and murdered thats right are you close to catching him we have a number of leads well good people like that should be lined up and shot thanks for your time as the young man walked off martin appeared and glanced at andys receding back if youd follow me officer pulaski with a smile that might as well have been a frown he walked toward the elevator pulaski was being eaten alive by nervous energy the disk drive filling his thoughts he was sure everybody could see it outlined in his pocket he began rambling so martinyou been with the company long yes you a computer person too a different smile which meant nothing more than the other one not really walking down the hallway black and white sterile pulaski hated it here he felt strangled claustrophobic he wanted the streets he wanted queens the south bronx even the danger didnt matter he wanted to leave just put his head down and run a tickle of panic the reporter not only lost his job but was prosecuted under criminal trespass statutes he served six months in state prison pulaski was also disoriented this was a different route from the one hed taken to get to sterlings office now martin turned a corner and pushed through a thick door the patrolman hesitated when he saw what was ahead a station manned by three unsmiling security guards along with a metal detector and an xray unit these werent the data pens so there was no dataerasing system as in the other part of the building but he couldnt smuggle out the portable hard drive without being detected when hed been here earlier with amelia sachs they hadnt passed through any security stations like these he hadnt even seen any dont think we went through one of these last time he said to the assistant trying to sound casual depends on whether peopleve been unattended for any period of time martin explained a computer makes the assessment and lets us know he smiled dont take it personally ha not at all his heart pounded his palms were damp no no he couldnt lose his job he just couldnt it was so important to him what the hell had he done agreeing to do this he told himself he was stopping the man whod killed a woman who looked a lot like jenny a terrible man who had no problem with killing anyone if it suited his purpose still he reflected this isnt right what would his parents say when he confessed to them that he was being arrested for stealing data his brother you have any data on you sir pulaski showed him the cd the man examined the case he called a number using speed dial he stiffened slightly and then spoke quietly he loaded the disk into a computer at his station and looked over the screen the cd apparently was on a list of approved items but still the guard ran it through the xray unit studying the image of the jewel box and the disk inside carefully it rolled on the conveyor to the other side of the metal detector pulaski started forward but a third guard stopped him sorry sir please empty your pockets and put everything metal on there im a police officer he said trying to sound amused the guard replied your department has agreed to abide by our security guidelines since were government contractors the rules apply to everybody you can call your supervisor to check if youd like pulaski was trapped martin continued to watch him closely everything on the belt please think come on pulaski raged to himself figure something out think bluff your way through this i cant im not smart enough yes you are what would amelia sachs do lincoln rhyme he turned away knelt down and spent several moments carefully unlacing his shoes slowly pulling them off standing he placed the polished shoes on the belt and added his weapons ammo cuffs radio coins phone and pens to a plastic tray pulaski started through the metal detector and it went off with a squeal as the unit sensed the hard drive you have anything else on you swallowing shaking his head he patted his pockets nope well have to wand you pulaski stepped out the second guard passed the wand over his body and stopped at the officers chest the device gave a huge squeal the patrolman laughed oh sorry he undid a button on his shirt and displayed the bulletproof vest metal heart plate forgot about it stops everything but a fullmetaljacket rifle slug probably not a desert eagle the guard said now heres my opinion a fiftycaliber handgun is just not natural pulaski joked finally drawing smiles from the guards he started to remove the shirt thats all right i dont think we need to make you strip officer with shaking hands pulaski buttoned his shirt right over the spot where the drive restedbetween his undershirt and the vest hed stuffed it there when hed bent down to unlace his shoes he gathered up his gear martin whod bypassed the metal detector guided him through another door they were in the main lobby a large stark area in gray marble etched with a huge version of the watchtower and window logo have a good day officer pulaski martin said turning back pulaski continued to the massive glass doors trying to control the shaking of his hands he was noticing for the first time the bank of tv cameras monitoring the lobby his impression was of vultures sitting serenely on the wall waiting for wounded prey to gasp and fall chapter twentyseven even hearing judys voice taking tearful comfort in its familiarity arthur rhyme couldnt stop thinking about the tattooed white guy the sizzling meth freak mick the guy kept talking to himself he slipped his hands inside his pants every five minutes or so and he seemed to turn his eyes to arthur almost as frequently honey are you there sorry i have to tell you something judy said about the lawyer about the money about the children whatever it was it would be too much for him arthur rhyme was close to exploding go ahead he whispered resigned i went to see lincoln you what i had to you dont seem to believe the lawyer art this isnt going to just fix itself buti told you not to call him well theres a family involved here art its not just what you want theres me and the children we shouldve done it before i dont want him involved no call him back and tell him thanks but its fine fine judy rhyme blurted are you crazy he sometimes believed she was stronger than he wasprobably smarter too shed been furious when hed stormed out of princeton after being passed over for the professorship shed said he was behaving like a child having a tantrum he wished hed listened to her judy blurted youve got this idea that john grisham is going to show up in court at the last minute and save you but thats not going to happen jesus art you ought to be grateful im doing something i am he said quickly his words darting out like squirrels its just just what this is a man who nearly died was paralyzed over his whole body and now lives in a wheelchair and hes stopped everything to prove youre innocent what the hell are you thinking of you want your children to grow up with a father in prison for murder of course not he wondered again if she really believed his denial that he hadnt known alice sanderson the dead woman she wouldnt think hed killed her of course shed wonder if theyd been lovers i have faith in the system judy god that sounded weak well lincoln is the system art you should give him a call and thank him arthur hesitated then asked what does he say i just talked to him yesterday he called to ask about your shoessome of the evidence but i havent heard from him again did you go see him or just call i went to his place he lives on central park west his town house is real nice a dozen memories of his cousin came to mind rapidfire arthur asked how does he look believe it or not pretty much like when we saw him in boston well no actually he looks in better shape now and he cant walk he cant move at all just his head and shoulders what about his ex do he and blaine see each other no hes seeing someone else a policewoman shes very pretty tall redhead i have to say i was surprised i shouldnt have been i guess but i was a tall redhead arthur thought immediately of adrianna and tried to put that memory aside it refused to leave tell me why arthur tell me why you did it a snarl from mick his hand was back in his pants his eyes flickered hatefully toward arthur im sorry honey thanks for calling him lincoln it was then that he felt hot breath on his neck yo getoffadaphone a lat was standing behind him offadaphone judy i have to go theres only one phone here ive used up my time i love you art i the lat stepped forward and arthur hung up then slipped back to his bench in a corner of the detention area he sat staring at the floor in front of him the scuff in the shape of a kidney staring staring but the distressed floor didnt hold his attention he was thinking of the past more memories joined those of adrianna and his cousin lincolnarthurs familys home on the north shore lincolns in the western suburbs arthurs stern king of a father henry his brother robert and shy brilliant marie thinking too of lincolns father teddy there was an interesting story behind the nicknamehis given name wasnt theodore arthur knew how it had come about but curiously he didnt think lincoln did hed always liked uncle teddy a sweet guy a little shy a little quietbut who wouldnt be in the shadow of an older brother like henry rhyme sometimes when lincoln was out arthur would drive to teddy and annes in the small paneled family room uncle and nephew would watch an old movie or talk about american history the spot on the tombs floor now morphed into the shape of ireland it seemed to move as arthur stared eyes fixed on it willing himself away from here disappearing through a magic hole into the life out there arthur rhyme felt complete despair now and he understood how naive hed been there were no magical exit routes and no practical ones either he knew lincoln was brilliant hed read all the articles in the popular press he could find even some of his scientific writing the biologic effects of certain nanoparticulate materials but arthur understood now that lincoln could do nothing for him the case was hopeless and hed be in jail for the rest of his life no lincolns role in this was perfectly fitting his cousinthe relative hed been closest to while growing up his surrogate brotherought to be present at arthurs downfall a grim smile on his face he looked up from the spot on the floor and he realized that something had changed weird this wing of detention was now deserted where had everybody gone then approaching footsteps alarmed he glanced up and saw somebody moving toward him fast feet scuffling his friend antwon johnson eyes cold arthur understood somebody was attacking him from behind mick of course and johnson was coming to save him leaping to his feet turningso frightened he felt like crying looking for the tweaker but no no one was there which is when he felt antwon johnson slip the garrote around his neckhomemade apparently from a shirt torn into strips and twisted into a rope no wha arthur was jerked to his feet the huge man pulled him off the bench and dragged him to the wall from which the nail protruded the one hed seen earlier seven feet from the floor arthur moaned and thrashed shhhh johnson looked around at the deserted alcove of the hall arthur struggled but it was a struggle against a block of wood against a bag of concrete he slammed his fist pointlessly into the mans neck and shoulders then felt himself lifted off the floor the black man hefted him up and hooked the homemade hangmans noose to the nail he let go and stood back watching arthur kick and jerk trying to free himself why why why he was trying to ask this question but only wet sputtering came from his lips johnson stared at him in curiosity no anger no sadistic gleam just watching with mild interest and arthur realized as his body shivered and his vision went black that this was all a setupjohnson had saved him from the lats for only one reason he wanted arthur for himself nnnnnn why the black man kept his hands at his sides and leaned close he whispered im doin you a favor man fuck youd do yourself in a month or two anyway you aint made for it here now jus stop fightin it go easier you jus give it up you know what im sayin pulaski returned from his mission at ssd and held up the sleek gray hard drive good job rookie rhyme said sachs winked your first secret op assignment he grimaced it didnt feel much like an assignment it felt more like a felony im sure we can find probable cause if we look hard enough sellitto reassured him rhyme said to rodney szarnek go ahead the computer man plugged the hard drive into the usb port on his battered laptop and typed with firm certain strikes on the keyboard staring at the screen good good you have a name rhyme snapped somebody at ssd who downloaded the dossiers what szarnek gave a laugh it doesnt work that way itll take a while i have to load it on the mainframe at computer crimes and then how long a while rhyme grumbled szarnek once again blinked as if seeing for the first time that the criminalist was disabled depends on the level of fragmentation age of the files allocation partitioning and then fine fine fine just do the best you can sellitto asked what else did you find pulaski explained about his interviews of the remaining technicians who had access to all of the data pens he added that hed talked to andy sterling whose cell phone confirmed that his father had called from long island at the time of the killing his alibi held up thom updated their suspect chart andrew sterling president chief executive officer alibion long island verified confirmed by son sean cassel director of sales and marketing no alibi wayne gillespie director of technical operations no alibi samuel brockton director compliance department alibihotel records confirm presence in washington peter arlonzokemper director of human resources alibiwith wife verified by her biased steven shraeder technical service and support manager day shift alibiin office according to time sheets faruk mameda technical service and support manager night shift no alibi client of ssd list provided by sterling unsub recruited by andrew sterling so now everyone at ssd who had access to innercircle knew of the investigationand still the bot guarding the nypd myra weinburg homicide file had not reported a single attempted intrusion was being cautious or did the concept of the trap miss the mark was the entire premise that the killer was connected to ssd completely wrong it occurred to rhyme that theyd been so awed by the power of sterling and the company that they were neglecting other potential suspects pulaski produced a cd here are the clients i looked it over fast therere about three hundred fifty of them ouch rhyme grimaced szarnek loaded the disk and opened it up on a spreadsheet rhyme looked over the data on his flatscreen monitornearly a thousand pages of dense text noise sachs said she explained what sterling had told her about datas being useless if its corrupt too sparse or too plentiful the tech scrolled through the swamp of informationwhich clients had bought which lists of datamined details too much information but then rhyme had a thought does it show the time and date of when the data was downloaded szarnek examined the screen yes it does lets find out who downloaded information just before the crimes good linc sellitto said five twentytwod want the most uptodate data possible szarnek considered this i think i can hack together a bot to handle it might take some time but yeah its doable just let me know exactly when the crimes occurred we can get you those mel sure the tech began to compile the details of the coin theft the painting theft and two rapes hey youre using that program excel pulaski asked szarnek thats right what is it exactly your basic spreadsheet mostly used for sales figures and financial statements but now people use it for a lot of things could i learn it sure you can take a course say the new school or learning annex should have boned up on it before now ill check them out those schools rhyme believed he now understood pulaskis reticence to go back to ssd he said put that low on your list rookie whats that sir remember people hassle you in all sorts of different ways dont assume theyre right and youre wrong just because they know something you dont the question is do you need to know it to do a better job then learn it if not its a distraction and to hell with it the young officer laughed okay thanks rodney szarnek took the cd and the portable hard drive and bundled up his computer to head down to the computer crimes unit and its mainframe after he left rhyme glanced at sachs who was on the phone tracking down information on the data scrounger killed in colorado several years ago he couldnt hear the words but she was clearly getting relevant information her head was forward lips moist and she tugged at a strand of hair her eyes were sleek and focused the pose was extremely erotic ridiculous he thought concentrate on the goddamn case he tried to push the sensation away he was only somewhat successful sachs hung up the phone got something from the colorado state police that data scroungers name was p j gordon peter james goes mountain biking one day and never comes home they found his bike at the bottom of a cliff battered up it was beside a deep river the body shows up twenty miles downstream a month or so later positive dna match investigation not much of one kidsre always killing themselves with bikes and skis and snowmobiles in that area it was ruled accidental but a few open questions remained for one thing it seemed that gordon had tried to break into the ssd servers in californianot the database but the companys own files and some employees personal ones nobody knows if he got inside or not i tried to track down other people from the company rocky mountain data to find out more but nobodys around anymore looks like sterling bought the company took its database and let everybody go anybody we can call about him no family that the state police could find rhyme was nodding slowly okay this is an interesting premise if i can use your flavoroftheweek participle mel this gordons doing his own data mining in ssds files and finds something about five twentytwo who realizes hes in trouble about to be found out then he kills gordon and makes it look like an accident sachs the police in colorado have any case files she sighed archived theyll look for them well i want to find out who at ssd was with the company back then when gordon died pulaski called mark whitcomb at ssd after a half hour he called back a conversation with human resources revealed that dozens of employees were with the company at that time including sean cassel wayne gillespie mameda and shraeder as well as martin one of sterlings personal assistants the large number meant that the peter gordon matter wasnt much of a lead rhyme hoped though that if they got the full colorado state police report maybe he could find some evidence that pointed them toward one of the suspects he was staring at the list when sellittos phone rang he took the call the criminalist saw the detective stiffen what he snapped glancing at rhyme no shit whats the storycall me as soon as you know he hung up his lips were pressed together and a frown crossed his face linc im sorry your cousin somebody moved on him in detention tried to kill him sachs walked over to rhyme rested her hand on his shoulder he could feel alarm in the gesture how is he the directorll call me back linc hes in the emergency clinic there they dont know anything yet chapter twentyeight hey there pam willoughby ushered into the town house foyer by thom was smiling the girl said hello to the crew there who greeted her with smiles despite the terrible news about arthur rhyme thom asked her how school had gone today great really good then she lowered her voice and asked amelia you have a minute sachs glanced at rhyme who nodded her toward the girl meaning theres nothing we can do about art until we know more go ahead she stepped into the hallway with the girl funny about young people sachs was thinking you can read everything in their faces the moods at least if not always the reasons behind them when it came to pam sachs sometimes wished she had more of kathryn dances skill in reading how the girl felt and what she was thinking this afternoon though she seemed transparently happy i know youre busy pam said no problem they walked into the parlor across the front foyer of the town house so sachs smiled conspiratorially okay i did what you said you know i just asked stuart about that other girl and its just they used to go outbefore i met him he even told me about her a while ago he ran into her on the street they were just talking is all she was kind of a clinger you know she was that way when they were going out and its one of the reasons he didnt want to see her anymore and she was holding on to him when emily saw themand he was trying to get away thats all everythings like cool hey congrats so the enemy is definitely out of the picture oh yeah it has to be truei mean he couldnt date her because he could lose his job pams voice came to an abrupt halt sachs didnt need to be an interrogator to realize that the girl had stumbled lose his job what job well you know not exactly pam why would he lose his job blushing she stared at the oriental rug at their feet like shes sort of in his class this year hes a teacher kind of at your high school not this year hes at jefferson i had him last year so its okay if we wait pam sachs was thinking back you told me he was in school i said i met him at school and poetry club well he was the adviser sachs said grimacing and he coaches soccer he doesnt play it i didnt exactly lie first sachs told herself dont panic thats not going to help anything well pam this is and what the hell is it she had so many questions she asked the first one in her thoughts how old is he i dont know not that old the girl looked up her eyes were hard sachs had seen her defiant and moody and determined shed never seen the girl this waytrapped and defensive almost feral pam i guess maybe like fortyone or something the nopanic rule was starting to crumble what the hell should she do yes amelia sachs had always wanted children in her lifespurred by memories of the wonderful times shed spent with her fatherbut she hadnt thought much about the tougher job of parenting be reasonable was the guideline here sachs told herself but it was about as effective as dont panic at the moment well pam i know what youre going to say but its not about that sachs wasnt so sure men and women togetherto some extent its always about that but she couldnt consider the sexual aspect of the problem it would only fuel the panic and destroy the reasonable hes different we have this connection i mean the guys in school its sports or video games so boring pam there are plenty of boys who read poetry and go to plays werent there any boys in poetry club its not the same i dont tell anybody what i went through you know with my mother and everything but i told stuart and he understood hes had a tough time too his father was killed when he was my age he had to put himself through school working two jobs or three its just not a good idea honey therere problems you cant even imagine now hes nice to me i love being with him isnt that the most important thing thats part of it but its not everything pams arms folded defiantly and even if hes not your teacher now he could get into really bad trouble too somehow saying this made sachs feel that shed already lost the argument he said im worth the risk you didnt need to be freud to figure it out a girl whose father had been killed when she was young and whose mother and stepfather were domestic terroristsshe was primed to fall for an attentive older man come on amelia im not getting married were just dating then why not take a break a month go out with a couple other guys see what happens pathetic sachs told herself her arguments smacked of a losing rearguard action an exaggerated frown like why would i want to do that im not out there trying to hook a boy just to have somebody like every other girl in my class honey i know you feel something for him but just give it some time i dont want you hurt there are a lot of wonderful guys out there theyll be better for you and youll be happier in the long run im not breaking up with him i love him and he loves me she gathered up her books and said coolly i better go i have homework the girl started toward the door but then stopped and turned back she whispered when you started going out with mr rhyme didnt somebody say it was a stupid idea that you could find somebody who wasnt in a wheelchair that there were lots of wonderful guys out there i bet they did pam held her eye briefly then turned and left closing the door behind her sachs reflected that yes indeed somebody had said just that to her practically those very words and who else but amelia sachss own mother miguel abrera the maintenance specialist as the corporately correct say left work at his usual time around pm he now gets out of the subway car near his home in queens and im right behind him as he strolls home im trying to stay calm but its not easy theythe policeare close close to me which has never happened before in years and years of collecting many dead sixteens many ruined lives many people in jail on my account nobody has ever come close like this since i learned about the police suspicions ive kept up a good facade im sure still ive been analyzing the situation frantically picking through the data looking for the lump of gold that tells me what they know and what they dont how much at risk i really am but i cant find the answer theres too much noise in the data contamination im running through how ive behaved lately ive been careful data certainly can work against you they can pin you to the grid like a blue morpho menelaus butterfly smelling of cyanides almond perfume on a velvet board but those of us in the know we can use data for protection too data can be erased can be massaged can be skewed we can add noise on purpose we can place data set a right next to data set x to make a and x seem much more similar than they are or more different we can cheat in the simplest of ways rfids for instance slip a smart pass transponder into someones suitcase and it will show your cars been in a dozen places over the weekend while in fact its actually been sitting in your garage the whole time or think about how easy it is to put your employee id into an envelope and have it delivered to the office where it sits for four hours until you ask somebody to collect the package and bring it to you in a restaurant downtown sorry forgot to pick it up thanks lunch is on me and what do the data show why that you were slaving away at work while in reality you were wiping your razor clean as you stood over someones cooling body during those hours in question that nobody actually saw you at your desk is irrelevant here are my time sheets officer we trust data we dont trust the human eye there are a dozen more tricks ive perfected and now i have to rely on one of the more extreme measures ahead of me now miguel pauses and glances into a bar i know for a fact that he drinks rarely and if he goes in for a cerveza it will throw off the timing a bit but that wont ruin my plans for this evening he forgoes the drink though and continues along the street head cocked to the side i actually feel sorry that he didnt give in and indulge considering he has less than an hour to live chapter twentynine finally somebody from the detention center called lon sellitto he nodded as he listened thanks he disconnected arthurs going to be okay hes hurt but not bad thank god sachs whispered what happened rhyme asked nobody can figure it out the perps antwon johnson doing fed time for kidnapping and state lines they moved him to the tombs for trial on related state charges he just kind of snapped looks like tried to make it look like arthur hanged himself johnson denied it at first then claimed arthur wanted to die asked him to help the guards found him in time no weird another prisoner went after johnson mick gallenta twotimer in for meth and smack he was half johnsons size took him on knocked him out and got arthur down from the wall nearly started a riot the phone rang and rhyme noticed a area code judy rhyme he took the call did you hear lincoln her voice was unsteady i did yes why would somebody do that why jails jail its a different world but its just a holding cell lincoln its detention i could understand if he were in prison with convicted murderers but most of those people are awaiting trial arent they thats right why would somebody risk his own case by trying to kill another prisoner there i dont know judy it doesnt make sense have you talked to him they let him make a call he cant speak very well his throat was damaged but its not too bad theyre keeping him in for a day or two good rhyme said listen judy i wanted more information before i called butim pretty sure well be able to show that arthurs innocent it looks like theres someone else behind it he killed another victim yesterday and i think we can tie him to the murder of the sanderson woman no really who the hell is it lincoln no longer treading on ice no longer carefully choosing words and worried about offending judy rhyme had grown tough in the last twentyfour hours thats what were trying to find out now he glanced at sachs then turned back to the speakerphone and it doesnt look as if he had any connection with the victim no connection at all you her voice faded are you sure about that sachs identified herself and said thats right judy they could hear her inhaling should i call the lawyer theres nothing he can do as things stand now arthurs still under arrest can i call art and tell him rhyme hesitated yes sure he asked about you lincoln in the clinic did he he sensed amelia sachs was looking at him yes he said whatever came of it thank you for helping everything wouldve been different i should go judy we have a lot to do well let you know what we find thank you lincoln and everybody there god bless you a hesitation goodbye judy rhyme didnt bother with the voice command he disconnected with his right index finger he had better control with the ring finger of his left hand but the right moved fast as a snake miguel is a survivor of tragedy and a dependable employee he regularly visits his sister and her husband on long island he wires western union money to his mother and sister in mexico hes a moral man once a year after his wife and child died he got a precious out of an atm machine in an area of brooklyn known for its prostitutes the janitor though balked the money went back into his account the next day unfair he had to pay the service charge at the atm i know a lot more about miguel more than most other sixteens in the databasebecause hes one of my escape hatches which i desperately need now ive been grooming him as a surrogate for the past year after he dies the diligent police will begin to put the pieces together why weve found the killerrapistartandcoin thief he confessed in his suicide notedespondent and driven to murder by the death of his family and in a box in his pocket a fingernail from the victim myra weinburg and look at what else we have here sums of money passed through his account and vanished inexplicably miguel looked into getting a large mortgage to buy a house on long island with a half million down despite his salary of a year he went on artdealer web sites inquiring about prescott paintings in the basement of his apartment building is a fivepack of miller beer trojan condoms edge shave cream and a photo of myra weinburgs realm from ourworld also hidden are books on hacking and thumb drives containing passcodecracking programs hes been depressed and even called a suicide counseling service just last week to ask for a brochure and then there are his time sheets revealing that he was out of the office when the crimes occurred slam dunk in my pocket is his suicide note a reasonable facsimile of his handwriting from the copies of his canceled checks and loan applications conveniently scanned and obscenely available online its written on paper similar to what he bought a month ago at his neighborhood drugstore and the ink is from the same type of pen he owns a dozen of and since the last thing the police want is an extensive investigation into their prime data contractor ssd that will be the end of the matter hell die case closed and ill go back to my closet survey the mistakes i made and work on how to be more clever in the future but isnt that just a life lesson for us all as for the suicide itself i looked at google earth and ran a basic prediction program which suggested how he would get home from the subway station after leaving ssd miguel will most likely take a path through a small urban park here in queens right next to the expressway the irritating rush of traffic and the gassy atmosphere from diesel exhaust mean the park is usually deserted ill come up fast behind himdont want him to recognize me and grow cautiousand deliver a half dozen blows to the head with the bbfilled iron pipe then ill slip the suicide note and box containing the fingernail into his pocket drag him to the railing and over he goes onto the highway fifty feet below miguel is walking slowly glancing into storefronts and im thirty forty feet behind head down inconspicuously lost in afterwork music like dozens of other commuters returning home though my ipod is off music is one thing i dont collect now the park is one block away i but wait somethings wrong hes not turning toward the park he pauses at a korean deli buys some flowers and turns away from the commercial strip heading toward a deserted neighborhood im processing this running the behavior through my knowledge base the predictions not working a girlfriend a relative how the hell can there be something about his life i dont know noise in the data i hate it no no this isnt good flowers for a girlfriend dont fit the profile of a suicidal killer miguel continues down the sidewalk the air fragrant with the spring smell of cut grass and lilac and dog urine ah got it now i relax the janitor walks through the gate of a cemetery of course the dead wife and kid were doing fine the prediction holds well just have a brief delay his path home will still take him through the park this might be even better a last visit to the wife forgive me for raping and murdering in your absence dear i follow keeping a safe distance in my comfortable shoes rubbersoled making no sound whatsoever miguel makes a direct line to a double grave there he blesses himself kneels in prayer then he leaves the flowers beside four other bouquets in varying degrees of wilt why havent the cemetery trips shown up on the grid of coursehe pays cash for the flowers he stands up and starts to walk away i begin to follow breathing deeply when excuse me sir i freeze then turn slowly to the groundskeeper who is talking to me hes come up silently treading over the carpet of short dewy grass and he looks from my face toward my right hand which i slip into my pocket he might or might not have seen the beige cloth glove im wearing hi i say i saw you in the bushes there how do i respond to that the bushes his eyes reveal to me that hes protective of his dead folks can i ask who youre visiting his name is on the front of his overalls but i cant see it clearly stony what kind of name is that im riddled with anger this is their faultthem the people after me theyve made me careless im addled by all the noise all the contamination i hate them hate them hate i manage a sympathetic smile im a friend of miguels ah you knew carmela and juan yes thats right stony or is it stanley is wondering why im still here since miguel is gone a shift in posture yes its stony his hand moves closer to the walkietalkie riding on his hip i dont recall the names on the tombstones im wondering if miguels wife was named rosa and the boy jose and ive just waltzed into a trap other peoples cleverness is so tedious stony glances at his radio and when he looks up the knife is already halfway into his chest one two three punches careful around the boneyou can twist a finger if youre not careful as ive learned the hard way its very painful the shocked groundskeeper is more resilient than id expected though he lunges forward and grabs my collar with the hand not gripping the wound we struggle grappling and pushing and pulling a macabre dance among the graves until his hand falls away and he drops onto his back on the sidewalk a snaky strip of asphalt that leads to the cemetery office his hand finds the walkietalkie at the same instant my blade finds his neck zip zip two quiet slashes open the artery or vein or both and send a surprising torrent of blood into the sky i dodge it no no why why he reaches for the wound helpfully getting his hands out of the way and allowing me to do the same on the other side of his neck slash slash i cant stop myself its unnecessary but im mad furiousat them for throwing me off stride they forced me to use miguel as an escape and now theyve distracted me i got careless more slashingthen i stand back and in thirty seconds after a few eerie kicks the man is unconscious in sixty life becomes death i can only stand numb from this nightmare gasping from the effort im hunched over and i feel like a miserable animal the policetheywill know i was the one of course the data are all there the death happened at the gravesite of an ssd employees family and after the wrestling match with the groundskeeper im sure theres some evidence the clever police can trace to the other scenes i dont have time to clean up theyll understand that id followed miguel to fake his suicide and was interrupted by the groundskeeper then a clatter from the walkietalkie someone is asking for stony the voice isnt alarmed its a simple inquiry but with no response theyll come looking for him soon i turn and leave quickly as if im a mourner overcome with sorrow and bewildered by what the future holds but then of course thats exactly who i am chapter thirty another killing and there was no doubt that had committed it rhyme and sellitto were on a hot list for immediate notification about any homicides in new york city when the call arrived from the detective bureau it took only a few questions to find out that the victim a cemetery groundskeeper had been murdered next to the grave of an ssd employees wife and child most likely by a man whod followed the worker there too much of a coincidence of course the employee a janitor was not a suspect he was talking to another visitor just outside the cemetery when they heard the groundskeepers screams right rhyme nodded okay pulaski yes sir call somebody at ssd see if you can find out where everybody on the suspect list was in the past two hours all right another stoic smile he sure didnt like the place and sachs ill run the scene at the cemetery she was already heading for the door after sachs and pulaski left rhyme called rodney szarnek at the nypd computer crimes unit he explained about the recent killing and said im guessing hes hungry for information about what weve learned have there been any hits on the trap nothing outside the department just one search somebody from a captain malloys office in the big building read through the files for twenty minutes then logged off malloy rhyme laughed to himself though sellitto had been keeping the captain updated as instructed he apparently couldnt shake his nature as an investigator and was gathering as much information as he couldmaybe intending to offer suggestions rhyme would have to call and tell him about the trap and that the bait files contained nothing helpful the tech said i assumed it was okay for them to look it over so i didnt call you its fine rhyme disconnected he stared at the evidence boards for a long time lon ive got an idea what sellitto asked our boys always one step ahead of us weve been going about this like hes any other perp but hes not the man who knows everything i want to try something a little different i want some help from who downtown big area where exactly malloy and somebody at city hall city hall the fuck for why do you think theyll even take your phone call because they have to thats a reason youve gotta convince them lon we need an edge on this guy but you can do it do what exactly i think we need an expert what kind computer expert weve got rodney hes not exactly what i have in mind the man had been knifed to death efficiently yes but also gratuitously stabbed in the chest and then viciously slashedin anger sachs assessed this was another side to shed seen injuries like these at other scenes the energetic and illaimed cuts suggested that the killer was losing control that was good for the investigators emotional criminals are also careless criminals theyre more public and they leave more evidence than perps who exercise selfcontrol but as amelia sachs had learned from her days on the street the downside is that theyre much more dangerous people as crazed and dangerous as drew no distinction among their intended victims innocent bystanders and the police any threatany inconveniencehad to be dealt with instantly and fully and to hell with logic in the harsh halogen lamps set up by the crimescene team bathing the graveyard in unreal light sachs looked over the victim on his back feet splayed where theyd danced outward in his death throes a huge comma of blood leading away from the corpse stained the asphalt sidewalk in forest hills memorial gardens and a fringe of grass beyond none of the canvassers could find any witnesses and miguel abrera the ssd janitor couldnt add anything he was badly shaken both because hed been a potential target of the killer and because his friend had died hed gotten to know the groundskeeper in his frequent visits to the graves of his wife and child that night hed had a vague feeling that someone had followed him from the subway and hed even stopped and glanced into a bar window to look for reflections of a mugger tailing him but the trick hadnt workedhed seen no oneand hed continued on to the cemetery now in her white overalls sachs directed two crimescene officers from the main cs operation in queens to photograph and video everything she processed the body and began to walk the grid she was especially diligent this was an important scene the killing had happened fast and violentlythe groundskeeper had obviously surprised and they had grappled which meant more chances to find some evidence here that would lead to more information about the killer and his residence or place of work sachs began on the gridwalking over the scene foot by foot in one direction and then turning perpendicular and searching the same area again halfway through she stopped abruptly a noise she was sure it was the sound of metal against metal a gun chambering a round a knife opening she looked around quickly but saw only the duskblanketed cemetery amelia sachs didnt believe in ghosts and normally found resting grounds like this peaceful even comforting but now her teeth were clenched her palms sweating in the latex gloves shed just turned back to the body when she gasped seeing a flash of light nearby was it a streetlight through those bushes or moving closer a knife in his hand uncontrolled and she couldnt help but think hed already tried once to kill herthe setup near deleon williamss house with the federal agentand failed maybe he was determined to finish what hed started she returned to her task but as she was nearly finished collecting evidence she shivered movement againthis time on the far side of the lights but still within the cemetery which had been closed by patrol officers she squinted through the glare had it been the breeze jostling a tree an animal her father a lifer of a cop and a generous source of street wisdom once told her forget the dead bodies amie theyre not going to hurt you worry about the ones who madeem dead echoing rhymes admonition to search carefully but watch your back amelia sachs didnt believe in a sixth sense not in the way people think of the supernatural to her the whole natural world was so amazing and our senses and thought processes so complex and powerful that we didnt need superhuman skills to make the most perceptive of deductions she was sure somebody was there she stepped out of the crimescene perimeter and strapped her glock onto her hip tapped the grip a few times to orient her hand in case she needed to draw fast she went back to the grid finished with the evidence and turned quickly in the direction where shed seen the movement earlier the lights were blinding but she knew without doubt that a man was there in the shadows of the building studying her from the back of the crematorium maybe a worker but she wasnt taking any chances hand on her pistol she strode forward twenty feet her white jumpsuit made a nice target in the failing light but she decided not to waste time stripping it off she drew her glock and pushed fast through the bushes starting a painful jog on arthritic legs toward the figure but then sachs stopped grimacing as she looked at the loading dock of the crematorium where shed seen the intruder her mouth tightened angry at herself the man a silhouette against a streetlight outside the cemetery was a cop she could see the outline of the patrolmans hat and noted the slumped bored posture of a man on guard duty she called officer you see anybody over there no detective sachs he answered sure havent thanks she finished with the evidence then released the scene to the medical examiner tour doctor returning to her car she opened the trunk and began stripping off the white jumpsuit she was chatting with the other officers from the cs main headquarters in queens they too had changed out of their own overalls one frowned and was looking around for something hed misplaced lose something she asked the man frowned yeah it was right here my hat sachs froze what its missing shit she tossed the jumpsuit into the trunk and jogged fast to the sergeant from the local precinct who was the immediate supervisor here did you have anybody secure the loading dock she asked breathlessly over there naw i didnt bother we had the whole area sealed and goddamnit turning she sprinted to the loading dock her glock in hand she shouted to the officers nearby he was here by the crematorium move sachs paused at the old redbrick structure noticing the open gate leading out to the street a fast search of the grounds revealed no sign of she continued on to the street and looked out fast left and right traffic curious onlookersdozens of thembut the suspect was gone sachs returned to the loading dock and wasnt surprised to find the police officers hat lying nearby it sat next to a sign leave caskets here she collected the hat slipped it into an evidence bag and returned to the other officers sachs and a local precinct sergeant sent officers around the neighborhood to see if anybody had spotted him then she returned to her car of course hed be far away by now but still she couldnt shake the raw uneasinesswhich was due mostly to the fact that he hadnt tried to escape when he saw her walking toward the crematorium but casually stood his ground though what chilled her the most was the memory of his casual voicereferring to her by name are they going to do it rhyme snapped as lon sellitto walked through the door from his mission downtown with captain malloy and the deputy mayor ron scott about what rhyme was calling the expert plan theyre not happy its expensive and they bullshit get somebody on the phone hold on hold on theyll do it theyre making the arrangements im just saying theyre grumbling about it you should have told me up front they agreed i dont care how much they grumble joe malloyll give me a call with the details at around pm the door opened and amelia sachs entered carrying the evidence shed collected at the groundskeepers murder scene he was there she said rhyme didnt understand her five twentytwo at the cemetery he was watching us no shit sellitto said he was gone by the time i realized it she held up a patrolmans hat and explained that hed been watching her in disguise the fuck hed do that for information rhyme said softly the more he knows the more powerful he is the more vulnerable we become you canvass sellitto asked a team from the precinct did nobody saw anything he knows everything we know zilch she unpacked the crate as rhymes eyes took in each evidencecollection bag she lifted out they struggled could be some good transfer trace lets hope i talked to abrera the janitor he said that for the past month hes noticed some strange things his time sheets were changed there were deposits into his checking account he didnt make cooper suggested like jorgensenidentity theft no no rhyme said ill bet five twentytwo was grooming him to take the fall maybe a suicide plant a note on himit was his wife and childs grave thats right sure hes despondent going to kill himself confesses to all the crimes in a suicide note we close the case but the groundskeeper interrupts him in the act and now five twentytwos up a creek he cant try this again well be expecting a fake suicide now hell have to try something else but what cooper had started going over the evidence no hairs in the hat no trace at allbut you know what ive got a bit of adhesive generic though cant source it he removed the trace with tape or a roller before he left the hat rhyme said grimacing nothing did would surprise him anymore cooper then announced from the other sceneby the graveive got a fiber its similar to the rope used in the earlier crime good whats in it cooper prepared the sample and tested it a short time later he announced okay got two things the most common is naphthalene in an inert crystal medium mothballs rhyme announced the substance had figured in a poisoning case years ago but theyd be old ones he explained that naphthalene had largely been abandoned in favor of safer materials or he added from out of the country fewer safety codes on consumer products in a lot of places then something else cooper gestured at the computer screen the substance it revealed was nachnhsoo and its bound with lecithin carnauba wax citrus acid what the hells that rhyme blurted another database was consulted sodium cyclamate oh artificial sweetener right thats it cooper said reading banned by the fda thirty years ago the bans still under challenge but no products have been made with it since the seventies then rhymes mind made a few leaps mimicking his eyes as they jumped from item to item on the evidence boards old cardboard mold desiccated tobacco the dolls hair old soda and boxes of mothballs what the hell does it add up to does he live near an antiques store over one they continued the analysis minute traces of phosphorus sesquisulfide the main ingredient in safety matches more trade center dust and leaves from a dieffenbachia also called leopard lily it was a common houseplant other evidence included paper fibers from yellow legal pads probably two different ones because of the color variations in the dyes but they werent distinctive enough to trace to a source also more of the spicy substance that rhyme had found in the knife used to murder the coin collector this time they had enough to properly examine the grains and the color its cayenne pepper cooper announced sellitto mumbled used to be you could pin somebody to a latin neighborhood with that now you can get salsa and hot sauce everywhere whole foods to elevens the only other clue was a shoeprint in the dirt of a recently dug grave near the site of the killing sachs deduced it was s because it appeared to have been left by someone running from that area toward the exit comparing the electrostatic print with the database of shoe treadmarks revealed that s shoes were wellworn size skechers a practical though not particularly stylish model often worn by workers and hikers while sachs took a phone call rhyme told thom to write the details on the chart as he dictated rhyme stared at the informationmuch more than when theyd

compliance department assistant smiled agreeably pulaski figured he must really love his job to be still working so latejust after ninethirty but then the cop realized he himself was still on the job another killing and that same guy did it were pretty sure the young man frowned im sorry jesus when about three hours ago they were in whitcombs office which was a lot homier than sterlings and sloppier too which made it more comfortable he set aside the legal pad he was jotting on and gestured at a chair pulaski sat noting pictures of family on his desk some nice paintings on the walls along with diplomas and some professional certificates pulaski had glanced up and down the quiet halls extremely glad that cassel and gillespie the school bullies werent here say that your wife my sister whitcomb gave a smile but pulaski had seen that look before it meant thiss a tough subject had the woman died no it was the other answer im divorced keep pretty busy here tough to have a family the young man waved his arm indicating ssd pulaski supposed but its important work real important im sure it is after trying to reach andrew sterling pulaski called whitcomb who had agreed to meet the cop and hand over the time sheets for that dayto see which of their suspects had been out of the office at the time the groundskeeper was killed ive got some coffee pulaski noted that the man had a silver tray on his desk with two china cups i remembered how you liked it thanks the slim man poured sipping the coffee it was good pulaski was looking forward to the day when finances improved and he could afford a cappuccino maker he loved his coffee you work late every night pretty often government regulationsre tough in any industry but in the information business the problem is that nobodys quite sure what they want for instance states can make a lot of money selling drivers license information some places the citizens go ballistic and the practices banned but in other states its perfectly okay some places if your company gets hacked you have to notify the customers whose information gets stolen whatever kind of data it is in other states you only have to tell them if its financial information some you dont have to tell them anything its a mess but weve got to stay on top of it thinking of security breaches pulaski was stabbed by guilt that hed stolen the emptyspace data from ssd whitcomb had been with him around the time hed downloaded the files would the compliance officer get into trouble if sterling found out about it so here we go whitcomb handed him about twenty pages of time sheets for that day pulaski flipped through them comparing the names with their suspects first he noted the time miguel abrera had lefta little after pm then pulaskis heart jolted when he happened to glance down at the name sterling the man had left just seconds after miguel as if he were following the janitor but then pulaski realized that hed made a mistake it was andy sterling the son whod left then the ceo had left earlierat about fourand had returned only about a half hour ago presumably after business drinks and dinner again he was angry with himself that he hadnt read the sheet properly and hed nearly called lincoln rhyme when hed seen the two departure times so close together how embarrassing would that have been think better he told himself angrily of the other suspects faruk mamedathe nightshift technician with the attitudehad been in ssd at the time of the killing technical operations director wayne gillespies entries revealed that hed left a half hour before abrera but hed returned to the office at six and stayed for several hours pulaski felt a petty disappointment that this seemed to take the bully off the list all the others had left with enough time to follow miguel to the cemetery or to precede him there and lie in wait in fact most employees were out of the office sean cassel he noticed had been out for much of the afternoon but had returneda half hour ago helpful whitcomb asked a little you mind if i keep this no go right ahead thanks pulaski folded the sheets and put them into his pocket oh i talked to my brother hes going to be in town next month dont know if youd be interested but i was thinking you might like to meet him maybe you and your brother you could swap cop stories then whitcomb smiled embarrassed as if that was the last thing police officers wanted to do which it wasnt pulaski could have told him cops loved cop stories if the case you know is solved by then or what do you say closed like that tv show the closer sureif its closed probably cant have a beer with a suspect youre hardly a suspect mark pulaski said laughing himself but yeah its probably better to wait ill see if my brother can make it too mark a soft voice spoke from behind them pulaski turned to see andrew sterling black slacks and a white shirt sleeves rolled up a pleasant smile officer pulaski youre here so often i should put you on payroll a bashful grin i called the phone went to your voice mail really the ceo frowned then the green eyes focused thats right martin left early today anything we can help you with pulaski was about to mention the time sheets but whitcomb jumped in fast ron was saying theres been another murder no really by the same person pulaski realized hed made a mistake going around andrew sterling was stupid it wasnt as if he thought sterling was guilty or would try to hide anything the cop just wanted the information quicklyand frankly he also wanted to avoid running into cassel or gillespie which mightve happened if hed gone to executive row for the time sheets but now he realized hed gotten information about ssd from a source that wasnt andrew sterlinga sin if not an outright crime he wondered if the businessman could sense his discomfort he said we think so seems like the killer had originally targeted an ssd employee but ended up killing a bystander which employee miguel abrera sterling immediately recognized the name in maintenance yes is he all right hes fine a little shaken up but okay why was he targeted do you think he knows something i cant say pulaski told him when did this happen about six sixthirty tonight sterling squinted faint wrinkles into the skin around his eyes ive got a solution what you should do is get your suspects time sheets officer thatd narrow down the ones with alibis i ill take care of it andrew whitcomb said quickly sitting down at his computer ill get them from human resources to pulaski he said it shouldnt take long good sterling said and let me know what you find yes andrew the ceo stepped closer looking up into pulaskis eyes he shook his hand firmly good night officer when he was gone pulaski said thanks i shouldve asked him first yeah you should have i assumed you did the one thing that andrew doesnt like is to be kept in the dark if he has the information even if its bad news hes happy youve seen the reasonable side of andrew sterling the unreasonable side doesnt seem much different but it is believe me you wont get in trouble will you a laugh as long as he doesnt find out i got the time sheets an hour before he suggested it as pulaski walked toward the elevator with whitcomb he glanced back there at the end of the corridor was andrew sterling talking to sean cassel their heads down the sales director was nodding pulaskis heart bumped hard then sterling strode off cassel turned and polishing his glasses with the black cloth looked directly at pulaski he smiled a greeting his expression the officer read said the businessman wasnt the least surprised to see him there the elevator arrival bell dinged and whitcomb gestured pulaski inside the phone rang in rhymes lab ron pulaski reported what hed learned at ssd about the whereabouts of the suspects sachs transcribed the information on the suspects chart only two were in the office at the time of the killingmameda and gillespie so it could be any one of the other half dozen rhyme muttered the place was virtually empty the young officer said not many people were in late they dont need to be sachs pointed out the computers do all the work rhyme told pulaski to go on home to his family he pressed back into his headrest and stared at the board andrew sterling president chief executive officer alibion long island verified confirmed by son sean

support manager day shift alibiin office according to time sheets faruk mameda technical service and support manager night shift no alibi alibi for groundskeepers killing in office according to time sheets client of ssd awaiting list from nypd computer crimes unit unsub recruited by andrew sterling but was one of them at all rhyme wondered once again he thought of what sachs had told him about the concept of noise in data mining were these names just noise distractions keeping them from the truth rhyme executed a smart turn on the tdx and again faced the whiteboards something nagged what was it lincoln shh something hed read or heard about no a casefrom years ago hovering just out of memory frustrating like trying to scratch an itch on his ear he was aware of cooper looking at him that irritated too he closed his eyes almost yes what is it apparently hed spoken out loud i think ive got it thom you follow popular culture dont you what on earth does that mean you read magazines newspapers look at ads are tareyton cigarettes still made i dont smoke ive never smoked id rather fight than switch lon sellitto announced what that was the ad in the sixties people with a black eye dont recall it my dad used to smoke em are they still made thats what im asking i dont know but you dont see em much exactly and the other tobacco we found was old too so whether or not he smokes its a reasonable assumption he collects cigarettes cigarettes what kind of collector is that no not just cigarettes the old soda with the artificial sweetener maybe cans or bottles and mothballs matches dolls hair and the mold the stachybotrys chartarum the dust from the trade towers i dont think its that hes downtown i think he just hasnt cleaned in years a grim laugh and what other collection have we been dealing with lately data five twentytwos obsessed with collecting i think hes a hoarder a what he hoards things he never throws anything away thats why theres so much old yeah i think ive heard of that sellitto said its weird creepy rhyme had once searched a scene where a compulsive hoarder had died crushed to death under a pile of bookswell he was immobilized and took two days to die of internal injuries rhyme described the cause of death as unpleasant he hadnt studied the condition much but hed learned that new york had a task force to help hoarders get therapeutic assistance and protect them and their neighbors from their compulsive behavior lets give our resident shrink a call terry dobyns maybe he knows somebody at the hoarding task force have him check and get him over here in person at this hour cooper asked its after ten rhyme didnt even bother to offer the punch line of the day were not sleeping why should anyone else a look conveyed the message just fine chapter thirtytwo lincoln rhyme had his second wind thom had fixed food again and although rhyme generally took no particular pleasure in eating hed enjoyed the chicken club sandwiches with the aides homemade bread its james beards recipe the aide announced though the reference to the revered chef and cookbook author was utterly lost on rhyme sellitto had wolfed down one sandwich and taken another with him when he left for home even better than the tuna he judged mel cooper asked for the bread recipe for gretta sachs was on the computer sending some emails rhyme was going to ask what she was doing when the doorbell rang a moment later thom ushered into the lab terry dobyns the nypd behaviorist whom rhyme had known for years he was a little balder a little thicker in the belly than when theyd first metwhen dobyns had sat with rhyme for hours at a time during that terrible time after the accident that left him paralyzed the doctor still had the same kind perceptive eyes that rhyme recalled and a calming nonjudgmental smile the criminalist was skeptical of psychological profiling preferring forensics but he had to admit that dobyns had from time to time offered brilliant and helpful insights into the perps rhyme pursued he now said hello to everyone took coffee from thom and declined food he sat on a stool next to rhymes wheelchair good call about the hoarding i think youre right and first let me tell you that i checked with the task force and they looked into the known hoarders in the city there arent many and the odds are that its none of them i eliminated the women since you told me about the rape of the men most are elderly or nonfunctioning the only two that fit the functioning profile are in staten island and the bronx and they were accounted for by social workers or family members at the time of the killing on sunday rhyme wasnt surprised was too smart not to cover his tracks but hed hoped for a small lead at least and scowled at the dead end dobyns couldnt help but smile this had been an issue theyd dealt with years ago rhyme had never been comfortable expressing personal anger and frustration professionally though hed always been a master at it but i can give you some insights that might be helpful now let me tell you about hoarders its a form of obsessivecompulsive disorder that occurs when a subject is faced with conflict or tensions they cant emotionally confront focusing on a behavior is much easier than looking at the underlying problem hand washing and counting are symptoms of ocd so is hoarding now its rare for somebody who hoards to be dangerous per se there are health risksanimal and insect infestation mold and fire hazardsbut essentially hoarders just want to be left alone theyd live surrounded by their collection if they could and never go outside but your fellow well hes a strange breed a combination of narcissistic antisocial personality and hoarding ocd if he wants somethingapparently collectible coins or paintings or sexual gratificationhe has to have it absolutely has to killing is nothing to him if it helps him acquire what he wants and protect his collection in fact id go so far as to suggest that killing calms him down living humans give him stress they would disappoint him theyd abandon him but inanimate objectsnewspapers cigar boxes candy even bodiesyou can tuck away in your lair they never betray you i dont suppose youre interested in the childhood factors that may have made him that way not really terry sachs said she was smiling at rhyme who was shaking his head first hes going to need space a lot of it and with the real estate prices here hes either very resourceful or very rich hoarders tend to live in big older houses or town houses they never rent they cant stand the thought of a landlord with rights to come into their living area and the windows will be painted black or taped over he has to keep the outside world away how much space she asked rooms and rooms and rooms some of the ssd employees would have plenty of money rhyme speculated the senior people now because your perp is so high functioning hell be leading two lives well call them the secret life and the façade he needs to exist in the real worldto add to his collection and maintain it and so hell keep up appearances hell probably have a second house or a part of a single one thatll appear normal oh hed prefer to live in his secret place but if he did only there people would start to take notice so hell also have a living space that seems like anybody in his socioeconomic situation would have the residences might be connected or nearby the ground floor could be normal the upstairs where he keeps his collection or the basement as for his personality hell play a role in his façade life thats almost the opposite of who he really is say the real five twentytwos personality is snide and petty the public five twentytwo will be measured calm mature polite he could appear to be a businessman oh easily and hell play the part very very well because he has to it makes him angry resentful but he knows if he doesnt his trove could be endangered and thats simply not acceptable to him dobyns looked over the charts he nodded now i notice youre wondering about children i really doubt he has any he probably just collects toys that again is something about his childhood hell be single too its rare to find a married hoarder his obsession with collecting is too intense he wouldnt want to share his time or space with another personand frankly its hard to find a partner whos so codependent she puts up with him okay the tobacco and matches he hoards cigarettes and matchbooks but i doubt very much he smokes most hoarders have huge stockpiles of papers and magazines flammable objects this perp isnt stupid hed never risk a fire because it could destroy his collection or at least expose him when the fire department comes and he probably has no particular interest in coins or art he has an obsession with collecting for its own sake what he collects is secondary so he probably doesnt live near an antiques store dobyns gave a laugh thats exactly what his placell look like but of course without customerswell i cant think of much else except to tell you how dangerous he is from what youve told me youve already stopped him several times that makes him furious hell kill anybody who interferes with his trove kill them without a second thought i cant impress that on you enough they thanked dobyns he wished them luck and the psychologist left sachs updated the unsub list based on what hed told them unsub profile

gillespie came the closest he seemed just plain odd but cassel seemed the slickestin terms of putting on a good façade arlonzokempers married which takes him out of the running according to terry i didnt see the technicians ron did with an electronic trill a caller id box popped up on the screen it was lon sellitto back home but apparently still at work on the expert plan that rhyme and the detective had put together earlier command answer phonelon how are we doing its all set linc where are we watch the eleven oclock news youll find out im going to bed rhyme disconnected and turned on the tv in the corner of the lab mel cooper said good night he was packing up his briefcase when his computer dinged he looked over the screen amelia youve got an email here she wandered over sat down is it the colorado state police about gordon rhyme asked sachs said nothing but he noticed an eyebrow rise as she read through the lengthy document her finger disappeared into her long red hair tied back in a ponytail and worried her scalp what ive got to go she said she rose quickly sachs what is it its not about the case call me if you need me and with that she was out the door leaving behind a cloud of mystery as subtle as the aroma of the lavender soap shed been favoring recently the case was moving fast and yet cops always have to juggle other aspects of their lives which was why she was now standing uneasily in front of a tidy detached house in brooklyn not far from her own home the night was pleasant a delicate breeze fragrant with lilac and mulch waltzed around her it would be good to sit on the curb or a door stoop here and not do what she was about to what she had to do god i hate this pam willoughby appeared in the doorway she was wearing sweats and had her hair pulled back in a ponytail she was talking to one of the other foster children another teenager their faces had that conspiratorial yet innocent expression teenage girls wear like makeup two dogs played at their feet jackson the tiny havanese and a much larger but equally exuberant briard cosmic cowboy who lived with pams foster family the policewoman would meet the girl here occasionally then theyd head off for a movie or starbucks or ice cream pams face usually brightened when she saw sachs not tonight sachs got out of the car and leaned against the hot hood pam picked up jackson and joined her as the other girl waved to sachs and disappeared into the house with cosmic cowboy sorry to come by so late its okay the girl was cautious hows homework homeworks homework somes good some sucks true now true in sachss day sachs petted the dog which pam clutched possessively she did this often with her things the girl always refused offers to let someone else carry her book bag or groceries sachs guessed that so much had been taken away from her she held tight to whatever she could so whats up she could think of no way to ease gently into the subject i talked to your friend friend pam asked stuart you what light fragmented by leaves of a ginkgo tree fell on her troubled face i had to no you didnt pami was worried about you i had a friend in the departmentsomebody who does security checkslook him up no i wanted to see if there were any skeletons in his closet you didnt have any right to do that true but i did anyway and i just got an email back sachs felt her stomach muscles clench facing killers driving mphthose were nothing she was shaken badly now so is he a fucking murderer pam snapped a serial killer a terrorist sachs hesitated she wanted to touch the girls arm but didnt no honey buthes married in the dappled light sachs saw pam blink hesmarried im sorry his wifes a teacher too a private school on long island and he has two children no youre wrong sachs saw pams free hand was clenched so tightly the muscles had to be cramping anger filled her eyes but there wasnt much surprise sachs wondered if pam would be running through certain memories maybe stuart had said he didnt have a home phone only a mobile or maybe hed asked her to use a particular email account not his general one and my house is such a mess id be embarrassed for you to see it im a teacher you know were absentminded i need to get a housekeeper pam blurted its a mistake youve got him mixed up with somebody else i went to see him just now i asked him and he told me no you didnt youre making it up the girls eyes flared and a cold smile crossed her face cutting deep into sachss heart youre doing just what my mother did when she didnt want me to do something she lied to me just like youre doing pam id never everybody takes things away from me youre not going to i love him and he loves me and youre not taking him away she wheeled and made for the house the dog firmly under her arm pam sachss voice choked no honey as the girl stepped inside she looked back once fast hair swirling posture stiff as iron leaving amelia sachs grateful that the backlight prevented her from seeing pams face she couldnt have stomached witnessing the hatred she knew was there the travesty at the cemetery still burns like fire miguel should have died should be pinned to a velvet board for the police to examine theyd say case closed and all would be well but he didnt that butterfly got away i cant try to fake a suicide again theyve learned something about me theyve collected some knowledge hate them hate them hate them hate them im so close to taking my razor and storming out and calm down but its becoming harder and harder to do that as the years go by ive canceled certain transactions for this eveningi was going to celebrate the suicideand now i head into my closet being surrounded by my treasures helps i wander through the fragrant rooms and hold several items close to me trophies from various transactions over the past year feeling the dried flesh and fingernails and hair against my cheek is such a comfort but im exhausted i sit down in front of the harvey prescott painting gaze up at it the family looking back as with most portraits their eyes follow you wherever you are comforting eerie too maybe one of the reasons i love his work so much is that these people were created fresh they have no memories to plague them to make them edgy to keep them up all night and to drive them out into the streets collecting treasures and trophies ah memories june five years old father sits me down tucks his unlit cigarette away and explains to me im not theirs we brought you into the family because we wanted you wanted you badly and we love you even if you arent our natural son you

sixteens screaming at the climax of a transaction those pursuing metheywill soon be dead and dust and ill be living out my days happily with my twodimensional family and my treasures here in the closet my soldiers the data are about to march into battle im like hitler in his berlin bunker ordering his waffenss troops to meet the invaders data are invincible i see now that its nearly pm time for the news i need to see what they know about the death at the cemetery and what they dont on goes the tv the station has gone live to city hall now the deputy mayor ron scott a distinguishedlooking man is explaining that the police have put together a task force to investigate a recent murder and rape and a murder this evening in a queens cemetery which seems related to the earlier crime scott introduces an nypd inspector joseph malloy who will discuss the case more specifically though he doesnt not really he shows a composite of the perpetrator that resembles me only in the way it resembles about other men in the city white or lightskinned oh please he tells people to be cautious we think the perpetrator has used techniques of identity theft to get close to his victims lower their defenses be wary he goes on to say of anyone you dont know but who has knowledge of your purchases bank accounts vacation plans traffic violations even little things you wouldnt normally pay attention to in fact the city has just flown in an expert in information management and security from carnegie mellon university dr carlton soames will spend the next few days assisting the investigators and advising them on the issue of identity theft which they believe is the best way to find the perpetrator soames looks like a typical ruffledhaired smalltown midwest boy gone smart an awkward grin suit a little off center glasses a bit smudged the asymmetrical glare tells me and how much wear would that wedding ring show plenty ill bet he looks like the sort who married early he doesnt say anything but gazes out like a nervous animal at the press and the camera captain malloy continues in an age when identity theft is increasing and the consequences are increasingly grave the pun obviously unintentional is unfortunate we take seriously our responsibility to protect the citizens of this city the reporters jump into the fray pelting the deputy mayor captain and unsettled professor with questions a thirdgrader could have come up with malloy generally demurs the word ongoing is his shield deputy mayor ron scott reassures the public that the city is safe and everything is being done to protect them the press conference ends abruptly we go back to the regular news if you can call it that tainted veggies in texas a woman on a hood of a truck caught in a missouri flood the president has a cold i shut off the set and sit in my dim closet wondering how best to process this new transaction an idea occurs to me its so obvious though that im skeptical but surprise it takes only three phone callsto hotels close to one police plazato find the one where dr carlton soames is registered iv amelia tuesday may there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment how often or on what system the thought police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time george orwell chapter thirtythree amelia sachs arrived early but lincoln rhyme had been awake earlier unable to sleep soundly because of the plans unfolding presently both here and in england hed had dreams about his cousin arthur and his uncle henry sachs joined him in the exercise room where thom was getting rhyme back into the tdx wheelchair after hed done five miles on the electrologic stationary bicycle part of his regular exercise scheme to improve his condition and to keep his muscles toned for the day when they might once again begin to replace the mechanical systems that now ran his life sachs took over while the aide went downstairs to fix breakfast it was a hallmark of their relationship that rhyme had long ago lost any qualms about her helping him with his morning routine which many people would find unpleasant sachs had spent the night at her place in brooklyn so now he updated her on the situation but she was distracted he could see when he asked why she exhaled slowly and told him its pam and she explained that pams boyfriend had turned out to be her former teacher and a married one at that no rhyme winced im sorry the poor kid his initial reaction was to threaten this stuart into getting the hell out of the picture youve got a shield sachs flash it hell head for the hills or ill give him a call if you want sachs however didnt think that was the right way to handle the matter im afraid if im too pushy or i report him ill lose her if i dont do anything shes in for a lot of grief god what if she wants to have his baby she dug a nail into her thumb stopped herself itd be different if id been her mother all along id know how to handle it would you rhyme asked she considered this then conceded with a smile okay maybe notthis parent stuff kids ought to come with an owners manual in the bedroom they had breakfast which sachs fed to rhyme like the parlor and the lab downstairs the bedroom was far homier than it had been when sachs first saw it years ago back then the place had been stark the only decorations art posters tacked up backward and used as impromptu whiteboards for the first case theyd worked on together now those posters had been turned around and others added of paintings that rhyme enjoyedimpressionistic landscapes and moody urban scenes by artists like george inness and edward hopper then she sat back next to his wheelchair and took his right hand the one in which hed recently regained some control and touch he could feel her fingertips though the sensation was odd a step or two removed from the pressure hed sense on his neck or face where the nerves worked normally it was as if her hand were water trickling onto his skin he willed his fingers to close on hers and felt the pressure of her response silence but he sensed through her posture that she wanted to talk about pam and he said nothing waiting for her to continue he watched the peregrine falcons on the ledge aware taut the female larger the pair were muscular bundles of readiness falcons hunt by day and there were fledglings to feed rhyme what he asked you still havent called him have you who your cousin ah not pams situation that shed been thinking of arthur rhyme had never occurred to him no i havent you know something else i didnt even know you had a cousin never mentioned him no you talked about your uncle henry and aunt paula but not arthur why not we work too hard no time for chitchat he smiled she didnt should he tell her rhyme debated his first reaction was not to because the explanation reeked of selfpity and that was poison to lincoln rhyme still she deserved to know something thats what happens in love in the shaded portions where the two spheres of different lives meet certain fundamentalsmoods loves fears angerscant be hidden thats the contract and so he told her now about adrianna and arthur about the bitterly cold day of the science fair and the lies later the embarrassing forensic examination of the corvette and even the potential engagement presenta chunk of atomicage concrete sachs nodded and rhyme laughed to himself because he knew shed be thinking what was the big deal a bit of teenage love a little duplicity a little heartbreak pretty small caliber in the arsenal of personal offenses how did something so pedestrian ruin such a deep friendship you two were like brothers but didnt judy say you and blaine used to visit them years later that sounds like everything got patched up oh yep we did i mean it was only a high school crush adrianna was prettya tall redhead as a matter of fact sachs laughed but hardly worth destroying a friendship over so theres more to the story isnt there rhyme said nothing at first then not long before my accident i went to boston he sipped some coffee through a straw i was speaking at an international conference on forensic science id finished the presentation and was in the bar afterward a woman came up to me she was a retired professor from mit shed been struck by my last name and said that shed had a student from the midwest in her class years ago his name was arthur rhyme was he any relation my cousin i told her she went on to tell me what an interesting thing arthur had done hed submitted a scientific paper with his application in lieu of an essay it was brilliant she said original well researched rigorousoh if you want to compliment scientists sachs say that their research is rigorous he fell silent briefly anyway she encouraged him to flesh it out and publish it in a journal but arthur never pursued it she hadnt stayed in touch with him and wondered if hed done any research in the area since i was curious i asked her what the subject was she actually remembered the title the biologic effects of certain nanoparticulate materialsoh and by the way sachs i wrote it you it was a paper id written for a science fair project came in second in the state it was some pretty original work i will admit arthur stole it yep even now after all these years the anger rippled within him but it gets worse go on after the conference i couldnt get what shed told me out of my head i contacted mits admissions they kept all the applications on microfiche they sent me a copy of mine something was wrong my application was what id sent them my signature but everything sent by the school from the counselors office had been altered art got a hold of my high school transcript and changed it he gave me bs instead of the as i really had hed forged new letters of recommendation which were lukewarm he made them sound like form letters they were probably the ones hed gotten from his teachers my uncle henrys recommendation wasnt included in my packet he took it out and hed replaced my essay with some generic whyiwanttogotomit crap he even added some very choice typos oh im sorry she squeezed his hand harder and adrianna worked in the counselors office right so she helped him no i thought so at first but i tracked her down and called her he gave a cool laugh we talked about life our marriages her kids careers then the past she always wondered why id cut things off the way i did i said i thought shed decided to go out with arthur that had surprised her and shed explained that no she was only doing art a favorhelping him with his college application hed come to her office a half dozen times simply to talk about schools look at some samples of essays letters of recommendation he said his own college counselor was terrible and he was desperate to get into a good school he asked her not to say anything to anyone especially me he was embarrassed that he needed the help so theyd snuck off together a few times she still felt guilty that art had made her lie about it and when she went to the bathroom or off to copy something he raided your file thats right why arthur never hurt a single soul in his life he isnt capable of it wrong judy are you absolutely sure sachs asked yep because right after i hung up with her i called arthur rhyme could hear the conversation almost verbatim why arthur tell me why no greeting other than this a pause arthurs breathing and even though years had passed since the transgression his cousin knew immediately what he was referring to no interest in how rhyme had found out no interest in denying or feigning ignorance or innocence his response to go on the offensive hed blustered angrily all right you want to know the answer lincoln ill tell you the prize at christmas mystified rhyme had asked the prize that my father gave you in the contest at the christmas eve party when we were seniors the concrete from the stagg field stadium rhyme had frowned in confusion what do you mean there had to be more to it than winning a souvenir of significance to only a handful of people in the world i deserved it his cousin had raged acting as if he were the victim father named me after the man in charge of the atomic project i knew hed kept the memento i knew he was going to give it to me when i graduated from high school or college it was going to be my graduation present id wanted it for years rhyme had been at a loss for words there they were grown men talking like children about a stolen comic book or piece of candy he gave away the one thing that was important to me and he gave it to you his voice was breaking was he crying arthur i just answered some questions it was a game a gamewhat kind of fucking game was that it was christmas eve we shouldve been singing carols or watching its a wonderful life but no no father had to turn everything into a fucking classroom it was embarrassing it was boring but nobody had the balls to say anything to the great professor jesus art it wasnt my fault it was just a prize i won i didnt steal anything from you a cruel laugh no well lincoln it ever occur to you that maybe you did what think about it maybemy father hed paused breathing deeply what the hellre you talking about you stole him did you ever wonder why i never tried out for varsity track because you had the lock on that and academically you were his other son not me you sat in on his classes at u of c you helped him with his research thiss crazy he asked you to come to class too i know he did once was enough for me he picked me apart until i wanted to cry he crossexamined everybody art thats why he was so brilliant he made you think he pushed you until you got the right answer but some of us could never get the right answer i was good but i wasnt great and the son of henry rhyme was supposed to be great it didnt matter though because he had you robert went to europe marie moved to california and even then he didnt want me he wanted you the other son i didnt ask for the role i didnt sabotage you didnt you ah mr innocent you didnt play the game you just accidentally drove up to our house on weekends even when i wasnt there you didnt invite him to come to your track meets sure you did answer me which of them would you really want for a father mine or yours did your father ever fawn over you ever whistle for you from the stands give you that raised eyebrow of approval thats all bullshit rhyme had snapped youve got some issue with your father and what do you do you sabotage me i couldve gotten into mit but you ruined that and my whole life changed if it werent for you everything wouldve been different well i can say the same about you lincoln i can say the same a harsh laugh did you even try with your father what do you think he felt having a son like you who was a hundred times smarter than he was going off all the time because hed rather hang out with his uncle did you even give teddy a chance at that rhyme had slammed the phone into the cradle it was the last time they talked several months later he was paralyzed at the crime scene everything wouldve been different after hed explained this to sachs she said thats why he never came to see you after you were hurt he nodded back then after the accident all i could do was lie in bed and think that if art hadnt changed the application i would have gotten into mit and maybe done graduate work at boston university or joined the bpd or come to new york earlier or later in any case i probably wouldntve been at the subway crime scene and his voice dissolved to silence the butterfly effect she said a small thing in the past makes a big difference in the future rhyme nodded and he knew that sachs could take in this information with sympathy and understanding and make no judgments about the broader implicationswhich he would choose walking and leading a normal life or being a crip and perhaps a far better criminalist because of itand of course being her partner this was the type of woman amelia sachs was he gave a faint smile the funny thing is sachs there was something to what he said my own father never seemed to notice me at all he certainly never challenged me the way my uncle did i did feel like uncle henrys other son and i liked it hed come to realize that maybe subconsciously he had been pursuing boisterous fulloflife henry rhyme he was pelted with a dozen fast memories of the times hed been embarrassed by his fathers shyness but its no excuse for what he did she said no its not still she began youre going to say that it happened a long time ago let bygones be bygones water over dams and under bridges something like that she offered with a smile judy said he asked about you hes reaching out forgive him you two were like brothers rhyme glanced over the still topography of his immobile body then back to sachs he said softly im going to prove hes innocent ill get him out of jail ill give him his life back thats not the same rhyme maybe not but its the best i can do sachs began to speak perhaps to make her case again but the subject of arthur rhyme and his betrayal vanished as the phone buzzed and on the computer screen came lon sellittos number command answer phone lon where are we hey linc just wanted to let you know our computer experts on his way the guy was familiar the doorman thoughtthe man who nodded pleasantly as he left the water street hotel he nodded back the guy was on his cell phone and he paused near the door as people eased around him he was talking the doorman deduced to his wife then the tone changed patty sweetheart a daughter after a brief conversation about a soccer game he was back on with the wife sounding more adult but still adoring he fell into a certain category the doorman knew been married fifteen years faithful looked forward to getting homewith a bag of tacky heartfelt presents he wasnt like some guests the businessman whod arrive wearing his wedding ring and leave for dinner with finger naked or the tipsy businesswoman being escorted into the elevator by a hunky coworker they never shed their rings they didnt need to the things a doorman knows i could write a book but the question nagged why was this guy so familiar and then he was saying to the wife with a laugh you saw me it made the news there mom did too saw him a tv celebrity wait wait almost there ah got it last night watching the news on tv surethis guy was a professor or doctor of some kind sloaneor soames a computer expert from some fancy school the one that ron scott the assistant mayor or whatever was talking about the prof was helping the police with that rape and murder on sunday and some other crime then the professors face went still and he said sure honey dont worry ill be fine he disconnected and looked around hey sir the doorman said saw you on tv the professor smiled shyly did you he seemed embarrassed by the attention say can you tell me how to get to one police plaza right up there about five blocks by city hall you cant miss it thanks good luck the doorman was watching a limo approach pleased that hed had a brush with a semicelebrity something to tell his own wife about then he felt a thunk on his back almost painful as another man hurried out the door of the hotel and pushed past him the guy didnt look back and said nothing by way of apology prick thought the doorman watching the man who was moving fast head down in the same direction as the professor the doorman didnt say anything though however rude they were you just put up with it they could be guests or friends of guests or they could be guests next week or even executives from the home office testing you just put up and shut up that was the rule the tv professor and the rude asshole faded from the doormans thoughts as a limo stopped and he stepped forward to open the door he got a nice view of soft cleavage as the guest climbed out it was better than a tip which he knew absolutely knew she wasnt going to give him anyway i could write a book chapter thirtyfour death is simple ive never understood why people complicate it movies for instance im not a fan of thrillers but ive seen my share sometimes ill take a sixteen out on a date to stave off boredom to keep up appearances or because im going to kill her later and well sit in a movie theater and its easier than dinner you dont have to talk so much and i watch the film and think what on earth is going on up there on the screen setting up these contrived ways to kill why use wires and electronics and elaborate weapons and plots when you can walk up to someone and beat them to death with a hammer in thirty seconds simple efficient and make no mistake the police are smart and hows this for irony a lot of them have ssd and innercircle helping them out the more complicated the scheme the more chance of leaving behind something they can use to track you down the more chance for witnesses and my plans today for this sixteen im following through the streets of lower manhattan are simplicity itself the failure at the cemetery yesterday is behind me now and im exhilarated im on a mission and as part of it ill be adding to one of my collections as i follow my target i dodge sixteens right and left why look at them all my pulse is picking up my head is throbbing at the thought that these sixteens are themselves collectionsof their past more information than we can comprehend dna is after all nothing more than a database of our bodies and genetic history stretching back millennia if you could plug that into hard drives how much data could you extract makes innercircle look like a commodore breathtaking but back to the task at hand i maneuver around a young sixteen smell her perfume which she dabbed on this morning in her staten island or brooklyn apartment in a sad attempt to exude competence and came off as cheaply seductive i move closer to my target feeling the comfort of the pistol against my skin knowledge may be one kind of power but there are others that are nearly as effective hey professor weve got some activity uhhuh roland bell replied his voice spilling from the speakers in the surveillance van where sat lon sellitto ron pulaski and several tactical officers bell an nypd detective who worked with rhyme and sellitto occasionally was on his way from the water street hotel to one police plaza hed traded his typical jeans work shirt and sports coat for a rumpled suit since he was playing the role of the fictional professor carlton soames or as hed put it in his north carolina drawl a stinkball on a hook and line bell now whispered into a lapel microphone as invisible as the tiny speaker in his ear how close hes behind you about fifty feet uhm bell was at the core of lincoln rhymes expert plan which was based on his increasing understanding of hes not taking our computer trap but hes dying for information i know it we need a different sort of trap hold a press conference and lure him out into the open have them announce that weve hired an expert and get somebody undercover up onstage youre assuming he watches tv oh hell be checking the media to see how were handling the case especially after the incident at the cemetery sellitto and rhyme had contacted somebody not connected with the caseroland bell was always game if he wasnt on another assignment rhyme had then called a friend at carnegie mellon university where hed lectured several times he told him about s crimes and the authorities at the school which was renowned for its work in hightechnology security agreed to help their webmaster added carlton soames phd to the schools web site rodney szarnek faked a résumé for soames and sent it out to dozens of science web sites then cobbled together a credible site for soames himself sellitto got a room for the professor at the water street hotel held the press conference and waited to see if would take the bait in this trap which apparently he had bell had left the water street hotel not long before and paused carrying on a credible but fake phone call and standing in the open long enough to make sure he caught s attention surveillance showed that a man had quickly left the hotel just after bell and was now following him you recognize him from ssd he one of the suspects on our list sellitto asked pulaski sitting beside him staring at the monitor four plainclothes officers were a block or so from bell two wore hidden video cameras on the crowded streets though it was hard to get a clear view of the killers face could be one of the service techs or weird it almost looks like andrew sterling himself or no maybe its that he kind of walks like him im not sure sorry sweating heavily in the hot van sellitto wiped his face then leaned forward and said into the mike okay professor five twentytwos moving up maybe forty feet behind you hes in a dark suit dark tie hes carrying a briefcase his gait profile suggests that hes armed most cops whove worked the street for a few years can recognize the difference in posture and walking patterns when a suspect is carrying a weapon gotcha commented the laconic officer who carried two pistols himself and was ambidextrously talented with them man sellitto muttered i hope this works okay roland go ahead with the right turn uhm rhyme and sellitto didnt believe that would shoot the professor on the street what would killing him accomplish rhyme speculated that the killers intent was to abduct soames to learn what the police knew then murder him later or perhaps threaten him and his family to have soames sabotage the investigation so the script called for roland bell to take a detour out of public view where would make his move and theyd nail him sellitto had found a construction site that would work well it featured a long sidewalk cordoned off to the public that was a shortcut to one police plaza bell would ignore the closed sign and head down the sidewalk where hed be lost to sight after thirty or forty feet a team was hiding at the far end to move in when approached the detective made the turn stepping around the barrier tape and heading up the dusty sidewalk while the rattle and slam of jackhammers and pile drivers filled the interior of the van from bells sensitive mike weve got you on visual roland sellitto said as one of the officers beside him hit a switch and another camera took up surveillance you watching linc no lon dancing with the celebrities is on jane fonda and mickey rooney are up next its dancing with the stars linc rhymes voice clattered into the van is five twentytwo going to make the turn or is he going to balkcome on come on sellitto moved the mouse and doubleclicked another image on a split screen popped up from a search and surveillance teams video camera it depicted a different angle bells back moving down the sidewalk away from the camera the detective was glancing with curiosity at the construction site as any normal passerby would a moment later appeared behind him keeping his distance looking around too though obviously with no interest in the workers he was scanning for witnesses or the police then he hesitated looked around once more and started to close the distance okay everybody heads up sellitto called hes moving up on you roland were going to lose you on visual in about five seconds so keep an eye out you copy yep said the easygoing officer as if answering a bartender whod asked if he wanted a glass with his bottle of budweiser chapter thirtyfive roland bell wasnt quite as calm as he sounded the widower father of two children a nice house in the burbs and a sweetheart down in the tarheel state he was getting pretty close to proposing toall those domestic things tended to add up on the negative side when you were asked to be a sitting duck on an undercover set still bell couldnt help but do his dutyparticularly when it came to a perp like this a rapist and killer a species of criminal that bell had a particular dislike for and truth be told he didnt mind the rush from ops like this one we all find our levels his daddy had often said and once the boy realized that the man wasnt talking about misplaced tools he embraced that philosophy as a cornerstone of his life his jacket was unbuttoned and his hand poised to draw aim and let fly with his favorite pistol an example of italys finest firepower he was glad lon sellitto had stopped his banter he needed to hear this fellows approach and the slam slam slam of the pile driver was plenty loud still concentrating hard he heard a scrape of shoes on the sidewalk behind him make it thirty feet bell knew the takedown team was in front of him though he couldnt see them or they him because of a sharp curve in the sidewalk the plan was for them to take as soon as the backdrop was safe and no bystanders were in danger this portion of the sidewalk was still partly visible from a nearby street and the construction site and theyd been gambling that the killer wouldnt attack until bell was closer to the tactical officers but he seemed to be moving in more quickly than theyd planned on bell hoped though that the man would hold off for a few minutes a firefight here could endanger a number of passersby and construction workers but the logistics of the takedown vanished from his mind as he heard two things simultaneously the sound of s footsteps breaking into a run toward him and much more alarming the cheerful spanish chatter of two women one pushing a baby carriage as they emerged from the back of the building right next to bell the tac officers had sealed off the sidewalk but apparently nobodyd thought to notify the superintendents of the buildings whose rear doors faced it bell glanced back and saw the women walk right in between him and who was staring at the detective and running forward in his hand was a gun weve got trouble civvies between us suspects armed repeat hes got a weapon move in bell started for his beretta but one of the women seeing screamed and jumped back slamming into bell knocking him to his knees his gun dropped to the sidewalk the killer blinked in shock and froze undoubtedly wondering why a college professor was armed but he recovered fast and aimed at bell who was going for his second gun no the killer shouted dont try it the officer could do nothing but lift his hands he heard sellitto say first teamll be there in thirty seconds roland the killer said nothing just snarled for the women to flee which they did and then he stepped forward gun on bells chest thirty seconds the detective thought breathing hard it might as well have been a lifetime walking from the parking garage to one police plaza captain joseph malloy was irritated that he hadnt heard anything about the set involving detective roland bell he knew sellitto and rhyme were desperate to find this perp and hed reluctantly agreed to the phony press conference but it really was over the line and he wondered what the fallout would be if it didnt work hell thered be fallout if it did work one of the top rules in city government dont fuck with the press especially in new york he was just reaching into his pocket for his cell phone when he felt something touch his back insistent and purposeful a pistol no no his heart galloped then came the voice calm do not turn around captain if you turn around youll see my face and that means youll die you understand he sounded educated surprising malloy for some reason wait do you understand yes dont at the next corner youre going to turn to the right into that alley and keep going but i dont have a silencer on the gun but the muzzle is close enough to your body that nobody will know where the sound came from and ill be gone before you hit the ground and the bullet will go through you and with these crowds im sure it will hit somebody else you dont want that who are you you know who i am joseph malloy had made a lifelong career in law enforcement and after his wife was killed by a drugcrazed burglar the profession became more than a career it was an obsession maybe he was brass an administrator now but he still had the instincts hed honed on the streets of midtown south precinct years ago he understood instantly five twentytwo what calm stay calm if youre calm youre in control youre the man who killed that woman on sunday and the groundskeeper in the cemetery last night what do you mean five twentytwo what the departments calling you internally an unknown subject unsub number five twentytwo give him some facts make him relax too carry on a conversation the killer gave a brief laugh a number thats interesting now turn to the right well if he wanted you dead youd be dead he just needs to know something or hes kidnapping you for leverage relax hes obviously not going to kill youhe doesnt want you to see his face okay lon sellitto said they were calling him the man who knew everything well get some information about him that you can use maybe you can talk your way out maybe you can lower his guard and get close enough to kill him with your bare hands joe malloy was perfectly capable of this both mentally and physically after a brief walk ordered him to stop in the alley he put a stocking cap over malloys head and pulled it down over his eyes good a huge relief as long as i dont see him ill live then his hands were taped and he was frisked a firm hand on his shoulder he was led forward and eased into a car trunk a drive in the stifling heat the uncomfortable space legs tucked up a compact car okay noted no burning oil and good suspension noted no smell of leather noted malloy tried to keep track of the directions they turned but that was impossible he paid attention to the sounds traffic noises a jackhammer nothing unique there and seagulls and a boat horn well hows that going to help pinpoint where you are manhattan is an island get something usefulwaitthe car has a noisy powersteering belt thats helpful tuck it away twenty minutes later they came to a stop he heard the rumble of a garage door closing a big one squeaky joints or wheels malloy gave a brief cry as the trunk popped startling him musty but cool air embraced him he gasped hard sucking oxygen into his lungs through the damp wool of the cap out we go there are some things id like to talk to you about im a captain i know who you are i have a lot of power in the department malloy was pleased his voice was steady he was sounding reasonable we can work something out come on over here five twentytwo helped him over the smooth floor then he was seated im sure you have grievances but i can help you tell me why youre doing this committing these crimes silence what would happen next would he have a chance to fight physically malloy wondered or would he have to continue to work his way into the mans mind by now hed be missed sellitto and rhyme might have figured out what happened then he heard a noise what was it several clicks followed by a tinny electronic voice the killer was testing a tape recorder it seemed then another the clink of metal against metal like tools being gathered up and finally the disturbing screech of metal on concrete as the killer scooted his chair so close to malloys that their knees touched chapter thirtysix a bounty hunter theyd caught a goddamn bounty hunter well as the man corrected a bond recovery specialist how the fuck did that happen was lincoln rhymes question were checking lon sellitto said standing dusty and hot beside the construction site where the man whod been following roland bell sat in cuffs he wasnt exactly under arrest in fact he hadnt done anything wrong at all he was licensed to carry a pistol and was merely trying to effect a citizens arrest of a man he believed to be a wanted criminal but sellitto was pissed off and ordered him cuffed roland bell himself was on the phone trying to find out if had been spotted elsewhere in the area but so far no one on the takedown teams had seen anyone fitting the scant profile of the killer might as well be in timbuktu bell drawled to sellitto and folded up his phone look began the bounty hunter from his curb perch shut up the heavy detective barked for the third or fourth time he returned to his conversation with rhyme he follows roland moves in and looks like hes going to take him out but seems hes just serving a warrant he thought roland was somebody named william franklin they look alike franklin and roland lives in brooklyn and missed a trial date on an assault with a deadly and firearm possession the bond companys been after him for six months five twentytwo set it all up you know he found this franklin in the system and sent the bondsman after him to keep us distracted i know linc anybody see anything helpful somebody staking us out nope roland just checked with all the teams silence then rhyme asked how did he know it was a trap though that wasnt the most important issue there was really only one question they wanted the answer to and that was what the hell is he really up to do they think im stupid did they think i wouldnt be suspicious they know about knowledge service providers at this point about predicting how sixteens will act based on past behavior and the behavior of others this concept has been a part of my life for a long long time it should be part of everyones how will your nextdoor neighbor react if you do x how will he react if you do y how will a woman behave when youre accompanying her to a car while youre laughing when youre silent and fishing in your pocket for something ive studied their transactions from the moment they became interested in me i sorted them analyzed them theyve been brilliant at timesfor instance that trap of theirs letting ssd employees and customers know about the investigation and waiting for me to peek at nypd files on the myra case i almost did came within an enter keystroke of searching but just had a feeling something was wrong i know now i was right and the press conference ah that transaction smelled off from the beginning hardly fit predictable and established patterns of behavior i mean for the police and the city to meet journalists at that time of night and the particular assemblage up on the podium certainly didnt ring true of course maybe it was legiteven the best fuzzy logic and predictive behavior algorithms get it wrong occasionally but it was in my interest to check further i couldnt even casually talk to any of them directly so instead i did what i do best i looked into the closets gazed through my secret window at the silent data i learned more about the folks up there on the podium during the press conference the deputy mayor ron scott and captain joseph malloythe man supervising the investigation against me and the third person the professor carlton soames phd exceptwell he wasnt he was a cop decoy a search engine request did turn up hits for professor soames on the carnegie mellon web site and on his own site as well his cv was also tucked away conveniently into various other sites but it took me only a few seconds to open up the coding of those documents and examine the metadata everything about the phony prof had been written and uploaded yesterday do they think im stupid if id had time i could have learned exactly who the cop was i could have gone to the tv networks web site archive found the press conference frozen an image of the mans face and done a biometric scan id compare that image to dmv records in the area and police and fbi personnel photos to come up with the mans real identity but that would have been a lot of work and unnecessary i didnt care who he was all i needed was to distract the police and give myself time to locate captain malloy the one who would be a veritable database of information about the operation i easily found an outstanding warrant for a man bearing a rough resemblance to the cop playing carlton soamesa white male in his thirties simple matter then to call the bail bondsman claiming to be an acquaintance of the fugitive and reporting that id spotted him at the water street hotel i described what he was wearing and hung up fast meanwhile i waited at the parking garage near police plaza where captain malloy parks his lowend lexus its oil change and wheel rotation long overdue the dealers data report every morning between and am i engaged the enemy at exactly there followed the abduction the drive to the warehouse on the west side and the judicious use of forged metal to execute a memory dump from the admirably courageous database im feeling the inexplicable morethansexual satisfaction of knowing ive completed a collection the identities of all the sixteens who are after me some of the people tethered to them and how theyre running the case some information was particularly revealing the name rhyme for instance thats the key as to why im in this fix i now understand my soldiers will soon be on their way marching into poland marching into the rhineland and as id hoped i got something for that collection of mine one of my favorites by the way i should wait until im back in my closet but i cant resist i fish for the tape recorder and i hit rewind then play a happy coincidence i find the exact spot where captain malloys screams hit a crescendo it chills even me he awoke from an uneasy sleep filled with bumpy nightmares his throat hurt from the garrote inside and out though the stinging was worse in his mouthfrom the dryness arthur rhyme glanced around at the dingy windowless hospital room well a cell in an infirmary inside the tombs no different from his own cell or that terrible common room where hed almost been murdered a male nurse or orderly came into the room examined an empty bed and wrote something down excuse me arthur rasped can i see a doctor the man looked his waya large african american arthur felt a surge of panic thinking this was antwon johnson whod stolen a uniform and snuck in here to finish what hed started but no it was somebody else still the eyes were just as cold and they spent no more time regarding arthur rhyme than they would glancing at a spill on the floor he left without a word a half hour passed arthur dipping into and out of waking then the door opened again and he glanced up startled as another patient was brought in hed had appendicitis arthur deduced the operation was over and he was recovering an orderly got him into bed he handed the man a glass don drink it rinse n spit the man drank no im tellin you he threw up fuck the orderly tossed a handful of paper towels at him and left arthurs fellow patient fell asleep clutching the towels it was then that arthur looked out the window in the door two men stood outside one latino one black the latter squinted staring directly at him then whispered something to the other who briefly looked too something about their posture and expressions told arthur their interest wasnt mere curiosityseeing the con whod been saved by mick the tweaker no they were memorizing his face why did they want to kill him too another surge of panic was it only a matter of time until they were successful he closed his eyes but then decided he shouldnt sleep he didnt dare theyd move on him when he was asleep theyd move on him if he closed his eyes theyd move on him if he didnt pay complete attention to everything everyone every minute and now his agony was complete judy had said that lincoln might have found something that could prove his innocence she didnt know what and so arthur had no way to judge if his cousin was simply being optimistic or if hed discovered some concrete proof that hed been wrongly arrested he was furious at this ambiguous hope before hed talked to judy arthur rhyme had resigned himself to a living hell and an impending death im doin you a favor man fuck youd do yourself in a month or two anyway now jus stop fightin it but now realizing that freedom might be attainable resignation blossomed into panic he saw in front of him some hope that could be taken away his heart began its manic thudding again he grabbed the call button pushed it once then again no response a moment later another pair of eyes appeared in the window but they werent a doctors was it one of the cons hed seen before he couldnt tell the man was looking directly at him struggling to control the fear that trickled down his spine like electricity he pressed the call button again then held it down still no response the eyes in the window blinked once then vanished chapter thirtyseven metadata on speakerphone rodney szarnek in the nypd computer lab was explaining to lincoln rhyme how most likely had learned that the expert was in fact an undercover cop sachs standing nearby with her arms crossed and fingers picking at her sleeve reminded him of what shed learned from calvin geddes of privacy now thats data about data embedded in documents right szarnek confirmed hearing her comment he probably saw that wed created the cv last night shit rhyme murmured well you cant think of everything then but you have to when youre up against the man who knows everything and now the plan which potentially could have netted him had been wasted the second time theyd failed and worse theyd tipped their hand just like theyd learned about his suicide ploy hed learned how they operated and had a defense against future tactics knowledge is power szarnek added i had somebody at carnegie mellon trace the addresses of everyone who was in their site this morning a half dozen hits originated in the city but they were from public terminals no trace of the users two were from proxies in europe and i know the servers they wont cooperate naturally now weve got some information from the emptyspace files ron got from ssd its taking some time they were he apparently decided to avoid the technical explanation and said pretty scrambled but weve got fragments coming together looks like somebody did assemble dossiers and download them weve got a nymthats a screen name or code name runnerboy thats all so far any idea who an employee customer hacker nope i called a friend in the bureau and checked their database for known nyms and email addresses they found about eight hundred runnerboys none in the metro area though well know more later rhyme had thom write the name runnerboy on the list of suspects well check with ssd see if thats a name anybody recognizes and the customer files on the cd ive got somebody going through it manually the code i wrote only got us so far therere too many variablesdifferent consumer products metro fare cards ezpasses most of the companies downloaded certain information from the victims but statistically nobodys jumping out as a suspect yet all right he disconnected we tried rhyme sachs said tried he offered a lifted eyebrow a gesture that meant absolutely nothing the phone buzzed and sellitto popped up on caller id command answer lon any linc something was wrong the tone through the speakerphone was hollow the voice shaky another vic sellitto cleared his throat he got one of us alarmed glancing at sachs who was involuntarily leaning forward toward the phone her arms unfolding who tell us joe malloy no whispered sachs rhymes eyes closed and his head eased into the wheelchairs headrest sure of course that was the setup lon he had it all planned his voice lowered how bad was it what do you mean asked sachs in a soft voice rhyme said he didnt just kill malloy did he sellittos quivering voice was wrenching no linc he didnt tell me sachs said bluntly what are you talking about rhyme looked at her eyes wide with the horror that they both felt he set up the whole thing because he wanted information he tortured joe to get it oh god right lon the big detective sighed he coughed yeah got to say it was pretty bad he used some tools and from the amount of blood joe held out for a long time the prick finished him off with a gunshot sachss face was red with anger she kneaded the grip of her glock through clenched jaws she asked did joe have kids rhyme recalled that the captains wife had been killed a few years ago sellitto answered a daughter in california i made the call already you okay about it sachs asked naw im not his voice cracked again rhyme didnt think hed ever heard the detective sound so upset in his mind he could hear joe malloys voice when he was responding to rhymes forgetting to share about the case the captain had looked beyond pettiness and backed them up even after the criminalist and sellitto hadnt been honest with him policing came before ego and had tortured and killed him simply because he needed information goddamn information but then from somewhere rhyme summoned the stone that resided within him the detachment that as some people had said meant he had a damaged soul but that he believed allowed him to better do his job he said firmly okay you know what this means dont you what sachs asked hes declaring war war it was sellitto who asked this question on us hes not going underground hes not running hes telling us to go fuck ourselves hes fighting back and he thinks he can get away with it killing brass oh yeah hes drawn the battle line and he knows all about us now maybe joe didnt tell him sachs said no he told he did everything he could to hold out but in the end he told rhyme didnt even want to picture what the captain had been through as hed tried to keep silent it wasnt his fault but were all at risk now ive gotta go talk to the brass sellitto said they want to know what went wrong they werent happy about the plan in the first place im sure they werent where did it happen a warehouse chelsea warehouseperfect for a hoarder was he connected to it work there remember his comfortable shoes or did he just find out about it from going through the data i want to know all of the above ill have it checked out cooper said sellitto gave him the details and well get the scene searched rhyme glanced at sachs who nodded after the detective disconnected rhyme asked wheres pulaski on his way back from the roland bell set lets call ssd find out where all our suspects were at the time malloy was killed some of them must have been in the office i want to know who wasnt and i want to know about this runnerboy think sterlingll help oh definitely sachs said reminding him how cooperative sterling had been throughout the investigation she hit the speakerphone button and placed the call an assistant answered and sachs identified herself hello detective sachs this is jeremy how can i help you i need to talk to mr sterling im afraid hes not available its very important theres been another killing a police officer yes i heard that on the news im very sorry hold on a moment martin just walked in they heard a muffled conversation and then another voice came through the speaker detective sachs its martin im sorry to hear another killing but mr sterlings offsite its really important we talk to him the calm assistant said ill relay the urgency what about mark whitcomb or tom oday hold for a moment please after a lengthy pause the young mans voice said im afraid mark is out of the office too and tom is in a meeting ive left messages i have another call detective sachs i should go and i am truly sorry about your captain you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me and more to my meditations than you might suppose sitting on a bench overlooking the east river pam willoughby felt a thud in her chest and her palms began to sweat she looked behind her at stuart everett lit brilliantly by the sun over new jersey a blue shirt jeans a sports coat the leather bag over his shoulder his boyish face a flop of brown hair narrow lips about to break into a grin that often never arrived hi she said sounding cheerful she was angry with herself wanted to sound harsh hey he glanced north toward the base of the brooklyn bridge fulton street the poem i know its crossing brooklyn ferry from leaves of grass walt whitmans masterpiece after stuart everett had mentioned in class that it was his favorite anthology of poems shed bought an expensive edition thinking that somehow it made them more connected i didnt assign that for class you knew it anyway pam said nothing can i sit down she nodded they sat in silence she smelled his cologne wondered if his wife had bought it for him your friend talked to you im sure yeah i liked her when she first called okay i thought she was going to arrest me pams frown softened into a smile stuart continued she wasnt happy about the situation but that was good she was looking out for you amelias the best i couldnt believe she was a cop and a cop who ran a check on my boyfriend being in the dark wasnt so bad pam reflected having too much information sucked bigtime he took her hand her impulse to pull it away vanished look lets get this whole thing out in the open she kept her eyes focused on the distance looking into his brown eyes under droopy lids would be a way bad idea she watched the river and the harbor beyond ferries still ran but most of the traffic was either private boats or cargo ships she often sat near the river here and watched them forced to live underground deep in the midwest woods with her crazy mother and a bunch of rightwing fanatics pam had developed a fascination with rivers and oceans they were open and free and constantly in motion that thought soothed her i wasnt honest i know but my relationship with my wife isnt what it seems i dont sleep with her anymore havent for a long time was that the first thing a man said at a time like this pam wondered she hadnt even considered the sex just the married he continued i didnt want to fall in love with you i thought wed be friends but you turned out to be different from everybody else you lit up something in me youre beautiful obviously but youre well youre like whitman unconventional lyrical a poet in your own way youve got kids pam couldnt stop herself from saying a hesitation i do but youd like them johns eight chiaras in middle school shes eleven theyre wonderful kids thats why mary and i are together the only reason her names mary was wondering he squeezed her hand pam i cant let you go she was leaning into him feeling the comfort of his arm against hers smelling the dry pleasing scent not caring whod bought the aftershave she thought he was probably going to tell me sooner or later i was going to tell you in a week or so i swear i was working up my courage she felt his hand trembling i see my childrens faces i think i cant break up the family and then you come along the most incredible person ive ever met ive been lonely for a long long time but what about holidays she asked i wanted to do something on thanksgiving or christmas with you i can probably get away for one of them at least part of the day we just need to plan ahead of time stuart lowered his head heres the thing i cant live without you if you can be patient well make it work she thought back to the one night theyd spent together a secret night that nobody knew about at amelia sachss town house when she was staying at lincoln rhymes and pam and stuart had the place to themselves it was magical she wished every night of her life could be like that one she gripped his hand harder yet he whispered i cant lose you he inched closer on the bench she found comfort in every square inch of contact she actually had written a poem about him describing their attraction as gravitational one of the fundamental forces in the universe pam rested her head against his shoulder i promise ill never hide anything from you again but pleasei have to keep seeing you she thought of the wonderful times theyd had times that would seem insignificant to anyone else silly nothing like it the comfort was like warm water on a wound washing away the pain when theyd been on the run pam and her mother had lived with and around petty men who would strike them for their own good who didnt share a word with their wives or children except when correcting or silencing them stuart wasnt even in the same universe with those monsters he whispered just give me a little while itll work out i promise well see each other like we have been hey heres an idea i know you want to travel theres a poetry conference in montreal next month i could fly you there get you a room you could attend the sessions and wed have the evenings free oh i love you she leaned toward his face i understand why you didnt tell me really he gripped her hard kissed her neck pam im so which is when she eased back and clutched her book bag to her chest like a shield but no stuart what pam believed her heart was beating faster than it ever had when you get divorced call me up and lets see but until then no i cant see you anymore shed said what she thought amelia sachs would say at a time like this but could she behave the same and not cry amelia wouldnt no way she slapped a smile onto her face struggling to control the pain as the loneliness and panic killed the comfort instantly the warmth froze to icy shards but pam youre everything to me but what are you to me stuart you cant be everything and im not willing to take less than that keep your voice steady she told herself if you get a divorce ill be with you will you now the seductive eyes lowered yes a whisper now i cant just now its complicated no stuart its really really simple she rose if i dont see you again have a nice life she began walking away quickly heading for amelias town house which was nearby okay maybe amelia wouldnt cry but pam could no longer hold the tears back she walked straight down the sidewalk eyes streaming andafraid shed weakennot daring to look back not daring to think about what shed done though she did have one thought about the encounter which she supposed someday shed consider pretty funny what a sucky parting line that was wish id come up with something better chapter thirtyeight mel cooper was frowning the warehouse where joe was killed some publisher rents it to store paper there for recycling though it hasnt been used actively for months but whats strange is that the ownerships not clear what does that mean ive run all the corporate documents its leased to a chain of three companies and owned by a delaware corporationand thats owned by a couple of new york corporations the ultimate ownership seems to be in malaysia but had known about it and that it was safe to torture a victim there how because hes the man who knows everything the phone in the lab trilled and rhyme glanced at caller id weve had such bad news in the case please let this be good inspector longhurst detective rhyme just to update you its looking rather productive here her voice betrayed a rare excitement she explained that destourne the teams french security service agent had sped to birmingham and contacted some algerians in a muslim community in west bromwich outside the city hed learned that an american had commissioned a passport and transit papers to north africa traveling on to singapore hed given them a large down payment and they promised the documents would be ready tomorrow evening as soon as he picked them up he was heading for london to finish the job good rhyme said chuckling that means logans already there dont you think in london quite certain of it longhurst agreed trying the shot tomorrow when our double meets the mi people at the shooting zone exactly so richard logan had ordered the papers and paid a large price for them to keep the team focused on birmingham while he hurried to london to complete his mission to kill the reverend goodlight what do danny kruegers people say that a boat will be waiting on the south coast to spirit him away to france spirit him away rhyme loved it cops dont talk that way over here he thought again about the safe house near manchester and the breakin at goodlights ngo in london was there anything rhyme mightve seen if he had walked the grid at either of those locales via the highdefinition video some tiny clue that theyd missed that might give them a clearer idea of exactly where and when the killer was going to strike if so the evidence was gone now hed just have to hope theyd made the right deductions what do you have in place ten officers around the shooting zone all plainclothed or in camouflage she added that danny krueger along with the french security man and another tactical team were making themselves subtly visible in birmingham longhurst had also added an extra protection detail where the reverend was actually hiding they had no evidence that the killer had learned the location but she didnt want to take any chances well know something soon detective just as they disconnected his computer dinged mr rhyme the words appeared on the screen in front of him a small window had opened it was a webcam view of amelia sachss living room he could see pam at the keyboard instant messaging him he spoke to her through his voicerecognition system hello pam owe are you dew in goddamn computer maybe he should have their digital guru rodney szarnek install a new system but she deduced the message just fine good she typed how r u i am good amelia there no she is how on a case bummer want talk her called but not picking up any thing eye can dew damn he sighed and tried again anything we can do here no thx a pause and he saw her glance at her cell phone she looked back at the computer typed rachel calling back in minute she left the webcam on but turned away speaking into her mobile she lugged a massive book bag onto her lap and dug through it opened a text and found some notes inside she read them aloud it seemed rhyme was about to turn to the whiteboards when he glanced at the webcam window something had changed he frowned and maneuvered his chair closer alarmed someone else seemed to be in sachss town house could it be it was hard to tell for certain but as he squinted he saw that yes a man was there hiding in a dark hallway only twenty feet or so from pam rhyme squinted moving his head as far forward as he could an intruder his face hidden by a hat and he was holding something was it a gun a knife thom the aide wasnt within earshot of course he was taking the trash out command dial sachs home thank god the ecu did exactly as instructed he could see pam glance at the phone beside the computer but she ignored the ringing the house wasnt hersshed let voice mail take a message she continued speaking into her mobile the man leaned out of the hallway his face obscured by the brim of his hat aimed directly at her command instant message the box popped up on the screen command type pam exclamation point command send pamex lamentation point fuck command type pam danger leave now command send this message went through pretty much unchanged pam read it please rhyme begged silently look at the screen but the girl was lost in her conversation her face was no longer so carefree the discussion had turned serious rhyme called and the operator assured him that a police car would be at the town house in five minutes but the intruder was only seconds away from pam who was completely unaware of him rhyme knew it was of course hed tortured malloy to get information about all of them amelia sachs was the first on the list to die only it wouldnt be sachs it would be this innocent girl his heart was pounding a sensation registering as a fierce throbbing headache he tried the phone again four rings hi this is amelia please leave your message at the tone he tried again command type pam call me period lincoln period and what would he tell her to do if he got through sachs had weapons in the place but he didnt know where she kept them pam was an athletic girl and the intruder didnt seem much larger than she was but hed have a weapon and given where he was he could get a garrote around her neck or a knife into her back before she was even aware of his presence and it would happen before his eyes then at last she was swiveling toward the computer shed see the message good keep turning rhyme saw a shadow on the floor across the room was the killer moving in closer still talking on her phone pam moved toward the computer but she was looking at the keyboard not the screen look up rhyme urged silently please read the goddamn message but like all kids today pam didnt need to look at the screen to make sure shed typed correctly with her cell held tight between cheek and shoulder she glanced fast at the keyboard as she stabbed the letters with quick strokes gotta go bye mr rhyme c u the screen went black amelia sachs was uncomfortable in the crimescene tyvek jumpsuit with surgeons hat and booties claustrophobic nauseous from inhaling the bitter scent of damp paper and blood and sweat in the warehouse she hadnt known captain joseph malloy well but he was as lon sellitto had announced one of ours and she was appalled at what had done to him to extract the information he wanted she was nearly finished running the scene and carried the evidencecollection bags outside infinitely grateful for the air here even though it reeked of diesel fumes she kept hearing the voice of her father as a young girl shed glanced into her parents bedroom and found him in his dress patrolmans uniform wiping tears this had shaken her shed never seen him cry hed gestured her inside hermann sachs always played straight with his daughter and hed sat her down on a bedside chair and explained that a friend of his a fellow officer had been shot and killed while stopping a robbery amie in this business everybodys family you probably spend more time with the guys you work with than you do with your own wife and kids every time somebody in blue dies you die a little bit too doesnt matter patrol or brass theyre all family and its the same pain when you lose somebody and she now felt the pain hed been speaking of felt it very deeply im finished she said to the crimescene crew who were standing beside their rapid response van shed searched the scene alone but the officers from queens had videotaped and photographed it and walked the grid at the secondary scenesthe likely entrance and exit routes nodding to the tour doctor and her associates from the mes office sachs said okay you can get him to the morgue the men in their thick green gloves and jumpsuits walked inside assembling the evidence in the milk crates for transport to rhymes lab sachs paused someone was watching her shed heard a tink of metal on metal or concrete or glass from up a deserted alleyway a fast look and she believed she saw a figure hiding near a deserted factorys loading dock which had collapsed years ago search carefully but watch your back she remembered the scene at the cemetery the killer wearing the swiped police hat watching her felt the same uneasiness she had there she left the evidence bags and walked down the alley hand on her pistol she saw no one paranoia detective one of the techs called she kept going was there a face behind that filthy window detective he persisted ill be right there a little irritation in her voice the crimescene tech said sorry its a call from detective rhyme she always shut her phone off when she got to a scene to avoid distractions tell him ill call him right back detective he says its about somebody named pam theres been an incident at your town house youre needed right away chapter thirtynine amelia sachs ran inside fast oblivious to the pain in her knees past the police at the door not even nodding to them where one officer pointed toward the living room sachs hurried into the roomand found pam on the couch the girl looked up her face pale the policewoman sat beside her youre all right im fine a little freaked out is all nothing hurt i can hug you pam laughed and sachs flung her arms around the girl what happened somebody broke in he was here while i was mr rhyme could see him behind me on the webcam he kept calling and on the like fifth ring or something i picked up and he told me to start screaming and get out and you did not really i kind of ran into the kitchen and got a knife i was pretty pissed he took off sachs glanced at a detective from the local brooklyn precinct a squat africanamerican man who said in a deep baritone he was gone when we got here neighbors didnt see anything so it had been her imagination at the warehouse crime scene where joe malloy was killed or maybe some kid or wino curious about what the cops were doing after killing malloy had come to her placeto look for files or evidence or to finish the job hed started kill her sachs walked through the town house with the detective and pam the desk had been ransacked but nothing seemed to be missing i thought maybe it was stuart pam took a breath i kind of broke up with him you did a nod good for you but it wasnt him no the guy here was wearing different clothes and wasnt built like stuart and yeah hes a son of a bitch but hes not going to break into somebody elses town house you get a look at him naw he turned and ran before i could see him real clearly shed noticed only his outfit the detective explained that pam had described the burglar as a male white or lightskinned black or latino medium build wearing blue jeans and a dark blue plaid sports jacket hed called rhyme too after hed learned of the webcam but the criminalist hadnt seen anything more than a vague form in the hallway they found the window through which hed broken in sachs had an alarm system but pam had shut it off when shed arrived she looked around the place the anger and dismay shed felt at malloys horrible death faded replaced by the same uneasiness and vulnerability that shed been aware of at the cemetery at the warehouse where malloy had died at ssdin fact everywhere since theyd started the pursuit of like at the scene near deleons house was he watching her now she saw motion outside the window a flash of light was it from the blowing leaves in front of nearby windows reflecting the pale sunlight or was it amelia pam asked in a soft voice looking around uneasily herself everything okay this brought sachs back to reality get to work and fast the killer had been hereand not that long ago goddamnit find out something useful sure honey its fine a patrol officer from the precinct asked detective you want somebody from crime scene to look it over thats okay she said with a glance to pam and a tight smile ill handle it sachs got her portable crimescene kit from the trunk of her car and she and pam searched together well sachs did the searching but pam standing clear of the perimeter described exactly where the killer had been though her voice was unsteady the girl was coolly efficient i kind of ran into the kitchen and got a knife since pam was here sachs asked a patrol officer to stand guard in the gardenwhere the killer had escaped this didnt allay her concern completely though not with s uncanny ability to spy on his victims to learn all about them to get close she wanted to search the scene and get pam away as soon as she could with the teenager directing her sachs searched the places hed stepped but she found no evidence in the town house the killer had either used gloves when hed broken in or hadnt touched any receptive surfaces and the adhesive rollers revealed no signs of foreign trace where did he go outside sachs asked ill show you pam glanced at sachss face which was apparently revealing her reluctance to expose the girl to more danger itd be better than me just telling you sachs nodded and they walked into the garden she looked around carefully she asked the patrol officer see anything nope but ive gotta say when you think somebodys watching you you see somebody watching you i hear that he jerked a thumb toward a row of dark windows across the alley then toward some thick azaleas and boxwood bushes i checked them out nothing but ill keep on it thanks pam directed sachs to the path had taken to escape and sachs began walking the grid amelia what i was kind of a shit you know what i said to you yesterday i felt like all desperate or something panickedi guess what im saying is im sorry you were the picture of restraint i didnt feel very restrained love makes us weird honey pam laughed well talk about it later maybe tonight depending on how the case goes well get dinner okay sure sachs continued her examination struggling to put aside her uneasiness the sense that was still here but despite her effort the search wasnt very fruitful the ground was mostly gravel and she found no footprints except one near the gate through which hed escaped from her yard into the alley the only mark was the toe of a shoehed been sprintingand useless forensically she found no fresh tire treadmarks but returning to her yard she saw a flash of white in the ivy and periwinkle covering the groundexactly in the position where it would have landed after falling from s pocket as hed vaulted the locked gate you found something maybe with tweezers sachs picked up a small piece of paper returning to the town house she set up a portable examining table and processed the rectangle she sprayed ninhydrin on it then after donning goggles hit it with an alternative light source she was disappointed that no prints were revealed is it helpful pam asked could be its not going to point to his front door but then evidence usually doesnt if it did she added smiling they wouldnt need people like lincoln and me right im going to go check it out sachs got her toolbox took out the drill and screwed shut the broken window she locked up setting the alarm she had called rhyme briefly earlier to tell him pam was all right but she now wanted to let him know about the possible lead she pulled out her cell phone but before she called she paused on the curb and looked around whats the matter amelia she put the phone back in its holster my car the camaro was gone sachs felt a surge of alarm her gaze swiveled up and down the street her hand strayed to the glock was here had he stolen the car the patrol officer was just leaving the backyard and she asked if hed seen anybody that car that old one it was yours yeah i think the perp mightve boosted it sorry detective i think it got towed i woulda said something if id known it was yours towed maybe shed forgotten to put the nypd placard on the dash she and pam walked up the street to the girls beatup honda civic and drove to the local precinct the desk sergeant there whom she knew had heard about the breakin hi amelia the boys canvassed the hood real careful nobody saw the perp listen vinnie my wheelsre gone they were by the hydrant across the street from my place pool car no not your old chevy yep aw no thats lousy somebody said it got towed i dont know if i had the officialbusiness sign on the dash still they ought tove run the plate seen who it was registered to shit that sucks sorry miss pam smiled to show her immunity to words that shed just uttered herself occasionally sachs gave the sergeant the plate number and he made some calls checked the computer naw it wasnt parking violations hold on a second he made some other calls son of a bitch she couldnt afford to be without her wheels she wanted desperately to check out the lead shed found at her town house but her frustration became concern when she noticed the frown on vinnies face you sureokay whered it go toyeah well gimme a call back as soon as you know he hung up what the camaro you have it financed financed no this is weird a repo team got it somebody repossessed it according to them you missed six months payments vinnie its a sixtynine my dad bought it for cash in the seventies its never had a lien on it who was the lender supposed to be my guy didnt know hes going to check it out and call back hell find out where they took it goddamn last thing i need you have wheels here sorry nope she thanked him and walked outside pam beside her if theres one scratch on her headsre going to roll she muttered could have been behind the towing it wouldnt have surprised her though how hed arrange it she couldnt imagine another stab of uneasiness at how close hed gotten to her how much information about her he could access the man who knows everything she asked pam can i borrow your civic sure only can you drop me at rachels were going to do our homework together tell you what honey how bout if i have one of the guys from the precinct run you into the city sure how come this guy knows way too much about me already think its best just to keep a little distance she and the girl walked back into the precinct house to arrange for the ride outside once again sachs looked up and down the sidewalk no sign of anyone watching her she glanced up fast at motion in a window across the street she thought immediately of the ssd logothe window in the watchtower the person whod glanced out was an elderly woman but that didnt stop the chill from trickling down sachss spine yet again she walked quickly to pams car and fired it up chapter forty with a snap of systems shutting down deprived of their lifeblood the town house went dark what the hell is going on rhyme shouted the electricitys out thom announced that part i figured the criminalist snapped what id like to know is why we werent running the gc mel cooper said defensively he looked out the window as if checking to see if the rest of the neighborhood grid had gone down too but since it was not yet dusk there were no coned references to tell the story we cant afford to be offline now goddamnit get it taken care of rhyme sellitto pulaski and cooper remained in the silent dim room while thom walked into the hall and on his cell phone made a call he was soon talking with somebody at the electric company impossible i pay the bills online every month never missed one i have receipts well theyre in the computer and i cant go online because theres no electricity now can icanceled checks yes but once again how can i fax them to you if theres no electricityi dont know where theres a kinkos no its him you know rhyme said to the others five twentytwo he got your power shut off yep he found out about me and where i live malloy mustve told him this is our command post the silence was eerie the first thing rhyme thought of was how completely vulnerable he was the devices that he relied on were useless now and he had no way to communicate no way to lock or unlock the doors or use the esu if the blackout continued and thom couldnt recharge his wheelchairs battery hed be immobilized completely he couldnt remember that last time hed felt so vulnerable even having others around didnt allay the concern was a threat to anybody anywhere he was also wondering is the blackout a diversion or the prelude to an attack keep an eye out everybody he announced he could be moving in on us pulaski glanced out the window cooper too sellitto pulled out his cell phone and called someone downtown he explained the situation he rolled his eyessellitto was never one for stoic facesthen ended the conversation with well i dont care whatever it takes this assholes a killer and we cant do a thing to find him without any fucking electricity thanks thom any luck no came the aides abrupt reply shit rhyme then reflected on something lon call roland bell i think we need protection five twentytwo went after pam he went after amelia the criminalist nodded at a dark monitor he knows about us i want officers on amelias mothers place pams foster home pulaskis house mels mothers place your house too lon you think its that much of a risk the big detective asked then shook his head what the hell am i saying sure it is he got the informationaddresses and phone numbersthen called bell and had him arrange for officers after hanging up he said itll take a few hours but hell get it done a loud knock on the door shattered the silence still clutching the phone thom started for it wait rhyme shouted the aide paused pulaski go with him rhyme nodded at the pistol on his hip sure they walked into the hallway then rhyme heard a muted conversation and a moment later two men in suits with trim hair and unsmiling faces walked into the town house looking around curiouslyfirst at rhymes body then at the rest of the lab surprised either at the amount of scientific equipment or the absence of lights or both most likely were looking for a lieutenant sellitto we were told hed be here thats me whore you shields were displayed and ranks and names giventhey were two nypd detective sergeants and they were with internal affairs lieutenant the older of the two said were here to take possession of your shield and weapon i have to tell you that the results were confirmed im sorry whatre you talking about youre officially suspended youre not being arrested at this time but we recommend you talk to an attorneyeither your own or one from the pba the hell is going on the younger officer frowned the drug test what you dont have to deny anything to us we just do the fieldwork pick up shields and weapons and inform suspects of their suspension what fucking test the older looked at the younger this apparently had never happened before naturally it hadnt since whatever was going on had been ginned up by rhyme understood detective really you dont have to act do i fucking look like im acting well according to the suspension order you took a drug test last week the results just came in showing significant levels of narcotics in your system heroin cocaine and psychedelics i took the drug test like everybody in my department it cant show up positive because i dont do any fucking drugs i have never done any fucking drugs andoh shit the big man spat out grimacing he jabbed a finger at the ssd brochure theyve got drugscreening and backgroundcheck companies he got into the system somehow and screwed up my file the results were faked that would be very difficult to accomplish well it got accomplished and you or your attorney can bring up that defense at the hearing again we really just need your shield and your weapon and heres the paperwork on that now i hope theres not going to be a problem you dont want to add to your difficulties do you shit the big rumpled man handed over his gunan oldstyle revolverand the shield gimme the fucking paperwork sellitto snatched it out of the hand of the younger one as the older wrote out a receipt and handed it to him as well he then unloaded the gun and placed it and the bullets in a thick envelope thank you detective have a good day after they were gone sellitto flipped open his phone and called the head of ia the man was out and he left a message then he called his own office the assistant he shared with several other detectives in major cases had apparently heard the news i know its bullshit they whatoh great ill call you when i find out whats going on he snapped the phone closed so hard rhyme wondered if hed broken it he raised an eyebrow they just confiscated everything in my desk pulaski asked how the hell do you fight somebody like this it was then that rodney szarnek called on sellittos mobile he set it to speakerphone whats wrong with the landline there the prick got the electricity shut off were working on it whats up the list of ssd customers from the cd we found something one customer downloaded pages of data about all victims and fall guys the day before each killing who is it his names robert carpenter rhyme said okay good whats his story all i have is whats on the spreadsheet hes got his own company in midtown associated warehousing warehousing rhyme was thinking of the place where joe malloy was murdered was there a connection have an address the tech specialist recited it after disconnecting rhyme noted pulaski was frowning the young officer said i think we saw him at ssd who carpenter when we were there yesterday a big bald guy he was in a meeting with sterling he didnt seem happy happy what does that mean i dont know just an impression not helpful rhyme said mel check this carpenter out cooper called downtown on his mobile he spoke for a few minutes moving closer to the window for the light then jotted notes he disconnected you dont seem to like the word interesting lincoln but it is ive got the ncic and department database results robert carpenter lives on the upper east side single and get this hes got a record some credit card fraud and badcheck busts did six months in waterbury and he was arrested in a corporate extortion scheme those charges were dropped but he went nuts when they came to pick him up tried to swing at the agent they dropped those charges when he agreed to go into ed counseling emotionally disturbed rhyme nodded and his companys in the warehousing business just the line of work for a hoarder okay pulaski find out where this carpenter was when amelias town house got broken into yes sir pulaski was lifting his phone from its holster when the unit trilled he glanced at caller id he answered hi honwhathey jenny calm down oh nolincoln rhyme knew that had attacked on yet another front what where are youtake it easy its just a mistake the rookies voice was shaking itll all get taken care of give me the address okay ill be right there he snapped shut the phone closed his eyes momentarily i have to go whats wrong rhyme asked jennys been arrested by the ins immigration she got put on a watch list at homeland security theyre saying shes illegal and a security threat isnt she our greatgrandparents were citizens pulaski snapped jesus the young officer was wildeyed brads at jennys moms but she has the baby with her now theyre transporting her to detentionand they may take the baby if they do thatoh man pure despair filled his face i have to go his eyes told rhyme that nothing would stop him being with his wife okay go good luck the young man sprinted out the door rhyme closed his eyes briefly hes picking us off like a sniper he grimaced at least sachsll be here any minute she can check out carpenter just then another pounding shook the door alarmed his eyes jerked open what now but this at least wasnt another disruption by two crimescene officers from the main facility in queens walked inside carrying a large milk crate which sachs had handed off to them before shed raced to her town house this would be the evidence from the scene of malloys death hi detective you know your doorbells not working one looked around and your lightsre off were pretty aware of that rhyme said coolly anyway here you go after the officers had left mel cooper put the box on an examination table and extracted the evidence and sachss digital camera which would contain images of the scene now thats helpful rhyme growled sarcastically pointing his chin at the silent computer and its black screen maybe we can hold the memory chip up to the sunlight he glanced at the evidence itselfa shoeprint some leaves duct tape and envelopes of trace they had to examine it as soon as possible since this wasnt planted evidence it might provide the final clue as to where was but without their equipment to analyze it and check the databases the bags were nothing more than paperweights thom rhyme called the power im still on hold the aide shouted from the dark hallway he knew this was probably a bad idea but he was out of control and it took a lot for ron pulaski to be out of control yet he was furious this was beyond anything hed ever felt when hed signed up for the blue hed expected to be beat up and threatened from time to time but hed never thought that his career would put jenny at risk much less his children so despite being straitlaced and by the booksergeant fridayhe was taking the matter into his own hands going behind the backs of lincoln rhyme and detective sellitto and even his mentor amelia sachs they wouldnt be happy at what he was going to do but ron pulaski was desperate and so on the way to the ins detention center in queens hed made a call to mark whitcomb hey ron the man had said whats going onyou sound upset youre out of breath ive got a problem mark please i need some help my wifes being accused of being an illegal alien they say her passports forged and shes a security threat its crazy but shes a citizen isnt she her familys been here for generations mark we think this killer weve been after got into your system hes had one detective fail a drug testand now hes had jenny arrested he could do that he mustve swapped her file with somebody whos on a watch list and then called it in look i know some people at ins i can talk to them where are you on my way to the detention center in queens ill meet you outside in twenty minutes oh thanks man i dont know what to do dont worry ron well get it worked out now waiting for whitcomb ron pulaski was pacing in front of ins detention beside a temporary sign indicating that the service was now operated by the department of homeland security pulaski thought back to all the tv news reports he and jenny had seen about illegal immigrants how terrified theyd looked what was happening to his wife at the moment would she be stuck for days or weeks in some kind of bureaucratic purgatory pulaski wanted to scream calm down handle it smart amelia sachs always told him that handle it smart finally thank you lord pulaski saw mark whitcomb walking quickly toward him the expression one of urgent concern he wasnt sure exactly what the man could do to help but he hoped that the compliance department with its connections to the government could pull strings with homeland security and get his wife and child released at least until the matter was officially resolved whitcomb breathless came up to him have you found out anything else i called about ten minutes ago theyre inside now i didnt say anything i wanted to wait for you you okay no im pretty frantic here mark thanks for this sure the compliance officer said earnestly itll be okay ron dont worry i think i can do something then he looked up into pulaskis eyes the ssd compliance officer was just slightly taller than andrew sterling onlyits pretty important for you to get jenny out of there right oh yeah mark thiss just a nightmare okay come this way he led pulaski around the corner of the building then into an alley ive got a favor to ask ron whitcomb whispered whatever i can do really the mans voice was uncharacteristically soft calm and his eyes had a sharpness that pulaski hadnt seen before as if hed dropped an act and was now being himself you know sometimes ron we have to do things that we dont think are right but in the end its for the best what do you mean to help your wife out you might have to do something you might think isnt so good the officer said nothing his thoughts whirling where was this going ron i need you to make this case go away case the murder investigation go away i dont get it stop the case whitcomb looked around and whispered sabotage it destroy the evidence give them some false leads point them anywhere but at ssd i dont understand mark are you joking no ron im real serious this cases got to stop and you can do it i cant oh yes you can if you want jenny out of there a nod toward the detention center no nothis was whitcomb was the killer hed used the passcodes of his boss sam brockton to get access to innercircle instinctively pulaski started for his gun but whitcomb drew first a black pistol appearing in his hand no ron thats not going to get us anywhere whitcomb reached into the holster and pulled pulaskis glock out by the grip slipped it into his waistband how could he have misjudged this so badly was it the head injury or was he just stupid whitcombs friendship had been feigned which hurt as much as it shocked bringing him the coffee defending him to cassel and gillespie suggesting they get together socially helping with the time sheetsit was all a tactic to get close to the cop and use him its all a goddamn lie isnt it mark you didnt grow up in queens at all did you and you dont have a brother whos a cop no to both whitcombs face was dark i tried to reason with you ron but you wouldnt work with me goddamnit you could have now look what youve made me do the killer pushed pulaski farther into the alley chapter fortyone amelia sachs was in the city cruising through traffic frustrated at the noisy tepid response of the japanese engine it sounded like an ice maker and had just about as much horsepower shed called rhyme twice but both times the line went right to voice mail this rarely happened lincoln rhyme obviously wasnt away from home very much and something odd was going on at the big building lon sellittos phone was out of order and neither he nor ron pulaski was answering his mobile was behind this too all the more reason to move fast in following up on the lead shed discovered at her town house it was a solid one she believed maybe it was the final clue the one missing piece of the puzzle they needed to bring this case to its conclusion now she saw her destination not far away mindful of what had happened to the camaro and not wanting to jeopardize pams car tooif had been behind the repossession as she suspectedsachs cruised around the block until she found the rarest of all phenomena in manhattan a legal unoccupied parking space how bout that maybe it was a good sign why are you doing this ron pulaski whispered to mark whitcomb as they stood in a deserted queens alleyway but the killer ignored him listen to me we were friends i thought well everybody thinks a lot of things that turn out not to be true thats life whitcomb cleared his throat he seemed edgy uncomfortable pulaski remembered sachs saying that the killer was feeling the pressure of their pursuit which made him careless it also made him more dangerous pulaski was breathing hard whitcomb looked around again fast then back at the young officer he kept the gun steady and it was clear he knew how to use it are you fucking listening to me goddamnit im listening i dont want this investigation to go any further its time for it to stop stop im in patrol how can i stop anything i was telling you sabotage it lose some evidence send people in the wrong direction i wont do that the young officer muttered defiantly whitcomb shook his head looking almost disgusted yes you will you can make this easy or hard ron what about my wife can you get her out of there i can do anything i want the man who knows everything the young officer closed his eyes grinding his teeth together the way hed done as a kid he looked at the building where jenny was being held jenny the woman who looked just like myra weinburg ron pulaski now resigned himself to what he had to do it was terrible it was foolish but he had no choice he was cornered his head down he muttered okay youll do it about the author former attorney and folksinger jeffery deaver is the bestselling author of a dozen suspense novels and numerous short stories
