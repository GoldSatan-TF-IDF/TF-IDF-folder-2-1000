laurell k hamilton the laughing corpse v book of anita blake vampire hunter harold gaynors house sat in the middle of intense green lawn and the graceful sweep of trees the house gleamed in the hot august sunshine bert vaughn my boss parked the car on the crushed gravel of the driveway the gravel was so white it looked like handpicked rock salt somewhere out of sight the soft whir of sprinklers pattered the grass was absolutely perfect in the middle of one of the worst droughts missouri has had in over twenty years oh well i wasnt here to talk with mr gaynor about water management i was here to talk about raising the dead not resurrection im not that good i mean zombies the shambling dead rotting corpses night of the living dead that kind of zombie though certainly less dramatic than hollywood would ever put up on the screen i am an animator its a job thats all like selling animating had only been a licensed business for about five years before that it had just been an embarrassing curse a religious experience or a tourist attraction it still is in parts of new orleans but here in st louis its a business a profitable one thanks in large part to my boss hes a rascal a scalawag a rogue but damn if he doesnt know how to make money its a good trait for a business manager bert was sixthree a broadshouldered excollege football player with the beginnings of a beer gut the dark blue suit he wore was tailored so that the gut didnt show for eight hundred dollars the suit should have hidden a herd of elephants his whiteblond hair was trimmed in a crew cut back in style after all these years a boaters tan made his pale hair and eyes dramatic with contrast bert adjusted his blue and red striped tie mopping a bead of sweat off his tanned forehead i heard on the news theres a movement there to use zombies in pesticidecontaminated fields it would save lives zombies rot bert theres no way to prevent that and they dont stay smart enough long enough to be used as field labor it was just a thought the dead have no rights under law anita not yet it was wrong to raise the dead so they could slave for us it was just wrong but no one listens to me the government finally had to get into the act there was a nationwide committee being formed of animators and other experts we were supposed to look into the working conditions of local zombies working conditions they didnt understand you cant give a corpse nice working conditions they dont appreciate it anyway zombies may walk even talk but they are very very dead bert smiled indulgently at me i fought an urge to pop him one right in his smug face i know you and charles are working on that committee bert said going around to all the businesses and checking up on the zombies it makes great press for animators inc i dont do it for good press i said i know you believe in your little cause youre a condescending bastard i said smiling sweetly up at him he grinned at me i know i just shook my head with bert you cant really win an insult match he doesnt give a damn what i think of him as long as i work for him my navy blue suit jacket was supposed to be summer weight but it was a lie sweat trickled down my spine as soon as i stepped out of the car bert turned to me small eyes narrowing his eyes lend themselves to suspicious squints youre still wearing your gun he said the jacket hides it bert mr gaynor will never know sweat started collecting under the straps of my shoulder holster i could feel the silk blouse beginning to melt i try not to wear silk and a shoulder rig at the same time the silk starts to look indented wrinkling where the straps cross the gun was a browning hipower mm and i liked having it near at hand come on anita i dont think youll need a gun in the middle of the afternoon while visiting a client berts voice held that patronizing tone that people use on children now little girl you know this is for your own good bert didnt care about my wellbeing he just didnt want to spook gaynor the man had already given us a check for five thousand dollars and that was just to drive out and talk to him the implication was that there was more money if we agreed to take his case a lot of money bert was all excited about that part i was skeptical after all bert didnt have to raise the corpse i did the trouble was bert was probably right i wouldnt need the gun in broad daylight probably all right open the trunk bert opened the trunk of his nearly brandnew volvo i was already taking off the jacket he stood in front of me hiding me from the house god forbid that they should see me hiding a gun in the trunk what would they do lock the doors and scream for help i folded the holster straps around the gun and laid it in the clean trunk it smelled like new car plastic and faintly unreal bert shut the trunk and i stared at it as if i could still see the gun are you coming he asked yeah i said i didnt like leaving my gun behind for any reason was that a bad sign bert motioned for me to come on i did walking carefully over the gravel in my highheeled black pumps women may get to wear lots of pretty colors but men get the comfortable shoes bert was staring at the door smile already set on his face it was his best professional smile dripping with sincerity his pale grey eyes sparkled with good cheer it was a mask he could put it on and off like a light switch hed wear the same smile if you confessed to killing your own mother as long as you wanted to pay to have her raised from the dead the door opened and i knew bert had been wrong about me not needing a gun the man was maybe fiveeight but the orange polo shirt he wore strained over his chest the black sport jacket seemed too small as if when he moved the seams would split like an insects skin that had been outgrown black acidwashed jeans showed off a small waist so he looked like someone had pinched him in the middle while the clay was still wet his hair was very blond he looked at us silently his eyes were empty dead as a dolls i caught a glimpse of shoulder holster under the sport jacket and resisted an urge to kick bert in the shins either my boss didnt notice the gun or he ignored it hello im bert vaughn and this is my associate anita blake i believe mr gaynor is expecting us bert smiled at him charmingly the bodyguardwhat else could he bemoved away from the door bert took that for an invitation and walked inside i followed not at all sure i wanted to harold gaynor was a very rich man maybe he needed a bodyguard maybe people had threatened him or maybe he was one of those men who have enough money to keep hired muscle around whether they need it or not or maybe something else was going on something that needed guns and muscle and men with dead emotionless eyes not a cheery thought the airconditioning was on too high and the sweat gelled instantly we followed the bodyguard down a long central hall that was paneled in dark expensivelooking wood the hall runner looked oriental and was probably handmade heavy wooden doors were set in the righthand wall the bodyguard opened the doors and again stood to one side while we walked through the room was a library but i was betting no one ever read any of the books the place was ceiling to floor in dark wood bookcases there was even a second level of books and shelves reached by an elegant sweep of narrow staircase all the books were hardcover all the same size colors muted and collected together like a collage the furniture was of course red leather with brass buttons worked into it a man sat near the far wall he smiled when we came in he was a large man with a pleasant round face doublechinned he was sitting in an electric wheelchair with a small plaid blanket over his lap hiding his legs mr vaughn and ms blake how nice of you to drive out his voice went with his face pleasant damn near amiable a slender black man sat in one of the leather chairs he was over six feet tall exactly how much over was hard to tell he was slumped down long legs stretched out in front of him with the ankles crossed his legs were taller than i was his brown eyes watched me as if he were trying to memorize me and would be graded later the blond bodyguard went to lean against the bookcases he couldnt quite cross his arms jacket too tight muscles too big you really shouldnt lean against a wall and try to look tough unless you can cross your arms ruins the effect mr gaynor said youve met tommy he motioned towards the sitting bodyguard thats bruno is that your real name or just a nickname i asked looking straight into brunos eyes he shifted just a little in his chair real name i smiled why he asked ive just never met a bodyguard who was really named bruno is that supposed to be funny he asked i shook my head bruno he never had a chance it was like naming a girl venus all brunos had to be bodyguards it was a rule maybe a cop naw it was a bad guys name i smiled bruno sat up in his chair one smooth muscular motion he wasnt wearing a gun that i could see but there was a presence to him dangerous it said watch out guess i shouldnt have smiled bert interrupted anita please i do apologize mr gaynor mr bruno ms blake has a rather peculiar sense of humor dont apologize for me bert i dont like it i dont know what he was so sore about anyway i hadnt said the really insulting stuff out loud now now mr gaynor said no hard feelings right bruno bruno shook his head and frowned at me not angry sort of perplexed bert flashed me an angry look then turned smiling to the man in the wheelchair now mr gaynor i know you must be a busy man so exactly how old is the zombie you want raised a man who gets right down to business i like that gaynor hesitated staring at the door a woman entered she was tall leggy blond with cornflowerblue eyes the dress if it was a dress was rosecolored and silky it clung to her body the way it was supposed to hiding what decency demanded but leaving very little to the imagination long pale legs were stuffed into pink spike heels no hose she stalked across the carpet and every man in the room watched her and she knew it she threw back her head and laughed but no sound came out her face brightened her lips moved eyes sparkled but in absolute silence like someone had turned the sound off she leaned one hip against harold gaynor one hand on his shoulder he encircled her waist and the movement raised the already short dress another inch could she sit down in the dress without flashing the room naw this is cicely he said she smiled brilliantly at bert that little soundless laugh making her eyes sparkle she looked at me and her eyes faltered the smile slipped for a second uncertainty filled her eyes gaynor patted her hip the smile flamed back into place she nodded graciously to both of us i want you to raise a twohundredandeightythreeyear old corpse i just stared at him and wondered if he understood what he was asking well bert said that is nearly three hundred years old very old to raise as a zombie most animators couldnt do it at all i am aware of that gaynor said that is why i asked for ms blake she can do it bert glanced at me i had never raised anything that old anita i could do it i said he smiled back at gaynor pleased but i wont do it bert turned slowly back to me smile gone gaynor was still smiling the bodyguards were immobile cicely looked pleasantly at me eyes blank of any meaning a million dollars ms blake gaynor said in his soft pleasant voice i saw bert swallow his hands convulsed on the chair arms berts idea of sex was money he probably had the biggest hardon of his life do you understand what youre asking mr gaynor i asked he nodded i will supply the white goat his voice was still pleasant as he said it still smiling only his eyes had gone dark eager anticipatory i stood up come on bert its time to leave bert grabbed my arm anita sit down please i stared at his hand until he let go of me his charming mask slipped showing me the anger underneath then he was all pleasant business again anita it is a generous payment the white goat is a euphemism bert it means a human sacrifice my boss glanced at gaynor then back to me he knew me well enough to believe me but he didnt want to i dont understand he said the older the zombie the bigger the death needed to raise it after a few centuries the only death big enough is a human sacrifice i said gaynor wasnt smiling anymore he was watching me out of dark eyes cicely was still looking pleasant almost smiling was there anyone home behind those so blue eyes do you really want to talk about murder in front of cicely i asked gaynor beamed at me always a bad sign she cant understand a word we say cicelys deaf i stared at him and he nodded she looked at me with pleasant eyes we were talking of human sacrifice and she didnt even know it if she could read lips she was hiding it very well i guess even the handicapped um physically challenged can fall into bad company but it seemed wrong i hate a woman who talks constantly gaynor said i shook my head all the money in the world wouldnt be enough to get me to work for you couldnt you just kill lots of animals instead of just one bert asked bert is a very good business manager he knows shit about raising the dead i stared down at him no bert sat very still in his chair the prospect of losing a million dollars must have been real physical pain for him but he hid it mr corporate negotiator there has to be a way to work this out he said his voice was calm a professional smile curled his lips he was still trying to do business my boss did not understand what was happening do you know of another animator that could raise a zombie this old gaynor asked bert glanced up at me then down at the floor then at gaynor the professional smile had faded he understood now that it was murder we were talking about would that make a difference i had always wondered where bert drew the line i was about to find out the fact that i didnt know whether he would refuse the contract told you a lot about my boss no bert said softly no i guess i cant help you either mr gaynor if its the money ms blake i can raise the offer a tremor ran through berts shoulders poor bert but he hid it well brownie point for him im not an assassin gaynor i said that aint what i heard tommy of the blond hair said i glanced at him his eyes were still as empty as a dolls i dont kill people for money you kill vampires for money he said legal execution and i dont do it for the money i said tommy shook his head and moved away from the wall i hear you like staking vampires and you arent too careful about who you have to kill to get to em my informants tell me you have killed humans before ms blake gaynor said only in selfdefense gaynor i dont do murder bert was standing now i think it is time to leave bruno stood in one fluid movement big dark hands loose and halfcupped at his sides i was betting on some kind of martial arts tommy was standing away from the wall his sport jacket was pushed back to expose his gun like an oldtime gunfighter it was a magnum it would make a very big hole i just stood there staring at them what else could i do i might be able to do something with bruno but tommy had a gun i didnt it sort of ended the argument they were treating me like i was a very dangerous person at fivethree i am not imposing raise the dead kill a few vampires and people start considering you one of the monsters sometimes it hurt but now it had possibilities do you really think i came in here unarmed i asked my voice sounded very matteroffact bruno looked at tommy he sort of shrugged i didnt pat her down bruno snorted she aint wearing a gun though tommy said want to bet your life on it i said i smiled when i said it and slid my hand very slowly towards my back make them think i had a hip holster at the small of my back tommy shifted flexing his hand near his gun if he went for it we were going to die i was going to come back and haunt bert gaynor said no no need for anyone to die here today ms blake no i said no need at all i swallowed my pulse back into my throat and eased my hand away from my imaginary gun tommy eased away from his real one goody for us gaynor smiled again like a pleasant beardless santa you of course understand that telling the police would be useless i nodded we have no proof you didnt even tell us who you wanted raised from the dead or why it would be your word against mine he said and im sure you have friends in high places i smiled when i said it his smile widened dimpling his fat little cheeks of course i turned my back on tommy and his gun bert followed we walked outside into the blistering summer heat bert looked a little shaken i felt almost friendly towards him it was nice to know that bert had limits something he wouldnt do even for a million dollars would they really have shot us he asked his voice sounded matteroffact firmer than the slightly glassy look in his eyes tough bert he unlocked the trunk without being asked with harold gaynors name in our appointment book and in the computer i got my gun out and slipped on the holster rig not knowing who wed mentioned this trip to i shook my head too risky then why did you pretend to have a gun he looked me straight in the eyes as he asked and for the first time i saw uncertainty in his face old money bags needed a comforting word but i was fresh out because bert i could have been wrong the bridal shop was just off west in st peters it was called the maiden voyage cute there was a pizza place on one side of it and a beauty salon on the other it was called full dark beauty salon the windows were blacked out outlined in bloodred neon you could get your hair and nails done by a vampire if you wanted to vampirism had only been legal for two years in the united states of america we were still the only country in the world where it was legal dont ask me i didnt vote for it there was even a movement to give the vamps the vote taxation without representation and all that two years ago if a vampire bothered someone i just went out and staked the son of a bitch now i had to get a court order of execution without it i was up on murder charges if i was caught i longed for the good of days there was a blond mannequin in the wedding shop window wearing enough white lace to drown in i am not a big fan of lace or seed pearls or sequins especially not sequins i had gone out with catherine twice to help her look for a wedding gown it didnt take long to realize i was no help i didnt like any of them catherine was a very good friend or i wouldnt have been here at all she told me if i ever got married id change my mind surely being in love doesnt cause you to lose your sense of good taste if i ever buy a gown with sequins on it someone just shoot me i also wouldnt have chosen the bridal dresses catherine picked out but it was my own fault that i hadnt been around when the vote was taken i worked too much and i hated to shop so i ended up plunking down plus tax on a pink taffeta evening gown it looked like it had run away from a junior high prom i walked into the airconditioned hush of the bridal shop high heels sinking into a carpet so pale grey it was nearly white mrs cassidy the manager saw me come in her smile faltered for just a moment before she got it under control she smiled at me brave mrs cassidy i smiled back not looking forward to the next hour mrs cassidy was somewhere between forty and fifty trim figure red hair so dark it was almost brown the hair was tied in a french knot like grace kelly used to wear she pushed her gold wireframed glasses more securely on her nose and said ms blake here for the final fitting i see i hope its the final fitting i said well we have been working on the problem i think weve come up with something there was a small room in back of the desk it was filled with racks of plasticcovered dresses mrs cassidy pulled mine out from between two identical pink dresses she led the way to the dressing rooms with the dress draped over her arms her spine was very straight she was gearing for another battle i didnt have to gear up i was always ready for battle but arguing with mrs cassidy about alterations to a formal beat the heck out of arguing with tommy and bruno it could have gone very badly but it hadnt gaynor had called them off for today he had said what did that mean exactly it was probably selfexplanatory i had left bert at the office still shaken from his close encounter he didnt deal with the messy end of the business the violent end no i did that or manny or jamison or charles we the animators of animators inc we did the dirty work bert stayed in his nice safe office and sent clients and trouble our way until today mrs cassidy hung the dress on a hook inside one of the dressing stalls and went away before i could go inside another stall opened and kasey catherines flower girl stepped out she was eight and she was glowering her mother followed behind her still in her business suit elizabeth call me elsie markowitz was tall slender blackhaired olive skinned and a lawyer she worked with catherine and was also in the wedding kasey looked like a smaller softer version of her mother the child spotted me first and said hi anita isnt this dress dumblooking now kasey elsie said its a beautiful dress all those nice pink ruffles the dress looked like a petunia on steroids to me i stripped off my jacket and started moving into my own dressing room before i had to give my opinion out loud is that a real gun kasey asked i had forgotten i was still wearing it yes i said are you a policewoman no kasey markowitz you ask too many questions her mother herded her past me with a harried smile sorry about that anita i dont mind i said sometime later i was standing on a little raised platform in front of a nearly perfect circle of mirrors with the matching pink high heels the dress was the right length at least it also had little puff sleeves and was an offtheshoulder look the dress showed almost every scar i had the newest scar was still pink and healing on my right forearm but it was just a knife wound theyre neat clean things compared to my other scars my collarbone and left arm have both been broken a vampire bit through them tore at me like a dog with a piece of meat theres also the crossshaped burn mark on my left forearm some inventive human vampire slaves thought it was amusing i didnt i looked like frankensteins bride goes to the prom okay maybe it wasnt that bad but mrs cassidy thought it was she thought the scars would distract people from the dress the wedding party the bride but catherine the bride herself didnt agree she thought i deserved to be in the wedding because we were such good friends i was paying good money to be publicly humiliated we must be good friends mrs cassidy handed me a pair of long pink satin gloves i pulled them on wiggling my fingers deep into the tiny holes ive never liked gloves they make me feel like im touching the world through a curtain but the bright pink things did hide my arms scars all gone what a good girl right the woman fluffed out the satiny skirt glancing into the mirror it will do i think she stood tapping one long painted fingernail against her lipsticked mouth i believe i have come up with something to hide that uh well she made vague hand motions towards me my collarbone scar i said yes she sounded relieved it occurred to me for the first time that mrs cassidy had never once said the word scar as if it were dirty or rude i smiled at myself in the ring of mirrors laughter caught at the back of my throat mrs cassidy held up something made of pink ribbon and fake orange blossoms the laughter died what is that i asked this she said stepping towards me is the solution to our problem all right but what is it well it is a collar a decoration it goes around my neck yes i shook my head i dont think so ms blake i have tried everything to hide that that mark hats hairdos simple ribbons corsages she literally threw up her hands i am at my wits end this i could believe i took a deep breath i sympathize with you mrs cassidy really i do ive been a royal pain in the ass i would never say such a thing i know so i said it for you but that is the ugliest piece of frufru ive ever laid eyes on if you ms blake have any better suggestions then i am all ears she half crossed her arms over her chest the offending piece of decoration trailed nearly to her waist its huge i protested it will hide yourshe set her mouth tightscar i felt like applauding shed said the dirty word did i have any better suggestions no i did not i sighed put it on me the least i can do is look at it she smiled please lift your hair i did as i was told she fastened it around my neck the lace itched the ribbons tickled and i didnt even want to look in the mirror i raised my eyes slowly and just stared thank goodness you have long hair ill style it myself the day of the wedding so it helps the camouflage the thing around my neck looked like a cross between a dog collar and the worlds biggest wrist corsage my neck had sprouted pink ribbons like mushrooms after a rain it was hideous and no amount of hairstyling was going to change that but it hid the scar completely perfectly tada i just shook my head what could i say mrs cassidy took my silence for assent she should have known better the phone rang and saved us both ill be just a minute ms blake she stalked off highheels silent on the thick carpet i just stared at myself in the mirrors my hair and eyes match black hair eyes so dark brown they look black they are my mothers latin darkness but my skin is pale my fathers germanic blood put some makeup on me and i look not unlike a china doll put me in a puffy pink dress and i look delicate dainty petite dammit the rest of the women in the wedding party were all fivefive or above maybe some of them would actually look good in the dress i doubted it insult to injury we all had to wear hoop skirts underneath i looked like a reject from gone with the wind there dont you look lovely mrs cassidy had returned she was beaming at me i look like ive been dipped in peptobismol i said her smile faded around the edges she swallowed you dont like this last idea her voice was very stiff elsie markowitz came out of the dressing rooms kasey was trailing behind scowling i knew how she felt oh anita elsie said you look adorable great adorable just what i wanted to hear thanks i especially like the ribbons at your throat well all be wearing them you know sorry about that i said she frowned at me i think they just set off the dress it was my turn to frown youre serious arent you elsie looked puzzled well of course i am dont you like the dresses i decided not to answer on the grounds that it might piss someone off i guess what can you expect from a woman who has a perfectly good name like elizabeth but prefers to be named after a cow is this the absolutely last thing we can use for camouflage mrs cassidy i asked she nodded once very firmly i sighed and she smiled victory was hers and she knew it i knew i was beaten the moment i saw the dress but if im going to lose im going to make someone pay for it all right its done this is it ill wear it mrs cassidy beamed at me elsie smiled kasey smirked i hiked the hoop skirt up to my knees and stepped off the platform the hoop swung like a bell with me as the clapper the phone rang mrs cassidy went to answer it a lift in her step a song in her heart and me out of her shop joy in the afternoon i was struggling to get the wide skirt through the narrow little door that led to the changing rooms when she called ms blake its for you a detective sergeant storr see mommy i told you she was a policewoman kasey said i didnt explain because elsie had asked me not to weeks ago she thought kasey was too young to know about animators and zombies and vampire slayings not that any child of eight could not know what a vampire was they were pretty much the media event of the decade i tried to put the phone to my left ear but the damned flowers got in the way pressing the receiver in the bend of my neck and shoulder i reached back to undo the collar hi dolph whats up murder scene his voice was pleasant like he should sing tenor what kind of murder scene messy i finally pulled the collar free and dropped the phone anita you there yeah having some wardrobe trouble what its not important why do you want me to come down to the scene whatever did this wasnt human vampire youre the undead expert thats why i want you to come take a look okay give me the address and ill be right there there was a notepad of pale pink paper with little hearts on it the pen had a plastic cupid on the end of it st charles im not more than fifteen minutes from you good he hung up goodbye to you too dolph i said it to empty air just to feel superior i went back into the little room to change i had been offered a million dollars today just to kill someone and raise a zombie then off to the bridal shop for a final fitting now a murder scene messy dolph had said it was turning out to be a very busy afternoon messy dolph had called it a master of understatement blood was everywhere splattered over the white walls like someone had taken a can of paint and thrown it there was an offwhite couch with brown and gold patterned flowers on it most of the couch was hidden under a sheet the sheet was crimson a bright square of afternoon sunlight came through the clean sparkling windows the sunlight made the blood cherryred shiny fresh blood is really brighter than you see it on television and the movies in large quantities real blood is screaming fireengine red in large quantities but darker red shows up on the screen better so much for realism only fresh blood is red true red this blood was old and should have faded but some trick of the summer sunshine kept it shiny and new i swallowed very hard and took a deep breath you look a little green blake a voice said almost at my elbow i jumped and zerbrowski laughed did i scare ya no i lied detective zerbrowski was about fiveseven curly black hair going grey darkrimmed glasses framed brown eyes his brown suit was rumpled his yellow and maroon tie had a smudge on it probably from lunch he was grinning at me he was always grinning at me i gotcha blake admit it is our fierce vampire slayer gonna upchuck on the victims putting on a little weight there arent you zerbrowski ooh im hurt he said he clutched hands to his chest swaying a little dont tell me you dont want my body the way i want yours lay off zerbrowski wheres dolph in the master bedroom zerbrowski gazed up at the vaulted ceiling with its skylight wish katie and i could afford something like this yeah i said its nice i glanced at the sheetcovered couch the sheet clung to whatever was underneath like a napkin thrown over spilled juice there was something wrong with the way it looked then it hit me there werent enough bumps to make a whole human body whatever was under there was missing some parts the room sort of swam i looked away swallowing convulsely it had been months since i had actually gotten sick at a murder scene at least the airconditioning was on that was good heat always makes the smell worse hey blake do you really need to step outside zerbrowski took my arm as if to lead me towards the door thanks but im fine i looked him straight in his baby browns and lied he knew i was lying i wasnt all right but id make it he released my arm stepped back and gave me a mock salute i love a tough broad i smiled before i could stop it go away zerbrowski end of the hall last door on the left youll find dolph there he walked away into the crowd of men there are always more people than you need at a murder scene not the gawkers outside but uniforms plainclothes technicians the guy with the video camera a murder scene was like a bee swarm full of frenzied movement and damn crowded i threaded my way through the crowd my plasticcoated id badge was clipped to the collar of my navyblue jacket it was so the police would know i was on their side and hadnt just snuck in it also made carrying a gun into a crowd of policemen safer i squeezed past a crowd that was gathered like a traffic jam beside a door in the middle of the hall voices came disjointed jesus look at the blood have they found the body yet you mean whats left of it no i pushed between two uniforms one said hey i found a cleared space just in front of the last door on the lefthand side i dont know how dolph had done it but he was alone in the room maybe they were just finished in here he knelt in the middle of the pale brown carpet his thick hands encased in surgical gloves were on his thighs his black hair was cut so short it left his ears sort of stranded on either side of a large blunt face he saw me and stood he was sixeight built big like a wrestler the canopied bed behind him suddenly looked small dolph was head of the polices newest task force the spook squad official title was the regional preternatural investigation team rpit pronounced rip it it handled all supernatural crime it was a place to dump the troublemakers i never wondered what zerbrowski had done to get on the spook squad his sense of humor was too strange and absolutely merciless but dolph he was the perfect policeman i had always sort of figured he had offended someone high up offended them by being too good at his job now that i could believe there was another sheetcovered bundle on the carpet beside him anita he always talks like that one word at a time dolph i said he knelt between the canopy bed and the bloodsoaked sheet you ready i know youre the silent type dolph but could you tell me what im supposed to be looking for i want to know what you see not what i tell you youre supposed to see for dolph it was a speech okay i said lets do it he pulled back the sheet it peeled away from the bloody thing underneath i stood and i stared and all i could see was a lump of bloody meat it could have been from anything a cow horse deer but human surely not my eyes saw it but my brain refused what it was being shown i squatted beside it tucking my skirt under my thighs the carpeting squeezed underfoot like rain had gotten to it but it wasnt rain do you have a pair of gloves i can borrow i left my crime scene gear at the office right jacket pocket he lifted his hands in the air there were blood marks on the gloves help yourself the wife hates me to get blood on the dry cleaning i smiled amazing a sense of humor is mandatory at times i had to reach across the remains i pulled out two surgical gloves one size fits all the gloves always felt like they had powder in them they didnt feel like gloves at all more like condoms for your hands can i touch it without damaging evidence yes i poked the side of it with two fingers it was like poking a side of fresh beef a nice solid feel to it my fingers traced the bumps of bone ribs under the flesh ribs suddenly i knew what i was looking at part of the rib cage of a human being there was the shoulder white bone sticking out where the arm had been torn away that was all all there was i stood too quickly and stumbled the carpet squeeshed underfoot the room was suddenly very hot i turned away from the body and found myself staring at the bureau its mirror was splattered so heavily with blood it looked like someone had covered it in layers of red fingernail polish cherry blossom red carnival crimson candy apple i closed my eyes and counted very slowly to ten when i opened them the room seemed cooler i noticed for the first time that a ceiling fan was slowly turning i was fine heap big vampire slayer riight dolph didnt comment as i knelt by the body again he didnt even look at me good man i tried to be objective and see whatever there was to see but it was hard i liked the remains better when i couldnt figure out what part of the body they were now all i could see was the bloody remains all i could think of was this used to be a human body used to be was the operative phrase no signs of a weapon that i can see but the coroner will be able to tell you that i reached out to touch it again then stopped can you help me raise it up so i can see inside the chest cavity whats left of the chest cavity dolph dropped the sheet and helped me lift the remains it was lighter than it looked raised on its side there was nothing underneath all the vital organs that the ribs protect were gone it looked for all the world like a side of beef ribs except for the bones where the arm should have connected part of the collarbone was still attached okay i said my voice sounded breathy i stood holding my bloodspattered hands out to my sides cover it please he did and stood impressions violence extreme violence more than human strength the bodys been ripped apart by hand why by hand no knife marks i laughed but it choked me hell id think someone had used a saw on the body like butchering a cow but the bones i shook my head nothing mechanical was used to do this anything else yeah where is the rest of the fucking body down the hall second door on the left the rest of the body the room was getting hot again just go look tell me what you see dammit dolph i know you dont like to influence your experts but i dont like walking in there blind he just stared at me at least answer one question maybe what is it worse than this he seemed to think about that for a moment no and yes damn you youll understand after youve seen it i didnt want to understand bert had been thrilled that the police wanted to put me on retainer he had told me i would gain valuable experience working with the police all i had gained so far was a wider variety of nightmares dolph walked ahead of me to the next chamber of horrors didnt really want to find the rest of the body i wanted to go home he hesitated in front of the closed door until i stood beside him there was a cardboard cutout of a rabbit on the door like for easter a needlework sign hung just below the bunny babys room dolph my voice sounded very quiet the noise from the living room was muted yes nothing nothing i took a deep breath and let it out i could do this i could do this oh god i didnt want to do this i whispered a prayer under my breath as the door swung inward there are moments in life when the only way to get through is with a little grace from on high i was betting this was going to be one of them sunlight streamed through a small window the curtains were white with little duckies and bunnies stitched around the edges animal cutouts danced around the pale blue walls there was no crib only one of those beds with handrails halfway down a big boy bed wasnt that what they were called there wasnt as much blood in here thank you dear god who says prayers never get answered but in a square of bright august sunshine sat a stuffed teddy bear the teddy bear was candycoated with blood one glassy eye stared round and surprised out of the spiky fake fur i knelt beside it the carpet didnt squeeze no blood soaked in why was the damn bear sitting here covered in congealing blood there was no other blood in the entire room that i could see did someone just set it here i looked up and found myself staring at a small white chest of drawers with bunnies painted on it when you have a motif i guess you stick with it on the white paint was one small perfect handprint i crawled towards it and held up my hand near it comparing size my hands arent big small even for a womans but this handprint was tiny two three maybe four blue walls probably a boy how old was the child picture in the living room has benjamin reynolds age three written on the back benjamin i whispered it and stared at the bloody handprint theres no body in this room no one was killed here no why did you want me to see it i looked up at him still kneeling your opinion isnt worth anything if you dont see everything that damn bear is going to haunt me me too he said i stood resisting the urge to smooth my skirt down in back it was amazing how many times i touched my clothing without thinking and smeared blood on myself but not today is it the boys body under the sheet in the living room as i said it i prayed that it wasnt no he said thank god mothers body yes where is the boys body we cant find it he hesitated then asked could the thing have eaten the childs body completely you mean so there wouldnt be anything left to find yes he said his face looked just the tiniest bit pale mine probably did too possible but even the undead have a limit to what they can eat i took a deep breath did you find any signs of regurgitation regurgitation he smiled nice word no the creature didnt eat and then vomit at least we havent found it then the boys probably still around somewhere could he be alive dolph asked i looked up at him i wanted to say yes but i knew the answer was probably no i compromised i dont know dolph nodded the living room next i asked no he walked out of the room without another word i followed what else could i do but i didnt hurry if he wanted to play tough silent policeman he could damn well wait for me to catch up i followed his broad back around the corner through the living room into the kitchen a sliding glass door led out onto a deck glass was everywhere shiny slivers of it sparkled in the light from yet another skylight the kitchen was spotless like a magazine ad done in blue tile and rich lightcolored wood nice kitchen i said i could see men moving around the yard the party had moved outside the privacy fence hid them from the curious neighbors as it had hidden the killer last night there was just one detective standing beside the shiny sink he was scribbling something in a notebook dolph motioned me to have a closer look okay i said something crashed through the sliding glass door it must have made a hell of a lot of noise this much glass breaking even with the airconditioning on youd hear it you think so he asked did any of the neighbors hear anything i asked no one will admit to it he said i nodded glass breaks someone comes to check it out probably the man some sexist stereotypes die hard what do you mean dolph asked the brave hunter protecting his family i said okay say it was the man what next man comes in sees whatever crashed through the window yells for his wife probably tells her to get out take the kid and run why not call the police he asked i didnt see a phone in the master bedroom i nodded towards the phone on the kitchen wall this is probably the only phone you have to get past the bogeyman to reach the phone go on i glanced behind me into the living room the sheetcovered couch was just visible the thing whatever it was took out the man quick disabled him knocked him out but didnt kill him why not kill dont test me dolph there isnt enough blood in the kitchen he was eaten in the bedroom whatever did it wouldnt have dragged a dead man off to the bedroom it chased the man into the bedroom and killed him there not bad want to take a shot at the living room next not really but i didnt say it out loud there was more left of the woman her upper body was almost intact paper bags enveloped her hands we had samples of something under her fingernails i hoped it helped her wide brown eyes stared up at the ceiling the pajama top clung wetly to where her waist used to be i swallowed hard and used my index finger and thumb to raise the pajama top her spine glistened in the hard sunshine wet and white and dangling like a cord that had been ripped out of its socket okay something tore her apart just like the man in the bedroom how do you know its a man unless they had company it has to be the man they didnt have a visitor did they dolph shook his head not as far as we know then it has to be the man because she still has all her ribs and both arms i tried to swallow the anger in my voice it wasnt dolphs fault im not one of your cops i wish youd stop asking me questions that you already have the answers to he nodded fair enough sometimes i forget youre not one of the boys thank you for that you know what i mean i do and i even know you mean it as a compliment but can we finish discussing this outside please sure he slipped off his bloody gloves and put them in a garbage sack that was sitting open in the kitchen i did the same the heat fastened round me like melting plastic but it felt good clean somehow i breathed in great lungfuls of hot sweating air ah summer i was right though it wasnt human he asked there were two uniformed police officers keeping the crowd off the lawn and in the street children parents kids on bikes it looked like a freaking circus no it wasnt human there was no blood on the glass that it came through i noticed whats the significance most dead dont bleed except for vampires most freshly dead zombies can bleed but vampires bleed almost like a person you dont think it was a vampire then if it was then it ate human flesh vampires cant digest solid food ghoul too far from a cemetery and thered be more destruction of the house ghouls would tear up furniture like wild animals zombie i shook my head i honestly dont know there are such things as flesheating zombies theyre rare but it happens you told me that there have been three reported cases each time the zombies stay human longer and dont rot i smiled good memory thats right flesheating zombies dont rot as long as you feed them or at least dont rot as quickly are they violent not so far i said are zombies violent dolph asked only if told to be what does that mean he asked you can order a zombie to kill people if youre powerful enough a zombie as a murder weapon i nodded something like that yes who could do something like that im not sure thats what happened here i said i know but who could do it well hell i could but i wouldnt and nobody i know that could do it would do it let us decide that he said he had gotten his little notebook out you really want me to give you names of friends so you can ask them if they happened to have raised a zombie and sent it to kill these people please i sighed i dont believe this all right me manny rodriguez peter burke and i stopped words already forming a third name what is it nothing i just remembered that ive got burkes funeral to go to this week hes dead so i dont think hes a suspect dolph was looking at me hard suspicion plain on his face you sure this is all the names you want to give me if i think of anyone else ill let you know i said i was at my wideeyed most sincere see nothing up my sleeve you do that anita sure thing he smiled and shook his head who are you protecting me i said he looked puzzled lets just say i dont want to get someone mad at me who i looked up into the clear august sky you think well get rain dammit anita i need your help ive given you my help i said the name not yet ill check it out and if it looks suspicious i promise to share it with you well isnt that just generous of you a flush was creeping up his neck i had never seen dolph angry before i feared i was about to the first death was a homeless man we thought hed passed out from liquor and ghouls got him we found him right next to a cemetery open and shut right his voice was rising just a bit with each word next we find this couple teenagers caught necking in the boys car dead still not too far from the cemetery we called in an exterminator and a priest case closed he lowered his voice but it was like he had swallowed the yelling his voice was strained and almost touchable with its anger now this its the same beastie whatever the hell it is but we are miles from the nearest frigging cemetery it isnt a ghoul and maybe if i had called you in with the first or even the second case this wouldnt have happened but i figure im getting good at this supernatural crap ive had some experience now but it isnt enough it isnt nearly enough his big hands were crushing his notebook thats the longest speech ive ever heard you make i said he half laughed i need the name anita dominga salvador shes the voodoo priest for the entire midwest but if you send police down there she wont talk to you none of them will but theyll talk to you yes i said okay but i better hear something from you by tomorrow i dont know if i can set up a meeting that soon either you do it or i do it he said okay okay ill do it somehow thanks anita at least now we have someplace to start it might not be a zombie at all dolph im just guessing what else could it be well if there had been blood on the glass id say maybe a lycanthrope oh great just what i needa rampaging shapeshifter but there was no blood on the glass so probably some kind of undead he said exactly you talk to this dominga salvador and give me a report asap aye aye sergeant he made a face at me and walked back inside the house better him than me all i had to do was go home change clothes and prepare to raise the dead at full dark tonight i had three clients lined up or would that be lying down ellen grisholms therapist thought it would be therapeutic for ellen to confront her childmolesting father the trouble was the father had been dead for several months so im going to raise mr grisholm from the dead and let his daughter tell him what a son of a bitch he was the therapist said it would be cleansing i guess if you have a doctorate youre allowed to say things like that the other two raisings were more usual a contested will and a prosecutions star witness that had had the bad taste to have a heart attack before testifying in court they still werent sure if the testimony of a zombie was admissible in court but they were desperate enough to try and to pay for the privilege i stood there in the greenishbrown grass glad to see the family hadnt been addicted to sprinklers a waste of water maybe they had even recycled their pop cans newspapers maybe they had been decent earthloving citizens maybe not one of the uniforms lifted the yellow donotcross tape and let me out i ignored all the staring people and got in my car it was a latemodel nova i could have afforded something better but why bother it ran the steering wheel was too hot to touch i turned on the airconditioning and let the car cool down what i had told dolph about dominga salvador had been true she wouldnt talk to the police but that hadnt been the reason i tried to keep her name out of it if the police came knocking on seсora dontingas door shed want to know who sent them and shed find out the seсora was the most powerful vaudun priest i had ever met raising a murderous zombie was just one of many things she could do if she wanted to frankly there were things worse than zombies that could come crawling through your window some dark night i knew as little about that side of the business as i could get away with the seсora had invented most of it no i did not want dominga salvador angry with me so it looked like i was going to have to talk with her tomorrow it was sort of like getting an appointment to see the godfather of voodoo or in this case the godmother the trouble was this godmother was unhappy with me dominga had sent me invitations to her home to her ceremonies i had politely declined i think my being a christian disappointed her so i had managed to avoid a face to face until now i was going to ask the most powerful vaudun priest in the united states maybe in all of north america if she just happened to raise a zombie and if that zombie just happened to be going around killing people on her orders was i crazy maybe it looked like tomorrow was going to be another busy day the alarm screamed i rolled over swatting at the buttons on top of the digital clock surely to god id hit the snooze button soon i finally had to prop myself up on one elbow and actually open my eyes i turned off the alarm and stared at the glowing numbers am shit id only gotten home at three why had i set the alarm for six i couldnt remember i am not at my best after only three hours of sleep i lay back down in the still warm nest of sheets my eyes were fluttering shut when i remembered dominga salvador she had agreed to meet me at am today talk about a breakfast meeting i struggled out of the sheet and just sat on the side of the bed for a minute the apartment was absolutely still the only sound was the hushhush of the airconditioning quiet as a funeral i got up then thoughts of bloodcoated teddy bears dancing in my head fifteen minutes later i was dressed i always showered after coming in from work no matter how late it was i couldnt stand the thought of going to bed between nice clean sheets smeared with dried chicken blood sometimes its goat blood but more often chicken i had compromised on the outfit caught between showing respect and not melting in the heat it would have been easy if i hadnt planned to carry a gun with me call me paranoid but i dont leave home without it the acid washed jeans jogging socks and nikes were easy an uncle mikes interpants holster complete with a firestar mm completed the outfit the firestar was my backup piece to the browning hipower the browning was far too bulky to put down an interpants holster but the firestar fit nicely now all i needed was a shirt that would hide the gun but leave it accessible to grab and shoot this was harder than it sounded i finally settled on a short almost middrift top that just barely fell over my waistband i turned in front of the mirror the gun was invisible as long as i didnt forget and raise my arms too high the top unfortunately was a pale pale pink what had possessed me to buy this top i really didnt remember maybe it had been a gift i hoped so the thought that i had actually spent money on anything pink was more than i could bear i hadnt opened the drapes at all yet the entire apartment was in twilight i had specialordered very heavy drapes i rarely saw sunlight and i didnt miss it much i turned on the light over my fish tank the angelfish rose towards the top mouths moving in slowmotion begging fish are my idea of pets you dont walk them pick up after them or have to housebreak them clean the tank occasionally feed them and they dont give a damn how many hours of overtime you work the smell of strong brewed coffee wafted through the apartment from my mr coffee i sat at my little twoseater kitchen table sipping hot black colombian vintage beans fresh from my freezer ground on the spot there was no other way to drink coffee though in a pinch ill take it just about any way i can get it the doorbell chimed i jumped spilling coffee onto the table nervous me i left my firestar on the kitchen table instead of taking it to the door with me see im not paranoid just very very careful i checked the peephole and opened the door manny rodriguez stood in the doorway hes about two inches taller than i am his coalblack hair is streaked with grey and white thick waves of it frame his thin face and black mustache hes fiftytwo and with one exception i would still rather have him backing me in a dangerous situation than anyone else i know we shook hands we always do that his grip was firm and dry he grinned at me flashing very white teeth in his brown face i smell coffee i grinned back you know its all i have for breakfast he walked in and i locked the door behind him habit rosita thinks you dont take care of yourself he dropped into a nearperfect imitation of his wifes scolding voice a much thicker mexican accent than his own she doesnt eat right so thin poor anita no husband not even a boyfriend he grinned rosita sounds like my stepmother judith is sick with worry that ill be an old maid youre what twentyfour mmuh he just shook his head sometimes i do not understand women it was my turn to grin what am i chopped liver anita you know i didnt mean i know im one of the boys i understand you are better than any of the boys at work sit down let me pour coffee in your mouth before your foot fits in again you are being difficult you know what i meant he stared at me out of his solid brown eyes face very serious i smiled yeah i know what you meant i picked one of the dozen or so mugs from my kitchen cabinet my favorite mugs dangled from a mugtree on the countertop manny sat down sipping coffee glancing at his cup it was red with black letters that said im a coldhearted bitch but im good at it he laughed coffee up his nose i sipped my own coffee from a mug decorated with fluffy baby penguins id never admit it but it is my favorite mug why dont you bring your penguin mug to work he asked berts latest brainstorm was that we all use personalized coffee cups at work he thought it would add a homey note to the office i had brought in a grey on grey cup that said its a dirty job and i get to do it bert had made me take it home i enjoy yanking berts chain so youre going to keep bringing in unacceptable cups i smiled mmuh he just shook his head i really appreciate you coming to see dominga with me he shrugged i couldnt let you go see the devil woman alone could i i frowned at the nickname or was it an insult thats what your wife calls dominga not what i call her he glanced down at the gun still lying on the tabletop but youll take a gun with you just in case i looked at him over the top of my cup just in case if it comes to shooting our way out anita it will be too late she has bodyguards all over the place i dont plan to shoot anybody we are just going to ask a few questions thats all he smirked por favor seсora salvador did you raise a killer zombie recently knock it off manny i know its awkward awkward he shook his head awkward she says if you piss off dominga salvador its a hell of a lot more than just awkward you dont have to come you called me for backup he smiled that brilliant teeth flashing smile that lit up his entire face you didnt call charles or jamison you called me and anita that is the best compliment you could give an old man youre not an old man and i meant it that is not what my wife keeps telling me rosita has forbidden me to go vampire hunting with you but she cant curtail my zombierelated activities not yet anyway the surprise must have shone on my face because he said i know she talked to you two years back when i was in the hospital you almost died i said and you had how many broken bones rosita made a reasonable request manny you have four children to think of and im too old to be slaying vampires his voice held irony and almost bitterness youll never be too old i said a nice thought he drained his coffee mug we better go dont want to keep the seсora waiting god forbid i said amen he said i stared at him as he rinsed his mug out in the sink do you know something youre not telling me no he said i rinsed my own cup still staring at him i could feel a suspicious frown between my eyes manny honest mexican i dont know nuthin then whats wrong you know i was vaudun before rosita converted me to pure christianity yeah so dominga salvador was not just my priestess she was my lover i stared at him for a few heartbeats youre kidding his face was very serious as he said i wouldnt joke about something like that i shrugged peoples choices of lovers never failed to amaze me thats why you could get me a meeting with her on such short notice he nodded why didnt you tell me before because you might have tried to sneak over there without me would that have been so bad he just stared at me brown eyes very serious maybe i got my gun from the table and fitted it to the interpants holster eight bullets the browning could hold fourteen but lets get real if i needed more than eight bullets i was dead and so was manny shit i whispered what i feel like im going to visit the bogeyman manny made a back and forth motion with his head not a bad analogy great just freaking bloody great why was i doing this the image of benjamin reynoldss bloodcoated teddy bear flashed into my mind all right i knew why i was doing it if there was even a remote chance that the boy could still be alive id go into hell itselfif i stood a chance of coming back out i didnt mention this out loud i did not want to know if hell was a good analogy too the neighborhood was older houses fifties forties the lawns were dying to brown for lack of water no sprinklers here flowers struggled to survive in beds close to the houses mostly petunias geraniums a few rosebushes the streets were clean neat and one block over you could get yourself shot for wearing the wrong color of jacket gang activity stopped at seсora salvadors neighborhood even teenagers with automatic pistols fear things you cant stop with bullets no matter how good a shot you are silver plated bullets will harm a vampire but not kill it it will kill a lycanthrope but not a zombie you can hack the damn things to pieces and the disconnected body parts will crawl after you ive seen it it aint pretty the gangs leave the seсoras turf alone no violence it is a place of permanent truce there are stories of one hispanic gang that thought it had protection against grisgris some people say that the gangs exleader is still down in domingas basement obeying an occasional order he was great showandtell to any juvenile delinquents who got out of hand personally i had never seen her raise a zombie but then id never seen her call the snakes either id just as soon keep it that way seсora salvadors twostory house is on about a half acre of land a nice roomy yard bright red geraniums flamed against the whitewashed walls red and white blood and bone i was sure the symbolism was not lost on casual passersby it certainly wasnt lost on me manny parked his car in the driveway behind a cream colored impala the twocar garage was painted white to match the house there was a little girl of about five riding a tricycle furiously up and down the sidewalk a slightly older pair of boys were sitting on the steps that led up to the porch they stopped playing and looked at us a man stood on the porch behind them he was wearing a shoulder holster over a sleeveless blue tshirt sort of blatant all he needed was a flashing neon sign that said bad ass there were chalk markings on the sidewalk pastel crosses and unreadable diagrams it looked like a childrens game but it wasnt some devoted fans of the seсora had chalked designs of worship in front of her house stubs of candles had melted to lumps around the designs the girl on the tricycle peddled back and forth over the designs normal right i followed manny over the sunscorched lawn the little girl on the tricycle was watching us now small brown face unreadable manny removed his sunglasses and smiled up at the man buenos dias antonio it has been a long time si antonio said his voice was low and sullen his deeply tanned arms were crossed loosely over his chest it put his right hand right next to his gun butt i used mannys body to shield me from sight and casually put my hands close to my own gun the boy scout motto always be prepared or was that the marines youve become a strong handsome man manny said my grandmother says i must let you in antonio said she is a wise woman manny said antonio shrugged she is the seсora he peered around manny at me who is this seсorita anita blake manny stepped back so i could move forward i did right hand loose on my waist like i had an attitude but it was the closest i could stay to my gun antonio looked down at me his dark eyes were angry but that was all he didnt have near the gaze of harold gaynors bodyguards i smiled nice to meet you he squinted at me suspiciously for a moment then nodded i continued to smile at him and a slow smile spread over his face he thought i was flirting with him i let him think it he said something in spanish all i could do was smile and shake my head he spoke softly and there was a look in his dark eyes a curve to his mouth i didnt have to speak the language to know i was being propositioned or insulted mannys neck was stiff his face flushed he said something from between clenched teeth it was antonios turn to flush his hand started to go for his gun i stepped up two steps touching his wrist as if i didnt know what was going on the tension in his arm was like a wire straining i beamed up at him as i held his wrist his eyes flicked from manny to me then the tension eased but i didnt let go of his wrist until his arm fell to his side he raised my hand to his lips kissing it his mouth lingered on the back of my hand but his eyes stayed on manny angry ragefilled antonio carried a gun but he was an amateur amateurs with guns eventually get themselves killed i wondered if dominga salvador knew that she may have been a whiz at voodoo but i bet she didnt know much about guns and what it took to use one on a regular basis whatever it took antonio didnt have it hed kill you all right no sweat but for the wrong reasons amateurs reasons of course youll be just as dead he guided me up on the porch beside him still holding my hand it was my left hand he could hold that all day i must check you for weapons manuel i understand manny said he stepped up on the porch and antonio stepped back keeping room between them in case manny jumped him that left me with a clear shot of antonios back careless under different circumstances deadly he made manny lean against the porch railing like a police frisk antonio knew what he was doing but it was an angry search lots of quick jerky hand movements as if just touching mannys body enraged him a lot of hate in old tony it never occurred to him to pat me down for weapons tsktsk a second man came to the screen door he was in his late forties maybe he was wearing a white undershirt with a plaid shirt unbuttoned over it the sleeves were folded back as far as theyd go sweat stood out on his forehead i was betting there was a gun at the small of his back his black hair had a pure white streak just over the forehead what is taking so long antonio his voice was thick and held an accent i searched him for weapons the older man nodded she is ready to see you both antonio stood to one side taking up his post on the porch once more he made a kissing noise as i walked past i felt manny stiffen but we made it into the living room without anyone getting shot we were on a roll the living room was spacious with a diningroom set taking up the lefthand side there was a wall piano in the living room i wondered who played antonio naw we followed the man through a short hallway into a roomy kitchen golden oblongs of sunshine lay heavy on a black and white tiled floor the floor and kitchen were old but the appliances were new one of those deluxe refrigerators with an ice maker and water dispenser took up a hunk of the back wall all the appliances were done in a pale yellow harvest gold autumn bronze sitting at the kitchen table was a woman in her early sixties her thin brown face was seamed with a lot of smile lines pure white hair was done in a bun at the nape of her neck she sat very straight in her chair thinboned hands folded on the tabletop she looked terribly harmless a nice old granny if a quarter of what id heard about her was true it was the greatest camouflage id ever seen she smiled and held out her hands manny stepped forward and took the offering brushing his lips on her knuckles it is good to see you manuel her voice was rich a contralto with the velvet brush of an accent and you dominga he released her hands and sat across from her her quick black eyes flicked to me still standing in the doorway so anita blake you have come to me at last it was a strange thing to say i glanced at manny he gave a shrug with his eyes he didnt know what she meant either great i didnt know you were eagerly awaiting me seсora i have heard stories of you chica wondrous stories there was a hint in those black eyes that smiling face that was not harmless manny i asked it wasnt me no manuel does not talk to me anymore his little wife forbids it that last sentence was angry bitter oh god the most powerful voodoo priestess in the midwest was acting like a scorned lover shit she turned those angry black eyes to me all who deal in vaudun come to seсora salvador eventually i do not deal in vaudun she laughed at that all the lines in her face flowed into the laughter you raise the dead the zombie and you do not deal in vaudun oh chica that is funny her voice sparkled with genuine amusement so glad i could make her day dominga i told you why we wished this meeting i made it very clear manny said she waved him to silence oh you were very careful on the phone manuel she leaned towards me he made it very clear that you were not here to participate in any of my pagan rituals the bitterness in her voice was sharp enough to choke on come here chica she said she held out one hand to me not both was i supposed to kiss it as manny had done i didnt think id come to see the pope i realized then that i didnt want to touch her she had done nothing wrong yet the muscles in my shoulders were screaming with tension i was afraid and i didnt know why i stepped forward and took her hand uncertain what to do with it her skin was warm and dry she sort of lowered me to the chair closest to her still holding my hand she said something in her soft deep voice i shook my head im sorry i dont understand spanish she touched my hair with her free hand black hair like the wing of a crow it does not come from any pale skin my mother was mexican yet you do not speak her tongue she was still holding my hand and i wanted it back she died when i was young i was raised by my fathers people i see i pulled my hand free and instantly felt better she had done nothing to me nothing why was i so damn jumpy the man with the streaked hair had taken up a post behind the seсora i could see him clearly his hands were in plain sight i could see the back door and the entrance to the kitchen no one was sneaking up behind me but the hair at the base of my skull was standing at attention i glanced at manny but he was staring at dominga his hands were gripped together on the tabletop so tightly that his knuckles were mottled i felt like someone at a foreign film festival without subtitles i could sort of guess what was going on but i wasnt sure i was right the creeping skin on my neck told me some hocuspocus was going on mannys reaction said that just maybe the hocuspocus was meant for him mannys shoulders slumped his hands relaxed their awful tension it was a visible release of some kind dominga smiled a brilliant flash of teeth you could have been so powerful mi corazon i did not want the power dominga he said i stared from one to the other not exactly sure what had just happened i wasnt sure i wanted to know i was willing to believe that ignorance was bliss it so often is she turned her quick black eyes to me and you chica do you want power the creeping sensation at the base of my skull spread over my body it felt like insects marching on my skin shit no a nice simple answer maybe i should try those more often perhaps not but you will i didnt like the way she said that it was ridiculous to be sitting in a sunny kitchen at in the morning and be scared but there it was my gut was twitching with it she stared at me her eyes were just eyes there was none of that seductive power of a vampire they were just eyes and yet the hair on my neck tried to crawl down my spine goose bumps broke out on my body a rush of prickling warmth i licked my lips and stared at dominga salvador it was a slap of magic she was testing me id had it done before people are so fascinated with what i do convinced that i know magic i dont i have an affinity with the dead its not the same i stared into her nearly black eyes and felt myself sway forward it was like falling without movement the world sort of swung for a moment then steadied warmth burst out of my body like a twisting rope of heat it went outward to the old woman it hit her solid and i felt it like a jolt of electricity i stood up gasping for air shit anita are you all right manny was standing now too he touched my arm gently im not sure what the hell did she do to me it is what you have done to me chica dominga said she looked a little pale around the edges sweat beaded on her forehead the man stood away from the wall his hands loose and ready no dominga said enzo i am all right her voice was breathy as if she had been running i stayed standing i wanted to go home now please we did not come here for games dominga manny said his voice had deepened with anger and i think fear i agreed with that last emotion it is not a game manuel have you forgotten everything i taught you everything you were i have forgotten nothing but i did not bring her here to be harmed whether she is harmed or not is up to her mi corazon i didnt much like that last part youre not going to help us youre just going to play cat and mouse well this mouse is leaving i turned to leave keeping a watchful eye on enzo he wasnt an amateur dont you wish to find the little boy that manny said was taken three years old very young to be in the hands of the bokor it stopped me she knew it would damn her what is a bokor she smiled you really dont know do you i shook my head the smile widened all surprised pleasure place your right hand palm up on the table por favor if you know something about the boy just tell me please endure my little tests and i will help you what sort of tests i hoped i sounded as suspicious as i felt dominga laughed an abrupt and cheery sound it went with all the smile lines in her face her eyes were practically sparkling with mirth why did i feel like she was laughing at me come chica i will not hurt you she said manny if she does anything that may harm you i will say so dominga gazed up at me a sort of puzzled wonder on her face i have heard that you can raise three zombies in a night night after night yet you truly are a novice ignorance is bliss i said sit chica this will not hurt i promise this will not hurt it promised more painful things later i sat any delay could cost the boy his life try to appeal to her good side she leaned towards me do you really think the child is still alive guess she didnt have a good side i leaned back from her i couldnt help it and i couldnt lie to her no then we have time dont we time for what your hand chica por favor then i will answer your questions i took a deep breath and placed my right hand on the table palm up she was being mysterious i hated people who were mysterious she brought a small black bag from under the table as if it had been sitting in her lap the whole time like shed planned this manny was staring at the bag like something noisome was about to crawl out close dominga salvador pulled something noisome out of it it was a charm a grisgris made of black feathers bits of bone a mummified birds foot i thought at first it was a chicken until i saw the thick black talons there was a hawk or eagle out there somewhere with a peg leg i had visions of her digging the talons into my flesh and was all tensed to pull away but she simply placed the grisgris on my open palm feathers bits of bone the dried hawk foot it wasnt slimy it didnt hurt in fact i felt a little silly then i felt it warmth the thing was warm sitting there in my hand it hadnt been warm a second ago what are you doing to it dominga didnt answer i glanced up at her but her eyes were staring at my hand intent like a cat about to pounce i glanced back down the talons flexed then spread then flexed it was moving in my hand shiiit i wanted to stand up to fling the vile thing to the floor but i didnt i sat there with every hair on my body tingling my pulse thudding in my throat and let the thing move in my hand all right my voice sounded breathy ive passed your little test now get this thing the hell out of my hand dominga lifted the claw gently from my hand she was careful not to touch my skin i didnt know why but it was a noticeable effort dammit dammit i whispered under my breath i rubbed my hand against my stomach touching the gun hidden there it was comforting to know that if worse came to worst i could just shoot her before she scared me to death can we get down to business now my voice sounded almost steady bully for me dominga was cradling the claw in her hands you made the claw move you were frightened but not surprised why what could i say nothing i wanted her to know i have an affinity with the dead it responds to me like some people can read thoughts she smiled do you really believe that your ability to raise the dead is like mind reading parlor tricks dominga had obviously never met a really good telepath if she had she wouldnt have been scornful in their own way they were just as scary as she was i raise the dead seсora it is just a job you do not believe that any more than i do i try real hard i said youve been tested before by someone she made it a statement my grandmother on my mothers side tested me but not with that i pointed to the still flexing foot it looked like one of those fake hands that you can buy at spencers now that i wasnt holding it i could pretend it just had tiny little batteries in it somewhere right she was vaudun i nodded why did you not study with her i have an inborn gift for raising the dead that doesnt dictate my religious preferences you are christian she made the word sound like something bad thats it i stood i wish i could say its been a pleasure but it hasnt ask your questions chica what the change of subject was too fast for me ask whatever you came here to ask she said i glanced at manny if she says she will answer she will answer he didnt look completely happy about it i sat down again the next insult and im outta here but if she could really help oh hell she was dangling that thin little thread of hope and after what id seen at the reynolds house i was grabbing for it i had planned to be as polite as possible on the wording of the question now i didnt give a shit have you raised a zombie in the last few weeks some she said okay i hesitated over the next question the feel of that thing moving in my hand flashed back on me i rubbed my hand against my pants leg as if i could rub the sensation away what was the worst she could do to me if i offended her dont ask have you sent any zombies out on errands of revenge there that was polite amazing none are you sure i asked she smiled id remember if i loosed murderers from the grave killer zombies dont have to be murderers i said oh her pale eyebrows raised are you so very familiar with raising killer zombies i fought the urge to squirm like a schoolchild caught at a lie only one tell me no my voice was very firm no that is a private matter a private nightmare that i was not going to share with the voodoo lady i decided to change the subject just a little ive raised murderers before they werent more violent than regular undead how many dead have you called from the grave she asked i shrugged i dont know give me an she seemed to be groping for a word estimation i cant it must have been hundreds a thousand she asked maybe i havent kept count i said has your boss at animators incorporated kept count i would assume that all my clients are on file yes i said she smiled i would be interested in knowing the exact number what could it hurt ill find out if i can such an obedient girl she stood i did not raise this killer zombie of yours if that is what is eating citizens she smiled almost laughed as if it were funny but i know people that would never speak to you people that could do this horrible deed i will question them and they will answer me i will have truth from them and i will pass this truth on to you anita she said my name like it was meant to be said ahneetah made it sound exotic thank you very much seсora salvador but there is one favor i will ask in return for this information she said something unpleasant was about to be said id have bet on it what would that favor be seсora i want you to pass one more test for me i stared at her waiting for her to go on but she didnt what sort of test i asked come downstairs and i will show you her voice was mild as honey no dominga manny said he was standing now anita nothing the seсora could tell you would be worth what she wants i can talk to people and things that will not talk to you either of you good christians that you are come on anita we dont need her help he had started for the door i didnt follow him manny hadnt seen the slaughtered family he hadnt dreamed about bloodcoated teddy bears last night i had i couldnt leave if she could help me whether benjamin reynolds was dead or not wasnt the point the thing whatever it was would kill again and i was betting it had something to do with voodoo it wasnt my area i needed help and i needed it fast anita come on he touched my arm pulling me a little towards the door tell me about the test dominga smiled triumphantly she knew she had me she knew i wasnt leaving until i had her promised help damn let us retire to the basement i will explain the test there mannys grip on my arm tightened anita you dont know what youre doing he was right but just stay with me manny back me up dont let me do anything that will really hurt okay anita anything she wants you to do down there will hurt maybe not physically but it will hurt i have to do this manny i patted his hand and smiled itll be all right no he said it wont be i didnt know what to say to that except that he was probably right but it didnt matter i was going to do it whatever she asked within reason if it would stop the killings if it would fix it so that i never had to see another halfeaten body dominga smiled let us go downstairs may i speak with anita alone seсora por favor manny said his hand was still on my arm i could feel the tension in his hand you will have the rest of this beautiful day to talk to her manuel but i have only this short time if she does this test for me now i promise to aid her in any way i can to catch this killer it was a powerful offer a lot of people would talk to her just out of pure terror the police cant inspire that all they can do is arrest you it wasnt enough of a deterrent having the undead crawl through your window that was a deterrent four maybe five people were already dead it was a bad way to die ive already said id do it lets go she walked around the table and took mannys arm he jumped like shed struck him she pulled him away from me no harm will come to her manuel i swear i do not trust you dominga she laughed but it is her choice manuel i have not forced her you have blackmailed her dominga blackmailed her with the safety of others she looked back over her shoulder have i blackmailed you chica yes i said oh she is your student corazon she has your honesty and your bravery she is brave but she has not seen what lies below i wanted to ask what exactly was in the basement but i didnt i really didnt want to know ive had people warn me about supernatural shit before dont go in that room the monster will get you there usually is a monster and it usually tries to get me but up till now ive been faster or luckier than the monsters heres to my luck holding i wished that i could heed mannys warning going home sounded very good about now but duty reared its ugly head duty and a whisper of nightmares i didnt want to see another butchered family dominga led manny from the room i followed with enzo bringing up the rear what a day for a parade the basement stairs were steep wooden slats you could feel the vibrations in the stairs as we tromped down them it was not comforting the bright sunlight from the door spilled into absolute darkness the sunlight faltered seemed to fade as if it had no power in this cavelike place i stopped on the grey edge of daylight staring down into the nightdark of the room i couldnt even make out dominga and manny they had to be just in front of me didnt they enzo the bodyguard waited at my back like some patient mountain he made no move to hurry me was it my decision then could i just pack up my toys and go home manny i called a voice came distantly too far away maybe it was an acoustic trick of the room maybe not im here anita i strained to see where the voice was coming from but there was nothing to see i took two steps farther down into the inky dark and stopped like id hit a wall there was the damp rock smell of most basements but under that something stale sour sweet that almost indescribable smell of corpses it was faint here at the head of the stairs i was betting it would get worse the farther down i went my grandmother had been a priestess of vaudun her humfo had not smelled like corpses the line between good and evil wasnt as clear cut in voodoo as in wicca or christianity and satanism but it was there dominga salvador was on the wrong side of the line i had known that when i came it still bothered me grandmother flores had told me that i was a necromancer it was more than being a voodoo priestess and less i had a sympathy with the dead all dead it was hard to be vaudun and a necromancer and not be evil too tempting grandma said she had encouraged my being christian encouraged my father to cut me off from her side of the family encouraged it for love of me and fear for my soul and here i was going down the steps into the jaws of temptation what would grandma flores say to that probably go home which was good advice the tight feeling in my stomach was saying the same thing the lights came on i blinked on the stairs the one dim bulb at the foot of the staircase seemed as bright as a star dominga and manny stood just under the bulb looking up at me light why did i feel instantly better silly but true enzo let the door swing shut behind us the shadows were thick but down a narrow bricked hallway more bare light bulbs dangled i was almost at the bottom of the stairs that sweet sour smell was stronger i tried breathing through my mouth but that only made it clog the back of my throat the smell of rotting flesh clings to the tongue dominga led the way between the narrow walls there were regular patches in the walls places where it looked like cement had been put over doors paint had been smoothed over the cement but there had been doors rooms at regular intervals why wall them up why cover the doors in cement what was behind them i rubbed fingertips across the rough cement the surface was bumpy and cool the paint wasnt very old it would have flaked in this dampness it hadnt what was behind this blocked up door the skin just between my shoulder blades started to itch i fought an urge to glance back at enzo i was betting he was behaving himself i was betting that being shot was the least of my worries the air was cool and damp a very basement of a basement there were three doors two to the right one to the left that were just doors one door had a shiny new padlock on it as we walked past it i heard the door sigh as if something large had leaned against it i stopped whats in there enzo had stopped when i stopped dominga and manny had rounded a corner and we were alone i touched the door the wood creaked rattling against its hinges like some giant cat had rubbed against the door a smell rolled out from under the door i gagged and backed away the stench clung to my mouth and throat i swallowed convulsively and tasted it all the way down the thing behind the door made a mewling sound i couldnt tell if it was human or animal it was bigger than a person whatever it was and it was dead very very dead i covered my nose and mouth with my left hand the right was free just in case in case that thing should come crashing out bullets against the walking dead i knew better but the gun was still a comfort in a pinch i could shoot enzo but somehow i knew that if the thing rattling the door got out enzo would be in as much danger as i was we must go on now he said i couldnt tell anything from his face we might have been walking down the street to the corner store he seemed impervious and i hated him for it if im terrified by god everyone else should be too i eyed the supposedly unlocked door to my left i had to know i yanked it open the room was maybe eight by four like a cell the cement floor and whitewashed walls were clean empty it looked like a cell waiting for its next occupant enzo slammed the door shut i didnt fight him it wasnt worth it if i was going to go one on one with someone who outweighed me by over a hundred pounds i was going to be picky about where i drew the line an empty room wasnt worth it enzo leaned against the door sweat glimmered across his face in the harsh light do not try any other doors seсorita it could be very bad i nodded sure no problem an empty room and he was sweating nice to know something frightened him but why this room and not the one with the mewling stench behind it i didnt have a clue we must catch up with the seсora he made a gracious motion like a maitre d showing me to a chair i went where he pointed where else was i going to go the hallway fed into a large rectangular chamber it was painted the same startling white as the cell had been the whitewashed floor was covered in brilliant red and black designs verve it was called symbols drawn in the voodoo sanctuary to summon the lao the gods of vaudun the symbols acted as walls bordering a path they led to the altar if you stepped off the path you messed up all those carefully formed symbols i didnt know if that would be good or bad rule number three hundred sixtynine when dealing with unfamiliar magic when in doubt leave it alone i left it alone the end of the room gleamed with candles the warm rich light flickered and filled the white walls with heat and light dominga stood in the midst of that light that whiteness and gleamed with evil there was no other word for it she wasnt just bad she was evil it gleamed around her like darkness made liquid and touchable the smiling old woman was gone she was a creature of power manny stood off to one side he was staring at her he glanced at me his eyes were showing a lot of white the altar was directly behind domingas straight back dead animals spilled off the top of it to form a pool on the floor chickens dogs a small pig two goats lumps of fur and dried blood that i couldnt identify the altar looked like a fountain where dead things flowed out of the center sluggish and thick the sacrifices were fresh no smell of decay the glazed eyes of a goat stared at me i hated killing goats they always seemed so much more intelligent than chickens or maybe i just thought they were cuter a tall woman stood to the right of the altar her skin gleamed nearly black in the candlelight as if she had been carved of some heavy gleaming wood her hair was short and neat falling to her shoulders wide cheekbones full lips expert makeup she wore a long silky dress the bright scarlet of fresh blood it matched her lipstick to the right of the altar stood a zombie it had once been a woman long pale brown hair fell nearly to her waist someone had brushed it until it gleamed it was the only thing about the corpse that looked alive the skin had turned a greyish color the flesh had narrowed down around the bones like shrink wrap muscles moved under the thin rotting skin stringy and shrunken the nose was almost gone giving it a halffinished look a crimson gown hung loose and flapping on the skeletal remains there was even an attempt at makeup lipstick had been abandoned when the lips shriveled up but a dusting of mauve eye shadow outlined the bulging eyes i swallowed very hard and turned to stare at the first woman she was a zombie one of the best preserved and most lifelike i had ever seen but no matter how luscious she looked she was dead the woman the zombie stared back at me there was something in her perfect brown eyes that no zombie has for long the memory of who and what they were fades within a few days sometimes hours but this zombie was afraid the fear was like a shiny bright pain in her eyes zombies didnt have eyes like that i turned back to the more decayed zombie and found her staring at me too the bulging eyes were staring at me with most of the flesh holding the eyes in the socket gone her facial expressions werent as good but she managed it managed to be afraid shit dominga nodded and enzo motioned me farther into the circle i didnt want to go what the hell is going on here dominga she smiled almost a laugh i am not accustomed to such rudeness get used to it i said enzo sort of breathed down my back i did my best to ignore him my right hand was sort of casually near my gun without looking like i was reaching for my gun it wasnt easy reaching for a gun usually looks like reaching for a gun no one seemed to notice though goody for our side what have you done to the two zombies inspect them yourself chica if you are as powerful as the stories say you will answer your own question and if i cant figure it out i asked she smiled but her eyes were as flat and black as a sharks then you are not as powerful as the stories is this the test perhaps i sighed the voodoo lady wanted to see how tough i really was why maybe there wasnt a reason maybe she was just a sadistic powerhungry bitch yeah i could believe that then again maybe there was a purpose to the theatrics if so i still didnt know what it was i glanced at manny he gave a barely perceivable shrug he didnt know what was going on either great i didnt like playing domingas games especially when i didnt know the rules the zombies were still staring at me there was something in their eyes it was fear and something worsehope shit zombies didnt have hope they didnt have anything they were dead these werent dead i had to know heres hoping that curiosity didnt kill the animator i stepped around dominga carefully watching her out of the corner of my eye enzo stayed behind blocking the path between the verve he looked big and solid standing there but i could get past him if i wanted it bad enough bad enough to kill him i hoped i wouldnt want it that bad the decayed zombie stared down at me she was tall almost six feet skeletal feet peeked out from underneath the red gown a tall slender woman probably beautiful once bulging eyes rolled in the nearly bare sockets a wet sucking sound accompanied the movements id thrown up the first time i heard that sound the sound of eyeballs rolling in rotting sockets but that was four years ago when i was new at this decaying flesh didnt make me flinch anymore or throw up as a general rule the eyes were pale brown with a lot of green in them the smell of some expensive perfume floated around her powdery and fine like talcum powder in your nose sweet flowery underneath was the stink of rotting flesh it wrinkled my nose caught at the back of my throat the next time i smelled this delicate expensive perfume i would think of rotting flesh oh well it smelled too expensive to buy anyway she was staring at me she not it she there was the force of personality in her eyes i call most zombies it because it fits they may come from the grave very alivelooking but it doesnt last they rot personality and intelligence goes first then the body its always that order god is not cruel enough to force anyone to be aware while their body decays around them something had gone very wrong with this one i stepped around dominga salvador for no reason that i could name i stayed out of reach she had no weapon i was almost sure of that the danger she represented had nothing to do with knives or guns i simply didnt want her to touch me not even by accident the zombie on the left was perfect not a sign of decay the look in her eyes was alert alive god help us she could have gone anywhere and passed for human how had i known she wasnt alive i wasnt even sure none of the usual signs were there but i knew dead when i felt it yet i stared up at the second woman her lovely dark face stared back fear screamed out of her eyes whatever power let me raise the dead told me this was a zombie but my eyes couldnt tell it was amazing if dominga could raise zombies like this she had me beat hands down i have to wait three days before i raise a corpse it gives the soul time to leave the area souls usually hover around for a while three days is average i cant call shit from the grave if the souls still present it has been theorized that if an animator could keep the soul intact while raising the body wed get resurrection you know resurrection the real thing like in jesus and lazarus i didnt believe that or maybe i just know my limitations i stared up at this zombie and knew what was different the soul was still there the soul was still inside both bodies how how in jesus name did she do it the souls the souls are still in the bodies my voice held the distaste i felt why bother to hide it very good chica i went to stand to her left keeping enzo in sight how did you do it the soul was captured at the moment it took flight from the body i shook my head that doesnt explain anything dont you know how to capture souls in a bottle souls in a bottle was she kidding no she wasnt no i dont i tried not to sound superior as i said it i could teach you so much anita so very much no thanks i said you captured their souls then you raised the body and put the soul back in i was guessing but it sounded right very very good that is it exactly she was staring at me so hard that it was uncomfortable her empty black eyes were memorizing me but why is the second zombie rotting the theory is with the soul intact the zombie wont decay it is no longer a theory i have proved it she said i stared at the rotted corpse and it stared back then why is that one rotting and this one isnt just two necromancers talking shop tell me do you raise your zombies only during the dark of the moon the soul may be put into the body then removed again as often as i wish i stared at dominga salvador now i stared and tried not to let my jaw drop not to let the dawning horror slip across my face she would enjoy shocking me i didnt want her taking pleasure from me for any reason let me test my understanding here i said in my best executive trainee voice you put the soul into the body and it didnt rot then you took the soul out of the body making it an ordinary zombie and it did rot exactly she said then you put the soul back in the rotted corpse and the zombie was aware and alive again did the rotting stop when the soul went back in yes shit so you could keep the zombie over there rotted just that much forever yes double shit and this one i pointed this time like i was doing a lecture many people would pay dearly for her wait a minute you mean sell her as a sex slave perhaps but the idea was too horrible she was a zombie which meant she didnt need to eat or sleep or anything you could keep her in a closet and take her out like a toy a perfectly obedient slave are they as obedient as normal zombies or does the soul give them free will they seem to be very obedient maybe theyre just scared of you i said she smiled perhaps you cant just keep the soul imprisoned forever i cant she said the soul needs to go on to your christian heaven or hell yes i said these were wicked women chica their own families gave them to me paid me to punish them you took money for this it is illegal to tamper with dead bodies without permission of the family she said i dont know if she had planned to horrify me maybe not but with that one sentence she let me know that what she was doing was perfectly legal the dead had no rights this was the reason we needed some laws to protect zombies shit no one deserves to spend eternity locked in a corpse i said we could do this to criminals on death row chica they could be made to serve society after death i shook my head no its wrong i have created a nonrotting zombie chica animators i believe you call yourselves have been searching for the secret for years i have it and people will pay for it its wrong i may not know much about voodoo but even among your own people its wrong how can you keep the souls prisoner and not allow them to go on and join with the lao she shrugged and sighed she suddenly looked tired i was hoping chica that you would help me with two of us working we could create more zombies much faster we could be wealthy beyond our dreams youve asked the wrong girl i see that now i had hoped that since you were not vaudun you would not see it as wrong christian buddhist moslem you name it dominga no ones going to think its all right perhaps perhaps not it does not hurt to ask i glanced at the rotted zombie at least put your first experiment out of its misery dominga glanced at the zombie she makes a powerful demonstration does she not youve created a nonrotting zombie great dont be sadistic you think i am being cruel yeah i said manuel am i being cruel manny stared at me while he answered his eyes were trying to tell me something i couldnt tell what yes seсora you are being cruel she glanced over at him then surprise in the movement of her body her face do you really think i am cruel manuel your beloved amante he nodded slowly yes you were not so quick to judge a few years back manuel you slew the white goat for me more than once i turned towards manny it was like that moment in a movie where the main character has a revelation about someone there should be music and camera angles when you learn one of your best friends participated in human sacrifice more than once she had said more than once manny my voice was a hoarse whisper this for me was worse than the zombies the hell with strangers this was manny and it couldnt be true manny i said it again he wouldnt look at me bad sign you didnt know chica didnt your manny tell you of his past shut up i said he was my most treasured helper he would have done anything for me shut up i screamed it at her she stopped her face thinning with anger enzo took two steps into the altar area dont i wasnt even sure who i was saying it to i need to hear from him not from you the anger was still in her face enzo loomed like an avalanche about to be unleashed dominga gave one sharp nod ask him then chica manny is she telling the truth did you perform human sacrifices my voice sounded so normal it shouldnt have my stomach was so tight it hurt i wasnt afraid anymore or at least not of dominga the truth i was afraid of the truth he looked up his hair fell across his face framing his eyes a lot of pain in those eyes almost flinching its the truth isnt it my skin felt cold answer me dammit my voice still sounded ordinary calm yes he said yes you committed human sacrifice he glared at me now anger helping him meet my eyes yes yes it was my turn to look away god manny how could you my voice was soft now not ordinary if i didnt know better id say it sounded like i was on the verge of tears it was nearly twenty years ago anita i was vaudun and a necromancer i believed i loved the seсora thought i did i stared up at him the look on his face made my throat tight manny dammit he didnt say anything he just stood there looking miserable and i couldnt reconcile the two images manny rodriguez and someone who would slaughter the hornless goat in a ritual he had taught me right from wrong in this business he had refused to do so many things things not half as bad as this it made no sense i shook my head i cant deal with this right now i heard myself say it out loud and hadnt really meant to fine youve dropped your little bombshell seсora salvador you said youd help us if i passed your test did i pass when in doubt concentrate on one disaster at a time i wanted to offer you a chance to help me with my new business venture we both know im not going to do that i said it is a pity anita with training you could rival my powers be just like her when i grew up no thanks thanks anyway but im happy where i am her eyes flicked to manny back to me happy manny and i will deal with it seсora now will you help me if i help you without you helping me in some way you will owe me a favor i didnt want to owe her a favor i would rather just trade information what could you possibly know that would be worth all the effort i will expend hunting for your killer zombie i thought about that for a moment i know that legislation is being written right now about zombies zombies are going to have rights and laws protecting them soon i hoped it was soon no need to tell her how early in the process the legislation was so i must sell a few nonrotting zombies soon before it becomes illegal i wouldnt think illegal would bother you much human sacrifice is illegal too she gave a tiny smile i do not do such things anymore anita i have given up my wicked ways i didnt believe that and she knew i didnt believe it her smile widened when manuel left i stopped such evil practices without his urgings i became a respectable bokar she was lying but i couldnt prove it and she knew that too i gave you valuable information now will you help me she nodded graciously i will search among my followers to see if any knows of your killer zombie i had the sense that she was quietly laughing at me manny will she help us if the seсora says she will do a thing it will be done she is good that way i will find your killer if it has anything to do with vaudun she said great i didnt say thank you because it seemed wrong i wanted to call her a bitch and shoot her between the eyes but then i would have had to shoot enzo too and how would i explain that to the police she was breaking no laws dammit i dont suppose appealing to your better nature would make you forget this mad scheme to use your new improved zombies for slaves she smiled chica chica i will be rich beyond your wildest dreams you can refuse to join me but you cannot stop me dont bet on it i said what will you do go to the police i am breaking no laws the only way to stop me is to kill me she looked directly at me while she said it dont tempt me manny moved up beside me dont anita dont challenge her i was sort of mad at him too so what the hell i will stop you seсora salvador whatever it takes you call death magic against me anita and it is you who will die i didnt know death magic from frijoles i shrugged i was thinking something more down to earth like a bullet enzo surged into the altar area moving to stand between his bosslady and me dominga stopped him no enzo she is angry this morning and shocked her eyes were still laughing at me she knows nothing of the deeper magics she cannot harm me and she is too morally superior to commit coldblooded murder the worst part about it was that she was right i couldnt just put a bullet between her eyes not unless she threatened me i glanced at the waiting zombies patient as the dead but underneath that endless patience was fear and hope and god the line between life and death was getting thinner all the time at least lay to rest your first experiment youve proved you can put the soul in and out multiple times dont make her watch but anita i already have a buyer for her oh jesus you dont mean oh god a necrophiliac those that love the dead better than you or i ever will will pay extraordinary amounts for such as her maybe i could just shoot her you are a coldhearted amoral bitch and you chica need to learn respect for your elders respect has to be earned i said i think anita blake that you need to remember why people fear the dark i will see that very soon you have a visitor to your window some dark night when you are fast asleep in your warm safe bed something evil will creep into your room i will earn your respect if that is the way you want it i should have been afraid but i wasnt i was angry and wanted to go home you can force people to be afraid of you seсora but you cant force them to respect you we shall see anita call me after you have gotten my gift it will be soon will you still help locate the killer zombie i said i would and i will good i said may we go now she waved enzo back beside her by all means run out into the daylight where you can be brave i walked to the pathway manny stayed right with me we were careful not to look at each other we were too busy watching the seсora and her pets i stopped just inside the path manny touched my arm lightly as if he knew what i was about to say i ignored him i may not be willing to kill you in cold blood but hurt me first and ill put a bullet in you some bright sunshiny day threats will not save you chica she said i smiled sweetly you either bitch her face went all thin and angry i smiled wider she does not mean it seсora manny said she will not kill you is this true chica her voice was a rich growl of sound pleasant and frightening at the same time i gave manny a quick dirty look it was a good threat i didnt like weakening it with common sense or truth i said id shoot you i didnt say id kill you now did i no you did not manny grabbed my arm and started pulling me backwards towards the stairs he was pulling on my left arm leaving my right free for my gun just in case dominga never moved her black angry eyes stared at me until we rounded the corner manny pulled me into the hallway with its cement covered doors i pulled free of him we stared at each other for a heartbeat whats behind the doors i dont know doubt must have shown on my face because he said god as my witness anita i dont know it wasnt like this twenty years ago i just stared at him as if looking would change things i wish dominga salvador had kept mannys secret to herself i had not wanted to know anita we have to get out of here now the light bulb over our head went out like someone had snuffed it we both looked up there was nothing to see my arms broke out in goose bumps the bulb just ahead of us dimmed then blinked off manny was right we needed to leave now i broke into a half jog towards the stairs manny stayed with me the door with its shiny padlock rattled and thumped as if the thing were trying to get out another light bulb flashed off the darkness was snapping at our heels we were at a full run by the time we hit the stairs there were two bulbs left we were halfway up the stairs when the last light vanished the world went black i froze on the stairs unwilling to move without being able to see mannys arm brushed mine but i couldnt see him the darkness was complete i could have touched my eyeballs and not seen my finger we grabbed hands and held on his hand wasnt much bigger than mine it was warm and familiar and damn comforting the cracking of wood was loud as a shotgun blast in the dark the stench of rotting meat filled the stairwell shit the word echoed and bounced in the blackness i wished i hadnt said it something large pulled itself into the corridor it couldnt be as big as it sounded the wet slithering sounds moved towards the stairs or sounded like they did i stumbled up two steps manny didnt need any urging we stumbled through the darkness and the sounds below hurried the light under the door was so bright it almost hurt manny flung open the door the sunlight blazed against my eyes we were both momentarily blinded something screamed behind us caught in the edge of daylight the scream was almost human i started to turn to look manny slammed the door he shook his head you dont want to see i dont want to see he was right so why did i have this urge to yank the door open to stare down into the dark until i saw something pale and shapeless a screaming nightmare of a sight i stared at the closed door and i let it go do you think it will come out after us i asked into the daylight manny asked yeah i said i dont think so lets leave without finding out i agreed the august sunlight streamed into the living room warm and real the scream the darkness the zombies all of it seemed wrong for the sunlight things that go bump in the morning it didnt sound quite right i opened the screen door calmly slowly panicked me but i was listening so hard i could hear blood rush in my ears listening for slithery sounds of pursuit nothing antonio was still on guard outside should we warn him about the possibility of a lovecraftian horror nipping at our heels did you fuck the zombie downstairs antonio asked so much for warning old tony manny ignored him go fuck yourself i said he said heh i kept walking down the porch steps manny stayed with me antonio didnt draw his gun and shoot us the day was looking up the little girl on the tricycle had stopped by mannys car she stared up at me as i got in the passenger side door i stared back into huge brown eyes her face was darkly tanned she couldnt have been more than five manny got in the drivers side door he put the car in gear and we pulled away the little girl and i stared at each other just before we turned the corner she started pedaling up and down the sidewalk again the air conditioner blasted cold air into the car manny drove through the residential streets most of the driveways were empty people off to work small children playing in the yards a few moms out on the front steps i didnt see any daddies at home with the kids things change but not that much the silence stretched out between us it was not a comfortable silence manny glanced at me furtively out of the corner of his eye i slumped in the passenger seat the seat belt digging across my gun so i said you used to perform human sacrifice i think he flinched do you want me to lie no i want to not know i want to live in blessed ignorance it doesnt work that way anita he said i guess it doesnt i said i adjusted the lap strap so it didnt press over my gun ah comfort if only everything else were that easy to fix what are we going to do about it about you knowing he asked he glanced at me as he asked i nodded you arent going to rant and rave tell me what an evil bastard i am doesnt seem much point in it i said he looked at me a little longer this time thanks i didnt say it was alright manny im just not going to yell at you not yet anyway he passed a large white car full of darkskinned teenagers their car stereo was up so loud my teeth rattled the driver had one of those highboned flat faces straight off of an aztec carving our eyes met as we moved by them he made kissing motions with his mouth the others laughed uproariously i resisted the urge to flip them off mustnt encourage the little tykes they turned right we went straight relief manny stopped two cars back from a light just beyond the light was the turnoff west wed take up to olive and then a short jaunt to my apartment we had fortyfive minutes to an hour of travel time not a problem normally today i wanted away from manny i wanted some time to digest to decide how to feel talk to me anita please honest to god manny i dont know what to say truth try to stick to the truth between friends yeah ive known you for four years manny you are a good man you love your wife your kids youve saved my life ive saved yours i thought i knew you i havent changed yes i looked at him as i said it you have manny rodriguez would never under any circumstance take part in human sacrifice its been twenty years theres no statute of limitations on murder you going to the cops his voice was very quiet the light changed we waited our turn and merged into the morning traffic it was as heavy as it ever got in st louis its not the gridlock of la but stop and jerk is still pretty darn annoying especially this morning i dont have any proof just dominga salvadors word i wouldnt exactly call her a reliable witness if you had proof dont push me on this manny i stared out the window there was a silver miada with the top down the driver was whitehaired male and wore a jaunty little cap plus racing gloves middleage crisis does rosita know i asked she suspects but she doesnt know for sure doesnt want to know i said probably not he turned and stared at me then a red ford truck was nearly in front of us i yelled manny he slammed on the brakes and only the seat belt kept me from kissing the dashboard jesus manny watch your driving he concentrated on traffic for a few seconds then without looking at me this time are you going to tell rosita i thought about that for about a second i shook my head realized he couldnt see it and said i dont think so ignorance is bliss on this one manny i dont think your wife could deal with it shed leave me and take the kids i believed she would rosita was a very religious person she took all the commandments very seriously she already thinks im risking my eternal soul by raising the dead manny said she didnt have a problem until the pope threatened to excommunicate all animators unless they stopped raising the dead the church is very important to rosita me too but im a happy little episcopalian now switch churches its not that easy he said it wasnt i knew that but hey you do what you can or what you have to can you explain why you would do human sacrifice i mean something that will make sense to me no he said he pulled into the far lane it seemed to be going a little faster it slowed down as soon as we pulled in murphys law of traffic you wont even try to explain its indefensible anita i live with what i did i cant do anything else he had a point this has to change the way i think about you manny in what way i dont know yet honesty if we were very careful we could still be honest with each other is there anything else you think i should know anything that dominga might spill later on he shook his head nothing worse okay i said okay he said thats it no interrogation not now maybe not ever i was tired all at once it was in the morning and i needed a nap emotionally drained i dont know how to feel about this manny i dont know how it changes our friendship or our working relationship or even if it does i think it does oh hell i dont know fair enough he said lets move on to something we arent confused about and what would that be i asked the seсora will send something bad to your window just like she said she would i figured that why did you threaten her i didnt like her oh great just great he said why didnt i think of that i am going to stop her manny i figured she should know never give the bad guys a head start anita i taught you that you also taught me that human sacrifice is murder that hurt he said yes i said it did you need to be prepared anita she will send something after you just to scare you i think not to really harm because you made me fess up to not killing her i said no because she doesnt really believe youll kill her shes intrigued with your powers i think shed rather convert you than kill you have me as part of her zombiemaking factory yes not in this lifetime the seсora is not used to people saying no anita her problem not mine he glanced at me then back to the traffic shell make it your problem ill deal with it you cant be that confident im not but what do you want me to do break down and cry ill deal with it when and if something noisome drags itself through my window you cant deal with the seсora anita she is powerful more powerful than you can ever imagine she scared me manny i am suitably impressed if she sends something i cant handle ill run okay not okay you dont know you just dont know i heard the thing in the hallway i smelled it im scared but shes just human manny all the mumbo jumbo wont keep her safe from a bullet a bullet may take her out but not down what does that mean if she were shot say in the head or heart and seemed dead id treat her like a vampire head and heart taken out body burned he glanced at me sort of sideways i didnt say anything we were talking about killing dominga salvador she was capturing souls and putting them into corpses it was an abomination she would probably attack me first some supernatural goodie come creeping into my home she was evil and would attack me first would it be murder to ambush her yeah would i do it anyway i let the thought take shape in my head rolled it over like a piece of candy tasting the idea yeah i could do it i should have felt bad that i could plan a murder for any reason and not flinch i didnt feel bad it was sort of comforting to know if she pushed me i could push back who was i to cast stones at manny for twentyyearold crimes yeah who indeed it was early afternoon manny had dropped me off without a word he hadnt asked to come up and i hadnt offered i still didnt know what to think about him dominga salvador and nonrotting zombies complete with souls i decided not to think what i needed was good physical activity as luck would have it i had judo class this afternoon i have a black belt which sounds a lot more impressive than it really is in the dojo with referees and rules i do okay out in the real world where most bad guys outweigh me by a hundred pounds i trust a gun i was actually reaching for the doorknob when the bell chimed i put the overstuffed gym bag by the door and used the little peephole i always had to stand on tiptoe to see out of it the distorted image was blond faireyed and barely familiar it was tommy harold gaynors musclebound bodyguard this day was just getting better and better i dont usually take a gun to judo class its in the afternoon in the summer that means daylight the really dangerous stuff doesnt come out until after dark i untucked the red polo shirt i was wearing and clipped my interpants holster back in place the pocketsize mm dug in just a little if i had known i was going to need it i would have worn looser jeans the doorbell rang again i hadnt called out to let him know i was in here he didnt seem discouraged he rang the doorbell a third time leaning on it i took a deep breath and opened the door i looked up into tommys pale blue eyes they were still empty dead a perfect blankness were you born with a stare like that or did you have to practice what do you want i asked his lips twitched arent you going to invite me in i dont think so he shrugged massive shoulders i could see the straps of his shoulder holster imprinted on his suit jacket he needed a better tailor a door opened to my left a woman came out with a toddler in her arms she locked the door before turning and seeing us oh hi she smiled brightly hello i said tommy nodded the woman turned and walked towards the stairs she was murmuring something nonsensical and highpitched to the toddler tommy looked back at me you really want to do this in the hallway what are we doing business money i looked at his face and it told me nothing the only comfort i had was that if tommy meant to do me harm he probably wouldnt have come to my apartment to do it probably i stepped back holding the door very wide i stayed out of arms reach as he walked into my apartment he looked around nice clean cleaning service i said talk to me about business tommy ive got an appointment he glanced at the gym bag by the door work or pleasure he asked none of your business i said again that bare twist of lips i realized it was his version of a smile down in the car i got a case full of money a million five half now half after you raise the zombie i shook my head i gave gaynor my answer but that was in front of your boss this is just you and me no onell know if you take it no one i didnt say no because there were witnesses i said no because i dont do human sacrifice i could feel myself smiling this was ridiculous i thought about manny then alright maybe it wasnt ridiculous but i wasnt doing it everyone has their price anita name it we can meet it he had never once mentioned gaynors name only i had he was being so bloody careful too careful i dont have a price tommyboy go back to mr harold gaynor and tell him that his face clouded up then a wrinkling between his eyes i dont know that name oh give me a break im not wearing a wire name your price we can meet it he said there is no price two million taxfree he said what zombie could be worth two million dollars tommy i stared at his softly frowning face what could gaynor hope to gain that would allow him to make a profit on that kind of expenditure tommy just stared at me you dont need to know that i thought youd say that go away tommy im not for sale i stepped back towards the door planning to escort him out he moved forward suddenly faster than he looked muscled arms wide to grab me i pulled the firestar and pointed it at his chest he froze dead eyes blinking at me his large hands balled into fists a nearly purple flush crept up his neck into his face rage dont do it i said my voice sounded soft bitch he wheezed it at me now now tommy dont get nasty ease down and we can all live to see another glorious day his pale eyes flicked from the gun to my face then back to the gun you wouldnt be so tough without that piece if he wanted me to offer to arm wrestle him he was in for a disappointment back off tommy or ill drop you here and now all the muscle in the world wont help you i watched something move behind his dead eyes then his whole body relaxed he took a deep breath through his nose okay you got the drop on me today but if you keep disappointing my boss im gonna find you without that gun his lips twitched and well see how tough you really are a little voice in my head said shoot him now i knew as surely as i knew anything that dear tommy would be at my back someday i didnt want him there but i couldnt just kill him because i thought he might come after me someday it wasnt a good enough reason and how would i ever have explained it to the police get out tommy i opened the door without taking either my gaze or the gun off the man get out and tell gaynor that if he keeps annoying me ill start sending his bodyguards home in boxes tommys nostrils flared just a bit at that veins straining in his neck he walked very stiffly past me and out into the hall i held the gun at my side and watched him listening to his footsteps retreat down the stairs when i was as sure as i could be that he was gone i put my gun back in its holster grabbed my gym bag and headed for judo class mustnt let these little interruptions spoil my exercise program tomorrow i would miss my workout for sure i had a funeral to attend besides if tommy really did challenge me to arm wrestling i was going to need all the help i could get i hate funerals at least this one wasnt for anyone i had particularly liked cold but true peter burke had been an unscrupulous sob when alive i didnt see why death should automatically grant him sainthood death especially violent death will turn the meanest bastard in the world into a nice guy why is that i stood there in the bright august sunlight in my little black dress and dark sunglasses watching the mourners they had set up a canopy over the coffin flowers and chairs for the family why was i here you might ask if i had not been a friend because peter burke had been an animator not a very good one but we are a small exclusive club if one of us dies we all come its a rule there are no exceptions maybe your own death but then again being that we raise the dead maybe not there are things you can do to a corpse so it wont rise again as a vampire but a zombie is a different beast short of cremation an animator can bring you back fire was about the only thing a zombie respected or feared we could have raised peter and asked him who put a gun to his head but they had put a magnum with an expanding point just behind his ear there wasnt enough left of his head to fill a plastic bag you could raise him as a zombie but he couldnt talk even the dead need mouths manny stood beside me uncomfortable in his dark suit rosita his wife stood spine absolutely straight thick brown hands gripping her black patent leather purse she is what my stepmother used to call largeboned her black hair was cut just below the ears and loosely permed the hair needed to be longer it emphasized how perfectly round her face was charles montgomery stood just behind me like a tall dark mountain charles looks like he played football somewhere he has the ability to frown and make people run for cover he just looks like a hard ass truth is charles faints at the sight of anything but animal blood its lucky for him he looks like such a big black dude he has almost no tolerance for pain he cries at walt disney movies like when bambis mother dies its endearing as hell his wife caroline was working she hadnt been able to switch shifts with anyone i wondered how hard she had tried caroline is okay but she sort of looks down on what we do mumbo jumbo she calls it shes a registered nurse i guess after dealing with doctors all day she has to look down on someone up near the front of the crowd was jamison clarke he was tall thin and the only redhaired greeneyed black man ive ever met he nodded at me across the grave i nodded back we were all here the animators of animators incorporated bert and mary our daytime secretary were holding down the fort i hoped bert didnt book us in anything we couldnt handle or would refuse to handle he did that if you didnt watch him the sun slapped my back like a hot metal hand the men kept pulling at their ties and high collars the smell of chrysanthemums was thick like wax at the back of my throat no one ever gives you football mums unless you die carnations roses snapdragons they all have happier lives but mums and gladstheyre the funeral flowers at least the tall spires of gladiolus had no scent a woman sat in the front line of chairs under the canopy she was leaning over her knees like a broken doll her sobs were loud enough to drown out the words of the priest only his quiet soothing rhythm reached me as i stood near the back two small children were gripping the hands of an older man grampa the children were pale holloweyed fear vied with tears on their faces they watched their mother break down completely useless to them her grief was more important than theirs her loss greater bullshit my own mother had died when i was eight you never really filled in the hole it was like a piece of you gone missing an ache that never quite goes away you deal with it you go on but its there a man sat beside her rubbing her back in endless circles his hair was nearly black cut short and neat broad shouldered from the back he looked eerily like peter burke ghosts in sunlight the cemetery was dotted with trees the shade rustled and flickered pale grey in the sunlight on the other side of the gravel driveway that twined through the cemetery were two men they stood quietly waiting grave diggers waiting to finish the job i looked back at the coffin under its blanket of pink carnations there was a bulky mound just behind it covered in bright green fake grass underneath was the fresh dug earth waiting to go back in the hole mustnt let the loved ones think about redclay soil pouring down on the gleaming coffin clods of dirt hitting the wood covering your husband father trapping them forever inside a leadlined box a good coffin will keep the water and worms out but it doesnt stop decay i knew what would be happening to peter burkes body cover it in satin wrap a tie round its neck rouge the cheeks close the eyes its still a corpse the funeral ended while i wasnt looking the people rose gratefully in one mass movement the darkhaired man helped the grieving widow to stand she nearly fell another man rushed forward and supported her other side she sagged between them feet dragging on the ground she looked back over her shoulder head almost lolling on her neck she screamed loud and ragged then flung herself on the coffin the woman collapsed against the flowers digging at the wood fingers scrambling for the locks on the coffin the ones that held the lid down everyone just froze for a moment staring i saw the two children through the crowd still standing wideeyed shit stop her i said it too loud people turned to stare i didnt care i pushed my way through the vanishing crowd and the aisles of chairs the darkhaired man was holding the widows hands while she screamed and struggled she had collapsed to the ground and her black dress had worked up high on her thighs she was wearing a white slip her mascara had run like black blood down her face i stood in front of the man and the two children he was staring at the woman like he would never move again sir i said he didnt react sir he blinked staring down at me like i had just appeared in front of him sir do you really think the children need to see all this shes my daughter he said his voice was deep and thick drugged or just grief i sympathize sir but the children should go to the car now the widow had begun to wail loud and wordless raw pain the girl was beginning to shake youre her father but youre their grandfather act like it get them out of here anger flickered in his eyes then how dare you he wasnt going to listen to me i was just an intrusion on their grief the oldest a boy of about five was staring up at me his brown eyes were huge his thin face so pale it looked ghostly i think it is you who should go the grandfather said youre right you are so right i said i walked around them out into the grass and the summer heat i couldnt help the children i couldnt help them just as no one had been there to help me i had survived so would they maybe manny and rosita were waiting for me rosita hugged me you must come to sunday dinner after church i smiled i dont think i can make it but thanks for asking my cousin albert will be there she said he is an engineer he will be a good provider i dont need a good provider rosita she sighed you make too much money for a woman it makes you not need a man i shrugged if i ever did marry which id begun to doubt a it wouldnt be for money love shit was i waiting for love naw not me we have to pick up tomas at kindergarten manny said he was smiling at me apologetically around rositas shoulder she was nearly a foot taller than he she towered over me too sure tell the little guy hi for me you should come to dinner rosita said albert is a very handsome man thanks for thinking of me rosita but ill skip it come on wife manny said our son is waiting for us she let him pull her towards the car but her brown face was set in disapproval it offended some deep part of rosita that i was twentyfour and had no prospects of marriage her and my stepmother charles was nowhere to be seen hurrying back to the office to see clients i thought jamison had too but he stood in the grass waiting for me he was dressed impeccably crossedlapels narrow red tie with small dark dots on it his tie clip was onyx and silver he smiled at me always a bad sign his greenish eyes looked hollow like someone had erased part of the skin if you cry enough the skin goes from puffy red to hollow white im glad so many of us showed up he said i know he was a friend of yours jamison im sorry he nodded and looked down at his hands he was holding a pair of sunglasses loosely he looked up at me eyes staring straight into mine all serious the police wont tell the family anything he said peter gets blown away and they dont have a clue who did it i wanted to tell him the police were doing their best because they were but there are a hell of a lot of murders in st louis over a year we were giving washington dc a run for their money as murder capital of the united states theyre doing their best jamison then why wont they tell us anything his hands convulsed the sound of breaking plastic was a crumbling sharp sound he didnt seem to notice i dont know i said anita youre in good with the police could you ask his eyes were naked full of such real pain most of the time i could ignore or even dislike jamison he was a tease a flirt a bleedingheart liberal who thought that vampires were just people with fangs but today today he was real what do you want me to ask are they making any progress do they have any suspects that sort of thing they were vague questions but important ones ill see what i can find out he gave a watery smile thanks anita really thanks he held out his hand i took it we shook he noticed his broken sunglasses damn ninetyfive dollars down the tubes ninetyfive dollars for sunglasses he had to be kidding a group of mourners were taking the family away at last the mother was smothered in wellmeaning male relatives they were literally carrying her away from the grave the children and grampa brought up the rear no one listens to good advice a man stepped away from the crowd and walked towards us he was the one who reminded me of peter burke from the back he was around six feet darkcomplected a black mustache and thin almost goatee like beard framing a handsome face it was handsome a dark moviestar face but there was something about the way he moved maybe it was the white streak in his black hair just over the forehead whatever you knew that he would always play the villain is she going to help us he asked no preamble no hello yes jamison said anna blake this is john burke peters brother john burke the john burke i wanted to ask new orleanss greatest animator and vampire slayer a kindred spirit we shook hands his grip was strong almost painfully so as if he wanted to see if i would flinch i didnt he let go maybe he just didnt know his own strength but i doubted it i am truly sorry about your brother i said i meant it i was glad i meant it he nodded thank you for talking to the police about him im surprised you couldnt get the new orleans police to give you some juice with our local police i said he had the grace to look uncomfortable the new orleans police and i have had a disagreement really i said eyes wide i had heard the rumors but i wanted to hear the truth truth is always stranger than fiction john was accused of participating in some ritual murders jamison said just because hes a practicing vaudun priest oh i said those were the rumors how long have you been in town john almost a week really peter had been missing for two days before they found the body he licked his lips his dark brown eyes flicked to the scene behind me were the grave diggers moving in i glanced back but the grave looked just the same to me anything you could find out would be most appreciated he said ill do what i can i have to get back to the house he shrugged as if to loosen the shoulder muscles my sisterinlaw isnt taking it well i let it go i deserved brownie points for that one thing i didnt let go can you look after your niece and nephew he looked at me a puzzled frown between his black eyebrows i mean keep them out of the really dramatic stuff if you can he nodded it was rough for me to watch her throw herself on the coffin god what must the kids be thinking tears glittered in his eyes like silver he kept them open very wide so the tears wouldnt spill out i didnt know what to say i did not want to see him cry ill talk to the police find out what i can ill tell jamison when i have anything john burke nodded carefully his eyes were like a glass where only the surface tension kept the water from spilling over i nodded to jamison and left i turned on the airconditioning in my car and let it run full blast the two men were still standing in the hot sunshine in the middle of summer brown grass when i put the car in gear and drove away i would talk to the police and find out what i could i also had another name for dolph john burke biggest animator in new orleans voodoo priest sounded like a suspect to me the phone was ringing as i shoved the key into my apartment door i yelled at it im coming im coming why do people do that yell at the phone as if the other person can hear you and will wait i shoved the door open and scooped up the phone on the fourth ring hello anita dolph i said my stomach tightened whats up we think we found the boy his voice was quiet neutral think i said what do you mean think you know what i mean anita he said he sounded tired like his parents it wasnt a question yeah god dolph is there much left come and see were at the burrell cemetery do you know it sure ive done work there be here as soon as you can i want to go home and hug my wife sure dolph i understand i was talking to myself the phone had gone dead i stared at the receiver for a moment my skin felt cold i did not want to go and view the remains of benjamin reynolds i did not want to know i pulled a lot of air in through my nose and let it out slowly i stared down at the dark hose high heels dress it wasnt my usual crime scene attire but it would take too long to change i was usually the last expert called in once i was through they could cover the body and everyone could go home i grabbed a pair of black nikes for walking over grass and through blood once you got bloodstains on dress shoes they never come clean i had the browning hipower complete with holster sort of draped atop my little black clutch purse the gun had been in my car during the funeral i couldnt figure out a way to carry a gun of any kind while wearing a dress i know you see thigh holsters on television but does the word chafing mean anything to you i hesitated on getting my backup gun and shoving it in my purse but didnt my purse like all purses seems to have a traveling black hole in it id never get the gun out in time if i really needed it i did have a silver knife in a thigh sheath under the short black skirt i felt like kit carson in drag but after tommys little visit i didnt want to be unarmed i had no illusions what would happen if tommy did catch me with no gun knives werent as good but they beat the hell out of kicking my little feet and screaming i had never yet had to try to fast draw a knife from a thigh sheath it was probably going to look vaguely obscene but if it kept me alive hey i can take a little embarrassment burrell cemetery is at the crest of a hill some of the gravestones go back centuries the soft weathered limestone is almost unreadable like hard candy thats been sucked clean the grass is waist tall luxuriant with only the headstones standing like tired sentinels there is a house on the edge of the cemetery where the caretaker lives but he doesnt have to take care of much the graveyard is full and has been for years the last person buried here could remember the worlds fair there is no road into the graveyard anymore there is a ghost of one like a wagon track where the grass doesnt grow quite so high the caretakers house was surrounded by police cars and the coroners van my nova seemed underdressed maybe i should get some buggy whip antennae or plaster zombies r us on the side of the car bert would probably get mad i got a pair of coveralls from the trunk and slipped into them they covered me from neck to ankle like most coveralls the crotch hit at knee level i never understood why but it meant my skirt didnt bunch up i bought them originally for vampire stakings but blood is blood besides the weeds would play hell with my panty hose i got a pair of surgical gloves from the little kleenexlike box in the trunk nikes instead of dress shoes and i was ready to view the remains remains nice word dolph stood like some ancient sentinel towering over everyone else in the field i worked my way towards him trying not to trip over broken bits of headstone a wind hot enough to scald rustled the grass i was sweating inside the overalls detective clive perry came to meet me as if i needed an escort detective perry was one of the most polite people i had ever met he had an oldworld courtliness to him a gentleman in the best sense of the word i always wanted to ask what he had done to end up on the spook squad his slender black face was beaded with sweat he still wore his suit jacket even though it had to be over a hundred degrees ms blake detective perry i said i glanced up at the crest of the hill dolph and a handful of men were standing around like they didnt know what to do no one was looking at the ground how bad is it detective perry i asked he shook his head depends on what you compare it to did you see the tapes and pictures of the reynolds house i did is it worse than that it was my new worst thing i ever saw measurement before this it had been a vampire gang that had tried to move in from los angeles the respectable vampire community had chopped them up with axes the parts were still crawling around the room when we found them maybe this wasnt worse maybe time had just dimmed the memory it isnt bloodier he said then he hesitated but it was a child a little boy i nodded he didnt need to explain it was always worse when it was a child i never knew exactly why maybe it was some primal instinct to protect the young some deep hormonal thing whatever kids were always worse i stared down at a white tombstone it looked like dull melted ice i didnt want to go up the hill i didnt want to see i went up the hill detective perry followed brave detective brave me a sheet rested on the grass like a tent dolph stood closest to it dolph i said anita no one offered to pull back the sheet is this it yeah dolph seemed to shake himself or maybe it was a shiver he reached down and grabbed the edge of the sheet ready he asked no i wasnt ready dont make me look please dont make me look my mouth was dry i could taste my pulse in my throat i nodded the sheet flew back caught by a gust of wind like a white kite the grass was trampled down struggles had benjamin reynolds been alive when he was pulled down into the long grass no surely not god i hoped not the footed pajamas had tiny cartoon figures on them the pajamas had been pulled back like the skin of a banana one small arm was flung up over his head like he was sleeping longlashed eyelids helped the illusion his skin was pale and flawless small cupidbow mouth half open he should have looked worse much worse there was a dirty brown stain on his pajamas the cloth covering his lower body i did not want to see what had killed him but that was why i was here i hesitated fingers hovering over the torn cloth i took a deep breath and that was a mistake hunkered over the body in the windy august heat the smell was fresh new death smells like an outhouse especially if the stomach or bowels have been ripped open i knew what id find when i lifted the bloody cloth the smell told me i knelt with a sleeve over my mouth and nose for a few minutes breathing shallow and through my mouth but it didnt really help once you caught a whiff of it your nose remembered the smell crawled down my throat and wouldnt let go quick or slow did i jerk the cloth back or pull it quick i jerked on the cloth but it stuck dried blood catching the cloth peeled back with a wet sucking sound it looked like someone had taken a giant ice cream scoop and gutted him stomach intestines upper bowels gone the sunshine swam around me and i had to put a hand on the ground to keep from falling i glanced up at the face his hair was pale brown like his mothers damp curls traced his cheeks my gaze was pulled back to the gaping ruin that was his abdomen there was some dark heavy fluid leaking out of the end of his small intestine i stumbled away from the crime scene using the tombstones to help me stand i would have run if i hadnt known i would fall the sky was spinning to meet the ground i collapsed in the smothering grass and vomited i threw up until i was empty and the world stopped spinning i wiped my mouth on my sleeve and stood up using a crooked headstone for support no one said a word as i walked back to them the sheet was covering the body the body had to think of it that way couldnt dwell on the fact that it had been a small child couldnt id go mad well dolph asked he hasnt been dead long dammit to hell dolph it was late morning maybe just before dawn he was alive alive when that thing took him i stared up at him and felt the hot beginnings of tears i would not cry i had already disgraced myself enough for one day i took a deep careful breath and let it out i would not cry i gave you twentyfour hours to talk to this dominga salvador did you find out anything she says she knows nothing of it i believe her why because if she wanted to kill people she wouldnt have to do anything this dramatic what do you mean he asked she could wish them to death i said he widened his eyes you believe that i shrugged maybe yes hell i dont know she scares me he raised one thick eyebrow ill remember that i have another name to add to your list though i said who john burke hes up from new orleans for his brothers funeral he wrote the name in his little notebook if hes just visiting would he have time i cant think of a motive but he could do it if he wanted to check him out with the new orleans police i think hes under suspicion down there for murder whats he doing traveling out of state i dont think they have any proof i said dominga salvador said shed help me shes promised to ask around and tell me anything she turns up ive been asking around since you gave me her name she doesnt help anyone outside her own people how did you get her to cooperate i shrugged my winning personality he shook his head it wasnt illegal dolph beyond that i dont want to talk about it he let it go smart man tell me as soon as you hear anything anita weve got to stop this thing before it kills again agreed i turned and looked out over the rolling grass is this the cemetery near where you found the first three victims yes maybe part of the answers here then i said what do you mean most vampires have to return to their coffins before dawn ghouls stay in underground tunnels like giant moles if it was either of those id say the creature was out here somewhere waiting for nightfall but he said but if its a zombie it isnt harmed by sunlight and it doesnt need to rest in a coffin it could be anywhere but i think it originally came from this cemetery if they used voodoo there will be signs of the ritual like what a chalk verve drawn symbols around the grave dried blood maybe a fire i stared off at the rustling grass though i wouldnt want to start an open fire in this place if it wasnt voodoo he asked then it was an animator again you look for dried blood maybe a dead animal there wont be as many signs and its easier to clean up are you sure its some kind of a zombie he asked i dont know what else it could be i think we should act like thats what it is it gives us someplace to look and something to look for if its not a zombie we dont have a clue he said exactly he smiled but it wasnt pleasant i hope youre right anita me too i said if it did come from here can you find what grave it came from maybe maybe he said maybe raising the dead isnt a science dolph sometimes i can feel the dead under the ground restlessness how old without looking at the tombstone sometimes i cant i shrugged well give you any help you need i have to wait until full dark my powers are better after dark thats hours away can you do anything now i thought about that for a moment no im sorry but no okay youll come back tonight then yeah i said what time ill send some men out i dont know what time and i dont know how long it will take i could be wandering out here for hours and find nothing or or i could find the beastie itself youll need backup for that just in case i nodded agreed but guns even silver bullets wont hurt it what will flamethrowers napalm like the exterminators use on ghoul tunnels i said those arent standard issue have an exterminator team standing by i said good idea he made a note i need a favor i said he looked up what peter burke was murdered shot to death his brother asked me to find out what progress the police are making you know we cant give out information like that i know but if you can get the facts i can feed just enough to john burke to keep in touch with him you seem to be getting along well with all our suspects he said yeah ill find out what i can from homicide do you know what jurisdiction he was found in i shook my head i could find out it would give me an excuse to talk to burke again you say hes suspected of murder in new orleans mmhuh i said and he may have done this he motioned at the sheet yep you watch your back anita i always do i said you call me as early tonight as you can i dont want all my people sitting around twiddling their thumbs on overtime as soon as i can ive got to cancel three clients just to make it bert was not going to be pleased the day was looking up why didnt it eat more of the boy dolph asked i dont know i said he nodded okay ill see you tonight then say hello to lucille for me hows she coming with her masters degree almost done shell have it before our youngest gets his engineering degree great the sheet flapped in the hot wind a trickle of sweat trailed down my forehead i was out of small talk see you later i said and started down the hill i stopped and turned back dolph yes he said ive never heard of a zombie exactly like this one maybe it does rise from its grave more like a vampire if you kept that exterminator team and backup hanging around until after dark you might catch it rising from the grave and be able to bag it is that likely no but its possible i said i dont know how ill explain the overtime but ill do it ill be here as soon as i can what else could be more important than this he asked i smiled nothing youd like to hear about try me he said i shook my head he nodded tonight early as you can early as i can i said detective perry escorted me back maybe politeness maybe he just wanted to get away from the corpus delicti i didnt blame him hows your wife detective were expecting our first baby in a month i smiled up at him i didnt know congratulations thank you his face clouded over a frown puckering between his dark eyes do you think we can find this creature before it kills again i hope so i said what are our chances did he want reassurance or the truth truth i havent the faintest idea i was hoping you wouldnt say that he said so was i detective so was i what was more important than bagging the critter that had eviscerated an entire family nothing absolutely nothing but it was a while until full dark and i had other problems would tommy go back to gaynor and tell him what i said yes would gaynor let it go probably not i needed information i needed to know how far he would go a reporter i needed a reporter irving griswold to the rescue irving had one of those pastel cubicles that passes for an office no roof no door but you got walls irving is fivethree id like him for that reason if nothing else you dont meet many men exactly my height frizzy brown hair framed his bald spot like petals on a flower he wore a white dress shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbow tie at halfmast his face was round pinkcheeked he looked like a bald cherub he did not look like a werewolf but he was one even lycanthropy cant cure baldness no one on the st louis postdispatch knew irving was a shapeshifter it is a disease and its illegal to discriminate against lycanthropes just like people with aids but people do it anyway maybe the papers management would have been broadminded liberal but i was with irving caution was better irving sat in his desk chair i leaned in the doorway of his cubicle hows tricks irving said do you really think youre funny or is this just an annoying habit i asked he grinned im hilarious ask my girlfriend ill bet i said whats up blake and please tell me whatever it is is on the record not off how would you like to do an article on the new zombie legislation thats being cooked up maybe he said his eyes narrowed suspicion gleamed forth what do you want in return this part is off the record irving for now it figures he frowned at me go on i need all the information you have on harold gaynor name doesnt ring any bells he said should it his eyes had gone from cheerful to steady his concentration was nearly perfect when he smelled a story not necessarily i said cautious can you get the information for me in exchange for the zombie story ill take you to all the businesses that use zombies you can bring a photographer and snap pictures of corpses his eyes lit up a series of articles with lots of semigruesome pictures you center stage in a suit beauty and the beast my editor would probably go for it i thought he might but i dont know about the center stage stuff hey your boss will love it publicity means more business and sells more papers i said sure irving said he looked at me for maybe a minute the room was almost silent most had gone home irvings little pool of light was one of just a few hed been waiting on me so much for the press never sleeps the quiet breath of the air conditioner filled the early evening stillness ill see if harold gaynors in the computer irving said at last i smiled at him remembered the name after me mentioning it just once pretty good i am after all a trained reporter he said he swiveled his chair back to his computer keyboard with exaggerated movements he pulled imaginary gloves on and adjusted the long tails of a tux oh get on with it i smiled a little wider do not rush the maestro he typed a few words and the screen came to life hes on file irving said a big file itd take forever to print it all up he swiveled the chair back to look at me it was a bad sign ill tell you what he said ill get the file together complete with pictures if we have any ill deliver it to your sweet hands whats the catch he put his fingers to his chest moi no catch the goodness of my heart all right bring it by my apartment why dont we meet at dead daves instead he said dead daves is down in the vampire district what are you doing hanging around out there his sweet cherubic face was watching me very steadily rumor has it that theres a new master vampire of the city i want the story i just shook my head so youre hanging around dead daves to get information exactly the vamps wont talk to you you look human thanks for the compliment he said the vamps do talk to you anita do you know who the new master is can i meet him or her can i do an interview jesus irving dont you have enough troubles without messing with the king vampire its a him then he said its a figure of speech i said you know something i know you do what i know is that you dont want to come to the attention of a master vampire theyre mean irving the vampires are trying to mainstream themselves they want positive attention an interview about what he wants to do with the vampire community his vision of the future it would be very upandcoming no corpse jokes no sensationalism straight journalism yeah right on page one a tasteful little headline the master vampire of st louis speaks out yeah itll be great youve been sniffing newsprint again irving ill give you everything we have on gaynor pictures how do you know you have pictures i said he stared up at me his round pleasant face cheerfully blank you recognized the name you little son of tsk tsk anita help me get an interview with the master of the city ill give you anything you want ill give you a series of articles about zombies fullcolor pictures of rotting corpses irving itll sell papers no interview with the master he said if youre lucky no i said shoot can i have the file on gaynor he nodded ill get it together he looked up at me i still want you to meet me at dead daves maybe a vamp will talk to me with you around irving being seen with a legal executioner of vampires is not going to endear you to the vamps they still call you the executioner among other things okay the gaynor file for going along on your next vampire execution no i said ah anita no he spread his hands wide okay just an idea itd be a great article i dont need the publicity irving not that kind anyway he nodded yeah yeah ill meet you at dead daves in about two hours make it an hour id like to be out of the district before full dark is anybody gunning for you down there i mean i dont want to endanger you blake he grinned youve given me too many lead stories i wouldnt want to lose you thanks for the concern no no ones after me far as i know you dont sound real certain i stared at him i thought about telling him that the new master of the city had sent me a dozen white roses and an invitation to go dancing i had turned him down there had been a message on my machine and an invitation to a black tie affair i ignored it all so far the master was behaving like the courtly gentleman he had been a few centuries back it couldnt last jeanclaude was not a person who took defeat easily i didnt tell irving he didnt need to know ill see you at dead daves in an hour im gonna run home and change now that you mention it ive never seen you in a dress before i had a funeral today business or personal personal i said then im sorry i shrugged ive got to go if im going to have time to change and then meet you thanks irving its not a favor blake ill make you pay for those zombie articles i sighed i had images of him making me embrace the poor corpse but the new legislation needed attention the more people who understood the horror of it the better chance it had to pass in truth irving was still doing me a favor no need to let him know that though i walked away into the dimness of the darkened office i waved over my shoulder without looking back i wanted to get out of this dress and into something i could hide a gun on if i was going into blood square i might need it dead daves is in the part of st louis that has two names polite the riverfront rude the blood quarter it is our towns hottest vampire commercial district big tourist attraction vampires have really put st louis on the vacation maps youd think that the ozark mountains some of the best fishing in the country the symphony broadway level musicals or maybe the botanical gardens would be enough but no i guess its hard to compete with the undead i know i find it difficult dead daves is all dark glass and beer signs in the windows the afternoon sunlight was fading into twilight vamps wouldnt be out until full dark i had a little under two hours get in look over the file get out easy riight i had changed into black shorts royalblue polo shirt black nikes with a matching blue swish black and white jogging socks and a black leather belt the belt was there so the shoulder holster had something to hang on my browning hipower was secure under my left arm i had thrown on a shortsleeved dress shirt to hide the gun the dress shirt was in a modest black and royalblue print the outfit looked great sweat trickled down my spine too hot for the shirt but the browning gave me thirteen bullets fourteen if youre animal enough to shove the magazine full and carry one in the chamber i didnt think things were that bad yet i did have an extra magazine shoved into the pocket of my shorts i know it picks up pocket lint but where else was i going to carry it one of these days i promise to get a deluxe holster with spaces for extra magazines but all the models id seen had to be cut down to my size and made me feel like the frito bandito i almost never carry an extra clip when ive got the browning lets face it if you need more than thirteen bullets its over the really sad part was the extra ammo wasnt for tommy or gaynor it was for jeanclaude the master vampire of the city not that silverplated bullets would kill him but they would hurt him make him heal almost human slow i wanted out of the district before dark i did not want to run into jeanclaude he wouldnt attack me in fact his intentions were good if not exactly honorable he had offered me immortality without the messy part of becoming a vampire there was some implication that i got him along with eternity he was tall pale and handsome sexier than a silk teddy he wanted me to be his human servant i wasnt anyones servant not even for eternal life eternal youth and a little compromise of the soul the price was too steep jeanclaude didnt believe that the browning was in case i had to make him believe it i stepped into the bar and was momentarily blind waiting for my eyes to adjust to the dimness like one of those old westerns where the good guy hesitates at the front of the bar and views the crowd i suspected he wasnt looking for the bad guy at all he had just come out of the sun and couldnt see shit no one ever shoots you while youre waiting for your eyes to adjust i wonder why it was after five on a thursday most of the bar stools and all the tables were taken the place was cheek to jowl with business suits male and female a spattering of work boots and tans that ended at the elbow but mostly upwardly mobile types dead daves had become trendy despite efforts to keep it at bay it looked like happy hour was in high gear shit all the yuppies were here to catch a nice safe glimpse of a vampire they would be slightly sloshed when it happened increase the thrill i guess irving was sitting at the rounded corner of the bar he saw me and waved i waved back and started pushing my way towards him i squeezed between two gentlemen in suits it took some maneuvering and a very uncoollooking hop to mount the bar stool irving grinned broadly at me there was a nearly solid hum of conversation in the air words translated into pure noise like the ocean irving had to lean into me to be heard over the murmuring sound i hope you appreciate how many dragons i had to slay to save that seat for you he said the faint smell of whiskey breathed along my cheek as he spoke dragons are easy try vampires sometimes i said his eyes widened before his mouth could form the question i said im kidding irving sheesh some people just dont have a sense of humor besides dragons were never native to north america i said i knew that sure i said he sipped whiskey from a faceted glass the amber liquid shimmered in the subdued light luther daytime manager and bartender was down at the far end of the bar dealing with a group of very happy people if they had been any happier theyd have been passed out on the floor luther is large not tall fat but it is solid fat almost a kind of muscle his skin is so black it has purple highlights the cigarette between his lips flared orange as he took a breath he could talk around a cig better than anyone id ever met irving picked up a scuffed leather briefcase from off the floor near his feet he fished out a file over three inches thick a large rubber band wrapped it together jesus irving can i take it home with me he shook his head a sister reporter is doing a feature on local upstanding businessmen who are not what they seem i had to promise her dibs on my firstborn to borrow it for the night i looked at the stack of papers i sighed the man on my right nearly rammed an elbow in my face he turned sorry little lady sorry no harm done little came out liddle and sorry slushed around the edges no harm i said he smiled and turned back to his friend another business type who laughed uproariously at something get drunk enough and everything is funny i cant possibly read the file here i said he grinned ill follow you anywhere luther stood in front of me he pulled a cigarette from the pack he always carried with him he put the tip of his still burning stub against the fresh cigarette the end flared red like a live coal smoke trickled up his nose and out his mouth like a dragon he crushed the old cig in the clear glass ashtray he carried with him from place to place like a teddy bear he chain smokes is grossly overweight and his grey hair puts him over fifty hes never sick he should be the national poster child for the tobacco institute a refill he asked irving yeah thanks luther took the glass refilled it from a bottle under the bar and set it back down on a fresh napkin what can i get for ya anita he asked the usual luther he poured me a glass of orange juice we pretend it is a screwdriver im a teetotaler but why would i come to a bar if i didnt drink he wiped the bar with a spotless white towel gotta message for you from the master the master vampire of the city irving asked his voice had that excited lilt to it he smelled news what there was no excited lilt to my voice he wants to see you bad i glanced at irving then back at luther i tried to telepathically send the message not in front of the reporter it didnt work the masters put the word out anybody who sees you gives you the message irving was looking back and forth between us like an eager puppy what does the master of the city want with you anita consider it given i said luther shook his head you aint going to talk to him are you no i said why not irving asked none of your business off the record he said no luther stared at me listen to me girl you talk to the master right now all the vamps and freaks are just supposed to tell you the master wants a powwow the next order will be to detain you and take ya to him detain it was a nice word for kidnap i dont have anything to say to the master dont let this get outta hand anita luther said just talk to him no harm thats what he thought maybe i will luther was right it was talk to him now or later later would probably be a lot less friendly why does the master want to talk to you irving asked he was like some curious brighteyed bird that had spied a worm i ignored the question and thought up a new one did your sister reporter give you any highlights from this file i dont really have time to read war and peace before morning tell me what you know about the master and ill give you the highlights thanks a lot luther i didnt mean to sic him on you he said his cig bobbed up and down as he spoke i never understood how he did that lip dexterity years of practice would everybody stop treating me like the bubonic fucking plague irving said im just trying to do my job i sipped my orange juice and looked at him irving youre messing with things you dont understand i cannot give you info on the master i cant wont he said i shrugged wont but the reason i wont is because i cant thats a circular argument he said sue me i finished the juice i didnt want it anyway listen irving we had a deal the file info for the zombie articles if youre going to break your word deals off but tell me its off i dont have time to sit here and play twenty damn questions i wont go back on the deal my word is my bond he said in as stagy a voice as he could manage in the murmurous noise of the bar then give me the highlights and let me get the hell out of the district before the master hunts me up his face was suddenly solemn youre in trouble arent you maybe help me out irving please help her out luther said maybe it was the please maybe it was luthers looming presence whatever irving nodded according to my sister reporter hes crippled in a wheelchair i nodded nondirective thats me he likes his women crippled what do you mean i remembered cicely of the empty eyes blind wheelchair amputee whatever old harryll go for it deaf i said up his alley why i asked clever questions are us irving shrugged maybe it makes him feel better since hes trapped in a chair himself my fellow reporter didnt know why he was a deviant just that he was what else did she tell you hes never even been charged with a crime but the rumors are real ugly suspected mob connections but no proof just rumors tell me i said an old girlfriend tried to sue him for palimony she disappeared disappeared as in probably dead i said bingo i believed it so hed used tommy and bruno to kill before meant it would be easier to give the order a second time or maybe gaynors given the order lots of times and just never gotten caught what does he do for the mob that earns him his two bodyguards oh so youve met his security specialist i nodded my fellow reporter would love to talk to you you didnt tell her about me did you do i look like a stoolie he grinned at me i let that go whats he do for the mob helps them clean money or thats what we suspect no evidence i said none he didnt look happy about it luther shook his head tapping his cig into the ashtray some ash spilled onto the bar he wiped it with his spotless towel he sounds like bad news anita free advice leave him the hell alone good advice unfortunately i dont think hell leave me alone i wont ask i dont want to know someone else was frantically signaling for a refill luther drifted over to them i could watch the entire bar in the fulllength mirror that took up the wall behind the bar i could even see the door without turning around it was convenient and comforting i will ask irving said i do want to know i just shook my head i know something you dont know he said and i want to know it he nodded vigorously enough to make his frizzy hair bob i sighed tell me you first i had about enough i have shared all i am going to tonight irving ive got the file ill look through it youre just saving me a little time right now a little time could be very important to me oh shucks you take all the fun out of being a hardcore reporter he looked like he was going to pout just tell me irving or im going to do something violent he half laughed i dont think he believed me he should have alright alright he brought out a picture from behind his back with a flourish like a magician it was a black and white photo of a woman she was in her twenties long brown hair down in a modern style just enough mousse to make it look spiky she was pretty i didnt recognize her the photo was obviously not posed it was too casual and there was a look to the face of someone who didnt know she was being photographed who is she she was his girlfriend until about five months ago irving said so shes handicapped i stared down at the pretty candid face you couldnt tell by the picture wheelchair wanda i stared at him i could feel my eyes going wide you cant be serious he grinned wheelchair wanda cruises the streets in her chair shes very popular with a certain crowd a prostitute in a wheelchair naw it was too weird i shook my head okay where do i find her i and my sister reporter want in on this thats why you kept her picture out of the file he didnt even have the grace to look embarrassed wanda wont talk to you alone anita has she talked to your reporter friend he frowned the light of conquest dimming in his eyes i knew what that meant she wont talk to reporters will she irving shes afraid of gaynor she should be i said why would she talk to you and not us my winning personality i said come on blake where does she hang out irving oh hell he finished his dwindling drink in one angry swallow she stays near a club called the grey cat the grey cat like that old joke all cats are grey in the dark cute wheres the club luther answered i hadnt seen him come back on the main drag in the tenderloin corner of twentieth and grand but i wouldnt go down there alone anita i can take care of myself yeah but you dont look like you can you dont want to have to shoot some dumb shmuck just because he copped a feel or worse take someone who looks mean save yourself the aggravation irving shrugged i wouldnt go down there alone i hated to admit it but they were right i may be heap big vampire slayer but it doesnt show much on the outside okay ill get charles he looks tough enough to take on the green bay packers but his heart is oh so gentle luther laughed puffing smoke dont let of charlie see too much he might faint faint once in public and people never let you forget ill keep charles safe i put more money down on the bar than was needed luther hadnt really given me much information this time but usually he did good information i never paid full price for it i got a discount because i was connected with the police dead dave had been a cop before they kicked him off the force for being undead shortsighted of them he was still pissed about that but he liked to help so he fed me information and i fed the police selected bits of it dead dave came out of the door behind the bar i glanced at the dark glass windows it looked the same but if dave was up it was full dark shit it was a walk back to my car surrounded by vampires at least i had my gun comforting that dave is tall wide short brown hair that had been balding when he died he lost no more hair but it didnt grow back either he smiled at me wide enough to flash fangs an excited wiggle ran through the crowd as if the same nerve had been touched in all of them the whispers spread like rings in a pool vampire the show was on dave and i shook hands his hand was warm firm and dry have you fed tonight dave he looked like he had all rosy and cheerful what did you feed on dave and was it willing probably dave was a good guy for a dead man luther keeps telling me you stopped by but its always in daylight nice to see youre slumming after dark truthfully i planned to be out of the district before full dark he frowned you packing i gave him a discreet glimpse of my gun irvings eyes widened youre carrying a gun it only sounded like he shouted it the noise level had died down to a waiting murmur quiet enough for people to overbear but then thats why they had come to listen to the vampire to tell their troubles to the dead i lowered my voice and said announce it to the world irving he shrugged sorry how do you know newsboy over here dave asked he helps me sometimes with research research well ladeda he smiled without showing any fang a trick you learn after a few years luther give you the message yeah you going to be smart or dumb dave is soma blunt but i like him anyway dumb probably i said just because you got a special relationship with the new master dont let it fool you hes still a master vampire they are freaking bad news dont fuck with him im trying to avoid it dave smiled broad enough to show fang shit you mean naw he wants you for more than good tail it was nice to know he thought id be good tail i guess yeah i said irving was practically bouncing in his seat what the hell is going on anita very good question my business not yours anita stop pestering me irving i mean it pestering i havent heard that word since my grandmother i looked him straight in the eyes and said carefully leave me the fuck alone that better he put his hands out in an igiveup gesture heh just trying to do my job well do it somewhere else i slid off the bar stool the words out to find you anita dave said some of the other vampires might get overzealous you mean try to take me he nodded im armed cross and all ill be okay you want me to walk you to your car dave asked i stared into his brown eyes and smiled thanks dave ill remember the offer but im a big girl truth was a lot of the vampires didnt like dave feeding information to the enemy i was the executioner if a vampire stepped over the line they sent for me there was no such thing as a life sentence for a vamp death or nothing no prison can hold a vampire california tried but one master vampire got loose he killed twentyfive people in a onenight bloodbath he didnt feed he just killed guess he was pissed about being locked up theyd put crosses over the doors and on the guards crosses dont work unless you believe in them and they certainly dont work once a master vampire has convinced you to take them off i was the vampires equivalent of an electric chair they didnt like me much surprise surprise ill be with her irving said he put money down on the bar and stood up i had the bulky file under my arm i guess he wasnt going to let it out of his sight great shell probably have to protect you too dave said irving started to say something then thought better of it he could say but im a lycanthrope except he didnt want people to know he worked very very hard at appearing human you sure youll be okay he asked one more chance for a vampire guard to my car he was offering to protect me from the master dave hadnt been dead ten years he wasnt good enough nice to know you care dave go on get outta here he said watch yourself girl luther said i smiled brightly at both of them then turned and walked out of the near silent bar the crowd couldnt have overheard much if any of the conversation but i could feel them staring at my back i resisted an urge to whirl around and go boo i bet somebody would have screamed its the crossshaped scar on my arm only vampires have them right a cross shoved into unclean flesh mine had been a branding iron specially made a now dead master vampire had ordered it thought it would be funny hardyhar or maybe it was just dave maybe they hadnt noticed the scar maybe i was overly sensitive make friendly with a nice lawabiding vampire and people get suspicious have a few funny scars and people wonder if youre human but thats okay suspicion is healthy itll keep you alive the sweltering darkness closed around me like a hot sticky fist a streetlight formed a puddle of brilliance on the sidewalk as if the light had melted all the streetlights are reproductions of turnofthecentury gas lamps they rise black and graceful but not quite authentic like a halloween costume it looks good but is too comfortable to be real the night sky was like a dark presence over the tall brick buildings but the streetlights held the darkness back like a black tent held up by sticks of light you had the sense of darkness without the reality i started walking for the parking garage just off first street parking on the riverfront is damn near impossible the tourists have only made the problem worse the hard soles of irvings dress shoes made a loud echoing noise on the stone of the street real cobblestones streets meant for horses not cars it made parking a bitch but it was charming my nike airs made almost no sound on the street irving was like a clattery puppy beside me most lycanthropes ive met have been stealthy irving may have been a werewolf but he was more dog a big funloving dog couples and small groups passed us laughing talking voices too shrill they had come to see vampires real live vampires or was that realdead vampires tourists all of them amateurs voyeurs i had seen more undead than any of them id lay money on that the fascination escaped me it was full dark now dolph and the gang would be awaiting me at burrell cemetery i needed to get over there what about the file on gaynor and what was i going to do with irving sometimes my life is too full a figure detached itself from the darkened buildings i couldnt tell if he had been waiting or had simply appeared magic i froze like a rabbit caught in headlights staring whats wrong blake irving asked i handed him the file and he took it looking puzzled i wanted my hands free in case i had to go for my gun it probably wouldnt come to that probably jeanclaude master vampire of the city walked towards us he moved like a dancer or a cat a smooth gliding walk energy and grace contained waiting to explode into violence he wasnt that tall maybe fiveeleven his shirt was so white it gleamed the shirt was loose long full sleeves made tight at the wrist by threebuttoned cuffs the front of the shirt had only a string to close the throat hed left it untied and the white cloth framed the pale smoothness of his chest the shirt was tucked into tight black jeans and only that kept it from billowing around him like a cape his hair was perfectly black curling softly around his face the eyes if you dared to look into them were a blue so dark it was almost black glittering dark jewels he stopped about six feet in front of us close enough to see the dark crossshaped scar on his chest it was the only thing that marred the perfection of his body or what id seen of his body my scar had been a bad joke his had been some poor sods last attempt to stave off death i wondered if the poor sod had escaped would jeanclaude tell me if i asked maybe but if the answer was no i didnt want to hear it hello jeanclaude i said greetings ma petite he said his voice was like fur rich soft vaguely obscene as if just talking to him was something dirty maybe it was dont call me ma petite i said he smiled slightly not a hint of fang as you like he looked at irving irving looked away careful not to meet jeanclaudes eyes you never looked directly into a vampires eyes never so why was i doing it with impunity why indeed who is your friend the last word was very soft and somehow threatening this is irving griswold hes a reporter for the post dispatch hes helping me with a little research ah he said he walked around irving as if he were something for sale and jeanclaude wanted to see all of him irving gave nervous little glances so that he could keep the vampire in view he glanced at me widening his eyes whats going on what indeed irving jeanclaude said leave him alone jeanclaude why have you not come to see me my little animator little animator wasnt much of an improvement over ma petite but id take it ive been busy the look that crossed his face was almost anger i didnt really want him mad at me i was going to come see you i said when tomorrow night tonight it was not a suggestion i cant yes ma petite you can his voice was like a warm wind in my head you are so damn demanding i said he laughed then pleasant and resonating like expensive perfume that lingers in the room after the wearer has gone his laughter was like that lingering in the ears like distant music he had the best voice of any master vampire id ever met everyone has their talents you are so exasperating he said the edge of laughter still in his voice what am i to do with you leave me alone i said i was utterly serious it was one of my biggest wishes his face sobered completely like someone had flipped a switch on happy off unreadable too many of my followers know you are my human servant ma petite bringing you under control is part of consolidating my power he sounded almost regretful a lot of help that did me what do you mean bringing me under control my stomach was tight with the beginnings of fear if jeanclaude didnt scare me to death he was going to give me an ulcer you are my human servant you must start acting like one i am not your servant yes ma petite you are dammit jeanclaude leave me alone he was suddenly standing next to me i hadnt seen him move he had clouded my mind without me even blinking i could taste my pulse at the back of my throat i tried to step back but one pale slender hand grabbed my right arm just above the elbow i shouldnt have stepped back i should have gone for my gun i hoped i would live through the mistake my voice came out fiat normal at least id die brave i thought having two of your vampire marks meant you couldnt control my mind i cannot bewitch you with my eyes and it is harder to cloud your mind but it can be done his fingers encircled my arm not hurting i didnt try to pull away i knew better he could crush my arm without breaking a sweat or tear it from its socket or bench press a toyota if i couldnt arm wrestle tommy i sure as hell couldnt match jeanclaude hes the new master of the city isnt he it was irving i think we had forgotten about him it would have been better for irving if we had jeanclaudes grip tightened slightly on my right arm he turned to look at irving you are the reporter that has been asking to interview me yes i am irving sounded just the tiniest bit nervous not much just the hint of tightness in his voice he looked brave and resolute good for irving perhaps after i have spoken with this lovely young woman i will grant you your interview really astonishment was plain in his voice he grinned widely at me that would be great ill do it any way you want it silence the word hissed and floated irving fell quiet as if it were a spell irving are you alright funny me asking i was the one cheek to jowl with a vampire but i asked anyway yeah irving said that one word was squeezed small with fear ive just never felt anything like him i glanced up at jeanclaude he is sort of one of a kind jeanclaude turned his attention back to me oh goody still making jokes ma petite i stared up into his beautiful eyes but they were just eyes he had given me the power to resist them its a way to pass the time what do you want jeanclaude so brave even now you arent going to do me on the street in front of witnesses you may be the new master but youre also a businessman youre mainstream vampire it limits what you can do only in public he said so soft that only i heard him fine but we both agree you arent going to do violence here and now i stared up at him so cut the theatrics and tell me what the bloody hell you want he smiled then a bare movement of lips but he released my arm and stepped back just as you will not shoot me down in the street without provocation i thought i had provocation but nothing i could explain to the police i dont want to be up on murder charges thats true his smile widened still not fangs he did that better than any living vampire i knew was living vampire an oxymoron i wasnt sure anymore so we will not harm each other in public he said probably not i said what do you want im late for an appointment are you raising zombies or slaying vampires tonight neither i said he looked at me waiting for me to say more i didnt he shrugged and it was graceful you are my human servant anita hed used my real name i knew i was in trouble now am not i said he gave a long sigh you bear two of my marks not by choice i said you would have died if i had not shared my strength with you dont give me crap about how you saved my life you forced two marks on me you didnt ask or explain the first mark may have saved my life great the second mark saved yours i didnt have a choice either time two more marks and you will have immortality you will not age because i do not age you will remain human alive able to wear your crucifix able to enter a church it does not compromise your soul why do you fight me how do you know what compromises my soul you dont have one anymore you traded your immortal soul for earthly eternity but i know that vampires can die jeanclaude what happens when you die where do you go do you just go poof no you go to hell where you belong and you think by being my human servant you will go with me i dont know and i dont want to find out by fighting me you make me appear weak i cannot afford that ma petite one way or another we must resolve this just leave me alone i cannot you are my human servant and you must begin to act like one dont press me on this jeanclaude or what will you kill me could you kill me i stared at his beautiful face and said yes i feel your desire for me ma petite as i desire you i shrugged what could i say its just a little lust jeanclaude nothing special that was a lie i knew it even as i said it no ma petite i mean more to you than that we were attracting a crowd at a safe distance do you really want to discuss this in the street he took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh very true you make me forget myself ma petite great i really am late jeanclaude the police are waiting for me we must finish this discussion ma petite he said i nodded he was right id been trying to ignore it and him master vampires are not easy to ignore tomorrow night where he asked polite of him not to order me to his lair i thought about where best to do it i wanted charles to go down to the tenderloin with me charles was going to be checking the zombie working conditions at a new comedy club good a place as any do you know the laughing corpse he smiled a glimpse of fang touching his lips a woman in the small crowd gasped yes meet me there at say eleven oclock my pleasure the words caressed my skin like a promise shit i will await you in my office tomorrow night wait a minute what do you mean your office i had a bad feeling about this his smile widened into a grin fangs glistening in the streetlights why i own the laughing corpse i thought you knew the hell you did i will await you id picked the place id stand by it dammit come on irving no let the reporter stay he has not had his interview leave him alone jeanclaude please i will give him what he desires nothing more i didnt like the way he said desires what are you up to me ma petite up to something he smiled anita i want to stay irving said i turned to him you dont know what youre saying im a reporter im doing my job swear to me swear to me you wont harm him you have my word jeanclaude said that you will not harm him in any way that i will not harm him in any way his face was expressionless as if all the smiles had been illusions his face had that immobility of the long dead lovely to look at but empty of life as a painting i looked into his blank eyes and shivered shit are you sure you want to stay here irving nodded i want the interview i shook my head youre a fool im a good reporter he said youre still a fool i can take care of myself anita we looked at each other for a space of heartbeats fine have fun may i have the file he looked down at his arms as if he had forgotten he was holding it drop it by tomorrow morning or madeline is going to have a fit sure no problem i tucked the bulky file under my left arm as loosely as i could manage it it hampered my being able to draw my gun but lifes imperfect i had information on gaynor i had the name of a recent exgirlfriend a woman scorned maybe shed talk to me maybe shed help me find clues maybe shed tell me to go to hell wouldnt be the first time jeanclaude was watching me with his still eyes i took a deep breath through my nose and let it out through my mouth enough for one night see you both tomorrow i turned and walked away there was a group of tourists with cameras one was sort of tentatively raised in my direction if you snap my picture i will take the camera away from you and break it i smiled while i said it the man lowered his camera uncertainly geez just a little picture youve seen enough i said move on the shows over the tourists drifted away like smoke when the wind blows through it i walked down the street towards the parking garage i glanced back and found the tourists had drifted back to surround jeanclaude and irving the tourists were right the show wasnt over yet irving was a big boy he wanted the interview who was i to play nursemaid on a grown werewolf would jeanclaude find out irvings secret if he did would it make a difference not my problem my problem was harold gaynor dominga salvador and a monster that was eating the good citizens of st louis missouri let irving take care of his own problems i had enough of my own the night sky was a curving bowl of liquid black stars like pinprick diamonds gave a cold hard fight the moon was a glowing patchwork of greys and goldishsilver the city makes you forget how dark the night how bright the moon how very many stars burrell cemetery didnt have any streetlights there was nothing but the distant yellow gleam of a houses windows i stood at the top of the hill in my coveralls and nikes sweating the boys body was gone it was in the morgue waiting for the coroners attentions i was finished with it never had to look at it again except in my dreams dolph stood beside me he didnt say a word just looked out over the grass and broken tombstones waiting waiting for me to do my magic to pull the rabbit out of the hat the best that could happen was the rabbit to be in and to destroy it next best thing was finding the hole it had come from that could tell us something and something was better than what we had right now the exterminators followed a few paces behind the man was short beefy grey hair cut in a butch he looked like a retired football coach but he handled the flamethrower strapped to his back like it was something alive thick hands caressing it the woman was young no more than twenty thin blond hair tied back in a ponytail she was a little taller than me small wisps of hair trailed across her face her eyes were wide and searched the tall grass side to side like a gunner on point i hoped she didnt have an itchy trigger finger i didnt want to be eaten by a killer zombie but i didnt want to be plastered with napalm either burned alive or eaten alive is there anything else on the menu the grass rustled and whispered like dry autumn leaves if we did use the flamethrowers in here itd be a grass fire wed be lucky to outrun it but fire was the only thing that could stop a zombie if it was a zombie and not something else altogether i shook my head and started walking doubts would get us nowhere act like you know what youre doing it was a rule i lived by i am sure that seсora salvador would have had a specific rite or sacrifice to find a zombies grave her way of doing all this had more rules than my way of course her way enabled her to trap souls in rotting corpses i had never hated anyone enough to do that to them kill them yes but entrap their soul and make it sit and wait and feel its body rotting no that was worse than wicked it was evil she needed to be stopped and only death would do that i sighed another problem for another night it bothered me to hear dolphs footsteps echoing mine i glanced back at the two exterminators they killed everything from termites to ghouls but ghouls are cowards scavengers mostly whatever we were after wasnt a scavenger i could feel the three of them at my back their footsteps seemed louder than mine i tried to clear my mind and start the search but all i could hear was their footsteps all i could sense was the womans fear they were messing up my concentration i stopped dolph i need more room what does that mean hang back a little youre ruining my concentration we might be too far away to help if the zombie rises out of the ground and leeches on me i shrugged what are you going to do shoot it with napalm and crispycritter me too you said fire was the only weapon he said it is but if the zombie actually grapples with anyone tell the exterminators not to fry the victim if the zombie grabs one of us we cant use the napalm he said bingo you could have said this sooner i just thought of it great he said i shrugged ill take point my oversight just hang back and let me do my job i stepped in close to him to whisper and watch the woman she looks scared enough to start shooting shadows theyre exterminators anita not police or vampire slayers for tonight our lives could depend on them so keep an eye on her okay he nodded and glanced back at the two exterminators the man smiled and nodded the girl just stared i could almost smell her fear she was entitled to it why did it bother me so much because she and i were the only women here and we had to be better than the men braver quicker whatever it was a rule for playing with the big boys i walked out into the grass alone i waited until the only thing i could hear was the grass soft dry whispering like it was trying to tell me something in a scratchy frantic voice frantic fearful the grass sounded afraid that was stupid grass didnt feel shit but i did and there was sweat on every inch of my body was it here was the thing that had reduced a man to so much raw meat here in the grass hiding waiting no zombies werent smart enough for that but of course it had been smart enough to hide from the police that was smart for a corpse too smart maybe it wasnt a zombie at all i had finally found something that scared me more than vampires death didnt bother me much strong christian and all that method of death did being eaten alive one of my top three ways not to go out who would ever have thought id be afraid of a zombie any kind of zombie nicely ironic that id laugh later when my mouth wasnt so damn dry there was that quiet waiting that all cemeteries have as if the dead held their collective breath waiting but for what the resurrection maybe but ive dealt with the dead too long to believe in just one answer the dead are like the living they do different things most people die and go to heaven or hell and thats that but a few for whatever reason dont work that way ghosts restless spirits violence evil or simple confusion all of these can trap a spirit on earth im not saying that it traps the soul i dont believe that but some memory of the soul the essence lingers was i expecting some specter to rise from the grass and rush screaming towards me no i had never seen a ghost yet that could cause actual physical harm if it causes physical damage it isnt a ghost demon maybe or the spirit of some sorcerer black magic but ghosts dont hurt that was almost a comforting thought the ground sloped out from under my feet i stumbled and caught myself on one of the leaning headstones sunken earth a grave without a marker a tingling shock ran up my leg a whisper of ghostly electricity i jerked back and sat down hard on the ground anita you all right dolph yelled i glanced back at him and found the grass completely hid me from view im fine i yelled i got to my feet careful to avoid stepping on the old grave whatever person lay under the earth he or she was not a happy camper it was a hot spot not a ghost or even a haunt but something it had probably been a fullblown ghost once but time had worn it away ghosts wear out like old clothes and go on to wherever old ghosts go the sunken grave would fade away probably in my lifetime if i could avoid killer zombies for a few years and vampires and guntoting humans oh hell the hot spot would probably outlast me i looked back to find dolph and the exterminators maybe twenty yards back twenty yards wasnt that awfully far i had told them to hang back but i hadnt meant for them to leave me hanging in the wind i was just never satisfied if i called them to come closer you think theyd get mad probably i started walking again trying not to step on any more graves but it was hard with most of the stones hidden in the long grass so many unmarked graves so much neglect i could wander aimlessly all bloody night had i really thought that i could just accidentally walk over the right grave yes hope springs eternal especially when the alternative isnt very human vampires were once ordinary human beings zombies too most lycanthropes start out human though there are a few rare inherited curses all the monsters start out normal except me raising the dead wasnt a career choice i didnt sit down in the guidance counselors office one day and say id like to raise the dead for a living no it wasnt that neat or clean i have always had an affinity for the dead always not the newly dead no i dont mess with souls but once the soul departs i know it i can feel it laugh all you want its the truth i had a dog when i was little just like most kids and like most kids dogs she died i was thirteen we buried jenny in the backyard i woke up a week after jenny died and found her curled up beside me thick black fur coated with grave dirt dead brown eyes following my every move just like when she was alive i thought for one wild moment she was alive it had been a mistake but i know dead when i see it feel it call it from the grave i wonder what dominga salvador would think about that story calling an animal zombie how shocking raising the dead by accident how frightening how sick my stepmother judith never quite recovered from the shock she rarely tells people what i do for a living dad well dad ignores it too i tried ignoring it but couldnt i wont go into details but does the term road kill have any significance for you it did for judith i looked like a nightmare version of the pied piper my father finally took me to meet my maternal grandmother shes not as scary as dominga salvador but shes interesting grandma flores agreed with dad i should not be trained in voodoo only in enough control to stop the problems just teach her to control it dad said she did i did dad took me back home it was never mentioned again at least not in front of me i always wondered what dear stepmother said behind closed doors for that matter dad wasnt pleased either hell i wasnt pleased bert recruited me straight out of college i never knew how he heard about me i refused him at first but he waved money at me maybe i was rebelling against parental expectations or maybe i had finally realized that there is damn little employment opportunity for a bs in biology with an emphasis on the supernatural i minored in creatures of legend that was real helpful on my resume it was like having a degree in ancient greek or the romantic poets interesting enjoyable but then what the hell can you do with it i had planned to go on to grad school and teach college but bert came along and showed me a way to turn my natural talent into a job at least i can say i use my degree every day i never puzzled about how i came to do what i do there was no mystery it was in the blood i stood in the graveyard and took a deep breath a bead of sweat trickled down my face i wiped it with the back of my hand i was sweating like a pig and i still felt cold fear but not of the bogeyman of what i was about to do if it were a muscle i would move it if it were a thought i would think it if it were a magic word i could say it it is nothing like that it is like my skin becomes cool even under cloth i can feel all my nerve endings naked to the wind and even in this hot sweating august night my skin felt cool it is almost like a tiny cool wind emanates from my skin but it isnt wind no one else can feel it it doesnt blow through a room like a hollywood horror movie it isnt flashy its quiet private mine the cool fingers of wind searched outward within a tentofifteenfoot circle i would be able to search the graves as i moved the circle would move with me searching how does it feel to search through the hardpacked earth for dead bodies like nothing human the closest i can come to describing it is like phantom fingers rifling through the dirt searching for the dead but of course that isnt quite what it feels like either close but no cigar the coffin nearest me had been waterruined years ago bits of warped wood shreds of bone nothing whole bone and old wood dirt clean and dead the hot spot flared almost like a burning sensation i couldnt read its coffin the hot spot could keep its secrets it wasnt worth forcing the issue it was a life force of sorts trapped to a dead grave until it faded that is bound to make you grumpy i walked slowly forward the circle moved with me i touched bones intact coffins bits of cloth in newer graves this was an old cemetery there were no decaying corpses death had progressed to the nice neat stage something grabbed my ankle i jumped and walked forward without looking down never look down its a rule i got a brief glimpse just behind my eyes of something pale and mistlike with wide screaming eyes a ghost a reallive ghost i had walked over its grave and it had let me know it didnt like it a ghost had grabbed me round the ankles big deal if you ignored them the spectral hands would fade if you noticed them you gave them substance and you could be in deep shit important safety tip with most of the spiritual world if you ignore it it has less power this does not work with demons or other demibeings other exceptions to the rule are vampires zombies ghouls lycanthropes witches oh hell ignoring only works for ghosts but it does work phantom hands tugged at my pants leg i could feel skeletal fingers pulling upwards as if it would use me to pull itself from the grave shit i was eating my pulse between my teeth just keep walking ignore it it will go away dammit to hell the fingers slipped away reluctantly some types of ghost seem to bear a grudge against the living a sort of jealousy they cannot harm you but they scare the bejesus out of you and laugh while theyre doing it i found an empty grave bits of wood decaying into the earth but no trace of bone no body empty the earth above it was thick with grass and weeds the earth was hardpacked and dry from the drought the grass and weeds had been disturbed bare roots were showing almost as if someone had tried to pull the grass up or something had come up underneath the grass and left a trail i knelt on all fours above the dying grass my hands stayed on top of the hard reddish dirt but i could feel the inside of the grave like rolling your tongue around your teeth you cant see it but you can feel it the corpse was gone the coffin was undisturbed a zombie had come from here was it the zombie we were looking for no guarantees but it was the only zombie raising i could sense i stared out away from the grave it was hard using just my eyes to search the grass i could almost see what lay under the dirt but the grave showed behind my eyes in my head somewhere where there were no optic nerves the graveyard that i could see with my eyes ended at a fence maybe five yards away had i walked it all was this the only grave that was empty i stood and looked out over the graves dolph and the two exterminators were still with me about thirty yards back thirty yards some backup i had walked it all there was the grabby ghost the hot spot was there the newest grave over there it was mine now i knew this cemetery and everything that was restless everything that wasnt quite dead was dancing above its grave white misty phantoms sparkling angry lights agitated there was more than one way to wake the dead but they would quiet down and sleep if that was the word no permanent damage i glanced back down at the empty grave no permanent damage i waved dolph and the others over i got a ziploc bag out of the coverall pocket and scooped some grave dirt into it the moonlight suddenly seemed dimmer dolph was standing over me he did sort of loom well he asked a zombie came out of this grave i said is it the killer zombie i dont know for sure you dont know not yet when will you know ill take it to evans and let him do his touchiefeelie routine on it evans the clairvoyant dolph said yep hes a flake true but hes good the department doesnt use him anymore bully for the department i said hes still on retainer at animators inc dolph shook his head i dont trust evans i dont trust anybody i said so whats the problem dolph smiled point taken i had rolled some of the grass and weeds roots carefully intact inside a second bag i crawled to the head of the grave and spread the weeds there was no marker dammit the pale limestone had been chipped away at the base shattered carried away shit why would they destroy the headstone dolph asked the name and date could have given us some clue to why the zombie was raised and to what went wrong wrong how you might raise a zombie to kill one or two people but not wholesale slaughter nobody would do that unless theyre crazy he said i stared up at him thats not funny no it isnt a madman that could raise the dead a murderous zombie corpse controlled by a psychotic great and if he or she could do it once dolph if we have a crazy man running around there could be more than one zombie and if it is crazy then there wont be a pattern he said shit exactly no pattern meant no motive no motive meant we might not be able to figure this out no i dont believe that why not he asked because if i do believe it it leaves us no place to go i took out a pocketknife that i brought for the occasion and started to chip at the remains of the tombstone defacing a gravemarker is against the law dolph said isnt it though i scrapped a few smaller pieces into a third bag and finally got a sizable chunk of marble big as my thumb i stuffed all the bags into the pockets of my coveralls along with the pocketknife you really think evans will be able to read anything from those bits and pieces i dont know i stood and looked down at the grave the two exterminators were standing just a short distance away giving us privacy how very polite you know dolph they may have destroyed the tombstone but the grave is still here but the corpse is gone he said true but the coffin might be able to tell us something anything might help he nodded alright ill get an exhumation order cant we just dig it up now tonight no he said i have to play by the rules he stared at me very hard and i dont want to come back out here and find the grave dug up the evidence wont mean shit if you tamper with it evidence you really think this case will go to court yes dolph we just need to destroy the zombie i want the bastards that raised it anita i want them up on murder charges i nodded i agreed with him but i thought it unlikely dolph was a policeman he had to worry about the law i worried about simpler things like survival ill let you know if evans has anything useful to say i said you do that wherever the beastie is dolph it isnt here its out there isnt it yeah i said killing someone else while we sit here and chase our tails i wanted to touch him to let him know it was all right but it wasnt all right i knew how he felt we were chasing our tails even if this was the grave of the killer zombie it didnt get us any closer to finding the zombie and we had to find it find it trap it and destroy it the sixtyfourthousanddollar question was could we do all that before it needed to feed again i didnt have an answer that was a lie i had an answer i just didnt like it out there somewhere the zombie was feeding again the trailer park where evans lives is in st charles just off highway acres of mobile homes toll out in every direction of course theres nothing mobile about them when i was a kid trailers could be hooked to the back of a car and moved simple it was one of their appeals some of these mobile homes had three and four bedrooms multiple baths the only thing moving these puppies was a semitruck or a tornado evans s trailer is an older model i think if he had to he could chain it to the back of a pickup and move easier than hiring a moving van i guess but i doubt evans will ever move hell he hasnt left the trailer in nearly a year the windows were golden with light there was a little makeshift porch complete with an awning guarding the door i knew he would be up evans was always up insomnia sounded so harmless evans had made it a disease i was back in my black shorts outfit the three bags of goodies were stuffed in a fanny pack if i went in there waving them around evans would freak i needed to work up to it be subtle just thought id drop by to see my old buddy no ulterior motives here right i opened the screen door and knocked silence no movement nothing i raised my hand to knock again then hesitated had evans finally gotten to sleep his first decent nights sleep since id known him drat i was still standing there with my hand halfraised when i felt him staring at me i looked up at the little window in the door a slice of pale face was staring out from between the curtains evanss blue eye blinked at me i waved his face disappeared the door unlocked then opened there was no sight of evans just the open door i walked in evans was standing behind the door hiding he closed the door by leaning against it his breathing was fast and shallow as if hed been running stringy yellow hair trailed over a dark blue bathrobe his face was covered in bristly reddish beard how are you doing evans he leaned against the door eyes too wide his breathing was still too fast was he on something evans you all right when in doubt reverse your word order he nodded what do you want his voice was breathy i didnt think he was going to believe i had just stopped by call it an instinct i need your help he shook his head no you dont even know what i want he shook his head doesnt matter may i sit down i asked if directness wouldnt work maybe politeness would he nodded sure i glanced around the small livingroom area i was sure there was a couch under the newspapers paper plates halffull cups old clothes there was a box of petrified pizza on the coffee table the room smelled stale would he freak if i moved stuff could i sit on the pile that i thought was the couch without everything collapsing i decided to try id sit in the freaking moldy pizza box if evans would agree to help me i perched on a pile of papers there was definitely something large and solid under the newspapers maybe the couch may i have a cup of coffee he shook his head no clean cups this i could believe he was still pressed against the door as if afraid to come any closer his hands were plunged into the pockets of his bathrobe can we just talk i asked he shook his head i shook my head with him he frowned at that maybe somebody was home what do you want he asked i told you your help i dont do that anymore what i asked you know he said no evans i dont know tell me i dont touch things anymore i blinked it was an odd way to phrase it i stared around at the piles of dirty dishes the clothes it did look untouched evans let me see your hands he shook his head i didnt imitate him this time evans show me your hands no it was loud clear i stood up and started walking towards him it didnt take long he backed away into the corner by the door and the doorway into the bedroom show me your hands tears welled in his eyes he blinked and the tears slid down his cheeks leave me alone he said my chest was tight what had he done god what had he done evans either you show me your hands voluntarily or i make you do it i fought an urge to touch his arm but that was not allowed he was crying harder now small hiccupy sobs he pulled his left hand out of the robe pocket it was pale bony whole i took a deep breath thank you dear god what did you think id done he asked i shook my head dont ask he was looking at me now really looking at me i did have his attention im not that crazy he said i started to say i never thought you were but obviously i had i had thought he had cut his hands off so he wouldnt have to touch anymore god that was crazy seriously crazy and i was here to ask him to help me with a murder which of us was crazier dont answer that he shook his head what are you doing here anita the tears werent even dry on his face but his voice was calm ordinary i need your help with a murder i dont do that anymore i told you you told me once that you couldnt not have visions your clairvoyance isnt something you can just turn off thats why i stay in here if i dont go out i dont see anybody i dont have visions anymore i dont believe you i said he took a clean white handkerchief out of his pocket and wrapped it around the doorknob get out i saw a threeyearold boy today hed been eaten alive he leaned his forehead into the door dont do this to me please i know other psychics evans but no one with your success rate i need the best i need you he rubbed his forehead against the door please dont i should have gone then left done what he said but i didnt i stood behind him and waited come on old buddy old pal risk your sanity for me i was the ruthless zombie raiser i didnt feel guilt results were all that mattered riight but in a way results were all that mattered other people are going to die unless we can stop it i said i dont care he said i dont believe you he stuffed the handkerchief back into his pocket and whirled around the little boy youre not lying about that are you i wouldnt lie to you he nodded yeah yeah he licked his lips give me what ya got i got the bags out of my purse and opened the one with the gravestone fragments in it had to start somewhere he didnt ask what it was that would be cheating i wouldnt even have mentioned the boy except i needed the leverage guilt is a wonderful tool his hand shook as i dropped the largest rock fragment into his palm i was very careful that my fingers did not brush his hand i didnt want evans inside my secrets it might scare him off his hand clenched around the stone a shock ran up his spine he jerked eyes closed and he was gone graveyard grave his head jerked to the side like he was listening to something tall grass hot blood hes wiping blood on the tombstone he looked around the room with his closed eyes would he have seen the room if his eyes had been open where does the blood come from he asked that was i supposed to answer no no he stumbled backwards back smacking into the door woman screaming screaming no no his eyes flew open wide he threw the rock fragment across the room they killed her they killed her he pressed his fists into his eyes oh god they slit her throat who is they he shook his head fists still shoved against his face i dont know evans what did you see blood he stared at me between his arms shielding his face blood everywhere they slit her throat they smeared the blood on the tombstone i had two more items for him dare i ask asking didnt hurt did it i have two more items for you to touch no fucking way he said he backed away from me towards the short hall that led to the bedroom get out get out get the fuck out of my house now evans what else did you see get out describe one thing about the woman help me evans he leaned in the doorway and slid to sit on the floor a bracelet she wore a bracelet on her left wrist little dangling charms hearts bow and arrow music he shook his head and buried his head against his eyes go away now i started to say thank you but that didnt cut it i picked my way over the floor searching for the rock fragment i found it in a coffee cup there was something green and growing in the bottom of it i picked up the stone and wiped it on a pair of jeans on the floor i put it back in the bag and shoved all of it inside the purse i stared around at the filth and didnt want to leave him here maybe i was just feeling guilty for having abused him maybe evans thanks he didnt look up if i had a cleaning person drop by would you let her in to clean i dont want anybody in here animators inc could pick up the tab we owe you for this one he looked up then anger pure anger was all that was in his face evans get some help youre tearing yourself apart getthefuckoutofmyhouse each word was hot enough to scald i had never seen evans angry scared yes but not like this what could i say it was his house i got out i stood on the shaky porch until i heard the door lock behind me i had what i wanted information so why did i feel so bad because i had bullied a seriously disturbed man okay that was it guilt guilt guilt an image flashed into my head the bloodsoaked sheet on the brown patterned couch mrs reynoldss spine dangling wet and glistening in the sunlight i walked to my car and got in if abusing evans could save one family then it was worth it if it would keep me from having to see another threeyearold boy with his intestines ripped out id beat evans with a padded club or let him beat me come to think of it wasnt that what wed just done i was small in the dream a child the car was crushed in front where it had been broadsided by another car it looked like it was made of shiny paper that had been crushed by hand the door was open i crawled inside on the familiar upholstery so pale it was almost white there was a dark liquid stain on the seat it wasnt all that large i touched it tentatively my fingers came away smeared with crimson it was the first blood id ever seen i stared up at the windshield it was broken in a spiderweb of cracks bowed outward where my mothers face had smashed into it she had been thrown out the door to die in a field beside the road thats why there wasnt a lot of blood on the seat i stared at the fresh blood on my fingers in real life the blood had been dry just a stain when i dreamed about it it was always fresh there was a smell this time the smell of rotten flesh that wasnt right i stared up in the dream and realized it was a dream and the smell wasnt part of it it was real i woke instantly staring into the dark my heart thudding in my throat my hand went for the browning in its second home a sheath attached to the headboard of my bed it was firm and solid and comforting i stayed on the bed back pressed against the headboard gun held in a teacup grip through a tiny crack in the drapes moonlight spilled the meager light outlined a mans shape the shape didnt react to the gun or my movement it shuffled forward dragging its feet through the carpet it had stumbled into my collection of toy penguins that spilled like a fuzzy tide under my bedroom window it had knocked some of them over and it didnt seem able to pick its feet up and walk over them the figure was wading through the fluffy penguins dragging its feet as if wading in water i kept the gun pointed onehanded at the thing and reached without looking to turn on my bedside lamp the light seemed harsh after the darkness i blinked rapidly willing my pupils to contract to adjust when they did and i could see it was a zombie he had been a big man in life shoulders broad as a barn door filled with muscle his huge hands were very strong looking one eye had dehydrated and was shriveled like a prune the remaining eye stared at me there was nothing in that stare no anticipation no excitement no cruelty nothing but a blankness a blankness that dominga salvador had filled with purpose kill she had said i would have bet on it it was her zombie i couldnt turn it i couldnt order it to do anything until it fulfilled domingas orders once it killed me it would be docile as a dead puppy once it killed me i didnt think id wait for that the browning was loaded with glazer safety rounds silvercoated glazer safety rounds will kill a man if you hit him anywhere near the center of the body the hole will be too big for salvage a hole in its chest wouldnt bother the zombie it would keep coming heart or no heart if you hit a person in the arm or leg with safety rounds it will take off that arm or leg instant amputee if you hit it right the zombie seemed in no hurry he shuffled through the fallen stuffed toys with that singleminded determination of the dead zombies are not inhumanly strong but they can use every ounce of strength they dont save anything almost any human being could do a superhuman feat once pop muscles tear cartilage snap your spine but you can lift the car only inhibitors in the brain prevent us all from destroying ourselves zombies dont have inhibitors the corpse could literally tear me apart while it tore itself apart but if dominga had really wanted to kill me she would have sent a lessdecayed zombie this one was so far gone i might have been able to dodge around it and make the door maybe but then again i cupped the butt of the gun in my left the right where it was supposed to be my finger on the trigger i pulled the trigger and the explosion was incredibly loud in the small room the zombie jerked stumbled its right arm flew off in a welter of flesh and bone no blood it had been dead too long for that the zombie kept coming i sighted on the other arm hold your breath squeeeeze i was aiming for the elbow i hit it the two arms lay on the carpet and began to worm their way towards the bed i could chop the thing to pieces and all the pieces would keep trying to kill me the right leg at the knee the leg didnt come loose completely but the zombie toppled to one side listing it fell on its side then rolled onto its stomach and began pushing with its remaining leg some dark liquid was leaking out of the shattered leg the smell was worse i swallowed and it was thick god i got off the bed on the far side away from the thing i walked around the bed coming in behind the thing it knew instantly that i had moved it tried to turn and come at me pushing with that last leg the crawling arms turned faster fingers scrambling on the carpet i stood over it and blasted the other leg from less than two feet away bits and pieces of it splattered onto my penguins damn the arms were almost at my bare feet i fired two quick shots and the hand shattered exploding on the white carpet the handless arms flopped and struggled they were still trying to reach me there was a brush of cloth a sense of movement just behind me in the darkened living room i was standing with my back to the open door i turned and knew it was too late arms grabbed me clutching me to a very solid chest fingers dug into my right arm pinning the gun against my body i turned my head away using my hair to shield my face and neck teeth sank into my shoulder i screamed my face was pressed against the things shoulder the fingers were digging in it was going to crush my arm the gun barrel was pressed against its shoulder teeth tore at the flesh of my shoulder but it wasnt fangs it only had human teeth to work with it hurt like hell but it would be alright if i could get away i turned my face forward away from the shoulder and pulled the trigger the entire body jerked backwards the left arm crumbled i rolled out of its grip the arm dangled from my forearm fingers hanging on i was standing in the doorway of my bedroom staring at the thing that had almost got me it had been a white male about sixone built like a football player it was fresh from the farm blood spattered where the shoulder had torn away the fingers on my arm tightened it couldnt crush my arm but i couldnt make it let go either i didnt have the time the zombie charged one arm wide to grab me i seemed to have all the time in the world to lift the gun twohanded the arm struggled and fought me as if it were still connected to the zombies brain i got off two quick shots the zombie stumbled its left leg collapsing but it was too late it was too close as it fell it took me with it we landed on the floor with me on the bottom i managed to keep the browning up so that my arms were free and so was the gun his weight pinned my body nothing i could do about it blood glistened on his lips i fired pointblank closing my eyes as i pulled the trigger not just because i didnt want to see but to save my eyes from bone shards when i looked the head was gone except for a thin line of naked jawbone and a fragment of skull the remaining hand scrambled for my throat the hand still attached to my arm was helping its body i couldnt get the gun around to shoot the arm the angle was wrong a sound of something heavy sliding behind me i risked a glance craning my neck backwards to see the first zombie coming towards me its mouth all that it had left to hurt me with was open wide i screamed and turned back to the one on top of me the attached hand fluttered at my neck i pulled it away and gave it its own arm to hold it grabbed it with the brain gone it wasnt as smart i felt the fingers on my arm loosen a shudder ran through the dangling arm blood burst out of it like a ripe melon the fingers spasmed releasing my arm the zombie crushed its own arm until it spattered and bones snapped the scrambling sounds behind me were closer god police come out with your hands up the voice was male and loud from the hallway the hell with being cool and selfsufficient help me miss whats happening in there the scrambling sounds were right next to me i craned my neck and found myself almost nose to nose with the first zombie i shoved the browning in its open mouth its teeth scrapped on the barrel and i pulled the trigger a policeman was suddenly in the doorway framed against the darkness from my angle he was huge curly brown hair going gray mustache gun in hand jesus he said the second zombie dropped its crushed arm and reached for me again the policeman took a firm grip of the zombies belt and pulled him upward with one hand get her out of here he said his partner moved in but i didnt give him time i scrambled out from under the halfraised body scuttling on all fours into the living room you didnt have to ask me twice the partner lifted me to my feet by one arm it was my right and the browning came up with it normally a cop will make you drop your gun before anything else there is usually no way to tell who the bad guy is if you have a gun you are a bad guy unless proven otherwise innocent until proven guilty does not work in the field he scooped the gun from my hand i let him i knew the drill a gunshot exploded behind us i jumped and the cop did too he was about my age but right then i felt about a million years old we turned and found the first cop shooting into the zombie the thing had struggled free of his hand it was on its feet staggered by the bullets but not stopped get over here brady the first cop said the younger cop drew his gun and moved forward he hesitated glancing at me help him i said he nodded and started firing into the zombie the sound of gunfire was like thunder it filled the room until my ears were ringing and the reek of gunpowder was almost overpowering bullet holes blossomed in the walls the zombie kept staggering forward they were just annoying it the problem for police is that they cant load up with glazer safety rounds most cops dont run into the supernatural as much as i do most of the time theyre chasing human crooks the powers that be frown on taking off the leg of john q public just cause he fired at you youre not really supposed to kill people just because theyre trying to kill you right so they had normal rounds maybe a little silver coating to make the medicine go down but nothing that could stop a zombie they were being backed up one reloaded while the other fired the thing staggered forward its remaining arm sweeping in front of it searching for me shit my guns loaded with glazer safety rounds i said use it the first cop said brady i told you to get her out of here you needed help brady said get the civilian the fuck out of here civilian me brady didnt question again he just backed towards me gun out but not firing come on miss we gotta get out of here give me my gun he glanced at me shook his head im with the regional preternatural investigation team which was true i was hoping he would assume i was a cop which wasnt true he was young he assumed he handed me back the browning thanks i moved up with the older cop im with the spook squad he glanced at me gun still trained on the advancing corpse then do something someone had turned on the livingroom light now that no one was shooting it the zombie was moving out it walked like a man striding down the street except it had no head and only one arm there was a spring in its step maybe it sensed i was close the body was in better condition than the first zombies had been i could cripple it but not incapacitate it id settle for crippled i fired a third round into the left leg that i had wounded earlier i had more time to aim and my aim was true the leg collapsed under it it pulled itself forward with the one arm leg pushing against the rug he was on his last leg i started to smile then to laugh but it choked in my throat i walked around the far side of the couch i didnt want any accidents after what id seen it do to its own body i didnt want any crushed limbs i came in behind it and it scrambled quicker than it should have to try to face me it took two shots for the other leg i couldnt remember how many bullets id used did i have one more left or two or none i felt like dirty harry except that this punk didnt give a damn how many bullets i had left the dead dont scare easy it was still pulling itself and its damaged legs along that one hand i fired nearly pointblank and the hand exploded like a crimson flower on the white carpet it kept coming using the wrist stump to push along i pulled the trigger and it clicked empty shit im out i said i stepped back away from it it followed me the older cop moved in and grabbed it by both ankles he pulled it backwards one leg slid slowly out of the pants and twisted free in his hand fuck he dropped the leg it wiggled like a brokenbacked snake i stared down at the still determined corpse it was struggling towards me it wasnt making much progress the policeman was holding it onelegged sort of in the air but the zombie kept trying it would keep trying until it was incinerated or dominga salvador changed her orders more uniformed cops came in the door they fell on the butchered zombie like vultures on a wildebeest it bucked and struggled fought to get away to finish its mission to kill me there were enough cops to subdue it they would hold it until the lab boys arrived the lab boys would do what they could onsite then the zombie would be incinerated by an exterminator team they had tried taking zombies down to the morgue and holding them for tests but little pieces kept escaping and hiding out in the strangest places the medical examiner had decreed that all zombies were to be truly dead before shipping the ambulance crew and lab techs agreed with her i sympathized but knew that most evidence disappears in a fire choices choices i stood to one side of my living room they had forgotten me in the melee fine i didnt feel like wrestling any more zombies tonight i realized for the first time that i was wearing nothing but an oversize tshirt and panties the tshirt clung wetly to my body thick with blood i started towards the bedroom i think i meant to get a pair of pants the sight on the floor stopped me the first zombie was like a legless insect it couldnt move but it was trying the bloody stump of a body was still trying to carry out its orders to kill me dominga salvador had meant to kill me two zombies one almost new she had meant to kill me that one thought chased round my head like a piece of song we had threatened each other but why this level of violence why kill me i couldnt stop her legally she knew that so why make such a damned serious attempt to kill me maybe because she had something to hide dominga had given her word that she hadnt raised the killer zombie but maybe her word didnt mean anything it was the only answer she had something to do with the killer zombie had she raised it or did she know who had no shed raised the beast or why kill me the night after i talked to her it was too big a coincidence dominga salvador had raised a zombie and it had gotten away from her that was it evil as she was she wasnt psychotic she wouldnt just raise a killer zombie and let it loose the great voodoo queen had screwed up royally that more than anything else more than the deaths or the possible murder charge would piss her off she couldnt afford her reputation to be trashed like that i stared past the bloody stinking remnants in the bedroom my stuffed penguins were covered in blood and worse could my long suffering dry cleaner get them clean he did pretty good with my suits glazer safety rounds didnt go through walls it was another reason i liked them my neighbors didnt get shot up the police bullets had pierced the bedroom walls neat round holes were everywhere no one had ever attacked me at home before not like this it should have been against the rules you should be safe in your own bed i know i know bad guys dont have rules its one of the reasons theyre bad guys i knew who had raised the zombie all i had to do was prove it there was blood everywhere blood and worse things i was actually getting used to the smell god but it stank the whole apartment stank almost everything in my apartment is white walls carpet couch chair it made the stains show up nicely like fresh wounds the bullet holes and cracked plaster board set off the blood nicely the apartment was trashed i would prove dominga had done this then if i was lucky id get to return the favor sweets to the sweet i whispered to no one in particular tears started to burn at the back of my throat i didnt want to cry but a scream was sort of tickling around in my throat too crying or screaming crying seemed better the paramedics came one was a short black woman about my own age come on honey we got to take a look at you her voice was gentle her hands sort of leading me away from the carnage i didnt even mind her calling me honey i wanted very much to crawl up into someones lap about now and be comforted i needed that badly i wasnt going to get it honey we need to see how bad youre bleeding before we take you down to the ambulance i shook my head my voice sounded far away detached its not my blood what i looked at her fighting to focus and not drift shock was setting in im usually better than this but hey we all have our nights its not my blood ive got a bite on the shoulder thats it she looked like she didnt believe me i didnt blame her most people see you covered in blood they just assume part of it has to be yours they do not take into account that they are dealing with a toughasnails vampire slayer and corpse raiser the tears were back stinging just behind my eyes there was blood all over my penguins i didnt give a damn about the walls and carpet they could be replaced but id collected those damned stuffed toys over years i let the paramedic lead me away tears trickling down my cheeks i wasnt crying my eyes were running my eyes were running because there were pieces of zombie all over my toys jesus id seen enough crime scenes to know what to expect it was like a play id seen too many times i could tell you all the entrances the exits most of the lines but this was different this was my place it was silly to be offended that dominga salvador had attacked me in my own home it was stupid but there it was she had broken a rule one i hadnt even known i had thou shalt not attack the good guy in his or her own home shit i was going to nail her hide to a tree for it yeah me and what army maybe me and the police the livingroom curtains billowed in the hot breeze the glass had been shattered in the firefight i was glad i had just signed a twoyear lease at least they couldnt kick me out dolph sat across from me in my little kitchen area the breakfast table with its two straightbacked chairs seemed tiny with him sitting at it he sort of filled my kitchen or maybe i was just feeling small tonight or was it morning i glanced at my watch there was a dark slick smear obscuring the face couldnt read it would have to chip the damn thing clean i tucked my arm back inside the blanket the paramedic had given me my skin was colder than it should have been even thoughts of vengeance couldnt warm me later later i would be warm later i would be pissed right now i was glad to be alive okay anita what happened i glanced at the living room it was nearly empty the zombies had been carried away incinerated on the street no less entertainment for the entire neighborhood family fun could i change clothes before i give a statement please he looked at me for maybe a second then nodded great i got up gripping the blanket around me edges folded carefully didnt want to accidentally trip on the ends id embarrassed myself enough for one night save the tshirt for evidence dolph called i said sure thing without turning around they had thrown sheets over the worst of the stains so they didnt track blood all over the apartment building nice the bedroom stank of rotted corpse stale blood old death god id never be able to sleep in here tonight even i had my limits what i wanted was a shower but i didnt think dolph would wait that long i settled for jeans socks and a clean tshirt i carried all of it into the bathroom with the door closed the smell was very faint it looked like my bathroom no disasters here i dropped the blanket on the floor with the tshirt there was a bulky bandage over my shoulder where the zombie had bitten me i was lucky it hadnt taken a hunk of flesh the paramedic warned me to get a tetanus booster zombies dont make more zombies by biting but the dead have nasty mouths infection is more of a danger but a tetanus booster is a precaution blood had dried in flaking patches on my legs and arms i didnt bother washing my hands id shower later get everything clean at once the tshirt hung almost to my knees a huge caricature of arthur conan doyle was on the front he was peering through a huge magnifying glass one eye comically large i gazed into the mirror over the sink looking at the shirt it was soft and warm and comforting comforting was good right now the old tshirt was ruined no saving it but maybe i could save some of the penguins i ran cold water into the bathtub if it was a shirt id soak it in cold water maybe it worked with toys i got a pair of jogging shoes out from under the bed i didnt really want to walk over the drying stains in only socks shoes were made for such occasions alright so the creator of nike airs never foresaw walking over drying zombie blood its hard to prepare for everything two of the penguins were turning brown as the blood dried i carried them gingerly into the bathroom and laid them in the water i pushed them under until they soaked up enough water to stay partially submerged then i turned the water off my hands were cleaner the water wasnt blood trailed out of the two soft toys like water squeezed out of a sponge if these two came clean i could save them all i dried my hands on the blanket no sense getting blood on anything else sigmund the penguin i occasionally slept with was barely spattered just a few specks across his fuzzy white belly small blessings i almost tucked him under my arm to hold while i gave a statement dolph probably wouldnt tell i put sigmund a little farther from the worst stains as if that would help seeing the stupid toy tucked safely in a corner did make me feel better great zerbrowski was peering at the aquarium he glanced my way these are the biggest freaking angelfish ive ever seen you could fry some of em up in a pan leave the fish alone zerbrowski i said he grinned sure just a thought back in the kitchen dolph sat with his hands folded on the tabletop his face unreadable if he was upset that id almost cashed it in tonight he didnt show it but then dolph didnt show much of anything ever the most emotion id ever seen him display was about this case the killer zombie butchered civilians you want some coffee i asked sure me too zerbrowski said only if you say please he leaned against the wall just outside the kitchen please i got a bag of coffee out of the freezer you keep the coffee in the freezer zerbrowski said hasnt anyone ever fixed real coffee for you i asked my idea of gourmet coffee is tasters choice i shook my head barbarian if you two are finished with clever repartee dolph said could we start the statement now his voice was softer than his words i smiled at him and at zerbrowski damned if it wasnt nice to see both of them i must have been hurt worse than i knew to be happy to see zerbrowski i was asleep minding my own business when i woke up to find a zombie standing over me i measured beans and poured them into the little black coffee grinder that id bought because it matched the coffee maker what woke you dolph asked i pressed the button on the grinder and the rich smell of fresh ground coffee filled the kitchen ah heaven i smelled corpses i said explain i was dreaming and i smelled rotting corpses it didnt match the dream it woke me then what he had his ever present notebook out pen poised i concentrated on each small step to making the coffee and told dolph everything including my suspicions about seсora salvador the coffee was beginning to perk and fill the apartment with that wonderful smell that coffee always has by the time i finished so you think dominga salvador is our zombie raiser dolph said yes he stared at me across the small table his eyes were very serious can you prove it no he took a deep breath closing his eyes for a moment great just great the coffee smells done zerbrowski said he was sitting on the floor back propped against the kitchen doorway i got up and poured the coffee if you want sugar or cream help yourself i put the cream real cream out on the kitchen counter along with the sugar bowl zerbrowski took a lot of sugar and a dab of cream dolph went for black it was the way i took it most of the time tonight i added cream and sweetened it real cream in real coffee yum yum if we could get you inside domingas house could you find proof dolph asked proof of something sure but of raising the killer zombie i shook my head if she did raise it and it got away then she wont want to be tied to it shell have destroyed all the proof just to save face i want her for this dolph said me too she might also try and kill you again zerbrowski said from the doorway he was blowing on his coffee to cool it no joke i said you think shell try again dolph asked probably how the hell did two zombies get inside my apartment someone picked the lock dolph said could the zombie no a zombie would rip a door off its hinges but it wouldnt take the time to pick a lock even if it had the fine motor skill to do it so someone with skill opened the door and let them in dolph said appears so i said any ideas on that i would bet one of her bodyguards her grandson antonio or maybe enzo a big guy in his forties who seems to be her personal protection i dont know if either of them have the skill but theyd do it enzo but not antonio why cross him off if tony had let the zombies in hed have stayed and watched you sure i shrugged hes that kind of guy enzo would do business and leave hed follow orders the grandson wouldnt dolph nodded theres a lot of heat from upstairs to solve this case i think i can get us a search warrant in fortyeight hours two days is a long time dolph two days without one piece of proof anita except for your word im going out on a limb for this one shes in it dolph somehow i dont know why and i dont know what could have caused her to lose control of the zombie but shes in it ill get the warrant he said one of the brothers in blue said you told him you were a cop zerbrowski said i told him i was with your squad i never said i was a cop zerbrowski grinned mmmhuh will you be safe here tonight dolph asked i think so the seсora doesnt want to get on the bad side of the law they treat renegade witches sort of like renegade vampires its an automatic death sentence because people are too scared of them dolph said because some witches can slip through the fucking bars how about voodoo queens zerbrowski said i shook my head i dont want to know we better go leave you to get some sleep dolph said he left his empty coffee cup on the table zerbrowski hadnt finished his but he put it on the counter and followed dolph out i walked them to the door ill let you know when we get the warrant dolph said could you arrange for me to see peter burkes personal effects why there are only two ways to lose control of a zombie this badly one you are strong enough to raise it but not to control it dominga can control anything she can raise second someone of near equal power interferes sort of a challenge i stared up at dolph john burke might just be strong enough to have done it maybe if im helpful enough to take john down to go over his brothers effectsyou know does any of this look out of place that type of thing maybe this burke will let something slip youve already got dominga salvador pissed at you anita isnt that enough for one week for one lifetime i said but its something we can do while we wait for the warrant dolph nodded yeah ill arrange it call mr burke tomorrow morning and set up a time then call me will do dolph hesitated in the doorway for a moment watch your back always i said zerbrowski leaned into me and said nice penguins he followed dolph down the hallway i knew the next time i saw the rest of the spook squad theyd all know i collected toy penguins my secret was out zerbrowski would spread it far and wide at least he was consistent it was nice to know something was stuffed animals are not meant to be submerged in water the two in the bathtub were ruined maybe spot remover the smell was thick and seemed permanent i put an emergency message on my cleaning services answering machine i didnt give a lot of details didnt want to frighten them off i packed an overnight bag two changes of clothes and one penguin with his tummy freshly scrubbed harold gaynors file and i was set i also packed both guns the firestar in its inner pants holster the browning under my arm a windbreaker hid the browning from view i had extra ammo in the jacket pockets between both guns i had twentytwo bullets twentytwo bullets why didnt i feel safe unlike most walking dead zombies can bear the touch of sunlight they dont like it but they can exist with it dominga could order a zombie to kill me in daylight just as easily as moonlight she wouldnt be able to raise the dead during daylight but if she planned it right she could raise the dead the night before and send it out to get me the next day a voodoo priestess with executive planning skills it would be just my luck i didnt really believe that dominga had backup zombies waiting to jump me but somehow i was feeling paranoid this morning paranoia is just another word for longevity i stepped out into the quiet hallway glancing both ways as if it were a street nothing no walking corpses hiding in the shadows no one but us fraidycats the only sound was the hush of the airconditioning the hallway had that feel to it i came home often enough at dawn to know the quality of silence i thought about that for a minute i knew it was almost dawn not by clock or window but on some level deeper than that some instinct that an ancestor had found while hiding in a dark cave praying for light most people fear the dark in a vague way they fear what might be out there i raise the dead ive slain over a dozen vampires i know whats out there in the dark and i am terrified of it people are supposed to fear the unknown but ignorance is bliss when knowledge is so damn frightening i knew what would have happened to me if i had failed last night if i had been slower or a worse shot two years ago there had been three murders nothing connected them except the method of death they had been torn apart by zombies they had not been eaten normal zombies dont eat anything they may bite a time or two but thats the worst of it there had been the man whose throat was crushed but that had been accidental the zombie just bit down on the nearest body part it happened to be a killing blow blind luck a zombie will normally just wrestle you to pieces like a small boy tearing pieces off of a fly raising a zombie for the purposes of being a murder weapon is an automatic death sentence the court system has gotten rather quick on the draw the last few years a death sentence meant what it said these days especially if your crime was supernatural in some way you didnt burn witches anymore you electrocuted them if we could get proof the state would kill dominga salvador for me john burke too if we could prove he had knowingly caused the zombie to go apeshit the trouble with supernatural crimes is proving them in court most juries arent up on the latest spells and incantations heck neither am i but ive tried explaining zombies and vampires in court before ive learned to keep it simple and to add any gory details the defense will allow me a jury appreciates a little vicarious adventure most testimony is terribly boring or heartbreaking i try to be interesting its a change of pace the parking area was dark stars still glimmered overhead but they were fading like candles in a steady wind i could taste dawn on the air roll it around on my tongue maybe its all the vampire hunting i do but i was more attuned to the passage of light and dark than i had been four years ago i hadnt been able to taste the dawn of course my nightmares were a lot less interesting four years ago you gain something you lose something else its the way life works it was after am when i got in my car and headed out for the nearest hotel i wouldnt be able to stand my apartment until the cleaning crew got the smell out if they could get the smell out my landlord was not going to be pleased if they couldnt he was going to be even less pleased with the bullet holes and shattered window replace the window replaster the walls maybe i really didnt know what you did to repair bullet holes here i was hoping my lease couldnt be challenged in court the first hint of dawn was slipping over the eastern sky a pure white light that spread like ice over the darkness most people think dawn is as colorful as sunset but the first color of dawn is white a pure notcolor that is almost an absence of night there was a motel but all its rooms were on one or two stories some of them awfully isolated i wanted a crowd i settled on the stouffer concourse which wasnt terribly cheap but it would force zombies to ride up in elevators people tended to notice the smell in an elevator the stouffer concourse also had room service at this ungodly hour of dawn i needed room service coffee give me coffee the clerk gave me that wideeyedimtoopolitetosayitoutloud look the elevators were mirrored and i had nothing to do for several floors but look at my reflection blood had dried in a stiff darkness in my hair a stain went down the right side of my face just below the hairline and trailed down my neck i hadnt noticed it in the mirror at home shock will make you forget things it wasnt the bloodstains that had made the clerk look askance unless you knew what to look for you wouldnt know it was blood no the problem was that my skin was deathly pale like clean paper my eyes that are perfectly brown looked black they were huge and dark and strange startled i looked startled surprised to be alive maybe i was still fighting off the edge of shock no matter how together i felt my face told a different story when the shock wore off id be able to sleep until then id read gaynors file the room had two double beds more room than i needed but what the heck i got out clean clothes put the firestar in the drawer of the nightstand and took the browning into the bathroom with me if i was careful and didnt turn the shower on full blast i could fasten the shoulder holster to the towel rack in the back of the stall it wouldnt even get wet though truthfully with most modern guns wet doesnt hurt them as long as you clean them afterwards most guns will shoot underwater i called room service wearing nothing but a towel id almost forgotten i ordered a pot of coffee sugar and cream they asked if i wanted decaf i said no thank you pushy like waiters asking if i wanted a diet coke when i didnt ask for it they never ask men even portly men if they want diet cokes i could drink a pot of caffeine and sleep like a baby it doesnt keep me awake or make me jumpy it just tastes better yes they would leave the cart outside the door no they wouldnt knock they would add the coffee to my bill that was fine i said they had a credit card number when they have plastic people are always eager to add on to your bill as long as the limit holds i propped the straightbacked chair under the doorknob to the hallway if someone forced the door id hear it maybe i locked the bathroom door and had a gun in the shower with me i was as secure as i was going to get there is something about being naked that makes me feel vulnerable i would much rather face bad guys with my clothes on than off i guess everyones like that the bite on my shoulder with its thick bandage was a problem when i wanted to wash my hair i had to get the blood out bandage or no bandage i used their little bottles of shampoo and conditioner they smelled like flowers are supposed to smell but never do blood had dried in patches on my body i looked spotted the water that washed down the drain was pinkish it took the entire bottle of shampoo before my hair was squeaky clean the last rinse water soaked through the bandage on my right shoulder the pain was sharp and persistent id have to remember to get that tetanus booster i scrubbed my body with a washcloth and the munchkin bar of soap when i had washed and soaked every inch of myself and was as clean as i was going to get i stood under the hot needling spray i let the water pour over my back down my body the bandage had soaked through long ago what if we couldnt tie dominga to the zombies what if we couldnt find proof shed try again her pride was at stake now she had set two zombies on me and i had wasted them both with a little help from the police dominga salvador would see it as a personal challenge she had raised a zombie and it had escaped her control completely she would rather have innocent people slaughtered than to admit her mistake and she would rather kill me than have me prove it vindictive bitch seсora salvador had to be stopped if the warrant didnt help then id have to be more practical shed made it clear that it was her or me i preferred it to be her and if necessary id make sure of it i opened my eyes and turned off the water i didnt want to think about it anymore i was talking about murder i saw it as selfdefense but i doubted a jury would itd be damn hard to prove i wanted several things dominga out of the picture dead or in jail to stay alive not to be in jail on a murder charge to catch the killer zombie before it killed again fat chance that to figure out how john burke fit into this mess oh and to keep harold gaynor from forcing me to perform human sacrifice yeah i almost forgot that one it had been a busy week the coffee was outside the door on a little tray i set it inside on the floor locked the door and put the chair against the doorknob again only then did i set the coffee tray on a small table by the curtained windows the browning was already sitting on the table naked the shoulder holster was on the bed i opened the drapes normally i would have kept the drapes closed but today i wanted to see the light morning had spread like a soft haze of light the heat hadnt had time to creep up and strangle that first gentle touch of morning the coffee wasnt bad but it wasnt great either of course the worst coffee ive ever had was still wonderful well maybe not the coffee at police headquarters but even that was better than nothing coffee was my comfort drink better than alcohol i guess i spread gaynors file on the table and started to read by eight that morning earlier than i usually get up i had read every scribbled note gazed at every blurry picture i knew more about mr harold gaynor than i wanted to none of it particularly helpful gaynor was mobconnected but it couldnt be proven he was a selfmade multimillionaire bully for him he could afford the million five that tommy had offered me nice to know a man can pay his bills his only family had been a mother who died ten years ago his father was supposed to have died before he was born there was no record of the fathers death in fact the father didnt seem to exist an illegitimate birth carefully disguised maybe so gaynor was a bastard in the original definition of the word so what id already known he was one in spirit i propped wheelchair wandas picture against the coffeepot she was smiling almost like shed known the picture was being taken maybe she was just photogenic there were two pictures with her and gaynor together in one they were smiling holding hands as tommy pushed gaynors wheelchair and bruno pushed wanda she was gazing at gaynor with a look i had seen in other women adoration love id even experienced it myself for a brief time in college you get over it the second picture was almost identical to the first bruno and tommy pushing them but they werent holding hands gaynor was smiling wanda wasnt she looked angry cicely of the blond hair and empty eyes was walking on the other side of gaynor they were holding hands ahha so gaynor had kept both of them around for a while why had wanda left jealousy had cicely arranged it had gaynor tired of her the only way to know was to ask i stared at the picture with cicely in it i put it beside the laughing closeup of wandas face an unhappy young woman a scorned lover if she hated gaynor more than she feared him wanda would talk to me she would be a fool to talk to the papers but i didnt want to publish her secrets i wanted gaynors secrets so i could keep him from hurting me barring that i wanted something to take to the police mr gaynor would have other things to worry about if i could get him in jail he might forget all about one reluctant animator unless of course he found out id had something to do with him being arrested that would be bad gaynor struck me as vengeful i had dominga salvador mad at me i didnt need anyone else i closed the drapes and left a wakeup call for noon irving would just have to wait for his file i had unintentionally given him the interview with the new master of the city surely that cut me a little slack if not to hell with it i was going to bed the last thing i did before going to bed was call peter burkes house i figured that john would be staying there it rang five times before the machine kicked on this is anita blake i may have some information for john burke on a matter we discussed thursday the message was a little vague but i didnt want to leave a message saying call me about your brothers murder it would have seemed melodramatic and cruel i left the hotels number as well as my own just in case they probably had the ringers turned off i would the story had been front page because peter was had been an animator animators dont get murdered much in the runofthemill muggings its usually something more unusual i would drop off gaynors file on the way home i wanted to drop it off at the receptionist desk i didnt feel like talking to irving about his big interview i didnt want to hear that jeanclaude was charming or had great plans for the city hed be very careful what he told a reporter it would look good in print but i knew the truth vampires are as much a monster as any zombie maybe worse vamps usually volunteer for the process zombies dont just like irving volunteered to go off with jeanclaude of course if irving hadnt been with me the master would have left him alone probably so it was my fault even if it had been his choice i was achingly tired but i knew id never be able to sleep until i heard irvings voice i could pretend id called to tell him i was dropping the file off late i wasnt sure if irving would be on his way to work or not i tried home first he answered on the first ring hello something tight in my stomach relaxed hi irving its me ms blake to what do i owe this early morning pleasure his voice sounded so ordinary i had a bit of excitement at my apartment last night i was hoping i could drop the file off later in the day what sort of excitement his voice had that tell me lilt to it the kind thats police business and not yours i said i thought youd say that he said you just getting to bed yeah i guess i can let a hardworking animator sleep in a little my sister reporter may even understand thanks irving you alright anita no i wanted to say but i didnt i ignored the question did jeanclaude behave himself he was great irvings enthusiasm was genuine all bubbly excitement hes a great interview he was quiet for a moment hey you called to check up on me to make sure i was okay did not i said thanks anita that means a lot but really he was very civilized great ill let you go then have a good day oh i will my editor is doing cartwheels about the exclusive interview with the master of the city i had to laugh at the way he rolled the title off his tongue good night irving get some sleep blake ill be calling you in a day or two about those zombie articles talk to you then i said we hung up irving was fine i should worry more about myself and less about everyone else i turned off the lights and cuddled under the sheets my penguin was cradled in my arms the browning hipower was under my pillow it wasnt as easy to get to as the bed holster at home but it was better than nothing i wasnt sure which was more comforting the penguin or the gun i guess both were equally comforting for very different reasons i said my prayers like a good little girl i asked very sincerely that i not dream the cleaning crew had a cancellation and moved my emergency into the slot by afternoon my apartment was clean and smelled like spring cleaning apartment maintenance had replaced the shattered window the bullet holes had been smeared with white paint the holes looked like little dimples in the wall all in all the place looked great john burke had not returned my call maybe id been too clever id try a more blunt message later but right at this moment i had more pleasant things to worry about i was dressed for jogging dark blue shorts with white piping white nikes with pale blue swishes cute little jogging socks and tank top the shorts were the kind with one of those inside pockets that shut with velcro inside the pocket was a derringer an american derringer to be exact ounces special total length at ounces it felt like a lumpy feather a velcro pocket was not conducive to a fast draw two shots and spitting would be more accurate at a distance but then gaynors men didnt want to kill me hurt me but not kill me they have to get in close to hurt me close enough to use the derringer of course that was just two shots after that i was in trouble i had tried to figure out a way to carry one of my mms but there was no way i could not jog and tote around that much firepower choices choices veronica sims was standing in my living room ronnie is fivenine blond hair grey eyes she is a private investigator on retainer to animators inc we also work out together at least twice a week unless one of us is out of town injured or up to our necks in vampires those last two happen more often than i would like she was wearing frenchcut purple shorts and a tshirt that said outside of a dog a book is mans best friend inside of a dog its too dark to read there are reasons why ronnie and i are friends i missed you thursday at the health club she said was the funeral awful yeah she didnt ask me to elaborate she knows funerals are not my best thing most people hate funerals because of the dead i hate all the emotional shit she was stretching long legs parallel to her body low on the floor in a sort of stretching crouch we always warm up in the apartment most leg stretches were never meant to be done while wearing short shorts i mirrored her movement the muscles in my upper thighs moved and protested the derringer was an uncomfortable but endurable lump just out of curiosity ronnie said why do you feel it necessary to take a gun with you i always carry a gun i said she just looked at me disgust plain in her eyes if you dont want to tell me then dont but dont bullshit me alright alright i said strangely enough no ones told me not to tell anyone what no threats about not going to the police she asked nope my how terribly friendly not friendly i said sitting flat on the floor legs out at angles ronnie mirrored me it looked like we were going to roll a ball across the floor not friendly at all i leaned my upper body over my left leg until my cheek touched my thigh tell me about it she said i did when i was done we were limbered and ready to run shit anita zombies in your apartment and a mad millionaire after you to perform human sacrifices her grey eyes searched my face youre the only person i know who has weirder problems than i do thanks a lot i said i locked my door behind us and put my keys in the pocket along with the derringer i know it would scratch hell out of it but what was i supposed to do run with the keys in my hand harold gaynor i could do some checking on him for you arent you on a case we clattered down the stairs im doing about three different insurance scams mostly surveillance and photography if i have to eat one more fast food dinner im going to start singing jingles i smiled shower and change at my place well go out for a real dinner sounds great but you dont want to keep jeanclaude waiting cut it out ronnie i said she shrugged you should stay as far away from that creature as you can anita i know it it was my turn to shrug agreeing to meet him seemed the lesser of evils what were your choices meeting him voluntarily or being kidnapped and taken to him great choices yeah i opened the double doors that led outside the heat smacked me in the face it was staggeringly hot like stepping into an oven and we were going to jog in this i looked up at ronnie she is five inches taller than i am and most of that is leg we can run together but i have to set the pace and i have to push myself it is a very good workout it has to be over a hundred today i said no pain no gain ronnie said she was carrying a sport water bottle in her left hand we were as prepared as we were going to get four miles in hell i said lets do it we set off at a slow pace but it was steady we usually finished the run in a half hour or less the air was solid with heat it felt like we were running through semisolid walls of scalding air the humidity in st louis is almost always around a hundred percent combine the humidity with hundredplus temperatures and you get a small damp slice of hell st louis in the summertime yippee i do not enjoy exercise slim hips and muscular calves are not incentive enough for this kind of abuse being able to outrun the bad guys is incentive sometimes it all comes down to who is faster stronger quicker i am in the wrong business oh im not complaining but pounds is not a lot of muscle to throw around of course when it comes to vampires i could be twohundredplus of pure human muscles and it wouldnt do me a damn bit of good even the newly dead can bench press cars with one hand so im outclassed ive gotten used to it the first mile was behind us it always hurts the worst my body takes about two miles to be convinced it cant talk me out of this insanity we were moving through an older neighborhood lots of small fenced yards and houses dating to the fifties or even the s there was the smooth brick wall of a warehouse that dated to precivil war it was our halfway point two miles i was feeling loose and muscled like i could run forever if i didnt have to do it very fast i was concentrating on moving my body through the heat keeping the rhythm it was ronnie who spotted the man i dont mean to be an alarmist she said but why is that man just standing there i squinted ahead of us maybe fifteen feet ahead of us the brick wall ended and there was a tall elm tree a man was standing near the trunk of the tree he wasnt trying to conceal himself but he was wearing a jean jacket it was much too hot for that unless you had a gun under it how longs he been there just stepped out from around the tree she said paranoia reigns supreme lets turn back its two miles either way ronnie nodded we pivoted and started jogging back the other way the man behind us did not cry out or say stop paranoia it was a vicious disease a second man stepped out from the far corner of the brick wall we jogged towards him a few more steps i glanced back mr jean jacket was casually walking towards us the jacket was unbuttoned and his hand was reaching under his arm so much for paranoia run i said the second man pulled a gun from his jacket pocket we stopped running it seemed like a good idea at the time unuh the man said i dont feel like chasing anyone in this heat all ya gotta be is alive chickie anything else is gravy the gun was a caliber automatic not much stopping power but it was perfect for wounding theyd thought this out that was scary ronnie was standing very stiff beside me i fought the urge to grab her hand and squeeze it but that wouldnt be very toughasnails vampire slayer would it what do you want thats better he said a pale blue tshirt gapped where his beer gut spilled over his belt but his arms had a beefy look to them he may have been overweight but i bet it hurt when he hit you i hoped i didnt have to test the theory i backed up so the brick wall was to my back ronnie moved with me mr jean jacket was almost with us now he had a beretta mm loose in his right hand it was not meant for wounding i glanced at ronnie then at fatty who was nearly right beside her i glanced at mr jean jacket who was nearly beside me i glanced back at ronnie her eyes widened just a bit she licked her lips once then turned back to stare at fatty the guy with the beretta was mine ronnie got the delegation at its best what do you want i said again i hate repeating myself you to come take a little ride with us thats all fatty smiled as he said it i smiled back then turned to jean jacket and his tame beretta dont you talk i talk he said he took two steps closer to me but his gun was very steadily pointed at my chest i talk real good he touched my hair lightly with his fingertips the beretta was damn near pressed against me if he pulled the trigger now it was all over the dull black barrel of the gun was getting bigger illusion but the longer you stare at a gun the more important it gets to be when youre on the wrong end of it none of that seymour fatty said no pussy and we cant kill her those are the rules shit pete pete alias fatty said you can have the blonde no one said we couldnt have fun with her i did not look at ronnie i stared at seymour i had to be ready if i got that one second chance glancing at my friend to see how she was taking the news of her impending rape was not going to help really phallic power ronnie it always goes to the gonads i said seymour frowned what the hell does that mean it means seymour that i think youre stupid and what brains you have are in your balls i smiled pleasantly while i said it he hit me with the flat of his hand hard i staggered but didnt go down the gun was still steady unwavering shit he made a sound deep in his throat and hit me closed fist i went down for a moment i lay on the gritty sidewalk listening to the blood pound in my ears the slap had stung the closed fist hurt someone kicked me in the ribs leave her alone ronnie screamed i lay on my stomach and pretended to be hurt it wasnt hard i groped for the velcro pocket seymour was waving the beretta in ronnies face she was screaming at him pete had grabbed ronnies arms and was trying to hold her things were getting out of hand goody i stared up at seymours legs and struggled to my knees i shoved the derringer into his groin he froze and stared down at me dont move or ill serve up your balls on a plate i said ronnie drove her elbow back into fattys solar plexus he bent over a little hands going to his stomach she twisted away and kneed him hard in the face blood spurted from his nose he staggered back she smashed him in the side of the face getting all her shoulder and upper body into it he fell down she had the in her hand i fought an urge to yell yea ronnie but it didnt sound tough enough wed do highfives later tell your friend not to move seymour or ill pull this trigger he swallowed loud enough for me to hear it dont move pete okay pete just stared at us ronnie please get seymours gun from him thank you i was still kneeling in the gravel with the derringer pressed into the mans groin he let ronnie take his gun without a fight fancy that ive got this one covered anita ronnie said i didnt glance at her she would do her job i would do mine seymour this is a special two shots it can hold a variety of ammunition or magnum this was a lie the new lightweight version couldnt hold anything higher thans but i was betting seymour couldnt tell the difference fortyfour or and you can kiss the family jewels goodbye twentytwo maybe youll just be very very sore to quote a role model of mine do you feel lucky today what do you want man what do you want his voice was high and squeaky with fear who hired you to come after us he shook his head no man hell kill us threefiftyseven magnum makes a fucking big hole seymour dont tell her shit pete said if he says anything else ronnie shoot his kneecap off i said my pleasure ronnie said i wondered if she would really do it i wondered if id tell her to do it better not to find out talk to me seymour now or i pull the trigger i shoved the gun a little deeper that must have hurt all on its own he sort of tried to tippytoe god please dont who hired you bruno you asshole seymour pete said hell kill us ronnie please shoot him i said you said the kneecap right yeah how about an elbow instead she asked your choice i said youre crazy seymour said yeah i said you remember that what exactly did bruno tell you he said to take you to a building off grand on washington he said to bring you both but we could hurt the blonde to get you to come along give me the address i said seymour did i think he would have told me the secret ingredient in the magic sauce if i had asked if you go down there bruno will know we told ya pete said ronnie i said shoot me now chickie it dont matter you go down there or send the police down there we are dead i glanced at pete he seemed very sincere they were bad guys but okay we wont bust in on him we arent going to the police ronnie asked no if we did that we might as well kill them now but we dont have to do that do we seymour no man no how much of bruno pay you four hundred apiece it wasnt enough i said youre telling me im going to get up now seymour and leave your balls where they are dont come near me or ronnie again or ill tell bruno you sold him out hed kill us man hed kill us slow thats right seymour well just all pretend this never happened right he was nodding vigorously that okay with you pete i asked i aint stupid brunod rip out our hearts and feed them to us we wont talk he sounded disgusted i got up and stepped carefully away from seymour ronnie covered pete nice and steady with the beretta the was tucked into the waistband of her jogging shorts get out of here i said seymours skin was pasty and a sick sweat beaded his face can i have my gun he wasnt very bright dont get cute i said pete stood the blood under his nose had started to dry come on seymour we gotta go now they moved on down the street side by side seymour looked hunched in upon himself as if he were fighting an urge to clutch his equipment ronnie let out a great whoosh of air and leaned back against the wall the gun was still clutched in her right hand my god she said yeah i said she touched my face where seymour had hit me it hurt i winced are you all right ronnie asked sure i said actually it felt like the side of my face was one great big ache but it wouldnt make it hurt any less to say it out loud are we going down to the building where they were to drop us no why not i know who bruno is and who gives him orders i know why they tried to kidnap me what could i possibly learn that would be worth two lives ronnie thought about that for a moment youre right i guess but you arent going to report the attack to the police why should i im okay youre okay seymour and pete wont be back she shrugged you didnt really want me to shoot his kneecap off did you i mean we were playing good cop bad cop right she looked at me very steadily as she asked her solid grey eyes earnest and true i looked away lets walk back home i dont feel much like jogging me either we set off walking down the street ronnie untucked her tshirt and stuck the beretta in the waistband the she sort of cupped in her hand it wasnt very noticeable that way we were pretending right being tough right truth i dont know anita i dont know thats the truth i couldnt have shot him to pieces just to keep him from talking good thing you didnt have to then i said would you really have pulled the trigger on that man there was a cardinal singing somewhere off in the distance the song filled the stale heat and made it seem cooler answer me anita would you really have pulled the trigger yes yes there was a lilt of surprise in her voice yes shit we walked on in silence for a minute or two then she asked what ammo is in the gun today thirtyeights it would have killed him probably i said i saw her look at me sideways as we walked back there was a look id seen before a mixture of horror and admiration id just never seen it on a friends face before that part hurt but we went out to dinner that night at the millers daughter in old st charles the atmosphere was pleasant the food wonderful as always we talked and laughed and had a very good time neither of us mentioned what had happened this afternoon pretend hard enough and maybe it will go away at that night i was down in the vampire district dark blue polo shirt jeans red windbreaker the windbreaker hid the shoulder holster and the browning hipower sweat was pooling in the bends of my arms but it beat the hell out of not having it the afternoon fun and games had turned out all right but that was partly luck and seymour losing his temper and me being able to take a beating and keep on ticking ice had kept the swelling down but the left side of my face was puffy and red as if some sort of fruit was about to burst out of it no bruiseyet the laughing corpse was one of the newest clubs in the district vampires are sexy ill admit that but funny i dont think so apparently i was in the minority a line stretched away from the club curling round the block it hadnt occurred to me that id need a ticket or reservations or whatever just to get in but hey i knew the boss i walked along the line of people towards the ticket booth the people were mostly young the women in dresses the men in dressy sports wear with an occasional suit they were chatting together in excited voices a lot of casual hand and arm touching dates i remember dates its just been a while maybe if i wasnt always ass deep in alligators id date more maybe i cut ahead of a doubledate foursome hey one man said sorry i said the woman in the ticket booth frowned at me you cant just cut in line like that maam maam i dont want a ticket i dont want to see the show i am supposed to meet jeanclaude here thats it well i dont know how do i know youre not some reporter reporter i took a deep breath just call jeanclaude and tell him anita is here okay she was still frowning at me look just call jeanclaude if im a nosy reporter hell deal with me if im who i say i am hell be happy that you called him you cant lose i dont know i fought an urge to scream at her it probably wouldnt help probably just call jeanclaude pretty please i said maybe it was the pretty please she swiveled on her stool and opened the upper half of a door in the back of the booth small booth i couldnt hear what she said but she swiveled back around okay manager says you can go in great thanks i walked up the steps the entire line of waiting people glared at me i could feel their hot stares on my back but ive been stared at by experts so i was careful not to flinch no one likes a line jumper the club was dim inside as most clubs are a guy just inside the door said ticket please i stared up at him he wore a white tshirt that said the laughing corpse its a scream a caricature of an openmouthed vampire was drawn very large across his chest he was large and muscled and had bouncer tattooed across his forehead ticket please he repeated first the ticket lady now the ticket man the manager said i could come through to see jeanclaude i said willie the ticket man said you send her through i turned around and there was willie mccoy i smiled when i saw him i was glad to see him that surprised me im not usually happy to see dead men willie is short thin with black hair slicked back from his forehead i couldnt tell the exact color of his suit in the dimness but it looked like a dull tomatored white buttonup shirt large shiny green tie i had to look twice before i was sure but yes there was a glowinthedark hula girl on his tie it was the most tasteful outfit id ever seen willie wear he grinned flashing a lot of fang anita good to see ya i nodded you too willie really yeah he grinned even wider his canines glistened in the dim light he hadnt been dead a year yet how long have you been manager here i asked bout two weeks congratulations he stepped closer to me i stepped back instinctive nothing personal but a vampire is a vampire dont get too close willie was new dead but he was still capable of hypnotizing with his eyes okay maybe no vampire as new as willie could actually catch me with his eyes but old habits die hard willies face fell a flicker of something in his eyeshurt he dropped his voice but didnt try to step next to me he was a faster study dead than he ever had been alive thanks to me helping you last time im in real good with the boss he sounded like an old gangster movie but that was willie im glad jeanclaudes doing right by you oh yeah willie said this is the best job i ever had and the boss isnt he waggled his hands back and forth ya know mean i nodded i did know i could bitch and complain about jeanclaude all i wanted but compared to most masters of the city he was a pussycat a big dangerous carnivorous pussycat but still it was an improvement the bosss busy right this minute willie said he said if you was to come early to give ya a table near the stage great aloud i said how long will jeanclaude be willie shrugged dont know for sure i nodded okay ill wait for a little while willie grinned fangs flashing ya want me to tell jeanclaude to hurry it up would you he grimaced like hed swallowed a bug hell no dont sweat it if i get tired of waiting ill tell him myself willie looked at me sorta sideways youd do it wouldnt you yeah he just shook his head and started leading me between the small round tables every table was thick with people laughing gasping drinking holding hands the sensation of being surrounded by thick sweaty life was nearly overwhelming i glanced at willie did he feel it did the warm press of humanity make his stomach knot with hunger did he go home at night and dream of ripping into the loud roaring crowd i almost asked him but i liked willie as much as i could like a vampire i did not want to know if the answer was yes a table just one row back from the stage was empty there was a big white cardboard foldy thing that said reserved willie tried to hold my chair for me i waved him back it wasnt womens liberation i simply never understood what i was supposed to do while the guy shoved my chair in under me did i sit there and watch him strain to scoot the chair with me in it embarrassing i usually hovered just above the chair and got it shoved into the backs of my knees hell with it would you like a drink while ya wait willie asked could i have a coke nuthin stronger i shook my head willie walked away through the tables and the people on the stage was a slender man with short dark hair he was thin all over his face almost cadaverous but he was definitely human his appearance was more comical than anything like a longlimbed clown beside him staring blankfaced out at the crowd was a zombie its pale eyes were still clear humanlooking but he didnt blink that familiar frozen stare gazed out at the audience they were only half listening to the jokes most eyes were on the standing deadman he was just decayed enough around the edges to look scary but even one row away there was no hint of odor nice trick if you could manage it ernie here is the best roommate i ever had the comedian said he doesnt eat much doesnt talk my ear off doesnt bring cute chicks home and lock me out while they have a good time nervous laughter from the audience eyes glued on of ernie though there was that pork chop in the fridge that went bad ernie seemed to like that a lot the zombie turned slowly almost painfully to stare at the comedian the mans eyes flickered to the zombie then back to the audience smile in place the zombie kept staring at him the man didnt seem to like it much i didnt blame him even the dead dont like to be the butt of jokes the jokes werent that funny anyway it was a novelty act the zombie was the act pretty inventive and pretty sick willie came back with my coke the manager waiting on my table ladeda of course the reserved table was pretty good too willie set the drink down on one of those useless paper lace dollies enjoy he said he turned to leave but i touched his arm i wish i hadnt the arm was solid enough real enough but it was like touching wood it was dead i dont know what else to call it there was no feeling of movement nothing i dropped his arm slowly and looked up at him meeting his eyes thanks to jeanclaudes marks those brown eyes held something like sorrow i could suddenly hear my heartbeat in my ears and i had to swallow to calm my own pulse shit i wanted willie to go away now i turned away from him and looked very hard at my drink he left maybe it was just the sound of all the laughing but i couldnt hear willie walk away willie mccoy was the only vampire i had ever known before he died i remembered him alive he had been a smalltime hood an errand boy for bigger fish maybe willie thought being a vampire would make him a big fish hed been wrong there he was just a little undead fish now jeanclaude or someone like him would run willies life for eternity poor willie i rubbed the hand that had touched him on my leg i wanted to forget the feel of his body under the new tomatored suit but i couldnt jeanclaudes body didnt feel that way of course jeanclaude could damn near pass for human some of the old ones could do that willie would learn god help him zombies are better than dogs theyll fetch your slippers and dont need to be walked ernell even sit at my feet and beg if i tell him to the audience laughed i wasnt sure why it wasnt that genuine haha laughter it was that outrageous shocked sound the icantbelievehesaidthat laughter the zombie was moving toward the comedian in a sort of slowmotion jerk crumbling hands reached outward and my stomach squeezed tight it was a flashback to last night zombies almost always attack by just reaching out just like in the movies the comedian didnt realize that ernie had decided hed had enough if a zombie is simply raised without any particular orders he usually reverts to what is normal for him a good person is a good person until his brain decays stripping him of personality most zombies wont kill without orders but every once in a while you get lucky and raise one that has homicidal tendencies the comedian was about to get lucky the zombie walked towards him like a bad frankenstein monster the comedian finally realized something was wrong he stopped in midjoke turning eyes wide ernie he said it was as far as he got the decaying hands wrapped around his throat and started to squeeze for one pleasant second i almost let the zombie do him in exploiting the dead is one thing i feel strongly about but stupidity isnt punishable by death if it was there would be a hell of a population drop i stood up glancing around the club to see if they had planned for this eventuality willie came running to the stage he wrapped his arms around the zombies waist and pulled lifted the much taller body off its feet but the hands kept squeezing the comedian slipped to his knees making little argh sounds his face was going from red to purple the audience was laughing they thought it was part of the show it was a heck of a lot funnier than the act i stepped up to the stage and said softly to willie need some help he stared at me still clinging to the zombies waist with his extraordinary strength willie could have ripped a finger at a time off the mans neck and probably saved him but supervampire strength doesnt help you if you dont think how to use it willie never thought of course the zombie might crush the mans windpipe before even a vampire could peel its fingers away maybe best not to find out i thought the comedian was a putz but i couldnt stand there and watch him die really i couldnt stop i said low and for the zombies ears he stopped squeezing but his hands were still tight the comedian was going limp release him the zombie let go the man fell in a near faint on the stage willie straightened up from his frantic tugging at the deadman he smoothed his tomatored suit back into place his hair was still perfectly slick too much hairgoop for a mere zombie wrestling to displace his hairdo thanks he whispered then he stood to his full five feet four and said the amazing albert and his pet zombie ladies and gentlemen the audience had been a bit uncertain but the applause began when the amazing albert staggered to his feet the applause exploded he croaked into the microphone ernie thinks its time to go home now youve been a great audience the applause was loud and genuine the comedian left the stage the zombie stayed and stared at me waiting waiting for another order i dont know why everyone cant speak and have zombies obey them it doesnt even feel like magic to me there is no tingle of the skin no breath of power i speak and the zombies listen me and e f hutton follow albert and obey his orders until i tell you otherwise the zombie looked down at me for a second then turned slowly and shuffled after the man the zombie wouldnt kill him now i wouldnt tell the comedian that though let him think his life was in danger let him think he had to let me lay the zombie to rest it was what i wanted it was probably what the zombie wanted ernie certainly didnt seem to like being the straight man in a comedy routine hecklers are one thing choking the comic to death is a little extreme willie escorted me back to my table i sat down and sipped my coke he sat down across from me he looked shaken his small hands trembled as he sat across from me he was a vampire but he was still willie mccoy i wondered how many years it would take for the last remnants of his personality to disappear ten years twenty a century how long before the monster ate the man if it took that long it wouldnt be my problem i wouldnt be there to see it to tell the truth i didnt want to see it i never liked zombies willie said i stared at him are you afraid of zombies his eyes flickered to me then down to the table no i grinned at him youre afraid of zombies youre phobic he leaned across the table dont tell please dont tell there was real fear in his eyes who would i tell you know i shook my head i dont know what youre talking about willie the master you could hear master was in all caps why would i tell jeanclaude he was whispering now a new comedian had come up on stage there was laughter and noise and still he whispered youre his human servant whether you like it or not when we speak to you he tells us were speaking to him we were leaning almost facetoface now the gentle brush of his breath smelled like breath mints almost all vampires smell like breath mints i dont know what they did before mints were invented had stinky breath i guess you know im not his human servant but he wants you to be just because jeanclaude wants something doesnt mean he gets it i said you dont know what hes like i think i do he touched my arm i didnt jerk back this time i was too intent on what he was saying hes been different since the old master died hes a lot more powerful than even you know this much i had suspected so why shouldnt i tell him youre afraid of zombies hell use it to punish me i stared at him our eyes inches apart you mean hes torturing people to control them he nodded shit you wont tell i wont tell promise i said he looked so relieved i patted his hand the hand felt like a hand his body didnt feel wood hard anymore why i didnt know and if i asked willie he probably wouldnt know either one of the mysteries of death thanks i thought you said that jeanclaude was the kindest master youve ever had he is willie said now that was a frightening truth if being tormented by your darkest fear was the kindest how much worse had nikolaos been hell i knew the answer to that one shed been psychotic jeanclaude wasnt cruel just for the sake of watching people squirm there was reason to his cruelty it was a step up i gotta go thanks for helping with the zombie he stood you were brave you know i said he flashed a grin my way fangs glinting in the dim light the smile vanished from his face like someone had turned a switch i cant afford to be anything else vampires are a lot like wolf packs the weak are either dominated or destroyed banishment is not an option willie was moving up in the ranks a sign of weakness could stop that rise or worse id often wondered what vampires feared one of them feared zombies it would have been funny if i hadnt seen the fear in his eyes the comic on stage was a vampire he was the new dead skin chalkwhite eyes like burned holes in paper his gums were bloodless and receding from canines that would have been the envy of any german shepherd i had never seen a vampire look so monstrous they all usually made an effort to appear human this one wasnt i had missed the audiences reaction to his first appearance but now they were laughing if i had thought the zombie jokes were bad these were worse a woman at the next table laughed so hard tears spilled down her cheeks i went to new york tough city a gang jumped me but i put the bite on them people were holding their ribs as if in pain i didnt get it it was genuinely not funny i gazed around the crowd and found every eye fixed on the stage they peered up at him with the helpless devotion of the bespelled he was using mind tricks id seen vampires seduce threaten terrify all by concentrating but i had never seen them cause laughter he was forcing them to laugh it wasnt the worst abuse of vampiric powers id ever seen he wasnt trying to hurt them and this mass hypnosis was harmless temporary but it was wrong mass mind control was one of the top scary things that most people dont know vampires can do i knew and i didnt like it he was the fresh dead and even before jeanclaudes marks the comic couldnt have touched me being an animator gave you partial immunity to vampires it was one of the reasons that animators are so often vampire slayers weve got a leg up so to speak i had called charles earlier but i still didnt see him he is not easy to miss in a crowd sort of like godzilla going through tokyo where was he and when would jeanclaude be ready to see me it was now after eleven trust him to browbeat me into a meeting and then make me wait he was such an arrogant son of a bitch charles came through the swinging doors that led to the kitchen area he strode through the tables heading for the door he was shaking his head and murmuring to a small asian man who was having to quickrun to keep up i waved and charles changed direction towards me i could hear the smaller man arguing i run a very good clean kitchen charles murmured something that i couldnt hear the bespelled audience was oblivious we could have shot off a twentyonegun salute and they wouldnt have flinched until the vampire comic was finished they would hear nothing else what are you the damn health department the smaller man asked he was dressed in a traditional chefs outfit he had the big floppy hat wadded up in his hands his dark uptilted eyes were sparkling with anger charles is only sixone but he seems bigger his body is one wide piece from broad shoulders to feet he seems to have no waist he is like a moving mountain huge his perfectly brown eyes are the same color as his skin wonderfully dark his hand is big enough to cover my face the asian chef looked like an angry puppy beside charles he grabbed charless arm i dont know what he thought he was going to do but charles stopped moving he stared down at the offending hand and said very carefully voice almost painfully deep do not touch me the chef dropped his arm like hed been burned he took a step back charles was only giving him part of the look the full treatment had been known to send wouldbe muggers screaming for help part of the look was enough for one irate chef his voice was calm reasonable when he spoke again i run a clean kitchen charles shook his head you cant have zombies near the food preparation its illegal the health codes forbid corpses near food my assistant is a vampire hes dead charles rolled his eyes at me i sympathized id had the same discussion with a chef or two vampires are not considered legally dead anymore mr kim zombies are i dont understand why zombies rot and carry disease just like any dead body just because they move around doesnt mean they arent a depository for disease i dont either keep the zombies away from the kitchen or we will close you down do you understand that and youd have to explain to the owner why his business was not making money i said smiling up at both of them the chef looked a bit pale fancy that i i understand it will be taken care of good charles said the chef darted one frightened look at me then began to thread his way back to the kitchen it was funny how jeanclaude was beginning to scare so many people hed been one of the more civilized vampires before he became head bloodsucker power corrupts charles sat down across from me he seemed too big for the table i got your message whats going on i need an escort to the tenderloin its hard to tell when charles blushes but he squirmed in his chair why in the world do you want to go down there i need to find someone who works down there who a prostitute i said he squirmed again it was like watching an uncomfortable mountain caroline is not going to like this dont tell her i said you know caroline and i dont lie to each other about anything i fought to keep my face neutral if charles had to explain his every move to his wife that was his choice he didnt have to let caroline control him he chose to do it but it grated on me like having your teeth cleaned just tell her that you had extra animator business she wont ask details caroline thought that our job was gross beheading chickens raising zombies how uncouth why do you need to find this prostitute i ignored the question and answered another one the less charles knew about harold gaynor the safer hed be i just need someone to look menacing i dont want to have to shoot some poor slob because he made a pass at me okay charles nodded ill come im flattered you asked i smiled encouragingly at him truth was that manny was more dangerous and much better backup but manny was like me he didnt look dangerous charles did i needed a good bluff tonight not firepower i glanced at my watch it was almost midnight jeanclaude had kept me waiting an hour i looked behind me and caught willies gaze he came towards me immediately i would try to use this power only for good he bent close but not too close he glanced at charles acknowledging him with a nod charles nodded back mr stoic what ya want willie said is jeanclaude ready to see me or not yeah i was just coming to get ya i didnt know you was expecting company tonight he looked at charles hes a coworker a zombie raiser willie asked charles said yes his dark face was impassive his look was quietly menacing willie seemed impressed he nodded sure ya got zombie work after you see jeanclaude yeah i said i stood and spoke softly to charles though chances were that willie would hear it even the newly dead hear better than most dogs ill be as quick as i can alright he said but i need to get home soon i understood he was on a short leash his own fault but it seemed to bother me more than it bothered charles maybe it was one of the reasons im not married im not big on compromise willie led me through a door and a short hallway as soon as the door closed behind us the noise was muted distant as a dream the lights were bright after the dimness of the club i blinked against it willie looked rosy cheeked in the bright light not quite alive but healthy for a deadman hed fed tonight on something or someone maybe a willing human maybe animal maybe the first door on the left said managers office willies office naw willie opened the door and ushered me in he didnt come in the office his eyes flicked towards the desk then he backed out shutting the door behind him the carpeting was pale beige the walls eggshellwhite a large blacklacquered desk sat against the far wall a shiny black lamp seemed to grow out of the desk there was a blotter perfectly placed in the center of the desk there were no papers no paper clips just jeanclaude sitting behind the desk his long pale hands were folded on the blotter soft curling black hair midnightblue eyes white shirt with its strange buttondown cuffs he was perfect sitting there perfectly still like a painting beautiful as a wet dream but not real he only looked perfect i knew better there were two brown metal filing cabinets against the left wall a black leather couch took up the rest of the wall there was a large oil painting above the couch it was a scene of st louis in the s settlers coming downriver in flatboats the sunlight was autumn thick children ran and played it didnt match anything in the room the picture yours i asked he gave a slight nod did you know the painter he smiled then no hint of fangs just the beautiful spread of lips if there had been a vampire gq jeanclaude would have been their cover boy the desk and couch dont match the rest of the decor i said i am in the midst of remodeling he said he just sat there looking at me you asked for this meeting jeanclaude lets get on with it are you in a hurry his voice had dropped lower the brush of fur on naked skin yes i am so cut to the chase what do you want the smile widened slightly he actually lowered his eyes for a moment it was almost coy you are my human servant anita he used my name bad sign that no i said im not you bear two marks only two more remain his face still looked pleasant lovely the expression didnt match what he was saying so what he sighed anita he stopped in midsentence and stood he came around the desk do you know what it means to be master of the city he leaned on the desk half sitting his shirt gaped open showing an expanse of pale chest one nipple showed small and pale and hard the crossshaped scar was an insult to such pale perfection i had been staring at his bare chest how embarrassing i met his gaze and managed not to blush bully for me there are other benefits to being my human servant ma petite his eyes were all pupil black and drowning deep i shook my head no no lies ma petite i can feel your desire his tongue flicked across his lips i can taste it great just great how do you argue with someone who can feel what youre feeling answer dont argue agree alright i lust after you does that make you happy he smiled yes one word but it flowed through my mind whispering things that he had not said whispers in the dark i lust after a lot of men but that doesnt mean i have to sleep with them his face was almost slack eyes like drowning pools casual lust is easily defeated he said he stood in one smooth motion what we have is not casual ma petite not lust but desire he moved towards me one pale hand outstretched my heart was thudding in my throat it wasnt fear i didnt think it was a mind trick it felt real desire he called it maybe it was dont my voice was hoarse a whisper he of course did not stop his fingers traced the edge of my cheek barely touching the brush of skin on skin i stepped away from him forced to draw a deep shaking breath i could be as uncool as i wanted he could feel my discomfort no sense pretending i could feel where he had touched me a lingering sensation i looked at the ground while i spoke i appreciate the possible fringe benefits jeanclaude really but i cant i wont i met his eyes his face was a terrible blankness nothing it was the same face of a moment ago but some spark of humanity of life was gone my pulse started thudding again it had nothing to do with sex fear it had a lot to do with fear as you like my little animator whether we are lovers or not it does not change what you are to me you are my human servant no i said you are mine anita willing or not you are mine see jeanclaude heres where you lose me first you try seducing me which has its pleasant side when that doesnt work you resort to threats it is not a threat ma petite it is the truth no it isnt and stop calling me ma fucking petite he smiled at that i didnt want him amused by me anger replaced fear in a quick warm rush i liked anger it made me brave and stupid fuck you i have already offered that his voice made something low jerk in my stomach i felt the rush of heat as i blushed damn you jeanclaude damn you we need to talk ma petite lovers or not servant or not we need to talk then talk i havent got all night he sighed you dont make this easy if it was easy you wanted you should have picked on someone else he nodded very true please be seated he went back to lean on the desk arms crossed over his chest i dont have that kind of time i said he frowned slightly i thought we agreed to talk this out ma petite we agreed to meet at eleven youre the one who wasted an hour not me his smile was almost bitter very well i will give you a condensed version i nodded fine with me i am the new master of the city but to survive with nikolaos alive i had to hide my powers i did it too well there are those who think i am not powerful enough to be the master of all they are challenging me one of the things they are using against me is you how your disobedience i cannot even control my own human servant how can i possibly control all the vampires in the city and surrounding areas what do you want from me he smiled then wide and genuine flashing fangs i want you to be my human servant not in this lifetime jeanclaude i can force the third mark on you anita there was no threat as he said it it was just a fact i would rather die than be your human servant master vampires can smell the truth he would know i meant it why i opened my mouth to try to explain but didnt he would not understand we stood two feet apart but it might have been miles miles across some dark chasm we could not bridge that gap he was a walking corpse whatever he had been as a living man it was gone he was the master of the city and that was nothing even close to human if you force this issue i will kill you i said you mean that there was surprise in his voice it isnt often a girl gets to surprise a centuriesold vampire yes i do not understand you ma petite i know i said could you pretend to be my servant it was an odd question what does pretending mean you come to a few meetings you stand at my side with your guns and your reputation you want the executioner at your back i stared at him for a space of heartbeats the true horror of what hed just said floated slowly through my mind i thought the two marks were accident that you panicked you meant all along to mark me didnt you he just smiled answer me you son of a bitch if the chance arose i was not averse to it not averse to it i was almost yelling you coldbloodedly chose me to be your human servant why you are the executioner damn you what does that mean it is impressive to be the vampire who finally caught you you havent caught me if you would behave yourself the others would think so only you and i need know that it is pretense i shook my head i wont play your game jeanclaude you will not help me you got it i offer you immortality without the compromise of vampirism i offer you myself there have been women over the years who would have done anything i asked just for that sex is sex jeanclaude no ones that good he smiled slightly vampires are different ma petite if you were not so stubborn you might find out how different i had to look away from his eyes the look was too intimate too full of possibilities theres only one thing i want from you i said and what is that ma petite all right two things first stop calling me ma petite second let me go wipe these damn marks away you may have the first request anita and the second i cannot even if i wanted to which you dont i said which i dont stay away from me jeanclaude stay the fuck away from me or ill kill you many people have tried through the years how many of them had eighteen kills his eyes widened just a bit none there was this man in hungary who swore he killed five what happened to him i tore his throat out you understand this jeanclaude i would rather have my throat torn out i would rather die trying to kill you than submit to you i stared at him trying to see if he understood any of what i said say something i have heard your words i know you mean them he was suddenly standing in front of me i hadnt seen him move hadnt felt him in my head he was just suddenly inches in front of me i think i gasped could you truly kill me his voice was like silk on a wound gentle with an edge of pain like sex it was like velvet rubbing inside my skull it felt good even with fear tearing through my body shit he could still have me still take me down no way i looked up into his soblue eyes and said yes i meant it he blinked once gracefully and stepped back you are the most stubborn woman i have ever met he said there was no play in his voice this time it was a flat statement thats the nicest compliment youve ever paid me he stood in front of me hands at his sides he stood very still snakes or birds can stand utterly still but even a snake has a sense of aliveness of action waiting to resume jeanclaude stood there with no sense of anything as if despite what my eyes told me he had vanished he was not there at all the dead make no noise what happened to your face i touched the swollen cheek before i could stop myself nothing i lied who hit you why so you can go beat him up one of the fringe benefits of being my servant is my protection i dont need your protection jeanclaude he hurt you and i shoved a gun into his groin and made him tell me everything he knew i said jeanclaude smiled you did what i shoved a gun into his balls alright his eyes started to sparkle laughter spread across his face and burst out between his lips he laughed fullthroated the laugh was like candy sweet and infectious if you could bottle jeanclaudes laugh i know it would be fattening or orgasmic ma petite ma petite you are absolutely marvelous i stared at him letting that wonderful touchable laugh roll around me it was time to go it is very hard to be dignified when someone is laughing uproariously at you but i managed my parting shot made him laugh harder stop calling me ma petite i stepped back out into the noise of the club charles was standing beside the table not sitting he looked uncomfortable from a distance what had gone wrong now his big hands were twisted together dark face scrunched up into near pain a kind god had made charles look big and bad because inside he was all marshmallow if id had charless natural size and strength id have been a guaranteed bad ass it was sort of sad and unfair whats wrong i asked i called caroline he said and the babysitters sick and carolines been called in to the hospital someone has to stay with sam while she goes to work mmhuh i said he didnt look the least bit tough when he said can going down to the tenderloin wait until tomorrow i shook my head youre not going to go down there alone charles said are you i stared up at the great mountain of a man and sighed i cant wait charles but the tenderloin he lowered his voice as if just saying the word too loud would bring a cloud of pimps and prostitutes to descend upon us you cant go down there alone at night ive gone worse places charles ill be all right no i wont let you go alone caroline can just get a new sitter or tell the hospital no he smiled when he said it always happy to help a friend caroline would give him hell for it worst of all now i didnt want to take charles with me you had to do more than look tough what if gaynor got wind of me questioning wanda what if he found charles and thought he was involved no it had been selfish to risk charles he had a fouryearold son and a wife harold gaynor would eat charles raw for dinner i couldnt involve him he was a big friendly eagertoplease bear a lovable cuddly bear i didnt need a teddy bear for backup i needed someone who would be able to take any heat that gaynor might send our way i had an idea go home charles i wont go alone i promise he looked uncertain like maybe he didnt trust me fancy that anita are you sure i wont leave you hanging like this go on charles ill take backup who can you get at this hour no questions go home to your son he looked uncertain but relieved he hadnt really wanted to go to the tenderloin maybe carolines short leash was what charles wanted needed an excuse for all the things he really didnt want to do what a basis for a marriage but hey if it works dont fix it charles left with many apologies but i knew he was glad to go i would remember that he had been glad to go i knocked on the office door there was a silence then come in anita how had he known it was me i wouldnt ask i didnt want to know jeanclaude seemed to be checking figures in a large ledger it looked antique with yellowed pages and fading ink the ledger looked like something bob crachit should have been scribbling in on a cold christmas eve what have i done to merit two visits in one night he said looking at him now i felt silly i spent all this time avoiding him now i was going to invite him to accompany me on a bit of sleuthing but it would kill two bats with one stone it would please jeanclaude and i really didnt want him angry with me if i could avoid it and if gaynor did try to go up against jeanclaude i was betting on jeanclaude it was what jeanclaude had done to me a few weeks ago he had chosen me as the vampires champion put me up against a monster that had slain three master vampires and he had bet that i would come out on top against nikolaos i had but just barely what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander i smiled sweetly at him pleased to be able to return the favor so quickly would you care to accompany me to the tenderloin he blinked surprise covering his face just like a real person to what purpose i need to question a prostitute about a case im working on i need backup backup he asked i need backup that looks more threatening than i do you fit the bill he smiled beatifically i would be your bodyguard youve given me enough grief do something nice for a change the smile vanished why this sudden change of heart ma petite my backup had to go home and babysit his kid and if i do not go ill go alone i said into the tenderloin yep he was suddenly standing by the desk walking towards me i hadnt seen him rise i wish youd stop doing that doing what clouding my mind so i cant see you move i do it as often as i can ma petite just to prove i still can whats that supposed to mean i gave up much of my power over you when i gave you the marks i practice what little games are left me he was standing almost in front of me lest you forget who and what i am i stared up into his blue blue eyes i never forget that you are the walking dead jeanclaude an expression i could not read passed over his face it might have been pain no i see the knowledge in your eyes of what i am his voice dropped low almost a whisper but it wasnt seductive it was human your eyes are the clearest mirror i have ever seen ma petite whenever i begin to pretend to myself whenever i have delusions of life i have only to look into your face and see the truth what did he expect me to say sorry ill try to ignore the fact that youre a vampire so why keep me around i asked perhaps if nikolaos had had such a mirror she would not have been such a monster i stared at him he might be right it made his choice of me as human servant almost noble almost oh hell i would not start feeling sorry for the freaking master of the city not now not ever we would go down to the tenderloin pimps beware i was bringing the master as backup it was like carrying a thermonuclear device to kill ants overkill has always been a specialty of mine the tenderloin was originally the red light district on the riverfront in the s but the tenderloin like so much of st louis moved uptown go down washington past the fox theater where you can see broadway traveling companies sing bright musical keep driving down washington to the west edge of downtown st louis and you will come to the resurrected carcass of the tenderloin the night streets are neoncoated sparkling flashing pulsingcolors it looks like some sort of pornographic carnival all it needs is a ferris wheel in one of the empty lots they could sell cotton candy shaped like naked people the kiddies could play while daddy went to get his jollies mom would never have to know jeanclaude sat beside me in the car he had been utterly silent on the drive over i had had to glance at him a time or two just to make sure he was still there people make noise i dont mean talking or belching or anything overt but people as a rule cant just sit without making noise they fidget the sound of cloth rubbing against the seats they breathe the soft intake of air they wet their lips wet quiet but noise jeanclaude didnt do any of these things as we drove i couldnt even swear he blinked the living dead yippee i can take silence as good as the next guy better than most women and a lot of men now i needed to fill the silence talk just for the noise a waste of energy but i needed it are you in there jeanclaude his neck turned bringing his head with it his eyes glittered reflecting the neon signs like dark glass shit you can play human jeanclaude better than almost any vampire ive ever met whats all this supernatural crap crap he said voice soft yeah why are you going all spooky on me spooky he asked and the sound filled the car as if the word meant something else entirely stop that i said stop what answering every question with a question he blinked once so sorry ma petite but i can feel the street feel the street what does that mean he settled back against the upholstery leaning his head and neck into the seat his hand clasped over his stomach there is a great deal of life here life he had me doing it now yes he said i can feel them running back and forth little creatures desperately seeking love pain acceptance greed a lot of greed here too but mostly pain and love you dont come to a prostitute for love you come for sex he rolled his head so his dark eyes stared at me many people confuse the two i stared at the road the hairs at the back of my neck were standing at attention you havent fed yet tonight have you you are the vampire expert can you not tell his voice had dropped to almost a whisper hoarse and thick you know i can never tell with you a compliment to my powers im sure i did not bring you down here to hunt i said my voice sounded firm a tad loud my heart was loud inside my head would you forbid me to hunt tonight he asked i thought about that one for a minute or two we were going to have to turn around and make another pass to find a parking space would i forbid him to hunt tonight yes he knew the answer this was a trick question trouble was i couldnt see the trick i would ask that you not hunt here tonight i said give me a reason anita he had called me anita without me prompting him he was definitely after something because i brought you down here you wouldnt have hunted here if it hadnt been for me you feel guilt for whomever i might feed on tonight it is illegal to take unwilling human victims i said so it is the penalty for doing so is death i said by your hand if you do it in this state yes they are just whores pimps cheating men what do they matter to you anita i dont think he had ever called me anita twice in a row it was a bad sign a car pulled away not a block from the grey cat club what luck i slid my nova into the slot parallel parking is not my best thing but luckily the car that pulled away was twice the size of my car there was plenty of room to maneuver back and forth from the curb when the car was lurched nearly onto the curb but safely out of traffic i cut the engine jeanclaude lay back in his seat staring at me i asked you a question ma petite what do these people mean to you i undid my seat belt and turned to look at him some trick of light and shadow had put most of his body in darkness a band of nearly gold light lay across his face his high cheekbones were very prominent against his pale skin the tips of his fangs showed between his lips his eyes gleamed like blue neon i looked away and stared at the steering wheel while i talked i have no personal stake in these people jeanclaude but they are people good bad or indifferent they are alive and no one has the right to just arbitrarily snuff them out so it is the sanctity of life you cling to i nodded that and the fact that every human being is special every death is a loss of something precious and irreplaceable i looked at him as i finished the last you have killed before anita you have destroyed that which is irreplaceable im irreplaceable too i said no one has the right to kill me either he sat up in one liquid motion and reality seemed to collect around him i could almost feel the movement of time in the car like a sonic boom for the inside of my head instead of my ear jeanclaude sat there looking entirely human his pale skin had a certain flush to it his curling black hair carefully combed and styled was rich and touchable his eyes were just midnightblue nothing exceptional but the color he was human again in the blink of an eye jesus i whispered what is wrong ma petite i shook my head if i asked how he did it hed just smile why all the questions jeanclaude why the worry about s my view of life you are my human servant he raised a hand to stop the automatic objection i have begun the process of making you my human servant and i would like to understand you better cant you just scent my emotions like you can the people on the street no ma petite i can feel your desire but little else i gave that up when i made you my marked servant you cant read me no that was really nice to know jeanclaude didnt have to tell me so why did he he never gave anything away for free there were strings attached that i couldnt even see i s shook my head you are just to back me up tonight dont s do anything to anybody unless i say so okay do anything dont hurt anyone unless they try to hurt us he nodded face very solemn why did i suspect that he was laughing at me in some dark corner of his mind giving orders to the master of the city i guess it was funny the noise level on the sidewalk was intense music blared out of every other building never the same song but always loud the flashing signs proclaimed girls girls girls topless a pinkedged sign read talk to the naked woman of your dreams eeek a tall thin black woman came up to us she was wearing purple shorts so short that they looked like a thong bikini black fishnet panty hose covered her legs and buttocks provocative she stopped somewhere between the two of us her eyes flicked from one to the other which one of ya does it and which one of ya watches jeanclaude and i exchanged glances he was smiling ever so slightly sorry we were looking for wanda i said a lot of names down here she said i can do anything this wanda can do and do it better she stepped very close to jeanclaude almost touching he took her hand in his and lifted it gently to his lips his eyes watched me as he did it youre the doer she said her voice had gone throaty sexy or maybe that was just the effect jeanclaude had on women maybe the woman cuddled in against him her skin looked very dark against the white lace of his shirt her fingernails were painted a bright pink like easter basket grass sorry to interrupt i said but we dont have all night this is not the one you seek then he said no i said he gripped her arms just above the elbows and pushed her away she struggled just a bit to reach him again her hands grabbed at his arms trying to pull herself closer to him he held her straightarmed effortlessly he could have held a semitruck effortlessly ill do you for free she said what did you do to her i asked nothing i didnt believe him nothing and she offers to do you for free sarcasm is one of my natural talents i made sure that jeanclaude heard it be still he said dont tell me to shut up the woman was standing perfectly still her hands dropped to her sides limp he hadnt been talking to me at all jeanclaude took his hands away from her she never moved he stepped around her like she was a crack in the pavement he took my arm and i let him i watched the prostitute waiting for her to move her straight nearly naked back shuddered her shoulders slumped she threw back her head and drew a deep trembling breath jeanclaude pulled me gently down the street his hand on my elbow the prostitute turned around saw us her eyes never even hesitated she didnt know us i swallowed hard enough for it to hurt i pulled free of jeanclaudes hand he didnt fight me good for him i backed up against a storefront window jeanclaude stood in front of me looking down what did you do to her i told you ma petite nothing dont call me that i saw her jeanclaude dont lie to me a pair of men stopped beside us to look in the window they were holding hands i glanced in the window and felt color creep up my cheeks there were whips leather masks padded handcuffs and things i didnt even have a name for one of the men leaned into the other and whispered the other man laughed one of them caught me looking our eyes met and i looked away fast eye contact down here was a dangerous thing i was blushing and hating it the two men walked away hand in hand jeanclaude was staring in the window like he was out for a saturday afternoon of windowshopping casual what did you do to that woman he stared in the storefront i couldnt tell exactly what had caught his attention it was careless of me ma anita my fault entirely what was your fault my powers are greater when my human servant is with me he stared at me then his gaze solid on my face with you beside me my powers are enhanced wait you mean like a witchs familiar he cocked his head to one side a slight smile on his face yes very close to that i did not know you knew anything about witchcraft a deprived childhood i said i was not going to be diverted from the important topic so your ability to bespell people with your eyes is stronger when im with you strong enough that without trying you bespelled that prostitute he nodded i shook my head no i dont believe you he shrugged a graceful gesture on him believe what you like ma petite it is the truth i didnt want to believe it because if it were true then i was in fact his human servant not in my actions but by my very presence with sweat trickling down my spine from the heat i was cold shit i said you could say that he said no i cant deal with this right now i cant i stared up at him you keep whatever powers we have between us in check okay i will try he said dont try dammit do it he smiled wide enough to flash the tips of his fangs of course ma petite panic was starting in the pit of my stomach i gripped my hands into fists at my sides if you call me that one more time im going to hit you his eyes widened just a bit his lips flexed i realized he was trying not to laugh i hate it when people find my threats amusing he was an invasive son of a bitch and i wanted to hurt him to hurt him because he scared me i understand the urge ive had it before with other people its an urge that can lead to violence i stared up at his softly amused face he was a condescending bastard but if it ever came to real violence between us one of us would die chances were good it would be me the humor leaked out of his face leaving it smooth and lovely and arrogant what is it anita his voice was soft and intimate even in the heat and movement of this place his voice could roll me up and under it was a gift dont push me into a corner jeanclaude you dont want to take away all my options i dont know what you mean he said if it comes down to you or me im going to pick me you remember that he looked at me for a space of heartbeats then he blinked and nodded i believe you would but remember ma anita if you hurt me it hurts you i could survive the strain of your death the question amante de moi is could you survive mine amante de moi what the hell did that mean i decided not to ask damn you jeanclaude damn you that dear anita was done long before you met me what does that mean his eyes were as innocent as they ever were why anita your own catholic church has declared all vampires as suicides we are automatically damned i shook my head im episcopalian now but that isnt what you meant he laughed then the sound was like silk brushed across the nape of the neck it felt smooth and good but it made you shudder i walked away from him i just left him there in front of the obscene window display i walked into the crowd of whores hustlers customers there was nobody on this street as dangerous as jeanclaude i had brought him down here to protect me that was laughable ridiculous obscene a young man who couldnt have been more than fifteen stopped me he was wearing a vest with no shirt and a pair of torn jeans you interested he was taller than me by a little his eyes were blue two other boys just behind him were staring at us we dont get many women down here he said i believe you he looked incredibly young where can i find wheelchair wanda one of the boys behind him said a crip lover jesus i agreed with him where i held up a twenty it was too much to pay for the information but maybe if i gave it to him he could go home sooner maybe if he had twenty dollars he could turn down one of the cars cruising the street twenty dollars it would change his life like sticking your finger in a nuclear meltdown shes just outside of the grey cat at the end of the block thanks i gave him the twenty his fingernails had grime embedded in them you sure you dont want some action his voice was small and uncertain like his eyes out of the comer of my eye i saw jeanclaude moving through the crowd he was coming for me to protect me i turned back to the boy ive got more action than i know what to do with i said he frowned looking puzzled that was all right i was puzzled too what do you do with a master vampire that wont leave you alone good question unfortunately what i needed was a good answer wheelchair wanda was a small woman sitting in one of those sport wheelchairs that are used for railing she wore workout gloves and the muscles in her arms moved under her tanned skin as she pushed herself along long brown hair fell in gentle waves around a very pretty face the makeup was tasteful she wore a shiny metallic blue shirt and no bra an anklelength skirt with at least two layers of multicolored crinoline and a pair of stylish black boots hid her legs she was moving towards us at a goodly pace most of the prostitutes male and female looked ordinary they werent dressed outrageously shorts middrifts in this heat who could blame them i guess if you wear fishnet jumpsuits the police just naturally get suspicious jeanclaude stood beside me he glanced up at the sign that proclaimed the grey cat in a near blinding shade of fuchsia neon tasteful how does one approach a prostitute even just to talk i didnt know learn something new every day i stood in her path and waited for her to come to me she glanced up and caught me watching her when i didnt look away she got eye contact and smiled jeanclaude moved up beside me wandas smile broadened or deepened it was a definite come along smile as my grandmother blake used to say jeanclaude whispered is that a prostitute yes i said in a wheelchair he asked yep my was all he said i think jeanclaude was shocked nice to know he could be she stopped her chair with an expert movement of hands she smiled craning to look up at us the angle looked painful hi she said hi i said she continued to smile i continued to stare why did i suddenly feel awkward a friend told me about you i said wanda nodded you are the one they refer to as wheelchair wanda she grinned suddenly and her face looked real behind all those lovely but fake smiles was a real person yeah thats me could we talk sure she said you got a room did i have a room wasnt she supposed to do that no she waited oh hell we just want to talk to you for an hour or two well pay whatever the going rate is she told me the going rate jesus thats a little steep i said she smiled beatifically at me supply and demand she said you cant get a taste of what i have anywhere else she smoothed her hands down her legs as she said it my eyes followed her hands like they were supposed to this was too weird i nodded okay you got a deal it was a business expense computer paper ink pens medium point one prostitute manila file folders see it fit right in bert was going to love this one we took wanda back to my apartment there are no elevators in my building two flights of stairs are not exactly wheelchair accessible jeanclaude carried her his stride was even and fluid as he walked ahead of me wanda didnt even slow him down i followed with the wheelchair it did slow me down the only consolation i had was i got to watch jeanclaude climb the stairs so sue me he had a very nice backside for a vampire he was waiting for me in the upper hallway standing with wanda cuddled in his arms they both looked at me with a pleasant sort of blankness i wheeled the collapsed wheelchair over the carpeting jeanclaude followed me the crinoline in wandas skirts crinkled and whispered as he moved i leaned the wheelchair against my leg and unlocked the door i pushed the door all the way back to the wall to give jeanclaude room the wheelchair folded inwards like a cloth baby stroller i struggled to make the metal bars catch so the chair would be solid again as i suspected it was easier to break it than to fix it i glanced up from my struggles and found jeanclaude still standing outside my door wanda was staring at him frowning whats wrong i asked i have never been to your apartment so the great vampire expert come anita oh you have my permission to enter my home he gave a sort of bow from the neck i am honored he said the wheelchair snapped into shape again jeanclaude set wanda in her chair i closed the door wanda smoothed her long skirts over her legs jeanclaude stood in the middle of my living room and gazed about he gazed at the penguin calendar on the wall by the kitchenette he rifled the pages to see future months gazing at pictures of chunky flightless birds until hed seen every picture i wanted to tell him to stop but it was harmless i didnt write appointments on the calendar why did it bother me that he was so damned interested in it i turned back to the prostitute in my living room the night was entirely too weird would you like something to drink i asked when in doubt be polite red wine if you have it wanda said sorry nothing alcoholic in the house coffee soft drinks with real sugar in them and water thats about it soft drink she said i got her a can of coke out of the fridge you want a glass she shook her head jeanclaude was leaning against the wall staring at me as i moved about the kitchen i dont need a glass either he said softly dont get cute i said too late he said i had to smile the smile seemed to please him which made me frown life was hard around jeanclaude he sort of wandered off towards the fish tank he was giving himself a tour of my apartment of course he would but at least it would give wanda and i some privacy shit hes a vampire wanda said she sounded surprised which surprised me i could always tell dead was dead to me no matter how pretty the corpse you didnt know i asked no im not coffinbait she said there was a tightness to her face the flick of her eyes as she followed jeanclaudes casual movements around the room was new she was scared whats coffinbait i handed her the soft drink a whore that does vampires coffinbait how quaint he wont touch you she turned brown eyes to me then her gaze was very thorough as if she were trying to read the inside of my head was i telling the truth how terrifying to go away with strangers to rooms and not know if they will hurt you or not desperation or a death wish so you and i are going to do it she asked her gaze never left my face i blinked at her it took me a moment to realize what she meant no i shook my head no i said i just wanted to talk i meant it i think i was blushing maybe the blush did it she popped the top on the soda can and took a drink you want me to talk about doing it with other people while you do it with him she motioned her head towards the wandering vampire jeanclaude was standing in front of the only picture i had in the room it was modern and matched the decor grey white black and palest pink it was one of those designs that the longer you stared at it the more shapes you could pick out look wanda we are just going to talk thats it nobody is going to do anything to anybody okay she shrugged its your money we can do what you want that one statement made my stomach hurt she meant it id paid the money she would do anything i wanted anything it was too awful that any human being would say anything and mean it of course she drew the line at vampires even whores have standards wanda was smiling up at me the change was extraordinary her face glowed she was instantly lovely even her eyes glowed it reminded me of cicelys soundless laughing face back to business i heard you were harold gaynors mistress a while back no preliminaries no sweet talk off with the clothes wandas smile faded the glow of humor died in her eyes replaced by wariness i dont know the name yeah you do i said i was still standing forcing her to look up at me in that near painful angle she sipped her drink and shook her head without looking up at me come on wanda i know you were gaynors sweetie admit you know him and well work from there she glanced up at me then down no ill do you ill let the vamp watch ill talk dirty to you both but i dont know anybody named gaynor i leaned down putting my hands on the arms of her chair our faces were very close im not a reporter gaynor will never know you talked to me unless you tell him her eyes had gotten bigger i glanced where she was staring the windbreaker had fallen forward my gun was showing which seemed to upset her good talk to me wanda my voice was soft mild the mildest of voices is often the worst threat who the hell are you youre not cops youre not a reporter social workers dont carry guns who are you that last question had the lilt of fear in it jeanclaude strolled into the room hed been in my bedroom great just great trouble ma petite i didnt correct him on the nickname wanda didnt need to know there was dissent in the ranks shes being stubborn i said i stepped back from her chair i took off the windbreaker and laid it over the kitchen counter wanda stared at the gun like i knew she would i may not be intimidating but the browning is jeanclaude walked up behind her his slender hands touched her shoulders she jumped like it had hurt i knew it hadnt hurt might be better if it did hell kill me wanda said a lot of people seemed to say that about mr gaynor hell never know i said jeanclaude rubbed his cheek against her hair his fingers kneading her shoulders gently and my sweet coquette he is not here with you tonight he spoke with his lips against her ear we are he said something else so soft i could not hear only his lips moved soundlessly for me wanda heard him her eyes widened and she started to tremble her entire body seemed in the grip of some kind of fit tears glittered in her eyes and fell down her cheeks in one graceful curve jesus please dont please dont let him her voice was squeezed small and thin with fear i hated jeanclaude in that moment and i hated me i was one of the good guys it was one of my last illusions i wasnt willing to give it up not even if it worked wanda would talk or she wouldnt no torture back off jeanclaude i said he gazed up at me i can taste her terror like strong wine his eyes were solid drowning blue he looked blind his face was still lovely as he opened his mouth wide and fangs glistened wanda was still crying and staring at me if she could have seen the look on jeanclaudes face she would have been screaming i thought your control was better than this jeanclaude my control is excellent but it is not endless he stood away from her and began to pace the room on the other side of the couch like a leopard pacing its cage contained violence waiting for release i could not see his face had the spook act been for wandas benefit or real i shook my head no way to ask in front of wanda maybe later maybe i knelt in front of wanda she was gripping the soda can so hard she was denting it i didnt touch her just knelt close by i wont let him hurt you honest harold gaynor is threatening me thats why i need information wanda was looking at me but her attention was on the vampire in back of her there was a watchful tension in her shoulders she would never relax while jeanclaude was in the room the lady had taste jeanclaude jeanclaude his face looked as ordinary as it ever did when he turned to face me a smile crooked his full lips it was an act pretense damn him was there something in becoming a vampire that made you sadistic go into the bedroom for a while wanda and i need to talk in private your bedroom his smile widened my pleasure ma petite i scowled at him he was undaunted as always but he left the room as id asked wandas shoulders slumped she drew a shaky breath you really arent going to let him hurt me are you no im not she started to cry then soft shaky tears i didnt know what to do ive never known what to do when someone cries did i hug her pat her hand comfortingly what i finally sat back on the ground in front of her leaning back on my heels and did nothing it took a few moments but finally the crying stopped she blinked up at me the makeup around her eyes had faded just vanished it made her look vulnerable more rather than less attractive i had the urge to take her in my arms and rock her like a child whisper lies about how everything would be alright when she left here tonight she was still going to be a whore a crippled whore how could that be alright i shook my head more at me than at her you want some kleenex she nodded i got her the box from the kitchen counter she wiped at her face and blew her nose softly very ladylike can we talk now she blinked at me and nodded she took a shaky sip of pop you know harold gaynor right she just stared at me dully had we broken her if he finds out he will kill me maybe i dont want to be coffinbait but i sure as hell dont want to die either no one does talk to me wanda please she let out a shaky sigh okay i know harold harold tell me about him wanda stared at me her eyes narrowed there were fine lines around her eyes it made her older than i had thought has he sent bruno or tommy after you yet tommy came for a personal meeting what happened i drew a gun on him that gun she asked in a small voice yes what did you do to make harold mad truth or lie neither i refused to do something for him what i shook my head it doesnt matter it cant have been sex you arent crippled she said the last word like it was hard he doesnt touch anyone whos whole the bitterness in her voice was thick enough to taste how did you meet him i asked i was in college at wash u gaynor was donating money for something and he asked you out yeah her voice was so soft i had to lean forward to hear it what happened we were both in wheelchairs he was rich it was great she rolled her lips under like she was smoothing lipstick then out and swallowed when did it stop being great i asked i moved in with him dropped out of college it was easier than college easier than anything he couldnt get enough of me she stared down at her lap again he started wanting variety in the bedroom see his legs are crippled but he can feel i cant feel wandas voice had dropped almost to a whisper i had to lean against her knees to hear he liked to do things to my legs but i couldnt feel it so at first i thought that was okay but but he got really sick she looked at me suddenly her face only inches from mine her eyes were huge swimming with unshed tears he cut me up i couldnt feel it but thats not the point is it no i said the first tear trailed down her face i touched her hand her fingers wrapped around mine and held on its alright i said its alright she cried i held her hand and lied its alright now wanda he cant hurt you anymore everyone hurts you she said you were going to hurt me there was accusation in her eyes it was a little late to explain good cop bad cop to her she wouldnt have believed it anyway tell me about gaynor he replaced me with a deaf girl cicely i said she looked up surprised youve met her briefly wanda shook her head cicely is one sick chickie she likes torturing people it gets her off wanda looked at me as if trying to gauge my reaction was i shocked no harold slept with both of us at the same time sometimes at the end it was always a threesome it got real rough her voice dropped lower and lower a hoarse whisper cicely likes knives shes real good at skinning things she rolled her lips under again in that lipsticksmoothing gesture gaynor would kill me just for telling you his bedroom secrets do you know any business secrets she shook her head no i swear he was always very careful to keep me out of that i thought at first it was so if the police came i wouldnt be arrested she looked down at her lap later i realized it was because he knew i would be replaced he didnt want me to know anything that could hurt him when he threw me away there was no bitterness now no anger only a hollow sadness i wanted her to rant and rave this quiet despair was aching a hurt that would never heal gaynor had done worse than kill her hed left her alive alive and as crippled inside as out i cant tell you anything but bedroom talk it wont help you hurt him is there any bedroom talk that isnt about sex i asked what do you mean personal secrets but not sex you were his sweetie for nearly two years he must have talked about something other than sex she frowned thinking i i guess he talked about his family what about his family he was illegitimate he was obsessed with his real fathers family he knew who they were wanda nodded they were rich old money his mother was a hooker turned mistress when she got pregnant they threw her out like gaynor did to his women i thought freud is so often at work in our lives out loud i said what family he never said i think he thought id blackmail them or go to them with his dirty little secrets he desperately wants them to regret not welcoming him into the family i think he only made his money so he could be as rich as they were if he never gave you a name how do you know he wasnt lying you wouldnt ask if you could hear him his voice was so intense he hates them and he wants his birthright their money is his birthright how does he plan to get their money i asked just before i left him harold had found where some of his ancestors were buried he talked about treasure buried treasure can you believe it in the graves no his fathers people got their first fortune from being river pirates they sailed the mississippi and robbed people gaynor was proud of that and angry about it he said that the whole bunch of them were descended from thieves and whores where did they get off being so high and mighty to him she was watching my face as she spoke the last maybe she saw the beginnings of an idea how would knowing the graves of his ancestors help him get their treasure he said hed find some voodoo priest to raise them hed force them to give him their treasure that had been lost for centuries ah i said what did that help i nodded my role in gaynors little scheme had become clear painfully clear the only question left was why me why didnt he go to someone thoroughly disreputable like dominga salvador someone who would take his money and kill his hornless goat and not lose any sleep over it why me with my reputation for morality did he ever mention any names of voodoo priests wanda shook her head no no names he was always careful about names theres a look on your face how could what i have told you just now help you i think the less you know about that the better dont you she stared at me for a long time but finally nodded i guess so is there any place i let it trail off i was going to offer her a plane ticket or a bus ticket to anywhere anywhere where she wouldnt have to sell herself anywhere where she could heal maybe she read it in my face or my silence she laughed and it was a rich sound shouldnt whores have cynical cackles you are a social worker type after all you want to save me dont you is it terribly naive to offer you a ticket home or somewhere she nodded terribly and why should you want to help me youre not a man you dont like women why should you offer to send me home stupidity i said and stood its not stupid she took my hand and squeezed it but it wouldnt do any good im a whore here at least i know the town the people i have regulars she released my hand and shrugged i get by with a little help from your friends i said she smiled and it wasnt happy whores dont have friends you dont have to be a whore gaynor made you a whore but you dont have to stay one there were tears trembling in her eyes for the third time that night hell she wasnt tough enough for the streets no one was just call a taxi okay i dont want to talk anymore what could i do i called a taxi i told the driver the fare was in a wheelchair like wanda told me to she let jeanclaude carry her back downstairs because i couldnt do it but she was very tight and still in his arms we left her in her chair on the curb i watched until the taxi came and took her away jeanclaude stood beside me in the golden circle of light just in front of my apartment building the warm light seemed to leech color from his skin i must leave you now ma petite it has been very educational but time grows short youre going to go feed arent you does it show a little i should call you ma veritй anita you always tell me the truth about myself is that what veritй means truth i asked he nodded i felt bad itchy grumpy restless i was mad at harold gaynor for victimizing wanda mad of wanda for allowing it angry with myself for not being able to do anything about it i was pissed at the whole world tonight id learned what gaynor wanted me to do and it didnt help a damn bit there will always be victims anita predators and prey it is the way of the world i glared up at him i thought you couldnt read me anymore i cannot read your mind or your thoughts only your face and what i know of you i didnt want to know that jeanclaude knew me that well that intimately go away jeanclaude just go away as you like ma petite and just like that he was gone a rush of wind then nothing showoff i murmured i was left standing in the dark tasting the first edge of tears why did i want to cry over a whore whom id just met over the unfairness of the world in general jeanclaude was right there would always be prey and predator and i had worked very hard to be one of the predators i was the executioner so why were my sympathies always with the victims and why did the despair in wandas eyes make me hate gaynor more than anything hed ever done to me why indeed the phone rang i moved nothing but my eyes to glance at the bedside clock am shit i lay there waiting half drifted to sleep again when the answering machine picked up its dolph we found another one call my pager i scrambled for the phone dropping the receiver in the process hlo dolph im here late night yeah whats up our friend has decided that single family homes are easy pickings his voice sounded rough with lack of sleep god not another family fraid so can you come out it was a stupid question but i didnt point that out my stomach had dropped into my knees i didnt want a repeat of the reynolds house i didnt think my imagination could stand it give me the address ill be there he gave me the address st peters i said its close to st charles but still still what its a long way to walk for a single family home there are lots of houses that fit the bill in st charles why did it travel so far to feed youre asking me he said there was something almost like laughter in his voice come on out ms voodoo expert see what there is to see dolph is it as bad as the reynolds house bad worse worst of all he said the laughter was still there but it held an edge of something hard and self deprecating this isnt your fault i said tell that to the top brass theyre screaming for someones ass did you get the warrant itll come in this afternoon late no one gets warrants on a weekend i said special panicmode dispensation dolph said get your ass out here anita everyone needs to go home he hung up i didnt bother saying bye another murder shit shit shit double shit it was not the way i wanted to spend saturday morning but we were getting our warrant yippee the trouble was i didnt know what to look for i wasnt really a voodoo expert i was a preternatural crimes expert it wasnt the same thing maybe i should ask manny to come along no no i didnt want him near dominga salvador in case she decided to cut a deal and give him to the police there is no statute of limitations on human sacrifice manny could still go down for it itd be domingas style to trade my friend for her life making it in a roundabout way my fault yeah shed love that the message light on my answering machine was blinking why hadnt i noticed it last night i shrugged one of lifes mysteries i pressed the playback button anita blake this is john burke i got your message call me anytime here im eager to hear what you have he gave the phone number and that was it great a murder scene a trip to the morgue and a visit to voodoo land all in one day it was going to be a busy and unpleasant day it matched last night perfectly and the night before shit i was on a roll there was a patrol cop throwing up his guts into one of those giant elephantsized trash cans in front of the house bad sign there was a television news van parked across the street worse sign i didnt know how dolph had kept zombie massacres out of the news so long current events must have been really hopping for the newshounds to ignore such easy headlines zombies massacre family zombie serial murderer on loose jesus it was going to be a mess the camera crew complete with microphonebearing suit watched me as i walked towards the yellow police tape when i clipped the official plastic card on my collar the news crew moved like one animal the uniform at the police tape held it for me his eyes on the descending press i didnt look back never look back when the press are gaining on you they catch you if you do the blond in the suit yelled out ms blake ms blake can you give us a statement always nice to be recognized i guess but i pretended not to hear i kept walking head determinedly down a crime scene is a crime scene is a crime scene except for the unique nightmarish qualities of each one i was standing in a bedroom of a very nice onestory ranch there was a white ceiling fan that turned slowly it made a faint whirring creak as if it wasnt screwed in tight on one side better to concentrate on the small things the way the east light fell through the slanting blinds painting the room in zebrastripe shadows better not to look at what was left on the bed didnt want to look didnt want to see had to see had to look might find a clue sure and pigs could fucking fly but still maybe maybe there would be a clue maybe hope is a lying bitch there are roughly two gallons of blood in the human body as much blood as they put on television and the movies its never enough try dumping out two full gallons of milk on your bedroom floor see what a mess it makes now multiply that by something there was too much blood for just one person the carpet squeeched underfoot and blood came up in little splatters like mud after a rain my white nikes were spotted with scarlet before i was halfway to the bed lesson learned wear black nikes to murder scenes the smell was thick in the room i was glad for the ceiling fan the room smelled like a mixture of slaughterhouse and outhouse shit and blood the smell of fresh death more often than not sheets covered not just the bed but a lot of the floor around the bed it looked like giant paper towels thrown over the worlds biggest koolaid spill there had to be pieces all over under the sheets the lumps were so small too small to be a body there wasnt a single scarletsoaked bump that was big enough for a human body please dont make me look i whispered to the empty room did you say something i jumped and found dolph standing just behind me jesus dolph you scared me wait until you see whats under the sheets then you can be scared i didnt want to see what was under the army of bloodsoaked sheets surely id seen enough for one week my quota of gore had to have been exceeded night before last yeah i was over my quota dolph stood in the doorway waiting there were tiny pinched lines by his eyes that i had never noticed he was pale and needed a shave we all needed something but first i had to look under the sheets if dolph could do it i could do it riight dolph stuck his head out in the hallway we need some help in here lifting the sheets after blake sees the remains we can go home i think he added that last because no one had moved to help he wasnt going to get any volunteers zerbrowski perry merlioni get your butts in here the bags under zerbrowskis eyes looked like bruises hiya blake hi zerbrowski you look like shit he laughed and you still look fresh and lovely as a spring morning he grinned at me yeah right i said detective perry said ms blake good to see you again i had to smile perry was the only cop i knew who would be gracious even over the bloody remains nice to see you too detective perry can we get on with this merlioni said or are the two of you planning to elope merlioni was tall though not as tall as dolph but then who was he had grey curling hair cut short and buzzed on the sides and over his ears he wore a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and a tie at halfmast his gun stuck out on his left hip like a lumpy wallet you take the first sheet then merlioni if youre in such a damn hurry dolph said merlioni sighed yeah yeah he stepped to the sheet on the floor he knelt you ready for this girlie better girlie than dago i said he smiled do it showtime merlioni said he raised the sheet and it stuck in a wet swatch that pulled up one wet inch at a time zerbrowski help him raise the damn thing dolph said zerbrowski didnt argue he must have been tired the two men lifted the sheet in one wet motion the morning sunlight streamed through the red sheet and painted the rug even redder than it was or maybe it didnt make any difference blood dripped from the edges of the sheet where the men held it wet heavy drops like a sink that needed fixing id never seen a sheet saturated with blood before a morning of firsts i stared at the rug and couldnt make sense of it it was just a pile of lumps small lumps i knelt beside them blood soaked through the knee of my jeans it was cold better than warm i guess the biggest lump was wet and smooth about five inches long it was pink and healthylooking it was a scrap of upper intestine a smaller lump lay just beside it i stared at the lump but the longer i stared the less it looked like anything it could have been a hunk of meat from any animal hell the intestine didnt have to be human but it was or i wouldnt be here i poked the smaller glob with one gloved finger i had remembered my surgical gloves this time goody for me the glob was wet and heavy and solid i swallowed hard but i was no closer to knowing what it was the two scraps were like morsels dropped from a cats mouth crumbs from the table jesus i stood next my voice sounded steady ordinary amazing it took all four men lifting from different corners to peel the sheet back from the bed merlioni cursed and dropped his corner dammit blood had run down his arm onto the white shirt did ums get his shirt messy zerbrowski asked fuck yes this place is a mess i guess the lady of the house didnt have time to clean up before you came merlioni i said my eyes flicked down to the bed and the remains of the lady of the house but i looked back up at merlioni instead or cant the dago cop take it i can take anything you can dish out little lady he said i frowned and shook my head betcha cant ill take some of that action zerbrowski said dolph didnt stop us tell us this was a crime scene not a betting parlor he knew we needed it to stay sane i could not stare down at the remains and not make jokes i couldnt id go crazy cops have the weirdest sense of humor because they have to how much you bet merlioni said a dinner for two at tonys i said zerbrowski whistled steep very steep i can afford to foot the bill is it a deal merlioni nodded my wife and i havent been out in ages he offered his bloodsoaked hand i took it the cool blood clung to the outside of my surgical gloves it felt wet like it had soaked through to the skin but it hadnt it was a sensory illusion i knew that when i took off the gloves my hands would be powder dry it was still unnerving how we prove whos toughest merlioni asked this scene here and now i said deal i turned my attention back to the carnage with renewed determination i would win the bet i wouldnt let merlioni have the satisfaction it gave me something to concentrate on rather than the mess on the bed the left half of a rib cage lay on the bed a naked breast was still attached to it the lady of the house everything was brilliant scarlet red like someone had poured buckets of red paint on the bed it was hard to pick out the pieces there a left arm small female i picked up the fingers and they were limp no rigor mortis there was a wedding band set on the third finger i moved the fingers back and forth no rigor mortis what do you think merlioni he squinted down at the arm he couldnt let me outdo him so he fiddled with the hand turning it at the wrist could be rigor came and went you know the first rigor doesnt last you really think nearly two days have passed i shook my head the bloods too fresh for that rigor hasnt set in the crime isnt eight hours old yet he nodded not bad blake but what do you make of this he poked the rib cage enough to make the breast jiggle i swallowed hard i would win this bet i dont know lets see help me roll it over i stared into his face while i asked did he pale just a bit maybe sure the three others were standing at the side of the room watching the show let them it was a lot more diverting than thinking of this as work merlioni and i moved the rib cage over on its side i made sure to give him the fleshy parts so he ended up groping the dead body was breast tissue breast tissue did it matter that it was bloody and cold merlioni looked just a little green i guess it mattered the insides of the rib cage were snatched clean like mr reynoldss rib cage clean and bloody smooth we let the rib cage fall back on the bed it splattered blood in a faint spray onto us his white shirt showed it worse than my blue polo shirt did point for me he grimaced and brushed at the blood specks he smeared blood from his gloves down the shirt merlioni closed his eyes and took a deep breath are you alright merlioni i asked i wouldnt want you to continue if its upsetting you he glared at me then smiled a most unpleasant smile you aint seen it all girlie i have but have you touched it all a trickle of sweat slid down his face you wont want to touch it all i shrugged well see there was a leg on the bed from the hair and the one remaining tennis shoe it looked male the round wet mound of the ball socket gleamed out at us the zombie had just torn the leg off tearing flesh without tearing bone that must have hurt like a son of a bitch i said you think he was alive when the leg was pulled off i nodded yeah i wasnt a hundred percent sure there was too much blood to tell who had died when but merlioni looked a little paler the rest of the pieces were just bloody entrails globs of flesh bits of bone merlioni picked up a handful of entrails catch jesus merlioni that isnt funny my stomach was one tight knot no but the look on your face is he said i glared at him and said throw it or dont merlioni no teasing he blinked at me for a minute then nodded he tossed the string of entrails they were awkward to throw but i managed to catch them they were wet heavy flaccid squeeshy and altogether disgusting like touching raw calfs liver but more so dolph made an exasperated sound while you two are playing gross out can you tell me something useful i dropped the flesh back on the bed sure the zombie came in through the sliding glass door like last time it chased the man or woman back in here and got them both i stopped talking i just froze merlioni was holding up a baby blanket some trick had left a corner of it clean it was edged in satiny pink with tiny balloons and clowns all over it blood dripped heavily from the other end of it i stared at the tiny balloons and clowns while they danced in useless circles you bastard i whispered are you referring to me merlioni asked i shook my head i didnt want to touch the blanket but i reached out for it merlioni made sure that the bloody edge slapped my bare arm dago bastard i said you referring to me bitch i nodded and tried to smile but didnt really manage it we had to keep pretending that this was alright that this was doable it was obscene if the bet hadnt held me id have run screaming from the room i stared at the blanket how old family portrait out front id guess three four months i was finally on the other side of the bed there was another sheetdraped spot it was just as bloody just as small there was nothing whole under the sheet i wanted to call the bet off if they wouldnt make me look id take them all to tonys just dont make me lift that last sheet please please but i had to look bet or no bet i had to see what there was to see might as well see it and win as run and lose i handed the blanket back to merlioni he took it and laid it back on the bed up high so the clean corner would stay clean i knelt on one side of the sheet he knelt on the other our eyes met it was a challenge then to the gruesome end we peeled back the sheet there were only two things under the sheet only two my stomach contracted so hard i had to swallow vomit i coughed and almost lost it there but i held on i held on id thought the bloodsoaked form was the baby but it wasnt it was a doll so bloodsoaked i couldnt tell what color its hair had been but it was just a doll a doll too old for a fourmonthold baby a tiny hand lay on the carpet covered in gore like everything else but it was a hand a tiny hand the hand of a child not a baby i spread my hand just above it to size it three maybe four about the same age as benjamin reynolds was that coincidence had to be zombies werent that choosy im breastfeeding the baby maybe when i hear a loud noise husband goes to check noise wakes the little girl she comes out of her room to see whats the matter husband sees the monster grabs the child runs for the bedroom the zombie takes them here kills them all here my voice sounded distant clinical bully for me i tried to wipe some of the blood off the tiny hand she was wearing a ring like mommy one of those plastic rings you get out of bubble gum machines did you see the ring merlioni i asked i lifted the hand from the carpet and said catch jesus he was on his feet and moving before i could do anything else merlioni walked very fast out the door i wouldnt really have thrown the hand i wouldnt i cradled the tiny hand in my hands it felt heavy as if the fingers should curl round my hand should ask me to take it for a walk i dropped the hand on the carpet it landed with a wet splat the room was very hot and spinning ever so slightly i blinked and stared at zerbrowski did i win the bet he nodded anita blake tough chick one night of delectable feasting at tonys on merlionis tab i hear they make great spaghetti the mention of food was too much bathroom where down the hall third door on the left dolph said i ran for the bathroom merlioni was just coming out i didnt have time to savor my victory i was too busy tossing my cookies i knelt with my forehead against the cool linoleum of the bathtub i was feeling better lucky i hadnt taken time to eat breakfast there was a tap on the door what i said its dolph can i come in i thought about that for a minute sure dolph came in with a washcloth in his hand linen closet i guessed he stared at me for a minute or two and shook his head he rinsed the washrag in the sink and handed it to me you know what to do with it i did the rag was cold and felt wonderful on my face and neck did you give merlioni one too i asked yeah hes in the kitchen youre both assholes but it was entertaining i managed a weak smile now that youre through grandstanding any useful observations he sat on the closed lid of the stool i stayed on the floor did anybody hear anything this time neighbor heard something around dawn but he went on to work said he didnt want to get involved in a domestic dispute i stared up at dolph had he heard fighting from this house before dolph shook his head god if he had just called the police i said you think it would have made a difference dolph asked i thought about that for a minute maybe not to this family but we might have trapped the zombie spilled milk dolph said maybe not the scene is still very fresh the zombie killed them then took the time to eat four people that isnt quick at dawn the thing was still killing them your point seal the area explain the zombie has to be nearby within walking distance its hiding waiting for nightfall i thought zombies could go out in daylight dolph said they can but they dont like it a zombie wont go out in the day unless ordered to so the nearest cemetery he said not necessarily zombies arent like vamps or ghouls it doesnt need to be coffins or even graves the zombie will just want to get out of the light so where do we look sheds garages any place that will shield it so he could be in some kids tree house dolph said i smiled nice to know i still could i doubt the zombie would climb if given a choice notice that all the houses are onestories basements he said but no one runs down to the basement i said would it have helped i shrugged zombies arent great at climbing as a rule this one is faster and more alert but at best the basement might have delayed it if there were windows they might have gotten the children out i rubbed the cloth on the back of my neck the zombie picks onestory houses with sliding glass doors it might rest near one the medical examiner says the corpse is tall six feet sixtwo male white immensely strong we knew the last and the rest doesnt really help you got a better idea as a matter of fact i said have all the officers about the right height walk the neighborhood for an hour then block off that much of the area and search all the sheds and garages dolph said and basements crawl spaces old refrigerators i said if we find it fry it get an exterminator team out here will the zombie attack during the day dolph asked if disturbed enough yes this ones awfully aggressive no joke he said wed need a dozen exterminator teams or more the cityll never go for that besides we could walk a pretty damn wide circle we might search and miss it completely itll move at dark if youre ready youll find it then okay you sound like youre not going to help search ill be back to help but john burke returned my call you taking him to the morgue yeah in time to try to use him against dominga salvador what timing i said good you need anything from me just access to the morgue for both of us i said sure thing you think youll really learn anything from burke dont know till i try i said he smiled give it the old college try eh win one for the gipper i said you go visit the morgue and deal with voodoo john well turn this fucking neighborhood upside down nice to know weve both got our days planned i said dont forget this afternoon we check out salvadors house i nodded yeah and tonight we hunt zombies were going to end this shit tonight he said i hope so he looked at me eyes narrowed you got a problem with our plans just that no plan is perfect he was quiet a moment then stood wish this one was me too the st louis county morgue was a large building it needs to be every death not attended by a physician comes to the morgue not to mention every murder in st louis that made for some very heavy traffic i use to come to the morgue fairly regularly to stake suspected vampire victims so they wouldnt rise and feast on the morgue attendants with the new vamp laws thats murder you have to wait for the puppies to rise unless theyve left a will strictly forbidding coming back as a vampire my will says to put me out of my misery if they think im coming back with fangs hell my will asks for cremation i dont want to come back as a zombie either thank you very much john burke was as i remembered him tall dark handsome vaguely villainous it was the little goatee that did it no one wears goatees outside of horror movies you know the ones with strange cults that worship horned images he looked a little faded around the eyes and mouth grief will do that to you even if your skin tone is dark his lips were set in a thin line as we walked into the morgue he held his shoulders as if something hurt hows it going at your sisterinlaws i asked bleak very bleak i waited for him to elaborate but he didnt so i let it go if he didnt want to talk about it that was his privilege we were walking down a wide empty corridor wide enough for three gurneys to wheel abreast the guard station looked like a wwii bunker complete with machine guns in case the dead should rise all at once and make for freedom it had never happened here in st louis but it had happened as close as kansas city a machine gun will take the starch out of any walking dead youre only in trouble if there are a lot of them if there is a crowd youre pretty much cooked i flashed my id at the guard hi fred long time no see i wish they let you come down here like before weve had three get up this week and go home can you believe that vampires what else theres going to be more of them than of us someday i didnt know what to say so i said nothing he was probably right were here to see the personal effects of peter burke sergeant rudolph storr was supposed to clear it fred checked his little book yeah youre authorized take the right corridor third door on the left dr saville is waiting for you i raised an eyebrow at that it wasnt often that the chief medical examiner did errands for the police or anybody else i just nodded as if i had expected royal treatment thanks fred see you on the way out more and more people do he said he didnt sound happy about it my nikes made no sound in the perpetual quiet john burke wasnt making any noise either i hadnt pegged him as a tennis shoe man i glanced down and i was right softsoled brown tieups not tennis shoes but he still moved beside me like a quiet shadow the rest of his outfit sort of matched the shoes a dressy brown sport jacket so dark brown it was almost black over a pale yellow shirt brown dress slacks he only needed a tie and he could have gone to corporate america did he always dress up or was this just what he had brought for his brothers funeral no the suit at the funeral had been perfectly black the morgue was always quiet but on a saturday morning it was deathly still did the ambulances circle like planes until a decent hour on the weekend i knew the murder count went up on the weekend yet saturday and sunday morning were always quiet go figure i counted doors on the lefthand side knocked on the third door a faint come in and i opened the door dr marian saville is a small woman with short dark hair bobbed just below her ears an olive complexion deeply brown eyes and fine high cheekbones she is french and greek and looks it exotic without being intimidating it always surprised me that dr saville wasnt married it wasnt for lack of being pretty her only fault was that she smoked and the smell clung to her like nasty perfume she came forward with a smile and an offered hand anita good to see you again i shook her hand and smiled you too dr saville marian please i shrugged malian are those the personal effects we were in a small examining room on a lovely stainless steel table were several plastic bags yes i stared at her wondering what she wanted the chief medical examiner didnt do errands something else was up but what i didnt know her well enough to be blunt and i didnt want to be barred from the morgue so i couldnt be rude problems problems this is john burke the deceaseds brother i said dr savilles eyebrows raised at that my condolences mr burke thank you john shook the hand she offered him but his eyes were all for the plastic bags there was no room today for attractive doctors or pleasantries he was going to see his brothers last effects he was looking for clues to help the police catch his brothers killer he had taken the notion very seriously if he wasnt involved with dominga salvador i would owe him a big apology but how was i to get him to talk with dr marian hovering around how was i supposed to ask for privacy it was her morgue sort of i have to be here to make sure no evidence is tampered with she said weve had a few very determined reporters lately but im not a reporter she shrugged youre not an official person anita new rules from on high that no nonofficial person is to be allowed to look at murder evidence without someone to watch over them i appreciate it being you marian she smiled i was here anyway i figured youd resent my looking over your shoulder less than anyone else she was right what did they think i was going to do steal a body if i wanted to i could empty the damn place and get every corpse to play follow the leader perhaps that was why i needed watching perhaps i dont mean to be rude john said but could we get on with this i glanced up at his handsome face the skin was tight around the mouth and eyes as if it had thinned guilt speared me in the side sure john were being thoughtless your forgiveness mr burke marian said she handed us both little plastic gloves she and i slipped into them like pros but john wasnt used to putting on examining gloves there is a trick to it practice by the time i finished helping him on with his gloves he was grinning his whole face changed when he smiled brilliant and handsome and not the least villainous dr saville popped the seal on the first bag it was clothing no john said i dont know his clothing it may be his and i wouldnt know peter and i had hadnt seen each other in two years the guilt in those last words made me wince fine well go on to the smaller items marian said and smiled as she said it nice and cheery practicing her bedside manner she so seldom got to practice she opened a much smaller bag and spilled the contents gently on the shiny silver surface a comb a dime two pennies a movie ticket stub and a voodoo charm a grisgris it was woven of black and red thread with human teeth worked into the beading more bones dangled all the way around it are those human finger bones i asked yes john said his voice very still he looked strange as he stood there as if some new horror were dawning behind his eyes it was an evil piece of work but i didnt understand the strength of his reaction to it i leaned over it poking it with one finger there was some dried skin woven in the center of it all and it wasnt just black thread it was black hair human hair teeth bones skin i said softly yes john repeated youre more into voodoo than i am i said what does it mean someone died to make this charm are you sure he glared down at me with withering contempt dont you think if it could be anything else i wouldnt say it do you think i enjoy learning my brother took part in human sacrifice did peter have to be there he couldnt have just bought it afterwards no it was almost a yell he turned away from us pacing to the wall his breathing was loud and ragged i gave him a few moments to collect himself then asked what had to be asked what does the grisgris do he turned a calm enough face to us but the strain showed around his eyes it enables a less powerful necromancer to raise older dead to borrow the power of some much greater necromancer how borrow he shrugged that charm holds some of the power of the most powerful among us peter paid dearly for it so he could raise more and older dead peter god how could you how powerful would you need to be to share your power like this very powerful he said is there any way to trace it back to the person who made it you dont understand anita that thing is a piece of someones power it is one substance to what soul they have left it must have been a great need or great greed to do it peter could never have afforded it never can it be traced back yes just get it in the room with the person who truly owns it the thing will crawl back to him its a piece of his soul gone missing would that be proof in court if you could make the jury understand it yes i guess so he stepped towards me you know who did this maybe who tell me who ill do better than that ill arrange for you to come on a search of their house a grim smile touched his lips im beginning to like you a great deal anita blake compliments later whats this mean marian asked she had turned the charm completely over there shining among the hair and bone was a small charm like from a charm bracelet it was in the shape of a musical symbola treble clef what had evans said when he touched the grave fragments they slit her throat she had a charm bracelet with a musical note on it and little hearts i stared at the charm and felt the world shift everything fell together in one motion dominga salvador hadnt raised the killer zombie she had helped peter burke raise it but i had to be sure we only had a few hours until wed be back at domingas door trying to prove a case are there any women that came in around the same time as peter burke im sure there are marian said with a smile women with their throats slit i said she stared at me for a heartbeat ill check the computer can we take the charm with us why because if im right she had a charm bracelet with a bow and arrow and little hearts on it and this came from the bracelet i held the gold charm up to the light it sparkled merrily as if it didnt know its owner was dead death turns you grey before any other color oh a body that loses a lot of blood will look white or bluish but once a body starts to decay not rot not yet it looks greyish the woman looked grey her neck wound had been cleaned and searched the wound looked puckered like a second giant mouth below her chin dr saville pulled her head back casually the cut was very deep it severed the muscles in the neck and the carotid artery death was fairly quick professionally done i said well yes whoever cut her throat knew what they were doing there are a dozen different ways to injure the neck that wont kill or wont kill quickly john burke said are you saying that my brother had practice i dont know i said do you have her personal effects right here marian unfastened a much smaller bag and spilled it out on an empty table the golden charm bracelet sparkled under the fluorescent lights i picked the bracelet up in my still gloved hand a tiny strung bow complete with arrow a different musical note two entwined hearts everything evans had said how did you know about the charm and the dead woman john burke asked i took some evidence to a clairvoyant he saw the womans death and the bracelet whats that got to do with peter i believe a voodoo priestess had peter raise a zombie it got away from him its been killing people to hide what shes done she killed peter who did it i have no proof unless the grisgris will be proof enough a vision and a grisgris john shook his head hard sell to a jury i know thats why we need more proof dr saville just watched us talk like an eager spectator a name anita give me a name only if you swear not to go after her until the law has its chance only if the law fails promise me i give you my word i studied his face for a minute the dark eyes stared back clear and certain bet he could lie with a clear conscience i dont trust just anybodys word i stared at him a moment longer he never flinched i guess my hardasnails look has faded a little or maybe he meant to keep his word it happens sometimes alright ill take your word dont make me regret it i wont he said now give me the name i turned to dr saville excuse us marian the less you know about all this the greater your chances of never waking to a zombie crawling through your window an exaggeration sort of but it made my point she looked like she wanted to protest but finally nodded very well but i would dearly love to hear the complete story someday if its safe if i can tell it its yours i said she nodded again shut the drawer the jane doe lay on and left yell when youre finished ive got work to do she said and the door closed behind her she left us with the evidence still clutched in our hands guess she trusted me or us dominga salvador i said he drew a sharp breath i know that name she is a frightening force if all the stories are true theyre true i said youve met her ive had the misfortune there was a look on his face that i didnt much like you swore no revenge the police will not get her she is too crafty for that he said we can get her legally i believe that you arent sure he said what could i say he was right im almost sure almost is not good enough for killing my brother that zombie has killed a lot more people than just your brother i want her too but were going to get her legally through the court system there are other ways to get her he said if the law fails us feel free to use voodoo just dont tell me about it he looked amused puzzled no outrage about me using black magic the woman tried to kill me once i dont think shell give up you survived an attack by the seсora he asked he looked amazed i didnt like him looking amazed i can take care of myself mr burke i dont doubt that ms blake he smiled ive bruised your ego you dont like me being so surprised do you keep your observations to yourself okay if you have survived a headon confrontation with what dominga salvador would send to you then i should have believed some of the stories i heard of you the executioner the animator who can raise anything no matter how old i dont know about that last but im just trying to stay alive thats all if dominga salvador wants you dead that wont be easy damn near impossible i said so let us get her first he said legally i said anita you are being naive the offer to come on a raid of her house still stands youre sure you can arrange that i think so his eyes had a sort of dark light to them a sparkling blackness he smiled tightupped and very unpleasant as if he were contemplating tortures for one dominga salvador the private vision seemed to fill him with pleasure the skin between my shoulders crept with that look i hoped john never turned those dark eyes on me something told me he would make a bad enemy almost as bad as dominga salvador almost as bad but not quite dominga salvador sat in her living room smiling the little girl who had been riding her tricycle on my last trip here was sitting in her grandmas lap the child was as relaxed and languorous as a kitten two older boys sat at domingas feet she was the picture of maternal bliss i wanted to throw up of course just because she was the most dangerous voodoo priestess id ever met didnt mean she wasnt a grandma too people are seldom just one thing hitler liked dogs you are more than welcome to search sergeant my house is your house she said in a candycoated voice that had already offered us lemonade or perhaps iced tea john burke and i were standing to one side letting the police do their job dominga was making them feel silly for their suspicions just a nice old lady right antonio and enzo were also standing to one side they didnt quite fit this picture of grandmotherly bliss but evidently she wanted witnesses or maybe a shootout wasnt out of the question mrs salvador do you understand the possible implications of this search dolph said there are no implications because i have nothing to hide she smiled sweetly damn her anita mr burke dolph said we came forward like props in a magic show which wasnt far off a tall police officer had the video camera ready to go i believe you know ms blake dolph said i have had the pleasure dominga said butter wouldnt have melted in her lying mouth this is john burke her eyes widened just a little the first slip in her perfect camouflage had she heard of john burke did the name worry her i hoped so so glad to meet you at last mr john burke she said finally always good to meet another practitioner of the art he said she bowed her head slightly in acknowledgment at least she wasnt trying to pretend complete innocence she admitted to being a voodoo priestess progress it was obscene for the godmother of voodoo to be playing the innocent do it anita dolph said no preliminaries no sense of theater just do it that was dolph for you i took a plastic bag out of my pocket dominga looked puzzled i pulled out the grisgris her face became very still like a mask a funny little smile curled her lips what is that come now seсora john said do not play the fool you know very well what it is i know that it is a charm of some kind of course but do the police now threaten old women with voodoo whatever works i said anita dolph said sorry i glanced at john and he nodded i sat the grisgris on the carpet about six feet from dominga salvador i had had to take johns word on a lot of this i had checked some of it over the phone with manny if this worked and if we could get it admitted into court and if we could explain it to the jury then we might have a case how many ifs was that the grisgris just sat there for a moment then the finger bones rippled as if an invisible finger had ruffled them dominga lifted her granddaughter from her lap and shooed the boys over to enzo she sat alone on the couch and waited the strange little smile was still on her face but it looked sickly now the charm began to ooze towards her like a slug pushing and struggling with muscles it did not have the hairs on my arms stood to attention you recording this bobby dolph asked the cop with the video camera said im getting it i dont fucking believe it but im getting it please do not use such words in front of the children dominga said the cop said sorry maam you are forgiven she was still trying to play the perfect hostess while that thing crawled towards her feet she had nerve id give her that antonio didnt he broke he strode forward as if he meant to pluck the thing from the rug dont touch it dolph said you are frightening my grandmother with your tricks he said dont touch it dolph said again this time he stood his bulk seemed to fill the room antonio looked suddenly small and frail beside him please you are frightening her but it was his face that was pale and covered with a sheen of sweat what was of tony in such a fret about it wasnt his ass going to jail stand over there dolph said now or do we have to cuff you antonio shook his head no i i will go back he did but he glanced at dominga as he moved a quick fearful glance when she met his eyes there was nothing but rage in them her black eyes glittered with rage her face was suddenly contorted with it what had happened to strip the act away what was going on the grisgris made its painful way to her it fawned at her feet like a dog rolling on the toes of her shoes in abandon like a cat who wants its belly rubbed she tried to ignore it to pretend would you refuse your returned power john asked i dont know what you mean her face was under control again she looked puzzled gosh she was good you are a powerful voodoo priest you are doing this to trap me if you dont want the charm i will take it he said i will add your magic to mine i will be the most powerful practitioner in the states for the first time johns power flowed across my skin it was a breath of magic that was frightening i had begun to think of john as ordinary or as ordinary as any of us get my mistake she just shook her head john strode forward and knelt reaching for the writhing grisgris his power moved with him like an invisible hand no she grabbed it cradling it in her hands john smiled up at her do you acknowledge that you made this charm if not i can take it and use it as i see fit it was found in my brothers effects its legally mine correct sergeant storr correct dolph said no you cannot i can and i will unless you look into that camera and admit making it she snarled at him you will regret this you will regret having killed my brother she stared at the video camera very well i made this charm but i admit nothing else i made the charm for your brother but that is all you performed human sacrifice to make this charm john said she shook her head the charm is mine i made it for your brother that is all you have the charm but nothing else seсora forgive me antonio said he looked pale and shaken and very very scared calenta she said shut up zerbrowski take our friend here into the kitchen and take his statement dolph said dominga stood at that you fool you miserable fool tell them anything more and i will rot the tongue out of your mouth get him out of here zerbrowski zerbrowski led a nearly weeping antonio from the room i had a feeling that of tony had been responsible for getting the charm back he failed and he was going to pay the consequences the police were the least of his problems if i were him id make damn sure grandma was locked up tonight i wouldnt want her near her voodoo paraphernalia ever were going to search now mrs salvador help yourself sergeant you will find nothing else to help you she was very calm when she said it even the stuff behind the doors i asked they are gone anita you will find nothing that is not legal and wholesome she made that last sound like a bad word dolph glanced my way i shrugged she seemed awfully sure okay boys take the place apart uniforms and detectives moved like they had a purpose i started to follow dolph out he stopped me no anita you and burke stay up here why youre civilians a civilian me was i a civilian when i walked the cemetery for you if one of my people could have done it i wouldnt have let you do that either let me he frowned you know what i mean no i dont think i do you may be a bad ass you may even be as good as you think you are but you arent police this is a job for cops you stay in the living room with the civies just this once when its all clear you can come down and identify the bogeymen for us dont do me any favors dolph i didnt peg you for a pouter blake i am not pouting i said whining he said cut it out youve made your point ill stay behind but i dont have to like it most of the time youre ass deep in alligators enjoy being out of the line of fire for once anita with that he led the way towards the basement i hadnt really wanted to go down into the darkness again i certainly didnt want to seethe creature that had chased manny and i up the stairs and yet i felt left out dolph was right i was pouting great john burke and i sat on the couch dominga sat in the recliner where she had been since we hit the door the children had been shooed out to play with enzo to watch them he looked relieved i almost volunteered to go with them anything was better than just sitting here straining to hear the first screams if the monster and that was the only word that matched the noises was down there there would be screaming the police were great with bad guys but monsters were new to them it had been simpler in a way when all this shit was taken care of by a few experts a few lone people fighting the good fight staking vampires turning zombies burning witches though there is some debate whether i might have ended up on the receiving end of some fire a few years back say the s what i did was undeniably magic before we got all the bogeymen out in the open supernatural was supernatural destroy it before it destroys you simpler times but now the police were expected to deal with zombies vampires the occasional demon police were really bad with demons but then who isnt dominga sat in her chair and stared at me the two uniforms left in the living room stood like all police stand blank faced bored but let anyone move and the cops saw it the boredom was just a mask cops always saw everything occupational hazard dominga wasnt looking at the police she wasnt even paying attention to john burke who was much closer to her equal she was staring at little old me i met her black gaze and said you got a problem the cops eyes flicked to us john shifted on the couch whats wrong he asked shes staring at me i will do a great deal more than stare at you chica her voice crawled low the hairs at the nape of my neck tried to crawl down my shirt a threat i smiled i dont think youre going to be hurting anybody anymore you mean this she held out the charm it writhed in her hand as if thrilled that she had noticed it she crushed it in her hand it made futile movements as if pushing against her her hand covered it completely she stared straight at me as she brought her hand slowly to her chest the air was suddenly heavy hard to breathe every hair on my body was creeping down my skin stop her john said he stood the policeman nearest her hesitated for only an instant but it was enough when he pried her fingers open they were empty sleight of hand dominga i thought better of you than that john was pale it isnt a trick his voice was shaky he sat down heavily on the couch beside me his dark face looked pale his power seemed to have shriveled up he looked tired what is it what did she do i asked you have to bring back the charm maam the uniform said i cannot she said john what the hell did she do something she shouldnt have been able to do i was beginning to know how dolph must feel having to depend on me for information it was like pulling fucking teeth what did she do she absorbed her power back into herself he said what does that mean she absorbed the grisgris into her body didnt you feel it i had felt something the air was clearer now but it was still heavy my skin was tingling with the nearness of something i felt something but i still dont understand without ceremony without help from the loa she absorbed it back into her soul we wont find a trace of it no evidence so all we have is the tape he nodded if you knew she could do this why didnt you speak up earlier we wouldnt have let her hold the thing i didnt know its impossible without ceremonial magic but she did it i know anita i know he sounded scared for the first time fear didnt sit well on his darkly handsome face after the power id felt from him the fear seemed even more out of place but it was real nonetheless i shivered like someone had walked on my grave dominga was staring at me what are you staring at a dead woman she said softly i shook my head talk is cheap seсora threats dont mean squat john touched my arm do not taunt her anita if she can do that instantly theres no telling what else she can do the cop had had enough shes not doing anything if you so much as twitch wrong lady im going to shoot you but i am just an old woman would you threaten me dont talk either the other uniform said i knew a witch once who could bespell you with her voice both uniforms had their hands near their guns funny how magic changes how people perceive you they were fine when they thought she needed human sacrifice and ceremony let her do one instant trick and she was suddenly very dangerous id always known she was dangerous dominga sat silently under the watchful eyes of the cops i had been distracted by her little performance there were still no screams from downstairs nothing silence had it gotten them all that quickly without a shot fired naw but still my stomach was tight sweat trickled down my spine are you alright dolph i thought did you say something john asked i shook my head just thinking really hard he nodded as if that made sense to him dolph came into the living room i couldnt tell anything by his face mr stoic well what was it l asked nothing he said what do you mean nothing shes cleaned the place out completely we found the rooms you told me about one door had been busted from inside but the rooms been scrubbed down and painted he held up one big hand it was stained white hell the paints still wet it cant all be gone what about the cementcovered doors looks like someone took a jackhammer to them theyre just freshly painted rooms anita the place stinks of pine scented bleach and wet paint no corpses no zombies nothing i just stared at him youve got to be kidding he shook his head im not laughing i stood in front of dominga who warned you she just stared up at me smiling i had a great urge to slap that smile off her face just to hit her once would feel good i knew it would anita dolph said back off maybe the anger showed on my face or maybe it was the fact that my hands were balled into fists and i seemed to be shaking shaking with anger and the beginnings of something else if she didnt go to jail that meant she was free to try to kill me again tonight and every night after that she smiled as if she could read my mind you have nothing chica you have gambled all on a hand with nothing in it she was right stay away from me dominga i will not come near you chica i will not need to your last little surprise didnt work out so well im still here i have done nothing but i am sure there are worse things that could come to your door chica i turned to dolph dammit isnt there anything we can do we got the charm but thats it something must have showed on my face because he touched my arm what is it she did something to the charm its gone he took a deep breath and stalked away then back dammit to hell how i shrugged let john explain i still dont understand it i hate admitting that i dont know something its always bothered me to admit ignorance but hey a girl cant be an expert on everything i had worked hard to stay away from voodoo work hard and where does it get you staring into the black eyes of a voodoo priestess whos plotting your death a most unpleasant death by the looks of it well in for a penny in for a pound i went back to her i stood and stared into her dark face and smiled her own smile faltered which made my smile bigger someone tipped you off and youve been cleaning up this cesspit for two days i leaned over her putting my hands on the arms of the chair it brought our faces close together you had to break down your walls you had to let out or destroy all your creations your inner sanctum your hougun is cleaned and whitewashed all the verve gone all the animal sacrifices gone all that slow building of power line by line drop by bloody drop youre going to have to start over you bitch youre going to have to rebuild it all the look in those black eyes made me shiver and i didnt care youre getting old to rebuild that much did you have to destroy many of your toys dig up any graves have your joke now chica but i will send what i have saved to you some dark night why wait do it now in daylight face me or are you afraid she laughed then and it was a warm friendly sound it startled me so much i stood up straight almost jumped back do you think i am foolish enough to attack you with the police all around you must think me a fool it was worth a try i said you should have joined with me in my zombie enterprises we could have been rich together the only thing were likely to do together is kill each other i said so be it let it be war between us it always was i said she nodded and smiled some more zerbrowski came out of the kitchen he was grinning from ear to ear something good was up the grandson just spilled the beans everyone in the room stared at him dolph said spilled what human sacrifice how he was supposed to get the grisgris back from peter burke after he killed him on his grandmothers orders but some joggers came by and he panicked hes so afraid of herhe motioned to domingahe wants her behind bars hes terrified of what shell do to him for forgetting the charm the charm that we didnt have anymore but we had the video and now we had antonios confession the day was looking up i turned back to dominga salvador she looked tall and proud and terrifying her black eyes blazed with some inner light standing this close to her the power crawled over my skin but a good bonfire would take care of that theyd fry her in the electric chair then burn the body and scatter the ashes at a crossroad i said softly gotcha she spit at me it landed on my hand and burned like acid shit do that again and well shoot you and save the taxpayers some money dolph said he had his gun out i went in search of the bathroom to wash her spit off my hand a blister had formed where it had hit second fucking degree burns from her spit dear god i was glad antonio had broken i was glad she was going to be locked away i was glad she was going to die better her than me riverridge was a modern housing development which meant that there were three models to choose from you could end up with four identical houses in a row like cookies on a baking sheet there was also no river within sight no ridge either the house that was the center of the police search area was identical to its neighbor except for color the murder house which is what the news was calling it was grey with white shutters the house that had been passed safely by was blue with white shutters neithers shutters worked they were just for show modern architecture is full of perks that are just for show balcony railings without a balcony peaked roofs that make it look like you have an extra room that you dont have porches so narrow that only santas elves could sit on them it makes me nostalgic for victorian architecture it might have been overdone but everything worked the entire housing project had been evacuated dolph had been forced to give a statement to the press mores the pity but you cant evacuate a housing development the size of a small town and keep it quiet the cat was out of the bag they were calling them the zombie massacres geez the sun was going down in a sea of scarlet and orange it looked like someone had melted two giant crayons and smeared them across the sky there wasnt a shed garage basement tree house playhouse or anything else we could think of that had been left unsearched still we had found nothing the newshounds were prowling restlessly at the edge of the search area if we had evacuated hundreds of people and searched their premises without a warrant and found no zombie we were going to be in deep fucking shit but it was here i knew it was here alright i was almost sure it was here john burke was standing next to one of those giant trash cans dolph had surprised me by allowing john to come on the zombie hunt as dolph said we needed all the help we could get where is it anita dolph asked i wanted to say something brilliant my god holmes how did you know the zombie was hiding in the flower pot but i couldnt lie i dont know dolph i just dont know if we dont find this thing he let the thought trail off but i knew what he meant my job was secure if this fell apart dolphs was not shit how could i help him what were we missing what i stared at the quiet street it was eerily quiet the windows were all dark only the streetlights pushed back the coming dark soft halos of light every house had a mailbox on a post near the sidewalk that edged the curb some of the mailboxes were unbelievably cute one had been shaped like a sitting cat its paw went up if there was mail in its tummy the family name was catt it was too precious every house had at least one large super duper trash can in front of it some of them were bigger than i was surely sunday couldnt be trash day or had today been trash day and the police line had stopped it trash cans i said aloud what dolph asked trash cans i grabbed his arm feeling almost lightheaded weve stared at those fucking trash cans all day thats it john burke stood quietly beside me frowning are you feeling okay blake zerbrowski came up behind us smoking the end of his cigarette looked like a bloated firefly the cans are big enough for a large person to hide in wouldnt your arms and legs fall asleep zerbrowski asked zombies dont have circulation not like we do dolph yelled everybody check the trash cans the zombie is in one of them move it everyone scattered like an anthill stirred with a stick but we had a purpose now i ended up with two uniformed officers their nameplates said ki and roberts ki was asian and male roberts was blond and female a nicely mixed team we fell into a rhythm without discussing it officer ki would move up and dump the trash can roberts and i would cover him with guns we were all set to yell like hell if a zombie came tumbling out it would probably be the right zombie life is seldom that cruel wed yell and an exterminator team would come running at least theyd better come running this zombie was entirely too fast too destructive it might be more resistant to gunfire better not to find out just frenchfry the sucker and be done with it we were the only team working on the street there was no sound but our footsteps the rubber crunch of trash cans overturning the rattle of cans and bottles as the trash spilled didnt anybody tie their bags up anymore darkness had fallen in a solid blackness i knew there were stars and a moon up there somewhere but you couldnt prove it from where we stood clouds as thick and dark as velvet had come in from the west only the streetlights made it bearable i didnt know how roberts was doing but the muscles in my shoulders and neck were screaming every time ki put his hands to the can and pushed i was ready ready to fire ready to save him before the zombie leapt up and ripped his throat out a trickle of sweat dripped down his highcheekboned face even in the dim light it glimmered glad to know i wasnt the only one feeling the effort of course i wasnt the one putting my face over the possible hiding place of a berserk zombie trouble was i didnt know how good a shot ki was or roberts either for that matter i knew i was a good shot i knew i could slow the thing down until help arrived i had to stay on shooting detail it was the best division of labor honest screams to the left the three of us froze i whirled towards the screaming there was nothing to see nothing but dark houses and pools of streetlight nothing moved but the screams continued high and horrified i started running towards the screams ki and roberts were at my back i ran with the browning in a twohanded grip pointed up easier to run that way didnt dare holster the gun visions of bloodcoated teddy bears and the screams the screams sort of faded someone was dying up ahead there was a sense of movement everywhere in the darkness cops running all of us running but it was too late we were all too late the screaming had stopped no gunshots why not why hadnt someone gotten off a shot we ran down the side yards of four houses when we hit a metal fence had to holster the guns couldnt climb it with one hand dammit i did my best to vault the fence using my hands for leverage i stumbled to my knees in the soft dirt of a flower bed i was trampling some tall summer flowers on my knees i was considerably shorter than the flowers ki landed beside me only roberts landed on her feet ki stood up without drawing his gun i drew the browning while i crouched in the flowers i could stand up after i was armed i had a sense of rushing movement but not clear sight the flowers obscured my vision roberts was suddenly tumbling backwards screaming ki was drawing his gun but something hit him knocked him on top of me i rolled but was still half under him he lay still on top of me ki move it dammit he sat up and crawled towards his partner his gun silhouetted against the streetlight he was staring down at roberts she wasnt moving i searched the darkness trying to see something anything it had moved more than human fast fast as a ghoul no zombie moved like that had i been wrong all along was it something else something worse how many lives would my mistake cost tonight was roberts dead ki is she alive i searched the darkness fighting the urge to look only at the lighted areas there was shouting but it was confusion where is it where did it go the sounds were getting farther away i screamed here here the voices hesitated then started our way they were making so much noise like a heard of arthritic elephants how bad is she hurt bad hed put his gun down he was pressing his hands over her neck something black and liquid was spreading over his hands god i knelt on the other side of roberts gun ready searching the darkness everything was taking forever yet it was only seconds i checked her pulse onehanded it was thready but there my hand came away covered in blood i wiped it on my pants the thing had damn near slit her throat where was it kis eyes were huge all pupil his skin looked leprous in the streetlight his partners blood was dripping out between his fingers something moved too low to the ground to be a man but about that size it was just a shape creeping along the back of the house in front of us whatever it was had found the deepest shadow and was trying to creep away that showed more intelligence than a zombie had i was wrong i was wrong i was fucking wrong and roberts was dying because of it stay with her keep her alive where are you going he asked after it i climbed the fence onehanded the adrenaline must have been pumping because i made it i gained the yard and it was gone a streaking shape fast as a mouse caught in the kitchen light a blur of speed but big big as a man it rounded the corner of the house and i lost sight of it dammit i ran as far from the wall as i could my stomach tight with anticipation of fingers ripping my throat out i came round the house gun pointed twohanded ready nothing i scanned the darkness the pools of light nothing shouts behind me the cops had arrived god let roberts live there movement creeping across the streetlight around the edge of another house someone shouted anita i was already running towards the movement i shouted as i ran bring an exterminator team but i didnt stop i didnt dare stop i was the only one in sight of it if i lost it it was gone i ran into the darkness alone after something that might not be a zombie at all not the brightest thing ive ever done but it wasnt going to get away it wasnt it was never going to hurt another family not if i could stop it now tonight i ran through a pool of light and it made the darkness heavier blinding me temporarily i froze in the dark willing my eyes to adjust faster perssisstent woman a voice hissed it was to my right so close the hair on my arms stood up i froze straining my peripheral vision there a darker shape rising out of the evergreen shrubs that hugged the edge of the house it rose to its full height but didnt attack if it wanted me it could have me before i could turn and fire id seen it move i knew i was dead you arrre not like the resst the voice was sibilant as if parts of the mouth were missing so it put great effort into forming each word a gentlemans voice decayed by the grave i turned towards it slowly slowly put me back i had turned my head enough to be able to see some of it my night vision is better than most and the streetlights made it lighter than it should have been the skin was pale yellowishwhite the skin clung to the bones of his face like wax that had halfmelted but the eyes they werent decayed they burned out at me with a glitter that was more than just eyes put you back where i asked my grave he said his lips didnt work quite right there wasnt enough flesh left on them light blazed into my eyes the zombie screamed covering his face i couldnt see shit it crashed into me i pulled the trigger blind i thought i heard a grunt as the bullet hit home i fired the gun again onehanded throwing an arm across my neck trying to protect myself as i fell halfblind when i blinked up into the electricshot darkness i was alone i was unhurt why put me back it had said in my grave how had it known what i was most humans couldnt tell witches could tell sometimes and other animators always spotted me other animators shit dolph was suddenly there pulling me to my feet god blake are you hurt i shook my head what the hell was that light a halogen flashlight you damn near blinded me we couldnt see to shoot he said police had run past us in the darkness there were shouts of there it is dolph and i and the offending flashlight bright as day were left behind as the chase ran merrily on it spoke to me dolph i said what do you mean it spoke to you it asked me to put it back in its grave i stared up at him as i said it i wondered if my face looked like kis had pale eyes wide and black why wasnt i scared its old a century at least it was a voodoo something in life thats what went wrong thats why peter burke couldnt control it how do you know all this did it tell you i shook my head the way it looked i could judge the age it recognized me as someone who could lay it to rest only a witch or another animator could have recognized me for what i am my moneys on an animator does that change our plan he asked i stared up at him its killed how many people i didnt wait for him to answer we kill it period you think like a cop anita it was a great compliment from dolph and i took it as one it didnt matter what it had been in life so it had been an animator or rather a voodoo practioner so what it was a killing machine it hadnt killed me hadnt hurt me i couldnt afford to return the favor shots echoed far way some trick of the summer air made them echo dolph and i looked at each other i still had the browning in my hand lets do it he nodded we started running but he outdistanced me quickly his legs were as tall as i was i couldnt match his pace i might be able to run him into the ground but id never match his speed he hesitated glancing at me go on run i said he put on an extra burst of speed and was gone into the darkness he didnt even look back if you said you were fine in the dark with a killer zombie on the loose dolph would believe you or at least he believed me it was a compliment but it left me running alone in the dark for the second time tonight shouts were coming from two opposite directions they had lost it damn i slowed i had no desire to run into the thing blind it hadnt hurt me the first time but id put at least one bullet into it even a zombie gets pissed about things like that i was under the cool darkness of a tree shadow i was on the edge of the development a barbedwire fence cut across the entire back of the subdivision farmland stretched as far as i could see at least the field was planted in beans the zombied have to be lying flat to hide in there i caught glimpses of policemen with flashlights searching the darkness but they were all about fifty yards to either side of me they were searching the ground the shadows because id told them zombies didnt like to climb but this wasnt any ordinary zombie the tree rustled over my head the hair on my neck crawled down my spine i whirled looking upwards gun pointing it snarled at me and leapt i fired twice before its weight hit me and knocked us both to the ground two bullets in the chest and it wasnt even hurt i fired a third time but i might as well have been hitting a wall it snarled in my face broken teeth with dark stains breath foul as a new opened grave i screamed back wordless and pulled the trigger again the bullet hit it in the throat it paused trying to swallow to swallow the bullet those glittering eyes stared down at me there was someone home like domingas soullocked zombies there was someone looking out of those eyes we froze in one of those illusionary seconds that last years he was straddling my waist hands at my throat but not pressing not hurting not yet i had the gun under his chin none of the other bullets had hurt him why would this one didnt mean to kill it said softly didnt understand at firsst didnt remember what i wass the police were there on either side hesitating dolph screamed hold your fire hold your fire dammit i needed meat needed it to remember who i wass tried not to kill tried to walk past all the houssess but i could not too many houssess he whispered his hands tensed stained nails digging in i fired into his chin his body jerked backwards but the hands squeezed my neck pressure pressure tighter tighter i was beginning to see white star bursts on my vision the night was fading from black to grey i pressed the gun just above the bridge of his nose and pulled the trigger again and again my vision faded but i could still feel my hands pulling the trigger darkness flowed over my eyes and swallowed the world i couldnt feel my hands anymore i woke to screams horrible screams the stink of burning flesh and hair was thick and choking on my tongue i took a deep shaking breath and it hurt i coughed and tried to sit up dolph was there supporting me he had my gun in his hand i drew one ragged breath after another and coughed hard enough to make my throat raw or maybe the zombie had done that something the size of a man was rolling over the summer grass it burned it flamed with a clean orange light that sent the darkness shattering in fire shadows like the sun on water two exterminators in their fire suits stood by it covering it in napalm as if it were a ghoul the thing screamed high in its throat over and over one loud ragged shriek after another jesus why wont it die zerbrowski was standing nearby his face was orange in the firelight i didnt say anything i didnt want to say it out loud the zombie wouldnt die because it had been an animator when alive that much i knew about animator zombies what i hadnt known was that they came out of the grave craving flesh that they remembered only when they ate flesh that i hadnt known didnt want to know john burke stumbled into the firelight he was cradling one arm to his chest blood stained his clothing had the zombie whispered to john did he know why the thing wouldnt die the zombie whirled the fire roaring around it the body was like the wick of a candle it took one shaking step towards us its flaming hand reached out to me to me then it fell forward slowly into the grass it fell like a tree in slow motion fighting for life if that was the word the exterminators stayed ready taking no chances i didnt blame them it had been a necromancer once upon a time that burning hulk slowly catching the grass on fire had been what i was would i be a monster if raised from the grave would i better not to find out my will said cremation because i didnt want someone raising me just for kicks now i had another reason to do it one had been enough i watched the flesh blacken curl peel away muscles and bone popped in miniature explosions tiny pops of sparks i watched the zombie die and made a promise to myself id see dominga salvador burned in hell for what shed done there are fires that last for all eternity fires that make napalm look like a temporary inconvenience shed burn for all eternity and it wouldnt be half long enough i was lying on my back in the emergency room a white curtain hid me from view the noises on the other side of the curtain were loud and unfriendly i liked my curtain the pillow was flat the examining table was hard it felt white and clean and wonderful it hurt to swallow it even hurt a little bit just to breathe but breathing was important it was nice to be able to do it i lay there very quietly doing what i was told for once i listened to my breathing the beating of my own heart after nearly dying i am always very interested in my body i notice all sorts of things that go unnoticed during most of life i could feel blood coursing through the veins in my arms i could taste my calm orderly pulse in my mouth like a piece of candy i was alive the zombie was dead dominga salvador was in jail life was good dolph pushed the curtain back he closed the curtain like youd close a door to a room we both pretended we had privacy even though we could see peoples feet passing under the hem of the curtain i smiled up at him he smiled back nice to see you up and around i dont know about the up part i said my voice had a husky edge to it i coughed tried to clear it but it didnt really help whatd the doc say about your voice dolph asked im a temporary tenor at the look on his face i added itll pass good hows burke i asked stitches no permanent damage i had figured as much after seeing him last night but it was good to know and roberts shell live but will she be alright i had to swallow hard it hurt to talk shell be alright ki was cut up too on the arm did you know i shook my head and stopped in midmotion that hurt too didnt see it just a few stitches hell be fine dolph plunged his hands in his pants pockets we lost three officers one hurt worse than roberts but hell make it i stared up at him my fault he frowned how do you figure that i should have guessed i had to swallow it wasnt an ordinary zombie it was a zombie anita you were right you were the one who figured out it was hiding in one of those damn trash cans he grinned down at me and you nearly died killing it i think youve done your part didnt kill it exterminators killed it big words seemed to hurt more than little words do you remember what happened as you were passing out no you emptied your clip into its face blew its damn brains out the back of its head you went limp i thought you were dead godhe shook his headdont ever do that to me again i smiled ill try not to when its brains started leaking out the back of its head it stood up you took all the fight out of it zerbrowski pushed into the small space leaving the curtain gaping behind him i could see a small boy with a bloody hand crying into a womans shoulder dolph swept the curtain closed i bet zerbrowski was one of those people who never shut a drawer theyre still digging bullets out of the corpse and every bullets yours blake i just looked at him you are such a bad ass blake somebody has to be with you around zerbrow i couldnt finish his name it hurt it figures are you in pain dolph asked i nodded carefully the docs getting me painkiller already got tetanus booster youve got a necklace of bruises blossoming on that pale neck of yours zerbrowski said poetic i said he shrugged ill check in on the rest of the injured one more time then ill have a uniform drive you back to your place dolph said thanks i dont think youre in any condition to drive maybe he was right i felt like shit but it was happy shit wed done it wed solved the crime and people were going to jail for it yippee the doctor came back in with the painkillers he glanced at the two policemen right he handed me a bottle with three pills in it this should see you through the night and into the next day id call in sick if i were you he glanced at dolph as he said it you hear that boss dolph sort of frowned im not her boss youre the man in charge right the doctor asked dolph nodded then im on loan i said loan you might say we borrowed her from another department zerbrowski said the doctor nodded then tell her superior to let her off tomorrow she may not look as hurt as the others but shes had a nasty shock shes very lucky there was no permanent damage she doesnt have a superior zerbrowski said but well tell her boss he grinned at the doctor i frowned at zerbrowski well then youre free to go watch those scratches for infection and that bite on your shoulder he shook his head you cops earn your money with that parting wisdom he left zerbrowski laughed wouldnt do for the doc to know wed let a civie get messed up shes had a nasty shock dolph said very nasty zerbrowski said they started laughing i sat up carefully swinging my legs over the edge of the bed if you two are through yukking it up i need a ride home they were both laughing so hard that tears were creeping out of their eyes it hadnt been that funny but i understood for tension release laughter beats the hell out of tears i didnt join them because i suspected strongly that laughing would hurt ill drive you home zerbrowski gasped between giggles i had to smile seeing dolph and zerbrowski giggling was enough to make anyone smile no no dolph said you two in a car alone only one of you would come out alive and itd be me i said zerbrowski nodded aint it the truth nice to know there was one subject we agreed on i was half asleep in the back of the squad car when they pulled up in front of my apartment building the throbbing pain in my throat had slid away on a smooth tide of pain medication i felt nearly boneless what had the doctor given me it felt great but it was like the world was some sort of movie that had little to do with me distant and harmless as a dream id given dolph my car keys he promised to have someone park the car in front of my apartment building before morning he also said hed call bert and tell him i wouldnt be in to work today i wondered how bert would take the news i wondered if i cared nope one of the uniformed police officers leaned back over the seat and said you going to be alright miss blake ms i corrected automatically he gave me a half smile as he held the door for me no door handles on the inside of a squad car he had to hold the door for me but he did it with relish and said you going to be alright ms blake yes officeri had to blink to read his name tag osborn thank you for bringing me home to your partner too his partner was standing on the other side of the car leaning his arms on the roof of the car its a kick to finally meet the spook squads executioner he grinned as he said it i blinked at him and tried to pull all the pieces together enough to talk and think at the same time i was the executioner long before the spook squad came along he spread his hands still grinning no offense i was too tired and too drugged to worry about it i just shook my head thanks again i was a touch unsteady going up the stairs i clutched the railing like it was a lifeline id sleep tonight i might wake up in the middle of the hallway but id sleep it took me two tries to put the key in the door lock i staggered into my apartment leaning my forehead against the door to close it i turned the lock and was safe i was home i was alive the killer zombie was destroyed i had the urge to giggle but that was the pain medication i never giggle on my own i stood there leaning the top of my head against the door i was staring at the toes of my nikes they seemed very far away as if distances had grown since last i looked at my feet the doc had given me some weird shit i would not take it tomorrow it was too realityaltering for my taste the toes of black boots stepped up beside my nikes why were there boots in my apartment i started to turn around i started to go for my gun too late too slow too fucking bad strong brown arms laced across my chest pinning my arms pinning me against the door i tried to struggle now that it was too late but he had me i craned my neck backwards trying to fight off the damn medication i should have been terrified adrenaline pumping but some drugs dont give a shit if you need your body you belong to the drug until it wears off period i was going to hurt the doctor if i lived through this it was bruno pinning me to the door tommy came up on the right he had a needle in his hands no bruno cupped his hand over my mouth i tried to bite him and he slapped me the slap helped a little but the world was still cottoncoated distant brunos hand smelled like aftershave a choking sweetness this is almost too easy tommy said just do it bruno said i stared at the needle as it came closer to my arm i would have told them that i was drugged already if brunos hand hadnt been clasped over my mouth i would have asked what was in the syringe and whether it would react badly with what i had already taken i never got the chance the needle plunged in my body stiffened struggling but bruno held me tight couldnt move couldnt get away dammit dammit the adrenaline was finally chasing the cobwebs away but it was too late tommy took the needle out of my arm and said sorry we dont have any alcohol to swab it off with he grinned at me i hated him i hated them both and if the shot didnt kill me i was going to kill them both for scaring me for making me feel helpless for catching me unaware drugged and stupid if i lived through this mistake i wouldnt make it again please dear god let me live through this mistake bruno held me motionless and mute until i could feel the injection taking hold i was sleepy with a bad guy holding me against my will i was sleepy i tried to fight it but it didnt work my eyelids fluttered i struggled to keep them open i stopped trying to get away from bruno and put everything i had into not closing my eyes i stared at my door and tried to stay awake the door swam in dizzying ripples as if i were seeing it through water my eyelids went down jerked up down i couldnt open my eyes a small part of me fell screaming into the dark but the rest of me felt loose and sleepy and strangely safe i was in that faint edge of wakefulness where you know youre not quite asleep but dont really want to wake up either my body felt heavy my head throbbed and my throat was sore the last thought made me open my eyes i was staring at a white ceiling brown water marks traced the paint like spilled coffee i wasnt home where was i i remembered bruno holding me down the needle i sat up then the world swam in clear waves of color i fell back onto the bed covering my eyes with my hands that helped a little what had they given me i had an image in my mind that i wasnt alone somewhere in that dizzying swirl of color had been a person hadnt there i opened my eyes slower this time i was content to stare up at the waterruined ceiling i was on a large bed two pillows sheets a blanket i turned my head carefully and found myself staring into harold gaynors face he was sitting beside the bed it wasnt what i wanted to wake up to behind him leaning against a battered chest of drawers was bruno his shoulder holster cut black lines across his blue shortsleeved dress shirt there was a matching and equally scarred vanity table near the foot of the bed the vanity sat between two high windows they were boarded with new sweetsmelling lumber the scent of pine rode the hot still air i started to sweat as soon as i realized that there was no airconditioning how are you feeling ms blake gaynor asked his voice was still that jolly santa voice with an edge of sibilance as if he were a very happy snake ive felt better i said im sure you have you have been asleep for over twentyfour hours did you know that was he lying why would he lie about how long id been asleep what would it gain him nothing truth then probably what the hell did you give me bruno eased himself away from the wall he looked almost embarrassed we didnt realize youd already taken a sedative painkiller i said he shrugged same difference when you mix it with thorazine you shot me up with animal tranquilizers now now ms blake they use it in mental institutions as well not just animals gaynor said gee i said that makes me feel a lot better he smiled broadly if you feel good enough to trade witty repartee then youre well enough to get up witty repartee but he was probably right truthfully i was surprised i wasnt tied up glad of it but surprised i sat up much slower than last time the room only tilted the tiniest bit before settling into an upright position i took a deep breath and it hurt i put a hand to my throat it hurt to touch the skin who gave you those awful bruises gaynor asked lie or truth partial lie i was helping the police catch a bad guy he got a little out of hand what happened to this bad guy bruno asked hes dead now i said something flickered across brunos face too quick to read respect maybe naw you know why ive had you brought here dont you to raise a zombie for you i said to raise a very old zombie for me yes ive refused your offer twice what makes you think ill change my mind he smiled such a jolly old elf why ms blake ill have bruno and tommy persuade you of the error of your ways i still plan on giving you a million dollars to raise this zombie the price hasnt changed tommy offered me a million five last time i said that was if you came voluntarily we cant pay full price when you force us to take such chances like a federal prison term for kidnapping i said exactly your stubbornness has cost you five hundred thousand dollars was it really worth that i wont kill another human being just so you can go looking for lost treasure little wanda has been bearing tales i was just guessing gaynor i read a file on you and it mentioned your obsession with your fathers family it was an outright lie only wanda had known that im afraid its too late i know wanda talked to you shes confessed everything confessed i stared at him trying to read his blankly good humored face what do you mean confessed i mean i gave her to tommy for questioning hes not the artist that cicely is but he does leave more behind i didnt want to kill my little wanda where is she now do you care what happens to a whore his eyes were bright and birdlike as he stared at me he was judging me my reactions she doesnt mean anything to me i said i hoped my face was as bland as my words right now they werent going to kill her if they thought they could use her to hurt me they might are you sure listen i havent been sleeping with her shes just a chippie with a very bent angle he smiled at that what can we do to convince you to raise this zombie for me i will not commit murder for you gaynor i dont like you that much i said he sighed his applecheeked face looked like a sad kewpie doll you are going to make this difficult arent you ms blake i dont know how to make it easy i said i put my back to the cracked wooden headboard of the bed i was comfortable enough but i still felt a little fuzzy around the edges but it was as good as it was going to get for a while it beat the hell out of being unconscious we have not really hurt you yet gaynor said the reaction of the thorazine with whatever other medication you had in you was accidental we did not harm you on purpose i could argue with that but i decided not to so where do we go from here we have both your guns gaynor said without a weapon you are a small woman in the care of big strong men i smiled then im used to being the smallest kid on the block harry he looked pained harold or gaynor never harry i shrugged fine you are not in the least intimidated that we have you completely at our mercy i could argue that point he glanced up at bruno such confidence where does she get it bruno didnt say anything he just stared at me with those empty doll eyes bodyguard eyes watchful suspicious and blank all at the same time show her we mean business bruno bruno smiled a slow spreading of lips that left his eyes dead as a sharks he loosened his shoulders and did a few stretching exercises against the wall his eyes never left me i take it im going to be the punching bag i asked how well you put it gaynor said bruno stood away from the wall limber and eager oh well i slid off the bed on the opposite side i had no desire for gaynor to grab me brunos reach was over twice mine his legs went on forever he had to outweigh me by nearly a hundred pounds and it was all muscle i was about to get badly hurt but as long as they didnt tie me up id go down swinging if i could cause him any serious damage id be satisfied i came out from behind the bed hands loose at my side i was already in that partial crouch that i used on the judo mat i doubted seriously if brunos fighting skill of choice was judo i was betting karate or tae kwon do bruno stood in an awkwardlooking stance halfway between an x and a t it looked like someone had taken his long legs and crumbled them at the knees but as i moved forward he scooted backwards like a crab fast and out of reach jujitsu i made it half question he raised an eyebrow most people dont recognize it ive seen it i said you practice no he smiled then i am going to hurt you even if i knew jujitsu youd hurt me i said itd be a fair fight if two people are equal in skill size matters a good big person will always beat a good small person i shrugged i dont have to like it but its the truth youre being awful calm about this bruno said would being hysterical help he shook his head nope then id just as soon take my medicine like if youll excuse the expression a man he frowned at that bruno was accustomed to people being scared of him i wasnt scared of him id decided to take the beating with the decision came a certain amount of calm i was going to get beat up not pleasant but i had made my mind up to take the beating i could do it id done it before if my choices were a getting beat up or b performing human sacrifice id take the beating ready or not bruno said here you come i finished for him i was getting tired of the bravado either hit me or stand up straight you look silly crouched down like that his fist was a dark blur i blocked it with my arm the impact made the arm go numb his long leg kicked out and connected solidly with my stomach i doubled over like i was supposed to all the air gone in one movement his other foot came up and caught me on the side of the face it was the same cheek of seymour had smashed i fell to the floor not sure what part of my body to comfort first his foot came for me again i caught it with both hands i came up in a rush hoping to trap his knee between my arms and pop the joint but he twisted away from me totally airborne for a moment i dropped to the ground and felt the air pass overhead as his legs kicked out where my head had been i was on the ground again but by choice he stood over me impossibly tall from this angle i lay on my side knees drawn up he came for me evidently planning to drag me to my feet i kicked out with both feet at an angle to his kneecap hit it just right above or below and you dislocate it the leg buckled and he screamed it had worked hot damn i didnt try to wrestle him i didnt try to grab his gun i ran for the door gaynor grabbed for me but i flung open the door and was out in a long hallway before he could maneuver his fancy chair the hallway was smooth witha handful of doors and two blind corners and tommy tommy looked surprised to see me his hand went for his shoulder holster i pushed on his shoulder and footswept his leg he fell backwards and grabbed me as he fell i rode him down making sure my knee ground into his groin his grip loosened enough for me to slip out of reach there were sounds behind me from the room i didnt look back if they were going to shoot me i didnt want to see it the hallway took a sharp turn i was almost to it when the smell slowed me from a run to a walk the smell of corpses was just around the corner what had they been doing while i slept i glanced back at the men tommy was still lying on the floor cradling himself bruno leaned against the wall gun in hand but he wasnt pointing it at me gaynor was sitting in his chair smiling something was very wrong around the blind corner came that something that was wrong very very wrong it was no taller than a tall man maybe six feet but it was nearly four feet wide it had two legs or maybe three it was hard to tell the thing was leprously pale like all zombies but this one had a dozen eyes a mans face was centered where the neck would have been its eyes dark and seeing and empty of everything sane a dogs head was growing out of the shoulder the dogs decaying mouth snapped at me a womans leg grew out of the center of the mess complete with black highheeled shoe the thing shambled towards me pulling with three of a dozen arms dragging itself forward it left a trail behind it like a snail dominga salvador stepped around the corner buenas noches chica the monster scared me but the sight of dominga grinning at me scared me just a little bit more the thing had stopped moving forward it squatted in the hallway kneeling on its inadequate legs its dozens of mouths panted as if it couldnt get enough air or maybe the thing didnt like the way it smelled i certainly didnt covering my mouth and nose with my arm didnt block out much of the smell the hallway suddenly smelled like bad meat gaynor and his wounded bodyguards had stayed at the end of the hall maybe they didnt like being near domingas little pet i know it didnt do much for me whatever the reason we were isolated it was just her and me and the monster how did you get out of jail better to deal with more mundane problems first the mindmelting ones could wait for later i made my bail she said this quickly on a murder involving witchcraft voodoo is not witchcraft she said the law sees it as the same thing when it comes to murder she shrugged then smiled beatifically she was the mexican grandmother of my nightmares youve got a judge in your pocket i said many people fear me chica you should be one of them you helped peter burke raise the zombie for gaynor she just smiled why didnt you just raise it yourself i asked i didnt want someone as unscrupulous as gaynor to witness me murdering someone he might use it for blackmail and he didnt realize that you had to kill someone for peters grisgris correct she said you hid all your horrors here not all you forced me to destroy much of my work but this i saved you can see why she caressed a hand down the slimy hide i shuddered just the thought of touching that monstrosity was enough to make my skin cold and yet how did you make it i had to know it was so obviously a creation of our shared art that i had to know surely you can animate bits and pieces of the dead dominga said i could but no one else i had ever met could do it yes i said i found i could take these odds and ends and meld them together i stared at the shambling thing meld them the thought was too horrible i can create new creatures that have never existed before you make monsters i said believe what you will chica but i am here to persuade you to raise the dead for gaynor why dont you do it gaynors voice came from just behind us i whirled putting the wall at my back so i could watch everybody what good that would do me i wasnt sure domingas power went wrong once this is my last chance the last known grave i wont risk it on her domingas eyes narrowed her agethinned hands forming fists she didnt like being dismissed out of hand couldnt say i blamed her she could do it gaynor easier than i could if i truly believed that i would kill you because i wouldnt need you anymore hmm good point youve had bruno rough me up now what gaynor shook his head such a little girl to have taken both my bodyguards down i told you ordinary methods of persuasion will not work on her dominga said i stared past her at the slathering monster she called this ordinary what do you propose gaynor asked a spell of compulsion she will do as i bid but it takes time to do such a spell for one as powerful as she if she knew any voodoo to speak of it would not work at all but for all her art she is but a baby in voodoo how long will you need two hours no more this had better work gaynor said do not threaten me dominga said oh goody maybe the bad guys would fight and kill each other i am paying you enough money to set up your own small country i should get results for that dominga nodded her head you pay well that is true i will not fail you if i can compel anita to kill another person then i can compel her to help me in my zombie business she will help me rebuild what she forced me to destroy it has a certain irony no gaynor smiled like a demented elf i like it well i dont i said he frowned at me you will do as you are told you have been very naughty naughty me bruno had worked himself close to us he was leaning heavily on the wall but his gun was very steadily pointed at the center of my chest id like to kill you now he said his voice sounded raw with pain a dislocated knee hurts like hell doesnt it i smiled when i said it better dead than a willing servant of the voodoo queen i think he ground his teeth the gun wavered just a little but i think that was rage not pain i will enjoy killing you you didnt do so good last time i think the judges would have given the match to me there are no fucking judges here i am going to kill you bruno gaynor said we need her alive and whole after she raises the zombie bruno asked if she is a willing servant of the seсora then you are not to hurt her if the compulsion doesnt work then you may kill her bruno gave a fierce flash of teeth it was more snarl than smile i hope the spell fails gaynor glanced at his bodyguard dont let personal feelings interfere with business bruno bruno swallowed hard yes sir it didnt sound like a title that came easily to him enzo came around the corner behind dominga he stayed near the wall as far from her creation as he could get antonio had finally lost his job as bodyguard it was just as well he was much better suited to stool pigeon tommy came limping down the hall still sort of scrunched over himself the big magnum was in his hands his face was nearly purple with rage or maybe pain im gonna kill you he hissed take a number i said enzo you help bruno and tommy tie this little girl to a chair in the room shes a lot more dangerous than she seems gaynor said enzo grabbed my arm i didnt fight him i figured i was safer in his hands than either of the other two tommy and bruno both looked as if they were looking forward to me trying something i think they wanted to hurt me as enzo led me past them i said is it because im a woman or are you always this bad at losing im gonna shoot her tommy grunted later gaynor said later i wondered if he really meant that if domingas spell worked id be like a living zombie obeying her will if the spell didnt work then tommy and bruno would kill me a piece at a time i hoped there was a third choice the third choice was being tied to a chair in the room where i woke up it was the best of the three choices but that wasnt saying much i dont like being tied up it means your options have gone from few to none dominga had clipped some of my hair and the tips of my fingernails hair and nails for her compulsion spell shit the chair was old and straightbacked my wrists were tied to the slats that made up the back of the chair ankles tied separately to a leg of the chair the ropes were tight i tugged at the ropes hoping for some slack there wasnt any i had been tied up before and i always have this houdini fantasy that this time ill have enough slack to wiggle free it never works that way once youre tied up you stay tied up until someone lets you go the trouble was when they let me go they were going to try a nasty little spell on me i had to get away before then somehow i had to get away dear god please let me get away the door opened as if on cue but it wasnt help bruno entered carrying wanda in his arms blood had dried down the right side of her face from a cut above the eye her left cheek was ripe with a huge bruise the lower lip had burst in a still bleeding cut her eyes were shut i wasnt even sure she was conscious i had an aching line on the left side of my face where bruno had kicked me but it was nothing to wandas injuries now what i asked bruno some company for you when she wakes up ask her what else tommy did to her see if that will persuade you to raise the zombie i thought dominga was going to bespell me into helping you he shrugged gaynor doesnt put much faith in her since she screwed up so badly he doesnt give second chances i guess i said no he doesnt he laid wanda on the floor near me you best take his offer girl one dead whore and you get a million dollars take it youre going to use wanda for the sacrifice i said my voice sounded tired even to me gaynor dont give second chances i nodded hows your knee he grimaced i put it back in place that must have hurt like hell i said it did if you dont help gaynor youre going to find out exactly how much it hurt an eye for an eye i said he nodded and stood he favored his right leg he caught me looking at the leg talk to wanda decide what you want to end up as gaynors talking about making you a cripple then keeping you around as his toy you dont want that how can you work for him he shrugged pays real well money isnt everything spoken by somebody whos never gone hungry he had me there i just looked at him we stared at each other for a few minutes there was something human in his eyes at last i couldnt read it though whatever emotion it was it was nothing i understood he turned and left the room i stared down at wanda she lay on her side without moving she was wearing another long multicolored skirt a white blouse with a wide lace collar was halfripped from one shoulder the bra she wore was the color of plums i bet there had been panties to match before tommy got hold of her wanda i said it softly wanda can you hear me her head moved slowly painfully one eye opened wide and panicstricken the other eye was glued shut with dried blood wanda pawed at the eye frantic for a moment when she could open both eyes she blinked at me her eyes took a moment to focus and really see who it was what had she expected to see in those first few panicked moments i didnt want to know wanda can you speak yes the voice was soft but clear i wanted to ask if she was alright but i knew the answer to that if you can get over here and free me ill get us out of here she looked at me like id lost my mind we cant get out harolds gonna kill us she made that last sound like a statement of pure fact i dont believe in giving up wanda untie me and ill think of something hell hurt me if i help you she said hes planning on you being the human sacrifice to raise his ancestor how much more hurt can you get she blinked at me but her eyes were clearing it was almost as if panic were a drug and wanda was fighting off the influence or maybe it was harold gaynor who was the drug yeah that made sense she was a junkie a harold gaynor junkie every junkie is willing to die for one more fix but i wasnt untie me wanda please i can get us out of this and if you cant then were no worse off i said she seemed to think about that for a minute i strained for sounds from the hallway if bruno came back while we were in the middle of escaping it would be very bad wanda propped herself up on her arms her legs trailed out behind her under the skirt dead no movement at all she began dragging herself towards me i thought it would be slow work but she moved quickly the muscles in her arms bunched and pushed working well she was by the chair in a matter of minutes i smiled youre very strong my arms are all i have they have to be strong wanda said she started picking at the ropes that bound my right wrist its too tight you can do it wanda she picked at the knot with her fingers until after what seemed hours but was probably about five minutes i felt the rope give slack i had slack yea youve almost got it wanda i felt like a cheerleader the sound of footsteps clattered down the hall towards us wandas battered face stared up at me terror in her eyes theres not time she whispered go back where you were do it well finish later i said wanda handwalked back to where bruno had laid her she had just arranged herself into nearly the same position when the door opened wanda was pretending to be unconscious not a bad idea tommy stood in the doorway hed taken off his jacket and the black webbing of the shoulder rig stood out on his white polo shirt black jeans emphasized his pinchedin waist he looked topheavy from lifting so many weights hed added one new thing to the outfit a knife he twirled it in his hand like a baton it was almost a perfect sheen of light manual dexterity wowee i didnt know you used a knife tommy my voice sounded calm normal amazing he grinned i have a lot of talents gaynor wants to know if youve changed your mind about the zombie raising it wasnt exactly a question but i answered it i wont do it his grin widened i was hoping youd say that why i was afraid i knew the answer because he sent me in here to persuade you i stared at the glittering knife i couldnt help myself with a knife with something else long and hard but not so cold he said rape i asked the word sort of hung there in the hot still air he nodded grinning like a damn cheshire cat i wished i could make him disappear except for his smile i wasnt afraid of his smile it was the other end i was worried about i jerked at the ropes helplessly the right wrist gave a little more had wanda loosened the rope enough had she please god let it be tommy stood over me i stared up the length of his body and what i saw in his eyes was nothing human there were all sorts of ways to become a monster tommy had found one there was nothing but an animal hunger in his gaze nothing human left he put a leg on either side of the chair straddling me without sitting down his flat stomach was pressed against my face his shirt smelled of expensive aftershave i jerked my head back trying not to touch him he laughed and ran fingers through the tight waves of my hair i tried to jerk my head out of his reach but he grabbed a handful of hair and forced my head back im going to enjoy this he said i didnt dare jerk at the ropes if my wrist came free hed see it i had to wait wait until he was distracted enough not to notice the thought of what i might have to do to distract him allow him to do to me made my stomach hurt but staying alive was the goal everything else was gravy i didnt really believe that but i tried he sat down on me his weight settling on my legs his chest was pressed against my face and there was nothing i could do about it he rubbed the flat of the knife across my cheek you can stop this anytime just say yes and ill tell gaynor his voice was already growing thick i could feel him growing hard where he was pressed against my belly the thought of tommy using me like that was almost enough to make me say yes almost i jerked on the ropes and the right one gave a little more one more hard tug and i could get free but id have just one hand to tommys two and he had a gun and a knife not good odds but it was the best i was going to get tonight he kissed me forcing his tongue in my mouth i didnt respond because he wouldnt have believed that i didnt bite his tongue either because i wanted him close with only one hand free i needed him close i needed to do major damage with one hand what what could i do he nuzzled my neck face buried in my hair on the left side now or never i pulled with everything i had and the right wrist popped free i froze surely hed felt it but he was too busy sucking on my neck to notice his free hand massaged my breast he had his eyes closed as he kissed to the right side of my neck his eyes were closed the knife was loose in his other hand nothing i could do about the knife had to take the chance had to do it i caressed the side of his face and he nuzzled my hand then his eyes opened it had occurred to him that i was supposed to be tied i plunged my thumb into his open eye i dug it in feeling the wet pop as his eye exploded he shrieked rearing back hand to his eye i grabbed the wrist with the knife and held on the screams were going to bring reinforcements dammit strong arms wrapped around tommys waist and pulled him backwards i grabbed the knife as he slid to the floor wanda was struggling to hold him the pain was so severe it hadnt occurred to him to go for his gun putting out an eye hurts and panics a lot more than a kick to the groin i cut my other hand free and knicked my arm doing it if i hurried too much id end up slitting my own wrist i forced myself to be more careful slicing my ankles free tommy had managed to get free of wanda he staggered to his feet one hand still over the eye blood and clear liquid trailed down his face ill kill you he reached for his gun i reversed my grip on the knife and threw it it thunked into his arm id been aiming for his chest he screamed again i picked up the chair and smashed it into his face wanda grabbed his ankles and tommy went down i pounded at his face with the chair until the chair broke apart in my hands then i beat him with a chair leg until his face was nothing but a bloody mess hes dead wanda said she was tugging at my pants leg hes dead lets get out of here i dropped the bloodcoated chair leg and collapsed to my knees i couldnt swallow i couldnt breathe i was splattered with blood id never beaten someone to death before it had felt good i shook my head later id worry about it later wanda put an arm over my shoulders i grabbed her around the waist and we stood she weighed a lot less than she should have i didnt want to see what was under the pretty skirt it wasnt a full set of legs but for once that was good she was easier to move i had tommys gun in my right hand i need this hand free so hold on tight wanda nodded her face was very pale i could feel her heart pounding against her ribs were going to get out of this i said sure but her voice was shaky i dont think she believed me i wasnt sure i believed me wanda opened the door and out we went the hallway was just like i remembered it a long stretch with no cover then a blind corner at each end right or left i whispered to wanda i dont know this house is like a maze right i think we went right because at least it was a decision the worst thing we could do was just stand there waiting for gaynor to come back i heard footsteps behind us i started to turn but with wanda in my arms i was slow the gunshot echoed in the hallway something hit my left arm around wandas waist the impact spun me around and sent us both crashing to the floor i ended up on my back with my left arm trapped under wandas weight the left arm was totally numb cicely stood at the end of the hallway she held a small caliber handgun twohanded her long long legs were far apart she looked like she knew what she was doing i raised the and aimed at her still lying flat on my back on the floor it was an explosion of sound that left my ears ringing the recoil thrust my hand skyward backwards it was everything i could do not to drop the gun if id needed a second shot id have never gotten it off in time but i didnt need a second shot cicely lay crumpled in the middle of the hallway blood was spreading on the front of her blouse she didnt move but that didnt mean anything her gun was still gripped in one hand she could be pretending then when i walked up shed shoot me but i had to know can you get off my arm please i asked wanda didnt say anything but she lifted herself to a sitting position and i could finally see my arm it was still attached goody blood was seeping down my arm in a crimson line a point of icy burning had started to chase away the numbness i liked the numbness better i did my best to ignore the arm as i stood up and walked towards cicely i had the magnum pointed at her if she so much as twitched id hit her again her miniskirt had hiked up her thighs displaying black garters and matching underwear how undignified i stood over her staring down cicely wasnt going to twitch not voluntarily her silk blouse was soaked with blood a hole big enough for me to put my fist through took up most of her chest dead very dead i kicked the out of her hand just in case you can never tell with someone who plays voodoo ive had people get up before with worse injuries cicely just lay there bleeding i was lucky shed had a ladylike caliber pistol anything bigger and i might have lost the arm i stuck her pistol in the front of my pants because i couldnt figure out where else to put it i did click the safety on first id never been shot before bitten stabbed beaten burned but never shot it scared me because i wasnt sure how badly i was hurt i walked back to wanda her face was pale her brown eyes like islands in her face is she dead i nodded youre bleeding she said she tore a strip from her long skirt here let me wrap it i knelt and let her tie the multicolored strip just above the wound she wiped the blood away with another piece of skirt it didnt look that bad it looked almost like a raw bloody scrap i think the bullet just grazed me i said a flesh wound nothing but a flesh wound it burned and was almost cold at the same time maybe the cold was shock one little bullet graze and i was going into shock surely not come on weve got to get out of here the shots will bring bruno it was good that i had pain in the arm it meant i could feel and i could move the arm the arm did not want to be wrapped around wandas waist again but it was the only way to move her and keep my right hand free lets go left maybe cicely came in this way wanda said there was a certain logic to that we turned and walked past cicelys body she lay there blue eyes staring impossibly wide there is never a look of horror on the face of the newly dead more surprise than anything as if death had caught them while they werent looking wanda stared down at the body as we passed it she whispered i never thought shed die first we rounded the corner and came facetoface with domingas monster the monster stood in the middle of a narrow little hall that seemed to take up most of the back of the house manypaned windows lined the wall and in the middle of those windows was a door through the windows i could see black night sky the door led outside the only thing standing between us and freedom was the monster the only thing sheesh the shambling mound of body parts struggled towards us wanda screamed and i didnt blame her i raised the magnum and sighted on the human face in the middle the shot echoed like captive thunder the face exploded in a welter of blood and flesh and bone the smell was worse like rotten fur on the back of my throat the mouths screamed an animal howling at its wound the thing kept coming but it was hurt it seemed confused as to what to do now had i taken out the dominant brain was there a dominant brain no way to be sure i fired three more times exploding three more heads the hallway was full of brains and blood and worse the monster kept coming the gun clicked on empty i threw the gun at it one clawed hand batted it away i didnt bother trying the if the magnum couldnt stop it the sure as hell couldnt we started backing down the hallway what else could we do the monster pulled its twisted bulk after us it was that same sliding sound that had chased manny and i out of domingas basement i was looking at her caged horror the flesh between the different textures of skin fur and bone was seamless no frankenstein stitches it was like the different pieces had melted together like wax i tripped over cicelys body too busy watching the monster to see where my feet were we sprawled across her body wanda screamed the monster scrambled forward misshapen hands grabbed at my ankles i kicked at it struggling to climb over cicelys body away from it a claw snagged in my jeans and pulled me towards it it was my turn to scream what had once been a mans hand and arm wrapped around my ankle i grabbed onto cicelys body her flesh was still warm the monster pulled us both easily the extra weight didnt slow it down my hands scrambled at the bare wood floor nothing to hold on to i stared back at the thing eager rotting mouths yawned at me broken discolored teeth tongues working like putrid snakes in the openings god wanda grabbed my arm trying to hold me but without legs to brace she just succeeded in being pulled closer to the thing let go i screamed it at her she did screaming anita i was screaming myself no stop it stop it i put everything i had into that yell not volume but power it was just another zombie that was all if it wasnt under specific orders it would listen to me it was just another zombie i had to believe that or die stop right now my voice broke with the edge of hysteria i wanted nothing more than just to start screaming and never stop the monster froze with my foot halfway to one of its lower mouths the mismatched eyes stared at me expectantly i swallowed and tried to sound calm though the zombie wouldnt care release me it did my heart was threatening to come out my mouth i lay back on the floor for a second relearning how to breathe when i looked up the monster was still sitting there waiting waiting for orders like a good little zombie stay here do not move from this spot i said the eyes just stared at me obedient as only the dead can be it would sit there in the hallway until it got specific orders contradicting mine thank you dear god that a zombie is a zombie is a zombie whats happening wanda asked her voice was broken into sobs she was near hysterics i crawled to her its alright ill explain later we have a little time but we cant waste it weve got to get out of here she nodded tears sliding down her bruised face i helped her up one last time we limped towards the monster wanda shied away from it pulling on my sore arm its alright it wont hurt us if we hurry i had no idea how close dominga was i didnt want her changing the orders while we were right next to it we stayed near the wall and squeezed past the thing eyes on the back of the body if it had a back and a front followed our progress the smell from the running wounds was nearly overwhelming but what was a little gagging between friends wanda opened the door to the outside world hot summer wind blew our hair into spider silk strands across our faces it felt wonderful why hadnt gaynor and the rest come to the rescue they had to have heard the gunshots and the screaming the gunshots at least would have brought somebody we stumbled down three stone steps to the gravel of a turn around i stared off into the darkness at hills covered in tall waving grass and decaying tombstones the house was the caretakers house at burrell cemetery i wondered what gaynor had done to the caretaker i started to lead wanda away from the cemetery towards the distant highway then stopped i knew why no one had come now the sky was thick and black and so heavy with stars if id had a net i could have caught some there was a high hot wind blowing against the stars i couldnt see the moon too much starlight on the hot seeking fingers of the wind i felt it the pull dominga salvador had completed her spell i stared off into the rows of headstones and knew i had to go to her just as the zombie had had to obey me i had to obey her there was no saving throw no salvaging it as easy as that i was caught i stood very still on the gravel wanda moved in my arms turning to look at me her face by starlight was incredibly pale was mine as pale was the shock spread over my face like moonlight i tried to take a step forward to carry wanda to safety i could not take a step forward i struggled until my legs were shaking with the effort i couldnt leave whats the matter we have to get out of here before gaynor comes back wanda said i know i said then what are you doing i swallowed something cold and hard in my throat my pulse was thudding in my chest i cant leave what are you talking about there was an edge of hysteria to wandas voice hysterics sounded perfect i promised myself a complete nervous breakdown if we got out of here alive if i could ever leave i fought against something that i couldnt see or touch but it held me solid i had to stop or my legs were going to collapse we had enough problems in that direction already if i couldnt go forward maybe backwards i backed up a step two steps yeah that worked where are you going wanda asked into the cemetery i said why good question but i wasnt sure i could explain it so that wanda would understand i didnt understand it myself how could i explain it to anyone else i couldnt leave but did i have to take wanda back with me would the spell allow me to leave her here i decided to try i laid her down on the gravel easy some of my choices were still open why are you leaving me she clutched at me terrified me too make it to the road if you can i said on my hands she asked she had a point but what could i do do you know how to use a gun no should i leave her the gun or should i take it with me and maybe get a chance to kill dominga if this worked like ordering a zombie then i could kill her if she didnt specifically forbid me to do it because i still had free will of a sort theyd bring me then send someone back for wanda she was to be the sacrifice i handed her the i clicked off the safety its loaded and its ready to fire i said since you dont know anything about guns keep it hidden until enzo or bruno is right on top of you then fire pointblank you cant miss at pointblank range why are you leaving me a spell i think i said her eyes widened what kind of spell one that allows them to order me to come to them one that forbids me to leave oh god she said yeah i said i smiled down at her a reassuring smile that was all lie ill try to come back for you she just stared at me like a kid whose parents left her in the dark before all the monsters were gone she clutched the gun in her hands and watched me walk off into the darkness the long dry grass hissed against my jeans the wind blew the grass in pale waves tombstones loomed out of the weeds like the backs of small walls or the humps of sea monsters i didnt have to think where i was going my feet seemed to know the way was this how a zombie felt when ordered to come no you had to be within hearing distance of a zombie you couldnt do it from this far away dominga salvador stood at the crown of a hill she was highlighted against the moon it was sinking towards dawn it was still night but the end of night everything was still velvet silver deep pockets of night shadows but there was the faintest hint of dawn on the hot wind if i could delay until dawn i couldnt raise the zombie maybe the compulsion would fade too if i was luckier than i deserved dominga was standing inside a dark circle there was a dead chicken at her feet she had already made a circle of power all i had to do was step into it and slaughter a human being over my dead body if necessary harold gaynor sat in his electric wheelchair on the opposite side of the circle he was outside of it safe enzo and bruno stood by him safe only dominga had risked the circle she said where is wanda i tried to lie to say she was safe but truth spilled out of my mouth shes down by the house on the gravel why didnt you bring her you can only give me one order at a time you ordered me to come i came stubborn even now how curious she said enzo go fetch the girl we need her enzo walked away over the dry rustling grass without a word i hoped wanda killed him i hoped she emptied the gun into him no save a few bullets for bruno dominga had a machete in her right hand its edge was black with blood enter the circle anita she said i tried to fight it tried not to do it i stood there on the verge of the circle almost swaying i stepped across the circle tingled up my spine but it wasnt closed i dont know what shed done to it but it wasnt closed the circle looked solid enough but it was still open still waiting for the sacrifice shots echoed in the darkness dominga jumped i smiled what was that i think it was your bodyguard biting the big one i said what did you do i gave wanda a gun she slapped me with her empty hand it wouldnt really have hurt but she slapped the same cheek bruno and whatshisname had hit id been smacked three times in the same place the bruise was going to be a beauty dominga looked at something behind me and smiled i knew what it would be before i turned and saw it enzo was carrying wanda up the hill dammit id heard more than one shot had she panicked and shot too soon wasted her ammunition damn wanda was screaming and beating her small fists against enzos broad back if we were alive come morning i would teach wanda better things to do with her fists she was crippled not helpless enzo carried her over the circle until it closed everyone could pass over it without breaking the magic he dropped wanda to the ground holding her arms out behind her at a painful angle she still struggled and screamed i didnt blame her get bruno to hold her still the death needs to be one blow i said dominga nodded yes it does she motioned for bruno to enter the circle he hesitated but gaynor told him do what she says bruno didnt hesitate after that gaynor was his greenback god bruno grabbed one of wandas arms with a man on each arm and her legs useless she was still moving too much kneel and hold her head still i said enzo dropped first putting a big hand on the back of wandas head he held her steady she started to cry bruno knelt putting his free hand on her shoulders to help steady her it was important for the death to be a single blow dominga was smiling now she handed me a small brown jar of ointment it was white and smelled heavily of cloves i used more rosemary in mine but cloves were fine how did you know what i needed i asked manny to tell me what you used he wouldnt tell you shit he would if i threatened his family dominga laughed oh dont look so sad he didnt betray you chica manuel thought i was merely curious about your powers i am you know youll see soon enough wont you i said she gave a sort of bow from the neck place the ointment on yourself in the appointed places i rubbed ointment on my face it was cool and waxy the cloves made it smell like candy i smeared it on over my heart under my shirt both hands last the tombstone now all we needed was the sacrifice dominga told me do not move i stayed where i was frozen as if by magic was her monster still frozen in the hallway like i was now dominga laid the machete on the grass near the edge of the circle then she stepped out of the circle raise the dead anita she said ask gaynor one question first please that please hurt but it worked she looked at me curiously what question is this ancestor also a voodoo priest i asked what difference does it make gaynor asked you fool dominga said she whirled on him hands in fists that is what went wrong the first time you made me think it was my powers what are you babbling about he asked when you raise a voodoo priest or an animator sometimes the magic goes wrong i said why he asked your ancestors magic interfered with my magic dominga said are you sure this ancestor had no voodoo not to my knowledge he said did you know about the first one i asked yes why didnt you tell me dominga said her power blazed around her like a dark nimbus would she kill him or did she want the money more i didnt think it was important i think dominga was grinding her teeth i didnt blame her hed cost her her reputation and a dozen lives he saw nothing wrong with it but dominga didnt strike him dead greed wins out get on with it gaynor said or dont you want your money do not threaten me dominga said peachy keen the bad guys were going to fight among themselves i am not threatening you seсora i merely will not pay unless this zombie is raised dominga took a deep breath she literally squared her shoulders and turned back to me do as i ordered raise the dead i opened my mouth to think of some other excuse to delay dawn was coming it had to come no more delays raise the dead anita now that last word had the tone of a command i swallowed hard and walked towards the edge of the circle i wanted to get out to leave but i couldnt i stood there leaning against that invisible barrier it was like beating against a wall that i couldnt feel i stayed there straining until my entire body trembled i took a deep shaking breath i picked up the machete wanda said no anita please please dont she struggled but she couldnt move she would be an easy kill easier than beheading a chicken with one hand and i did that almost every night i knelt in front of wanda enzos hand on the back of her head kept her from moving but she whimpered a desperate sound low in her throat god help me i placed the machete under her neck and told enzo raise her head up so i can make sure of the kill he grabbed a handful of hair and bowed her neck at a painful angle her eyes were showing a lot of white even by moonlight i could see the pulse in her throat i placed the machete back against her neck her skin was solid and real under the blade i raised it just above her flesh not touching for an instant i drove the machete straight up into enzos throat the point speared his throat blood gushed out in a black wave everyone froze for an instant but me i jerked the machete out of enzo and plunged it into brunos gut his hand with the gun halfdrawn fell away i leaned on the machete and drew it up towards his throat his insides spilled out in a warm rush the smell of fresh death filled the circle blood sprayed all over my face chest hands coating me it was the last step and the circle closed id felt a thousand circles close but nothing like this the shock of it left me gasping i couldnt breathe over the rush of power it was like an electric current was running over my body my skin ached with it wanda was covered in other peoples blood she was having hysterics in the grass please please dont kill me dont kill me please i didnt have to kill wanda dominga had told me to raise the dead and i would do just that killing animals never gave me this kind of rush it felt like my skin was going to crawl off on its own i shoved the power flowing through me into the ground but not just into the grave in the circle i had too much power for just one grave too much power for just a handful of graves i felt the power spreading outward like ripples in a pool out and out until the power was spread thick and clean over the ground every grave that i had walked for dolph every grave but the ones with ghosts because that was a type of soul magic and necromancy didnt work around souls i felt each grave each corpse i felt them coalesce from dust and bone fragments to things that were barely dead at all arise from your graves all dead within sound of my call arise and serve me without naming them all i shouldnt have been able to call a single one from the grave but the power of two human deaths was too much for the dead to resist they rose upward like swimmers through water the ground rippled underfoot like a horses skin what are you doing dominga asked raising the dead i said maybe it showed in my voice maybe she felt it whatever she started running towards the circle but it was too late hands tore through the earth at domingas feet dead hands grabbed her ankles and sent her sprawling into the long grass i lost sight of her but i didnt lose control of the zombies i told them kill her kill her the grass shuddered and surged like water the sound of muscles pulling away from bone in wet thick pieces filled the night bones broke with sharp cracks over the sounds of tearing flesh dominga shrieked there was one last wet sound thick and full domingas screams broke off abruptly i felt the dead hands tearing out her throat her blood splattered the grass like a black sprinkler her spell shredded on the wind but i didnt need her urging now the power had me i was riding it like a bird on a current of air it held me lifted me it felt solid and insubstantial as air the dry sunken earth cracked open over gaynors ancestors grave a pale hand shot skyward a second hand came through the crack the zombie tore the dry earth i heard other old graves breaking in the still summer night it broke its way out of his grave just like gaynor had wanted gaynor sat in his wheelchair on the crest of the hill he was surrounded by the dead dozens of zombies in various stages of decay crowded close to him but i hadnt given the order yet they wouldnt hurt him unless i told them to ask him where the treasure is gaynor shouted i stared at him and every zombie turned with my eyes and stared at him too he didnt understand gaynor was like a lot of people with money they mistake money for power it isnt the same thing at all kill the man harold gaynor i said it loud enough to carry on the still air ill give you a million dollars for having raised him whether i find the treasure or not gaynor said i dont want your money gaynor i said the zombies were moving in on every side slow hands extended like every horror movie youve ever seen sometimes hollywood is accurate whatta ya know two million three million his voice was breaking with fear hed had a better seat for domingas death than i had he knew what was coming four million not enough i said how much he shouted name your price i couldnt see him now the zombies hid him from view no money gaynor just you dead thats enough he started screaming wordlessly i felt the hands begin to rip at him teeth to tear wanda grabbed my legs dont dont hurt him please i just stared at her i was remembering benjamin reynoldss bloodcoated teddy bear the tiny hand with that stupid plastic ring on it the bloodsoaked bedroom the baby blanket he deserves to die i said my voice sounded separate from me distant and echoing it didnt sound like me at all you cant just murder him wanda said watch me i said she tried to climb my body but her legs betrayed her and she fell in a heap at my feet sobbing i didnt understand how wanda could beg for his life after what he had done to her love i suppose in the end she really did love him and that perhaps was the saddest thing of all when gaynor died i knew it when pieces of him stained almost every hand and mouth of the dead they stopped they turned to me waiting for new orders the power was still buoying me up i wasnt tired was there enough to lay them all to rest i hoped so go back all of you go back to your graves rest in the quiet earth go back go back they stirred like a wind had blown through them then one by one they went back to their graves they lay down on the hard dry earth and the graves just swallowed them whole it was like magic quicksand the earth shuddered underfoot like a sleeper moving to a more comfortable position some of the corpses had been as old as gaynors ancestor which meant that i didnt need a human death to raise one threehundredyearold corpse bert was going to be pleased human deaths seemed to be cumulative two human deaths and i had emptied a cemetery it wasnt possible but id done it anyway whatta ya know the first light of dawn passed like milk on the eastern sky the wind died with the light wanda knelt in the bloody grass crying i knelt beside her she jerked back at my touch i guess i couldnt blame her but it bothered me anyway we have to get out of here you need a doctor i said she stared up at me what are you today for the first time i didnt know how to answer that question human didnt seem to cover it im an animator i said finally she just kept staring at me i wouldnt have believed me either but she let me help her up i guess that was something but she kept looking at me out of the edge of her eyes wanda considered me one of the monsters she may have been right wanda gasped eyes wide i turned too slowly was it the monster jeanclaude stepped out of the shadows i didnt breathe for a moment it was so unexpected what are you doing here i asked your power called to me ma petite no dead in the city could fail to feel your power tonight and i am the city so i came to investigate how long have you been here i saw you kill the men i saw you raise the graveyard did it ever occur to you to help me you did not need any help he smiled barely visible in the moonlight besides would it not have been tempting to rend me to pieces as well you cant possibly be afraid of me i said he spread his hands wide youre afraid of your human servant little of moi not afraid ma petite but cautious he was afraid of me it almost made some of this shit worthwhile i carried wanda down the hill she wouldnt let jeanclaude touch her a choice of monsters dominga salvador missed her court date fancy that dolph had searched for me that night after he discovered that dominga had made bail he had found my apartment empty my answers about where i had gone didnt satisfy him but he let it go what else could he do they found gaynors wheelchair but no trace of him its one of those mysteries to tell around campfires the empty bloodcoated wheelchair in the middle of the cemetery they did find body parts in the caretakers house animal and human only domingas power had held the thing together when she died it died thank goodness theory was that the monster got gaynor where the monster came from no one seemed to know i was called in to explain the body parts thats how the police knew theyd once been attached irving wanted to know what i really knew about gaynors vanishing act i just smiled and played inscrutable irving didnt believe me but all he had were suspicions suspicions arent a news story wanda is waiting tables downtown jeanclaude offered her a job at the laughing corpse she declined not politely shed saved quite a bit of money from her business i dont know if shell make it or not but with gaynor gone she seems free to try she was a junkie whose drug of choice was dead it was better than rehab by catherines wedding the bullet wound was just a bandage on my arm the bruises on my face and neck had turned that sickly shade of greenishyellow it clashed with the pink dress i gave catherine the option of me not being in the wedding the wedding coordinator was all for that but catherine wouldnt hear of it the wedding coordinator applied makeup to the bruises and saved the day i have a picture of me standing in that awful dress with catherines arm around me were both smiling friendship is strange stuff jeanclaude sent me a dozen white roses in the hospital the card read come to the ballet with me not as my servant but as my guest i didnt go to the ballet i had enough problems without dating the master of the city i had performed human sacrifice and it had felt good the rush of power was like the memory of painful sex part of you wanted to do it again maybe dominga salvador was right maybe power talks to everyone even me i am an animator i am the executioner but now i know im something else the one thing my grandmother flores feared most i am a necromancer the dead are my specialty
