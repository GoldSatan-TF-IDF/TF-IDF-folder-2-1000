phil rickman the cure of souls one special it was really getting to jane now tormenting her nights raiding her head as soon as she awoke in the mornings the way things did when there was nobody like nobody you could tell im sixteen years old and im feeling deeply isolated she walked numbly out of the school with its acrid anxietysmell and into the sunsplashed quadrangle where scott eagles and sigourney jones were already into a fullblown feely snog almost directly under the staffroom window the big statement this was jones and eagles telling the sad old gits in the staffroom that the english language gcse that they and jane and a bunch of other kids had just completed was like all the other gcses the focus of their schoollife for the past four or five years of truly minuscule significance in comparison with their incredible obsession with one another yes having done their sleeping around they were into something longterm and meaningful lifepartners possibly an awesome thing jane however felt like part of some other species sixteen years old and she closed her eyes on the superior superglued lovers walked away from the whole naff sixties edifice of concrete and washedout brick sinking slowly into the pitted asphalt exercise yard which the head liked to call a quadrangle she needed out of here like now and yet she kept wishing the term still had weeks to run so how was it for you jane huh she spun round the sun was a slap in the face candida butler was shimmering alongside her tall and cool the words head girl material shining out of her sweatless forehead as they probably had since she was ten the exam jane candida wrinkled a sensible nose at the jonesandeagles show her own boyfriend was at cambridge reading astrophysics an older guy natch candida who was never going to be called candy by anyone was serene and focused and knew it pity the essay titles were all so crap jane said did you think so candida looked mildly surprised shed have opted for the utterly safe and anodyne my grandmothers attic anyway its another one over thats the main thing she looked down at jane with that soft mature smile so what are you going to be doing with yourself this summer the suns reflection lasered out of the plateglass doors of the new science block danny gittoes and dean wall who probably still couldnt get the letters gcse in the right order came out of the toilets grinning and ripping off their school ties in preparation for another bid to get served in the royal oak where the teachers drank went without saying that they wouldnt be coming back in the autumn jane wished it was already winter she wished she could spend the next seven weeks holed up in her own attic apartment under the mondrian walls with a pile of comfort reading i am sixteen and im an old maid im going on holiday for a couple of weeks she said miserably with my boyfriend at his familys holiday home from the edge of the quad where it met the secondary playing fields you could see across miles of open countryside to the black mountains on the horizon on the other side of the mountains was wales another country eirions country on the edge of wales probably nearly a hundred miles away was the pembrokeshire coast where eirions family had their fivebedroom holiday cottage where you could go surfing and walk the famous coastal path and lose your virginity that kind of thing some people have all the luck said candida were kind of constrained this year because roberts got a holiday job at his cousins software plant near cheltenham beats strangling poor bloody chickens at sun valley i suppose candidas wealthy farming family probably had major shares in sun valley welsh isnt he your guy not sos youd notice jane blushed then furious with herself she went over the top again i mean he doesnt shag any old sheep candidas eyes narrowed are you all right jane yeah jane sighed fine candida patted janes shoulder see you next term then on the a level treadmill sure jane watched candida stride confidently across the quad towards the car park where her mother would be waiting for her in the secondbest range rover janes own mum ancient clanking volvo would be a while yet shed had an early funeral to conduct alfred rokes whod gone out at a hundred and two having still been blacksmithing at ninety so nothing too sorrowful there and then a little grief here maybe the bishop was expected to call in with a good hour to kill jane could have strolled round the back for a cigarette if shed been into tobacco but when your mum smoked like a chimney what was the point janes nails dug into her palms an old maid who didnt even smoke what kind of life was this ok the problem the problem was that eirion was giving every impression of wanting to move them up to the scott eaglessigourney jones relationship level jane watched jones and eagles heading hand in hand for the students car park scott had passed his test on his seventeenth birthday hed been driving land rovers since his feet could reach the pedals which had probably been around the age of nine because he was a tall guy maybe fully grown now adult experienced also eirion himself sexy enough in his stocky amiable way had obviously been putting it about for years well you know i was in this band he would say oh eirion had been around no question and he could have had jane too by now she would have had sex with him no arguments in the back of the car or somewhere anywhere she just wanted the bloody thing cleared away like dirty dishes everybody said the first time was crap anyway this messy chore to be undergone before you could start enjoying it but eirion would gently detach her clammy little hand from his belt i want this to be proper hed mumble do you know what im saying proper like what did proper have to do with it i dont want this to be ordinary you know runofthemill me and you were and then hed go all embarrassed looking out of the car window at the moon jesus ordinary listen ordinary would have been just fine by jane who had no illusions didnt expect rockets and catherine wheels ordinary wouldve been an enormous relief she found herself stomping across the playing field between the tennis courts panting with anguish under the merciless sun a torrid sun guaranteed to turn the pembrokeshire coast into palm beach did eirions fatcat family have their own beach did they all sprawl around naked and uninhibited like just because they were welsh didnt mean they were all buttonedup and chapelwhipped necessarily probably the reverse she and the young master would be assigned a double room and presented with a gross of condoms shit she shouldnt be feeling like this because back in the exam room shed probably done ok you always sensed it shed get her ten gcses and then come back in september and do some a levels come back as an adult with a lover she swallowed so eirion at seventeen was experienced and mature had done the rounds and had met jane who was sexually backward to what in this day and age was a frightening extent and she had become like special to him maybe because when theyd first met shed been physically hurt by someone shed thought was a friend and hed felt protective and stuff and that was ok that was acceptable and special yeah ok that was flattering or would have been flattering if she was ready to be special which might have been the case if thered been others or least one other before eirion but the first guy you actually did it with at the age of sixteen really should not be special should he not longterm special not jonesandeagles special not the very first guy why the hell had she said shed go there jane began to blink back tears seriously unravelled not knowing what she wanted except not to be a virgin not to be a virgin now not to have to take this useless lump of excess baggage with her to the holiday cottage in fact if thered been some notoveracned sixthformer wandering towards her right now shed probably have been tempted to make him an offer he couldnt refuse just to get it out of the way sure she was alone on the playing field somewhere in the distance she could hear howls of laughter wall and gittoes on the loose ready to crash the royal oak pick a fight with a teacher their last week at school the week theyd been dreaming of for five long years they were adults now too official even wall and gittoes were adults panic seized jane and she stood there feeling exposed the sun directly above her like a hot baleful eye she was a child still a child ahead of her was the groundsmans concrete shed a square bunker standing out on its own the groundsman was called steve and he was about thirty and had big lips like a horse and this huge beer gut he was a useful guy to know however because of this concrete shed a safe house where card schools could meet cigs and dope could be smoked and es and stuff exchanged steve would also deal the stuff himself it was rumoured but not with everybody he was very careful and very selective lowersixthformers kirsty ryan and layla riddock were less selective they laughed openly at steve but sometimes went into his shed with him after school and what did slobbery steve give them in return nobody knew but it was rumoured that he could get actual cocaine for anyone who offered that kind of payment school life sex and drugs and jane saw that the blinds were down over the window in the shed there was absolutely no reason why a groundsmans hut should have blinds at all but every window in the school was fitted with the same type black and rubbery so that educational videos could be shown at any time or the net consulted there was no tv in here obviously no computer the lowered blinds could only mean one thing with the english language gcse not half an hour over slobbery steve was in there doing business you couldnt get away from it could you jane shook her head wearily and was about to turn back across the field when the wooden door of the shed swung open she stiffened the sunflooded playing fields stretched away on three sides everywhere to run nowhere to hide well come on a voice drawled from inside dont hang around jane didnt move she imagined pills spread across steves workbench or maybe some really desperate sixthformer jane felt cocooned in heat and a sense of unreality she blinked layla riddock large and ripe stood there in the doorway of steves hut in her microskirt blouse open to the top of her bra like a hooker in the entrance to an alleyway well well layla said the vicars kid we are honoured two little green apples safety in numbersspread the load a problem shared the bishop was heavy with cliches this morning although what he was saying made sense when you accepted that the church of england looked upon the supernatural like the ministry of defence regarded ufos visitations the blinding light on the road to damascus the softly glowing white figure in the grotto god forbid the blinding sunlight over ledwardine vicarage was diffused by the thin venetian slats at the kitchen window bernie dunmores friars tonsure was a fluffy halo he topped up his glass with scrumpy jack from the can beamed plumply at merrily they look at you they see a symptom of escalating hysteria they see the church being dragged towards the threshold of a new medievalism simply to stay in business oh no bernie shuddered if the third millennium does witness the collapse of the anglican church wed rather go down quietly with our passive dignity intact leaving you out there waving your crosses at the sky and waiting for the angels thats not me is it bernie below the dog collar merrily wore a dark grey cotton tshirt and black jeans her hair was damp from the swift but crucial shower shed managed to squeeze in between alf rokess funeral and the arrival of the bishop theyre saying that even after ellis but ok she knew what he meant nick ellis had been a rampant evangelical who preached in a village hall plastered with christ is the light posters and used the holy spirit like an oxyacetylene torch merrily watkins was the crank who prayed for the release of earthbound spirits currently setting up the first hereford deliverance website to offer basic on line guidance to the psychically challenged they hadnt liked each other she and ellis but to a good half of the clergy they were out there on the same ledge and one of them was mad and the other was a woman bernie dunmore was quite right of course shed been putting it off too long she saw that he was blatantly inspecting her from head to feet which wasnt far as if looking for signs of depreciation so you want to build a team then bishop if deliverance has its back to the wall better it should be more than one back bernie said sagely well fine most dioceses had one now a deliverance cluster a posse of sympathetic priests as backup for the exorcist it was about spreading the load fielding the flack having people there to watch your back ok lets do it she came to sit down opposite him at the pine refectory table where bars of yellow sunlight tigerstriped her bare arms the problem is who do we recruit bernie sank more cider merrily tried to think what his appearance suggested if not bishop you could almost think hed been appointed simply because he looked so much like one unlike his predecessor mick hunter who might have been a rising presenter from newsnight previously bernie had been suffragan bishop of ludlow the number two who rarely made it to the palace but his formal acceptance by downing street as bishop of hereford had been a relief all round a safe option anyone in particular you want to sound out merrily of course shed already been thinking about this a lot but the members of the local clergy she most liked and trusted tended to be the ones who wouldnt touch deliverance with coaltongs and asbestos gloves and the ones who actively sought involvement in what they imagined to be a handtohand battle with satan well nick ellis had wanted the job for himself that told you all you needed to know there must be any number of people out there better equipped spiritually than me fighting off the urge to dig for a cigarette she poured herself some spring water i mean so many people who seem to be living in what seen from my miserable level looks awfully like a state of grace she glanced at him worried he might think she was fishing for praise and reassurance but there truly wasnt a day that went by without her feeling she wasnt up to this job wondering if she wasnt any better than the mystical dabblers she was obliged to keep warning off then make me a list of these saintly buggers bernie dunmore would never have considered himself one of them either but then saintliness had never been a prerequisite for bishops fax it across to the palace or give it to sophie ill make the approaches if you like suppose we start with what would you suggest two two clerics thats enough to begin with dont want deliverance looking like a faction and ah would they pardon my ignorance but would these two need to be ah what merrily blinked you know you mean psychic he looked pained whats that other word sensitive yes well would they thats a good question she sipped some water i mean i never liked to ask merrily but would you say that you yourself well er this is not a witchhunt merrily i dont honestly know she said maybe we all are to a varying degree and maybe just doing this job gives you insights that is god all right bernie said forget it what else do we need a tame shrink sure we can make a good guess at whos in genuine psychic torment and whos clinically paranoid but a guess isnt good enough and how on earth do we go about finding one of them the bishop shook his cider can but found it empty merrily rose to fetch him another from the fridge but bernie shook his head and put a hand over his glass i mean should we make a direct approach to the health authority asking for nominations and wouldnt a proper psychiatrist require some kind of retainer doctors dont like to do anything for nothing in my experience and the archdeacon would be the first to query any kind of i dont know merrily sat down again theres a whole lot i dont know were all feeling our way here said bernie whose official elevation had been confirmed only at the end of may i mean its all hitandmiss isnt it you get the wrong shrink point him at some little old lady spouting the lords prayer backwards in a rich baritone and hell still swear shes a paranoid schizophrenic be hard to find one who wont always say that and he or she also needs to be a christian because if we ever get someone with a malignant squatter inside them the psychiatrist is going to have to be there for the showdown bernie winced at the terminology i really cant help you much there im afraid i dont think i actually know any psychiatrists of any religious persuasion me neither merrily said but i know a man who does he looked at her with the interest he usually displayed when she mentioned she knew a man she didnt elaborate she was aching for a cigarette ethel the black cat the vicarage had acquired from lol robinson jumped onto her knee as if to prompt her but merrily kept quiet the bishop got up and moved to the window he was wearing his golfing clothes pale green polo shirt over cream slacks and over what you didnt like to call a beer gut if this had been mick hunter the ensemble would have been mauve and purpleblack episcopal chic but mick hunter wouldnt have played golf what you said a few moments ago bernie was looking out over the vicarage lawn which gomer parry insisted on mowing twice a week about people living in a state of grace the lawn ended at the old powell orchard which belonged now to the church there were already tiny green apples on the trees like individual grapes where was the year going to merrily glanced at the clock she was going to have to leave soon to pick up the kid after her english exam no anxiety on that one at least english came naturally to jane and it was the one gcse that required no revision the bishop coughed theres something ive been meaning to say to you for a while mmm youre still young ish young he said firmly he had grandchildren janes age he turned back into the room and a very young widow merrily was about to remind him that if it hadnt been for a particular fatal carcrash on the m she might have been a notsoyoung divorcee and therefore would never have made it into the priesthood but she guessed theyd been into all that before bernie said we all know that when tommy dobbs was exorcist here he felt it incumbent upon him to develop a rather rigid monastic way of life frugal steeped himself in prayer yes she said i think i can understand that fully now why he did that however he was an old man youre a whatever she stood up obviously stepping into dobbss shoes you were bound to feel you were walking on eggshells well that and for other reasons too she had a vague idea what was coming and clapped her hands together briskly look bernie im afraid ive got to be off in a minute have to collect jane from the school gcsetime once they finish an exam they can go home i dont really want her heading down the pub he nodded not really taking it in i weve never minced words you and i both accept that hunter set you up to succeed dobbs to appear trendy politically correct all that tosh and again in my opinion as ive told you on a number of occasions in spite of all that it was probably one of hunters better moves not least because people who wouldnt dare go near that gruesome old bugger dobbs will talk to you as a human being young people for instance its very important that we should help the young people he screwed up his face what im trying to say merrily i dont want you to be scared to be a human being huh i mean there must be times when you find yourself looking at young jane with all of it just beginning for her boyfriends parties you know what i mean you must feel theyre fairly human too in my experience merrily raised an eyebrow nuns there was a moment of silence then the bishop sighed softly well you said it i was trying to help you out bloody hell merrily he brought his left fist down on the back of a dining chair well what was she supposed to say she hadnt exactly applied for the job down here on the coalface of christianity daytoday confrontation with the intangible the amorphous and the unproven as experienced by the damaged the vulnerable the disturbed and the fraudulent was the bishop actually implying that she might find all this easier to cope with if she went out got drunk and got laid a time or two probably not he was probably just covering himself all im saying bernie thrust his left hand into his hip pocket maybe to conceal the fact that hed hurt it on the back of the chair is that deliverance has started taking on a much higher profile than any of us imagined i dont want you cracking up on me or tightening up building some kind of impenetrable spiritual shell around yourself the way dobbs did oh i doubt id have the personal strength for that bernie didnt matter with dobbs because half the hereford clergy didnt even know what he actually did he could go his own way all his pressures were inner ones yes she noticed that a few of the little green apples had either fallen or been plucked from the orchard trees and now lay forlornly on newmown grass that was already showing signs of sunscorching she wondered if there was some sinister piece of local folklore about premature windfalls anyway the bishop said ill want you to email me that list by tomorrow night i will i will and start helping yourself to a bit of ordinary life merrily before it gets eaten away three soiled place it was like some illicit members club for which shed accidentally given the secret sign one foot over the threshold and she was pulled in and layla riddock had closed the door behind them then she heard a lock turn and layla was pulling the key out of the door sliding it into her skirt pocket what the two candles on the workbench made shadows rise and turned the metal handles of the oldest lawnmower into twin cobraheads one of the flames was reflected magnified and distorted in the bevelled side of a glass it looked like one of the water glasses from the dining hall upturned in the centre of the benchtop welcome layla riddock said if candida butler looked mature layla looked somehow old as in seasoned as in tainted as in kind of corrupt or maybe you just thought that because of what you knew about her and all the guys shed had like actual guys not boys but there were no guys in here today not even steve the beergutted groundsman take a seat then layla pulled out some kind of oil drum tapped on the top of it with her nails the other girls said nothing only the chunky kirsty ryan laylas mate turned her spiky red head towards jane kirsty was sitting on the mowers grassbox turned on its side the other girl on a stool kept on looking down at the benchtop where pieces of cardboard the size of playing cards were arranged in a circle the candles standing outside of it in what looked like tobacco tins well go on layla said jane sat down on the oil drum next to kirsty ryan because well because when layla told you to do something you somehow just did it layla was tall and goodlooking in this kind of pouting sexual way and she somehow had this forceful thing about her an aura of grim authority her father had been a gypsy she liked to tell people that liked hinting she had a long tradition of secret powers behind her the gypsy must have moved on pretty quick though because laylas mother was longmarried to allan henry the wellknown builder and property developer allan henry homes and they lived in this huge crass ranchstyle bungalow with a swimming pool and a snooker room out near canon pyon riddock was presumably her mothers family name or the gypsys its jane right layla sat down on a stool at the head of the bench behind the candle tins kirsty you know i assume and thats amy fourth year she pushed the candles further apart so that they were arranged either side of her and she looked like some sombre smouldering idol in an indian temple the card in front of jane said no the letters were printed on white paper stuck to the card now she had an idea what this was kirsty ryan turned to her you got the ten quid on you jane said nothing she can bring it in tomorrow layla said crisply then looked at jane without smiling cheap at the price love youll find out kirsty smirked jane thought she saw amy stiffen the kid was slight and fairhaired and was the only one in here wearing her school blazer despite the heat she was sitting directly opposite jane in front of her was the card that said yes kirsty said to jane you come with a special question got a problem you want sorted jane shook her head lying little cow kirsty said jane said nothing she had to get out of here but it would be seriously unwise to let any of them know that told you thered be another one along didnt i layla folded her arms in satisfaction there was this other kid kirsty explained but she got shitscared and backed out and we were worried they wouldnt like it there should be four they jane cleared her throat why cause we started out with four so like your mothers a vicar yeah so oh not just a vicar layla said is she love jane shrugged keeping her lips clamped she didnt like talking about what mum did especially to someone like layla riddock so what would she say to this your old lady jane managed a nervous grin but still said nothing her old lady would probably have snatched up the glass scattered the letters and called on god and all his angels to cleanse this soiled place like now kirsty said who told you about this nobody jane said i was just it doesnt matter layla leaned forward those big heavy breasts straining to come bouncing out of her blouse this is excellent i think i really do think that this is going to be a really good sitting yeah said kirsty rebuked right jane had never actually done this before it belonged to the realm of sad gits people with no real hold on life it was a joke unhealthy maybe but still a joke she had to keep thinking like that because she knew there was no way she was going to get out of here until it was over ok she could leap up and demand the key and they probably wouldnt use violence to stop her or would they but that wouldnt be awfully cool would it besides it might be you know kind of interesting the air in the groundsmans hut smelled of oil and sweat the candlelight had found a little moisture in the cleft over layla riddocks upper lip as it curled at last into a sort of smile lets go for it then layla said it was terrifying and like really addictive the glass made an eerie sound as it moved across the greasy surface of steves bench like a coffin sliding through the curtains of a crematorium reflected jane who had never been inside a crematorium not even when her dad had died the first time are you here layla had asked calmly the glass shot directly to yes with the snap precision of a fast cue ball on a snooker table and the sudden movement made both candleflames go almost horizontal like in the wind created when someone suddenly slams a door jane was so shocked she almost jerked her finger away good layla said jane let out a fast breath she hadnt expected that to happen nobody could be pushing it just wasnt possible now tell us your name layla instructed it jane thought there couldnt be an it not on a summer afternoon in slobbery steves filthy shed in the precincts of the dreary oncemodernist moorfield high school herefordshire it was a scam that was all there had to be a trick to it a method of setting up momentum without appearing to apply pressure an interesting endofterm conundrum for the anoraks in the new science block jane looked into laylas face laylas eyes were shut but her wide mouth was set into a closedlips smile that seemed to shimmer in the moist light and jane felt sure that layla could see her through those lowered lids as the glass glided dragging janes finger then her hand across the oily benchtop towards the letter j ok that was it she was annoyed now so like suppose she tried to manoeuvre it suppose she exerted a little deliberate pressure of her own next time suppose with some really intense concentration a blast of hyperfocused will power she could make it spell out jane will power yeah thoughtprojection she glanced up at layla laylas eyes still didnt open all right she located the letter a halfway between kirsty and the kid amy and she really really concentrated on it and when the glass began to move she tried to the glass was dragged from under her forefinger to slide unstoppably to the letter u jane leaned back she didnt like this she really didnt like it she became aware that the girl opposite her amy of the fourth form had begun panting her fair hair was pulled back tightly from her face and her skin seemed to be stretched taut now jane knew exactly who she was she was the one who looked like one of those plaster mannequins in an oldfashioned schooloutfitters skirt always uncreased blazer always buttoned tie always straight hair perfectly shoulderlength perfectly brushed amys ultimate role model would be candida butler what was wrong with her if this scared her so much what was she doing here because it was addictive because it worked get me out of this the glass moved under janes finger slid back into the centre of the circle of letters and off again the bloody thing seemed to know exactly where it was going and she just let it happen now watching the finger in motion with the fore fingers of the other three all of them apparently just resting on the thick base of the glass and all the time trying to separate herself from this pretending that finger was no longer connected to her nervous system watching the glass spelling out one word before it stopped in the dead centre of the circle justine amy drew in a long ratchety kind of breath part one the flavour in the beer the hop belongs to the same family as hemp and cannabis and is a relative of the nettle a hardy longlived climbing perennial its shoots can reach feet in length but die back to ground level every winter it has no tendrils and climbs clockwise round its support although it will grow in the poorest soils only optimum conditions will produce the quality needed for todays shrinking markets as a result hopgrowing in herefordshire is now concentrated in the sheltered valleys of the frome and lugg where there are at least inches of loamy soil a pocketful of hops bromyard and district local history society the wires in the warm milky night lol was leaning against a fivebarred gate listening for the river frome it couldnt be more than six yards away but youd never know this was the nature of the frome crossing the wooden bridge hed looked down and seen nothing that was ok it was a small and secretive river that in places didnt flow so much as seep dark as beer obscured by groundhugging bushes and banks of willowherb already lol felt a deep affinity with the frome he just didnt want to step into it in the dark that was all river prof levin had said vaguely this morning thats a river i thought it was some kind of sodding drainage ditch which had only made lol more drawn to it later hed sat down in the sun with his old washburn guitar and started to assemble a wistful song did you ever think youd reach the sea aspiring to an estuary but hey who could take that seriously yeah who like wasnt he supposed to have turned his back on all this for good now here was prof levin forever on at him to give it another go and prof didnt give up easily so lol had gone wandering out into this milky night feeling guilty and confused nerves quivering jagged pieces of his past sticking out of him like shards of glass from a smashed mirror seeking the unassuming tranquillity of the nighttime river nothing more than that the modern countryside prof levin had insisted this morning was one big sham close to nature balls this is heavy industrial laurence guys in baseball caps driving machinery you could build motorways with sixspeaker stereo in the cab blasting jungle these lanes aint wide enough for the bastards any more grabbing hold of the bottom of lols tshirt prof had towed him to the window overlooking someone elses long meadow sloping to the bank of the river frome week or two theyll be out there haymaking technohaymaking come september they start on the hops over there and thats all mechanized take a look at the size of those tractors tell me this aint heavy industry they dont even stop at night got lamps on them like frigging great searchlights doing shift work now who ever hears the cock crow any more this laurence this is the new rural and heres me padding out the frigging walls to doublethickness on account of i dont want to disturb them prof levin grinning ruefully through his white nailbrush beard a shavenheaded wiry man of over sixty years old precisely how far over nobody would know until he was dead and not necessarily even then when lol had first known him prof had been the worlds most reliable recording engineer always in work and then after forty years in the business hed emerged as a revered producer an icon an oracle and now a bucolic oracle disdainful of belated acclaim prof had quit the mainstream industry he would produce only material that was worth producing and only when he was in the mood he would create for himself a bijou studio a private centre of excellence in some deeply unfashionable corner of the sticks knights frome yeah that sounded about right who the hell had ever heard of knights frome who indeed down south there was at least one other river frome only much bigger the frome valley here in east herefordshire had just the one small market town and a string of villages and hamlets bishops frome canon frome halmonds frome and little knights frome all sunk into rich red loam and surrounded by orchards and vineyards and hopyards under the malverns middle englands answer to mountains not that prof appeared to care about any of this that it was obscure was enough in fact the real reason he was here rather than the west of ireland or somewhere was that an old friend a onetime professional bassplayer and cellist was currently vicar of knights frome it was this unquestionably honest guy who had identified for prof a suitable property a cottage with a stable block and pigsties but no land for either horses or pigs therefore on sale at an unusually reasonable price and prof had shrugged whatever he had no basic desire to communicate with the landscape or with people for that matter except through headphones unless of course he needed help arriving out here marooned among crates of equipment prof had put out an sos to every muso and sparks he knew within a fiftymile radius only to find that most of them had moved on some to the next life in the end it was only simon the vicar and lol robinson formerly songwriter and second guitar with the longdefunct band hazey jane now on holiday from his college course in psychotherapy not that lol was any good with wiring but that wasnt important it was mainly about making the tea and listening to prof grouch and taking the blame for malfunctions this afternoon theyd installed the final wallpanels and tested the new acoustics by recording in the absence of anything more challenging some of lols more recent numbers this had continued into the night when at some point prof had stopped cursing and wrenching out leads and replacing mikes and sat back for a while behind the exposed skeleton of his mixing board just listening to the music and then had stood up and stomped across the studio floor positioning himself menacingly in the doorway of the booth where lol sat with the old washburn on his knees laurence you little bastard stop right there lol looking up timidly listen to me prof glowered how long for fucks sake have you been sitting on this stuff it was past eleven now but the night was still awash with pale light forming long lakes in the northern sky to the south a plane tracked across the starscape like a slow pulse on a monitor in the middle distance was a round tower like some storybook castle except that the tip of its conical hat was oddly skewed there was a windowglow visible in the tower unsteady like lantern light lol was stilled by the unreality of the moment half feeling that if he were to climb over the farm gate and walk towards that tower the entire edifice would begin to dissolve magically into the greyblack woodland behind it was he concluded one of those nights for nothing being entirely real from the shadowed field beyond the gate he heard the slow seismic nightbreathing of cattle so loud and full and resonant that it might have been the respiration system of the whole valley the air was dense with pollen and sweet with warm manure and lol experienced a long moment of calm and the nearness of something that was vast and enfolding and brought him close to weeping at which point he cut the fantasy the fairytale castle hardened into a notsoancient hop kiln there were dozens of them around the valley most of them converted into homes sad not some rich mystical experience just another bogstandard memory of the womb because therapy laurence is the religion of the new millennium and were the priests lol gripped the top rail of the gate until his hands hurt prof was exaggerating of course his material wasnt that strong anyway lol was too long out of it the most hed done in years had been occasional demos for the purpose of flogging a few songs to betterknown artists makeweight stuff for albums nothing special it was an incometrickle but it wasnt a career it wasnt a life and he thought hed accepted the reality of that a long time ago back in january hed enrolled on this course for trainee psychotherapists the only one he could find still with any available places up in wolverhampton it made a surreal kind of sense to lol though he didnt share the irony of it with any of the other students certainly not with the tutors without actually saying therapy shmerapy prof had managed to convey a scepticism well over the threshold of contempt i cant believe you waste your time on this you want to take money for persuading the gullible to remember how they were abused by their daddies then they go home and slash their wrists its like i say to simon youre just being a vicar for you not for them who gets married any more who wants to hear a sermon sip lemonade at the vicarage fete if you want to reach people cure people calm people and you have it in you to give them beautiful music from the heart then jesus this is the real therapy the real spirituality forget this counselling bullshit whore you really gonna change of course prof knew all about lols history on the other side of psychiatry brought about by early exposure to the music business the blurred fairground ride ending in halflit caverns with drifting whitecoated ghosts and gliding trolleys syringes pills medication the strippeddown nhs was a sick system drugdependent it made sense to lol that he should be using his own experience to help keep other vulnerable people out of the system otherwise the medication years were just a damp rotten hole in his life prof knew all about this just didnt accept the logic listen to me boy i have strong contacts these days people who trust me who tend to act on what i say and im telling you you gotta take these songs into the market place well sure lol said obligingly anybody who wants one no theyll want you listen to me i can get you a good tour lol had been backing away into the booth at this point the guitar held in front of him like a riot shield prof pursuing him hands spread wide laurence youre older now you know the score you know all the traps im telling you honestly you dont do this now youll be a very embittered old man one day jesus what am i saying one day how long you been out of it now ten years fifteen thats three whole generations in this business how much time you really got left how long now before the looks start to fade before the winsome littleboylost turns into some sad wrinkled listen to me i cant i cant tour face it he couldnt even play all that well any more right lets see now prof went on like he hadnt heard it would have to be as support the first time but supporting somebody tasteful dont worry about that it can be arranged rem radiohead all these guys admit to being influenced by your work youre a cult ok a minor cult but a cult is still a cult prof lol was resting the guitar on his trainers his fingers among its machineheads be honest you dont even know thats true do you the hell does that matter laurence i apologize in advance if this sounds immodest but if im the one spreading it around everyone is going to believe it therefore it becomes the truth i cant tour lol stood with his back against the partition wall again his breathing becoming harder at the very thought of on the road you can tour you need to tour this will kickstart your confidence youre just using this therapy shit as some kind of buffer against the real world youre institutionalized and you dont even know it its like like so many schoolteachers are really just kids who were afraid to leave school believe me laurence and part of lol did believe him because kenneth prof levin had been down in the halflit caverns too in his case alcoholism the destruction of a good marriage lol recalled the buzz hed felt when hed had the message to call prof a couple of weeks ago around the same time he was concluding that knowing the difference between cognitive therapy and humanistic therapy didnt make either of them any more effective in fact the day after his senior tutor had told him not with irony but with something approaching pride therapy laurence is the religion of the third millennium and were the priests the voice slick with selfbelief after a few glasses in the wine bar down the road from the college everybody needs a church a confessional forgiveness this senior tutor this high priest was younger than lol maybe thirtyfour all right prof levin had finally backed off enough well talk about this again for starters we just do the album album prof had spread his arms magnanimously with his own studio set up he was at last able to make these decisions without consulting anyone in a suit and lol had thanked him for the offer very profusely obviously because having prof levin produce an album for you was kind of like having spielberg take on your screenplay but then pointed out reasonably enough that he had only four songs not quite half an album prof had smiled beatifically through his white nailbrush beard you have the whole summer my son this summer is yours and he had shambled smugly away to his room in the adjacent cottage leaving lol to switch everything off before climbing to his own camp bed in one of the old haylofts like he was really going to sleep after this instead hed stumbled out bemused into the warm night to commune with the frome but the river was already asleep and that was how he ended up following the track running down a line of poplars and out the other side close to where the hopkilns stood the sky was now obscured by a tangle of trees and he was aware of a high piercing hum that somehow translated itself into everybody needs a church a confessional forgiveness not exactly the wisest analogy to hang on lol who in his late teens had seen his parents find religion watched them being swept away on waves of foaming fundamentalist madness causing them to reject the godless kid playing the devils music the kid who would always remember coming home one weekend to find that those two small mantelpiece photos of himself as a toddler had been replaced by framed postcards of jesus which was probably how it had started the alienation and then in just this last year a surprise development lols fear and resentment of the church had been fatally compromised by encounters with a priest called merrily watkins who lived and worked as it happened less than twenty miles from here but if this was another reason for coming back to herefordshire he wasnt going to admit it least of all to himself their last meeting had followed events so dark that maybe she wouldnt want to be reminded he felt a sharp pain below his knee and stopped feeling suddenly out of breath he realized hed been running like he sometimes did to try and overtake a dilemma to put an impending decision behind him he must have veered from the path and now he was in the middle of an unknown wood and there were brambles tangled around his legs wrong turning somehow it was easy enough to do even in the daytime even in countryside you thought you knew in the middle of this unknown unmanaged wood snagged with hawthorn he heard his tshirt rip and he stood there shaking his head lost again story of his life knights frome was a scattered hamlet with no real centre so it wasnt as if he could look around for a cluster of lights or even listen for the river all he could hear was the humming a plaintive sound that rose and fell and pulsed as if a melody was trying to escape lol turned walked back the way hed come putting a hand up to his glasses pushing them tight onto the bridge of his nose losing your specs was not something you did in a wood at night when he took his hand away he saw the trees and bushes had fallen away and there was now a clear space up ahead a small yellow light appeared not too bright a little unsteady with a black cone above it a witchs hat the kiln tower again when the sky was clear of branches a trailing scarf of brightness told him which direction was north and then it was suddenly split by something black and rigid that made him reel back startled he slipped and stumbled went down on one knee before it waiting for the thing to move bend down snatch him up hit him nothing moved even the humming had stopped lol scrambled warily to his feet it was only a pole half as thick as a telegraph pole but not tall enough to carry telegraph wires or electricity cables although it did support wires of some kind to avoid it he took a couple of steps to the right no trees or bushes stood in the way and the ground was level a second black pole appeared rearing hard against the northern sky and this one had a short crosspiece like his first thought a gibbet from it hung something limp and shrivelled the skeletal spine of a dead garland when he passed between the two poles his bare elbow brushed against the remains with a dry papery crackle now he could see the extent of it dozens of black poles against the pale night in lines to either side of him across the barren ground most of them with crosspieces some connected by dark wires overhead it was like a site laid out for a mass crucifixion between the wires he could still see the yellow kilnhouse light perhaps two hundred yards away and the nearness of the kiln told him what this was or should have been it was high summer and these poles should be loaded with foliage the ripening bines high on the wires rippling with soft green hopcones but this whole scene was in black and white and grey and there was an awning of silence no owls no scurryings in the undergrowth no undergrowth in fact the silence lol thought was like a studio silence soft dry flat and localized the air seemed cooler now and he could feel goosebumps prickling on his bare arms as he ventured tentatively into a hopyard where no hops grew along an alley of winterbleak naked hoppoles a place as desolate as the strippedback bed of someone recently dead he felt a little scared now there was no contented cattlebreath around this place it felt less like a memory of the womb than a premonition of the grave no reason to stay lol started to turn away afterwards he couldnt remember whether these thoughts of death had occurred in the moment before the humming began again or whether it was the combination of the sound and the stark setting that conveyed the sense of mourning loss lamentation the bleak keening seemed to be around and above him as if it was travelling along those black wires as if they were vibrating with some kind of plangent sorrow and then as he turned there was another noise a crispy swishing like dried leaves in a tentative breeze like the noise when hed touched the remains of the dead hopbine only continuous and a pale smear blurred the periphery of his vision like petroleum jelly spread on a camera lens lol saw her it was like she was swimming through the night towards him from the far end of the corridor of crosses no sense of unreality here that was the worst of it it was not dreamlike not hallucinatory she stopped between the poles legs apart leaning back one moment all shadows and then shining under the northern sky a thin white woman garlanded with pale foliage rustling and crackling like something dead and dusty moved by the wind but there was no wind lol backed into a pole felt it juddering against his spine and the back of his head as he gasped and twisted away semistunned and reeling into a parallel hopcorridor the poles rushing past him like black railings seen from a train between them he saw the woman moving a long driedout bobbled bine was wound around her like a boa around her neck under her arms over her shoulders pulled up between her legs the cones crackling and crumbling on her skin throwing off a spray of flakes an ashy aura of dead vegetation as she drew level with him he could see under the winding bine black droplets beading her breasts streaks down her forearms as though the bine was thorned she turned to lol and the bine fell away as she extended her hands towards him lol very nearly took them in his own very nearly in the oldfashioned sense it was like shed told the bishop anything iffy out came the coaltongs and the asbestos gloves and it made you wonder whatever happened to that old job description the cure of souls id just said the blood of christ keep you in eternal life and that was when the girl went slightly crazy canon dennis beckett explained on the phone to be fair he had good reason to feel this wasnt really his problem he was retired now and lived on the other side of the county he only came across to dilwyn to take the sunday services for two weeks a year when jeff kimball his godson was away on holiday which was a diversion for dennis too and a nice place to drive out to this neat black and white haven with its village green but at the end of it the thing was other than on a superficial handshaking level he didnt really know these people did he and in this case there was a young girl involved always dicey also for extra tension a touch of drama it had happened during holy communion weve all had situations of people becoming ill of course dennis said even dying in their pews on two occasions that i can recall but well its usually elderly people isnt it mmm since coming to ledwardine less than two years ago merrily had seen a stroke a blackout an epileptic fit and a birth not invariably she wasnt yet seeing this as a deliverance issue shed met canon beckett two or three times at local clergy gatherings remembered him as greybearded vague affable she wondered why if this incident had occurred last sunday it had taken him five clear days to decide he should tell her about it it was the first morning of janes school holidays friday the thirteenth as it happened it was embarrassing rather than anything else at the time dennis said the mother appeared to be affected the most essentially such a good family you see in the oldfashioned sense a family in fact to whom the term godfearing might once have applied and im afraid you cant say that of very many of them nowadays can you no merrily tucked the phone under her chin leaning forward through a sunbeam to pull over her sermon pad and a felt pen i suppose not so what did happen exactly she dashed thats the only word for it dashed the chalice from my hands and then she was sick she actually threw up copiously tossed her cookies as my grandson would say in the chancel on everything on me oh rather a mess and the smell soured everything hard to continue afterwards i can imagine everyone was extremely understanding and trying not to react someone said oh dear very quietly and then they all discreetly moved out of the way the mother was absolutely white with the shame of it poor woman shes one of jeffreys regulars cleans the church arranges the flowers there she was dragging the child away down the aisle followed by the father and i was starting to go after them when this elderly lady suddenly began clutching her chest i thought oh lord thats all we anyway as it turned out the old dear wasnt in the throes of some cardiac crisis which was a mercy but by the time i reached the door the whole family had vanished so we simply cleaned everywhere up and resumed at the time it seemed the best thing merrily said luckily i managed to find a fresh surplice there were only about five communicants left by then a few had walked away in the wake of it dennis beckett paused through the scullery door merrily heard impatient footsteps across the flags in the kitchen look im aware this doesnt sound like much merrily dennis said certainly didnt seem so to me at the time but i thought i ought to reassure the parents so i got their number and when i arrived home i gave them a call no answer i made a note to try again the following day but im afraid it got mislaid and other things cropped up and it wasnt until this morning that i finally got through to them mum behind merrily the scullery door opened jane stood there in jeans and a yellow sleeveless top summery but somehow waiflike a bit forlorn look im going to get the bus into hereford ok merrily held up a hand signalling for the kid to hang on until she was off the phone sorry dennis dennis beckett lowered his voice it was still quite a long time before anyone answered i was about to hang up when the mother came on rather abrupt until she realized who i was whereupon she simply burst into tears an eruption as if shed been holding it back for days you know thank god youve called thank god i didnt know what to do i dont know what no in fact her actual words were i dont dare to think whats got into her he paused jane scowled threw up her arms in exasperation and walked out got into her merrily said cautiously her own words the childs being generally not herself shes normally a quiet studious demure sort of girl a nice girl been taken to church every week since she was about seven suddenly shes exhibiting signs of a distinct aversion claiming shes not well on sunday mornings headaches this sort of thing merrily thought about jane being generally difficult mood swings emotional i gather how old fourteen well merrily tapped her pencil on the desk remembering similar phases no need to get too carried away about that unless an obvious thought had struck her could she be pregnant what oh i see what you mean he was silent for a moment thinking it over well she seemed to me to be a very young fourteen she was wearing her school uniform which in itself is a rather uncommon sight these days out of school hours true half of janes school clothes seemed to have vanished by the time she reached home let me tell you the main thing dennis said it seems amy had been brought along to holy communion precisely because her parents were getting worried about her spiritual health in the oldfashioned sense meaning what exactly dennis hesitated and then sighed meaning theyre now asking for something i would not personally be happy to undertake he replied eventually as merrily went into the kitchen ethel the cat looked up at her from a sunpool on a deep window sill no sign of jane the kid must have gone back up to her apartment in the attic merrily went back into the scullery stared at the phone for a few seconds and then picked it up and rang sophie at the gatehouse im just following procedure here soph do we have a procedure the bishops lay secretary servant of the cathedral and posher than the queen would be in her office next to the deliverance room from where she also dealt with the admin side of merrilys business we have a rule theres only one situation where we have a rule merrily said and this is it i see a tiny pause a vacuum snap sophie uncapping her gold cross fountain pen what would you like me to tell the bishop were talking major exorcism wont be an exorcism at all if i can help it i suspect they dont know quite what they want apart from some reassurance im just informing the bishop according to the rule jane appeared in the doorway what she saw the phone at merrilys ear and rolled her eyes sorry sophie ive just got to ask jane something before her very limited patience snaps i am sixteen jane muttered as you keep telling me i have all the bloody time in the world you know a kid called amy shelbone jane blinked know the name probably i think she goes to your school she does not in your class then no she i guess shes probably in the fourth or the third year something like that ok merrily nodded thanks flower worth a try but kids in a lower form were pond life sorry sophie jane didnt leave merrily frowned at her youll miss the bus so like whats this amy shel thing done go said merrily she waited until she heard the front door slam her dog collar lay in the centre of the pale blue blotter glowing in the sunbeam sophie would disapprove of her discarding it simply because of the heat the womens ministry had been hardwon it was like some exsuffragette not turning out for the polls because it was raining sorry about that i think you can assume shes gone now sophie said but you may wish to check the room for listening devices sophie would also disapprove of merrily asking the kid about amy shelbone but merrily knew it would go no further it had reached the stage with jane where there was a certain trust forged out of experience jane was sixteen there wasnt such a huge agegap between them they told each other almost everything didnt they she sat for a while at her desk looking down the garden towards the apple trees she was thinking about father nicholas ellis the fundamentalist zealot who had interpreted the term cure of souls all too freely administering exorcism like doctors prescribed antibiotics without ever consulting the bishop but at least ellis had certainty a complete faith not only in god and all his angels but in himself as the approved wielder of an archangels broadsword how he must have despised her merrily put on her dog collar ellis had crossed the line bigtime she was never going to do that god help her nor was it up to the priest to decide who was genuine who was misguided and who was trying it on she knelt by the side of the desk under the window put her hands together the backs of her thumbs against the centre of her forehead she closed her eyes let her thoughts fall away the sunshine through her eyelids made her feel washed in a warm orange glow it felt good too good merrily moved into shadow facing the whitepainted wall of fourhundredyearold wattle and daub and prayed for perception since dennis beckett had first told her about amy shelbone shed been thinking on and off about the occasion shed thrown up in church herself her own church on the fraught night of her installation as priest in charge churches were powerful places they sometimes amplified emotions might well have an emetic effect on storedup stress it didnt necessarily mean any kind of invasion however this was at holy communion and a dramatically adverse reaction to the presence of the sacrament was something that needed to be looked into after a few minutes merrily picked up the phone and called the number dennis beckett had given her for the shelbones in dilwyn there was no answer stock the first time lol saw gerard stock he thought the bloke must have some kind of status here that maybe he was the original owner of the whole place including the stables and the pigsties this was perhaps because gerard stock kind of swaggered it was not a word lol recalled ever mentally applying to anyone before stock walked like he was shouldering his way through a crowd of people who didnt matter to get to somebody who did this looked odd because he was all alone on the track which crossed the hay meadow no bushes no banks of nettles no cows nothing but lush kneehigh grass in a valley smouldering with summer it was eleventhirty in the morning and stock was heading their way prof was not glad to see him the sodding countryside you get more privacy in notting hill he wants to know who you are he always has to know who everybody is the bastard hes obviously seen you walking around here and he thinks you might be someone of significance obviously hasnt noticed my car then lol was standing with a mug of tea and a slice of toast at the window of the studio anteroomcumkitchen which had once been a pigsty and now possibly looked even more of one this guy prof drained his mug added it to a pile of unwashed crockery beside the sink i ask myself should i have to cope with guys like this any more my time of life the business is topheavy with the bastards always has been they know everybody shared spliffs with jerry garcia toured with dylan played jews harp on the cut that never made it onto blood on the tracks which of course is how come their name was tragically omitted from the sleeve these guys prof palmed his stubbly white chin these guys are losers the likes of which i hoped that by moving out here i should never have to encounter again so who exactly is he prof lol saw a man who was not that much taller than he was but wide and powerful a man swaggering like he owned the place but not hurrying a man wanting them to know he was coming prof snorted for my sins my nearest neighbour he lives with his distressingly younger wife in a converted hopkiln somewhere over there where ive never been he walks over here two three times a week in case maybe i got knopfler or sting hanging out a hopkiln lol had fallen asleep thinking of a woman in a hopyard near a kiln then had dreamed of her and then had awoken this morning thinking did that really happen very soughtafter these old kilns apparently so how come such a loser is able to buy one answer he didnt it was an inheritance and not even his own his wifes uncle left it to them what kind of man was this uncle to bequeath this leeching bastard to the community nice guy actually said the man who was sitting on the floor below the window his back against the whitewashed bricks mug between his knees though he went a little strange i suppose before his death prof turned on him and you when you were selling me on this place did you mention the proximity of this freeloader this ligger even once you werent interested in the neighbours simon st john bassplayer cellist and vicar had known prof for many more years than lol had as long as they dont have noisy kids or barbecues youre never remotely interested in your neighbours lifes too short for neighbours prof said gruffly whatever time i got left i want to spend it laying down good music in my own place at my own pace is that too much to ask he glared down at simon you knew him well this uncle prof i buried him simon lifted pale hair out of his eyes but before that he used to come and see us periodically he was interested in the history of the church he was interested in most things local he turned to lol youll see his books in various shops in bromyard local books full of pictures photos old ones and new ones he took himself but he did them in sepia so they looked like old ones an illustrated guide to the frome valley past and present and the hopgrowers year theyre still selling very well i think gerards quite annoyed because the income from those books was left to another niece and all they got was the house said prof poor little bleeders stewart ash was his name the uncle simon said good bloke what happened to him seemed really shocking obviously especially in a close community like this but in my own defence prof i have to say that when i first told you about this place i hadnt yet met friend gerard prof snorted both times i called at the kiln making my initial pastoral visit as we do he appeared not to have heard me knocking simon flicked a wrist naturally i assumed he was of a reclusive disposition and not exactly a christian reclusive jesus nah you were wearing your bloody uniform no wonder he wasnt answering the door the bastard thinks youre collecting for the organ fund and he doesnt have any money and of course thats the very last thing these hustlers are ever going to admit their private capitals always tied up in some bigdeal promotion they cant tell you about just yet lol wanted to ask what had happened to the uncle that had so shocked the community but there wasnt going to be time for that he saw gerard stock push through the gate leaving it open behind him and cross the yard stocks thinning hair was slicked straight back and he had a beard that was red and gold fading to grey where it was trimmed to a small thrusting wedge and lol was still not sure what the bloke actually did see if there was a whole bunch of neighbours prof spread his hands it might not be so bad but this guy on his own with the wife at work all day oh yeah it might be her inheritance but she goes to work while he hangs around here supposedly engaged in renovation but actually pissing the time away and getting in what remains of my hair i tell you if you live in the sticks and you have just the one neighbour its like i would imagine being in prison and sharing a cell as youll find out when i go lol smiled prof kept saying when i go like he was expecting imminent death in fact he was going to abbey road studio to produce the longawaited fourth solo album by his old friend the bluesguitar legend tom storey lol had agreed to mind the studio while prof was away knowing this was profs way of forcing him to work on his own solo album which was not longawaited not by anybody there was a knock on the back door just the one prof jabbed his thumb towards the passage and if you ever do let stock in here when im gone you dont permit him to play a chord or touch a knob on that board that clear not for my benefit im saying this but for yours because if your album eventually starts to sell in any quantity hes gonna swear blind he coproduced it am i right simon simon rose languidly to his feet he wore wellfaded jeans and a collarless white shirt you know me prof i must never allow myself to think the worst of people prof turned to lol if it reaches court this man will be your principal witness he dont play bass so good any more but his god loves him increasingly simon st john smiled but didnt reply nothing prof said ever seemed to offend him he would bend with it like a willow simon had probably not changed much or put on a pound in weight in twenty years he seemed to know exactly who he was and to feel comfortable with that he made lol feel unstable and directionless aw just let the bastard in prof said resigned then he grinned at lol ill do you the favour of ensuring that he develops no interest in you from the start as good as his word prof handed gerard stock a mug of lukewarm tea and jerked a thumb at lol gerry this little guy is laurence robinson he used to be in a minor band way back now hes a psychotherapist lol sighed he was polishing his glasses on the hem of his tshirt so gerard stock was just a bluedenim blur but he could feel the guys lazy gaze like a damp towel as stock cranked out a laugh guess weve all been down that road at some time lol put his glasses back on stocks voice had surprised him underneath the vague midatlantic slur it was educated uppermiddleclass like simons he saw that the bloke had intelligent canny eyes a wet little rosebud mouth inside the oval of the beard and moustache i was in therapy for six months in the states stock said it really fucked me up he laughed again eyes glinting with challenge lol nodded it can happen it isnt right for everybody stock drank some tea and what kind of person isnt it right for dont get him going prof snapped hell bore the arse off you with his psychobabble what can we do for you gerry i hate to hurry you but we need to have this rig up and running time is money in this business i dont need to tell you that you most certainly dont prof stock said actually i wanted a word with the vicar prof said nothing clearly thrown by this me simon said also thrown obviously if you have a few minutes sure simon shrugged i was just leaving anyway i should be out there ministering to my flock but profs still a novelty made me selfindulgent would you excuse me one minute while i pop off and have a wee then ill walk back with you when simon vanished into the passage lol went over to the sink and filled it with hot water for the washing up when he turned round to find a teacloth he saw that gerard stock was contemplating him eyes screwed up like he was trying to figure out the species of a bird in the garden you were in a band laurence robertson robinson lol said lol usually but you probably wouldnt ah stock said triumphantly hazey jane lols turn to be surprised maybe it took one loser to recognize another you did this nick drakey thing stock recalled long before the man was rediscovered all sensitive and fingerpicking when everybody else was crashing about on synths brave of you didnt get us anywhere lol said lightly if ten years too early stocks teeth were very white and even hollywood teeth he couldnt always have been a loser and now everybodys discovered drake its probably too late a hard and ungrateful business my friend youre probably better off even in psychotherapy unfortunately everybodys discovered that too lol said story of my life sad said gerard stock as simon returned prof and lol followed the other two men down the passage and out through the back door prof seeming much happier now that he was seeing stocks back the sun was a big white spotlamp tracking them and all around the countryside was surging with summer the meadow lavishly splattered with wild flowers mother nature flaunting herself happy to be a whore prof stopped in the yard and sat a panama hat on his bald head he piss you off laurence he asked hopefully not particularly give him time prof rubbed his beard his baggy american tshirt carried the merry message babes is all whats he want with simon thats what i would like to know he strike you as a man who feels himself in need of spiritual absolution lol smiled you jealous i shall treat that with the contempt it deserves prof said what does mr stock actually do you never said nothing strolls about like the squire while the poor wifes at work temping for some agency in hereford she inherits the house now she earns the money for them to live there all right he was some kind of a freelance publicist a term that can mean whatever he wants it to mean on any particular day he offers to handle my pr i say gerard watch my lips i do not want any relations with the public lol watched stock and the vicar crossing the river bridge at the bottom of the meadow where the line of poplars began where hed walked last night he told prof about the hopkiln hed seen with its fairytale tower prof nodded yeah i expect that would be his place its not a prime location stock maintains on account of being blocked in on either side by these two enormous great metal barns same situation as this with the land all around it owned by someone else he should moan like he paid a penny for it they still grow hops there used to only there was this kind of hopyard with no hops well a few shrivelled bits of bine hanging from the wires i mean hops had obviously been grown at one time in quantity but it was all barren now scorched earth and just these poles it was depressing hmm prof said this would be the wilt i expect what verticulum wilt nah thats wrong but some word like that its this voracious hop disease no known cure wipes out your whole crop contaminates your land like anthrax or something throwing hopfarmers out of business you want to know about this stuff take a walk down to the hop museum by the main road prof smiled slyly youll like it there check out the back room why prof winked anyway he said apparently thats how these stables got split off from the farm the owner has hard times maybe from the wilt sells his land bit by bit flogs off what buildings he can for conversion maybe thats also how stocks wifes uncle got his kiln i forget its an ill wind laurence it was noon the time of no shadows but the sun was momentarily weakened by a trailer of muslin cloud whats the er whats the wife like lol asked prof gave him a curious look prof had sensitive multitrack hearing sometimes even picking up tracks you hadnt recorded never met her laurence quiet im told often the case with a guy like that wants a listener and what happened to the uncle ha im detecting forgive me a burgeoning interest here well not the moment i mention hopkilns after our discussion am i to conclude you went for one of your little strolls and you came back with dare i suggest the seed of an idea im thinking of the song you did a year or two back for norma waterson the bakers tune the bakers lament about the slow fading of the old village fabric a good one well im not pushing it but there are strong themes here too change and decay visit the hop museum in fact im going to set that up for you prof theres no check it out reject it if you want but check it out first lol gave up in an avalanche lie down so what did happen to the uncle aha prof sat on an old rustic bench against the stable wall tilting his panama over his eyes well that laurence was a very sick wind lol waited prof seemed to have a remarkably extensive knowledge of people he claimed he hadnt ever wanted to meet he talked from under his hat stretching out his legs i think what simon didnt mention about this stewart ash was his interest as an author a chronicler of social history in our travelling friends not the new age travellers the old kind gypsies prof nodded romanies used to come here in force every autumn for the hoppicking enormous work in those days before the machines some of them even travelling over from europe in their vardos year after year a colourful spectacle youll find all this in the hop museum as well the romanies were a little community inside a community and of course ash very much wanted to record their memories for his book what they thought of the hopmasters how well they were treated a man with a social conscience well theres a few romany families not many still coming back to help the machinery do the work though whether theyll be back this year after what happened is anyones guess anyway off goes our mr ash to talk to them only gypsies by tradition dont like to talk its their history why should the gaujos profit from it prof tilted up his hat looking for lols reaction thats a point lol said cautiously i have sympathy for the romanies prof said a persecuted race big victims of the holocaust prof rarely talked about this he liked to call himself a lapsed jew but lol knew from other sources that his family had been considerably depleted by hitler aunts and uncles certainly if not his parents it would explain why prof who was accustomed to ignoring his immediate neighbourhood had taken a certain interest in this story but ash you see was by all accounts a generous man and he didnt expect the stuff for nothing he established what you might call a rapport with a few of the gypsies what he might have called a rapport though they would probably have had a different name for it like they got more out of him than he got out of them they havent survived the romanies by passing up on opportunities though it was probably a little more complicated than ripping off the guy for a bunch of madeup stories complicated for one thing by ash being representative of another significant minority oh did he form too close a rapport with certain of his travelling friends did they take his money for services rendered none of this ever came out in court when the case was heard earlier this year it amounted to two little bleeders breaking in one night gypsy boys brothers old man comes down in the night catches them messing with his cameras and stuff this was how it was put in the papers they beat the poor bugger to death christ said lol last year this would be late summer there you go aint what it was the countryside prof laughed hoarsely bear this in mind laurence make sure you always lock up at night when ive gone the reservoir st mary the virgin guarded dilwyn like a mother hen a good solid medieval parish church with a squat steeple on the tower but it was always going to be the village below that got the attention bijou black and white cottages around the green a movie set birthday card timberframed heaven in fact you only really noticed the church on the way out of the village and if she hadnt been leaving the village merrily might also have missed seeing the woman coming down from the porch past ancient gravestones just a few of them selectively spaced as if the lesssightly stones had been removed she seemed as timeless as the cottages themselves a big woman comfortably overweight walking with her head high a shopping basket over her arm you expected there to be big rosy apples in it maybe some fresh brown eggs it could be her couldnt it merrily slowed the car and then reversed turning on the forecourt of the crown inn and parking next to the village green the shelbones bungalow had been easy enough to find sunk into a lane leading out of the village in the general direction of stretford whose church of st cosmas and st damien once desecrated with a pool of urine and a gutted crow had been the scene of merrilys first humiliating exorcismofplace the bungalow had lace curtains and flower beds with bright clusters of bedding plants it was traditional no barbecue no waterfeature and no one had answered the door but this woman looked promising she was about the right age midfifties with her dark green linen skirt and her greybrown hair loosely permed you had the impression she didnt care overmuch if she did resemble her mother at that same age merrily switched off the engine wound down the window and waited for the woman to reach the green late afternoon had brought on the first overcast sky of the week dense with white heat droplets of birdsong were sprinkled over the distant buzz of invisible traffic on the main road above the village the woman had stopped to check something in her basket wearily merrily levered herself out of the car leaned against the door she was wearing a blue cotton jacket a white silk scarf over her dog collar in case the shelbones didnt want the neighbours knowing they were having visits from strange clergy she hadnt bought any new summer clothes last year and thered be no need for any this year either she wasnt planning to go anywhere this would be the first summer shed stayed behind while jane went off on holiday joining another family in a big farmhouse in pembrokeshire where there was sea and surfing not that the kid seemed especially excited she just slumped around sluggish and grumpy maybe it was the weight of the exams and the weather or some unknown burden something they needed to discuss perhaps thered be a violent thunderstorm tonight with the electricity cut off as it usually was a time for candlelight confidences to be swapped across the kitchen table maybe their last chance for a meaningful discussion before jane went away for a month leaving merrily alone in the sevenbedroom vicarage the woman was now crossing the road towards the green merrily stepped away from the car mrs shelbone good afternoon she looked neither surprised nor curious in a village this size a stranger would swiftly have rounded up a dozen people who could have pointed her out i had a call from canon beckett this morning merrily said im merrily watkins i rang i know it wasnt convenient to talk to you then im sorry mrs shelbone spoke briskly local accent i was intending to call you back tonight when we could speak freely dennis must have told her to expect a call from the deliverance consultant but the girl amy had been in the house merrily guessed at the time she rang she suddenly felt wrongfooted because this woman already knew exactly who she was and what she was doing here and now she was getting that familiar dismayed look that said youre the wrong sex youre too young youre too small she slipped a hand defensively to her scarf mrs hazel shelbone shifted her shopping basket from one hand to the other in the basket were two tins of polish and some yellow dusters neatly folded no apples no eggs well my dear mrs shelbone said this isnt really a good place to leave your car i should take it a little way down that lane over there perhaps we could meet in the church in about five minutes she produced a smile that was wry and resigned the scene of the crime as it were in the long church porch with its glassless ironbarred gothic windows merrily took a few long breaths whispered a rather feverish prayer jane had once asked insouciantly so when do they issue you with the black medical bag and the rubber apron for the green bile the truth was that merrily had never exorcized a person deliverance consultant might be an unsatisfactory title but it was a more accurate job description than diocesan exorcist heavy spiritual cleansing had never been more than an infrequent last resort tell me if its real merrily mumbled to god dont let me get this wrong it was only a few steps down from the porch but the body of the church had a subterranean feel a cool grey cavern hazel shelbone was alone there waiting in a front pew a few yards from the pulpit and the entrance to the chancel where her daughter had in the phraseology of dennis becketts grandson tossed her cookies she half rose im sorry mrs watkins if i was abrupt its been very difficult yes i would like you to understand about me from the outset i am a christian and a mother she said this almost defiantly her wide face shining in the white light from the leaded windows merrily nodded me too youve got children just the one a girl sixteen mrs shelbones brown eyes widened a child bride were you sort of my husband was killed in a car accident long time ago the body of the church seemed fairly colourless there was no stained glass in the nave but behind the altar was a crucifixion window with bloodred predominant and you remarried no i found the church instead a deep nod of understanding from mrs shelbone its important to know where your destiny lies isnt it i knew from a very early age that i was destined to be a mother that this was to be my task in life my occupation do you see merrily smiled hazel shelbones expression rebuked her but we couldnt have children mrs watkins couldnt have them imagine that it was enough to shatter my faith how terribly cruel of god i thought so but after a while i began to understand he intended for me to be a reservoir do you see a reservoir of maternal love for little children who were starved of it when i came to that understanding it was a moment of great joy so you foster parents we were for a number of years and then we took on amy as an infant and god in his wisdom decided that she was to stay and become our daughter we had a big decrepit old house up in leominster in those days with lots of bedrooms so we sold that and we moved out here this was when amy was five and we knew she was going to be staying i didnt realize she was adopted merrily was wondering what basic difference this might make as a foster parent hazel shelbone would probably already have had considerable experience of kids from dysfunctional families kids with emotional problems she wouldnt easily be fooled by them what does your husband do davids a listedbuildings officer with the hereford council he looks after the old places makes sure nobody knocks them down or tampers with them they offered him early retirement last year but he said he wouldnt know what to do with himself her eyes grew anxious i wish hed taken it now hes not been in the best of health recently and now she looked ahead through the opening in the oak screen towards the altar and then suddenly turned leaning urgently sideways in the pew towards merrily we never pushed the church on her we never forced religion on any of our children we just made sure they knew that god was waiting for them if and when they were ready theres a great difference between indoctrination and bringing up children in a home which is full of gods love merrily nodded again thats sensible and amy responded better than anyone could have wished a daughter to be proud of respected her parents her teachers and her god hazel shelbone paused looking merrily straight in the eyes you understand im only talking like this to you now because youre a woman of god i dont make a practice of scattering the lords name willynilly on barren ground the social services people one has to deal with in fostering and adoption many of those people are very leftwing and atheistic and theyll automatically take against you if they think youre some sort of religious fanatic well were far from fanatics mrs watkins we just maintain a christian household which you always think will will she bit her lip will be a protection to them merrily said softly hazel shelbone leaned back and breathed in deeply as if accepting an infusion of strength from god for what she was about to say sometimes when i come home and shes been alone in the house it seems so cold theres a sense of cold the sort of cold you can feel in your bones merrily said nothing once something started gnawing at your mind it could produce its own phenomena last sunday when she was sick and we took her from here i dont think she even realized where she was her eyes were absolutely vacant as though her mind had gone off somewhere else vacant and cold like a dolls eyes do you know what i mean yes it was only when we got her home that she began to cry and even then it was like tears of defiance id never seen that before not in amy weve had other children for short periods who were resentful and troublesome but not amy amy became our own merrily asked carefully have you consulted a doctor hazel shelbone blinked you mean a psychiatrist well not we are a christian household mrs watkins we seek christian solutions well yes i understand that but you may say weve become complacent in our middle years having a daughter who was always conscientious with her school work whod been going happily to church from the age of seven and was by the way confirmed into the church in march this year by bishop dunmore a girl who even she looked at merrily whose silk scarf had come loose revealing the dog collar who even talked of one day becoming a minister merrily thought of jane who once in a heated moment had said shed rather clean public lavatories she always kept her bible on her bedside table until it went missing and i found it wedged under the wardrobe in the spare room the holy bible wedged there face down like some old telephone directory this was the child who always wanted to be assured before the light went out that jesus was watching over her now she doesnt want go to church any more she looks down at her feet every time she has to even pass the church since when five weeks six weeks the first time she wouldnt go she claimed she was feeling ill with a bad stomach well shes always been truthful never tried to get a day off school so of course i sent her back to bed at once the second time oh it was some essay she had to write for school shes always been very assiduous about her school work as i say very well her dad said you must decide whats most important and she promised she would go to evensong that night instead on her own and sure enough she got changed and off she went but i know she didnt turn up i know that her voice had become loud enough to cause an echo and merrily glanced quickly around to make sure they were still alone another time she made the excuse of having a particularly severe period pain but when she gave me the same excuse again last sunday i counted up the days and i can tell you theres nothing wrong with my arithmetic oh no i said up you get my girl now and i made her come with us to the early eucharist did she make a fuss she was sulky distant that glazed look has she got a boyfriend what does that no she hasnt got a boyfriend but shes only fourteen you sure about that what could be better guaranteed to undermine the piety of a starchy fourteenyearold girl than a sudden blinding crush on some cool mean kid who despised religion for instance where did she really go do you think when she claimed she was off to evensong i know what youre thinking mrs watkins and yes ive had her to the doctor this week and no he couldnt find anything wrong with her but well i can tell you there certainly has been illness in the house as a result of all this davids had migraines again and my anyway everything has seemed under a cloud unhealthy a darkness even in the height of summer and you may say this is subjective but i know that it isnt the childs become a receptacle for evil hazel shelbone stood up her back against a stone pillar by the pews end defensive merrily thought if shes so certain then theres something else mrs shelbone walked into the chancel and faced the altar i come here and i polish and polish the bit of rail where she was sick and i pray for her to be redeemed and i get down on my knees and ask god what our family could have done to deserve this merrily went to join her you seriously believe amy is possessed by evil by an evil spirit and you want her to be exorcized i feel its not something we can ignore yeah but its its not something we undertake without a lot of theres a procedure ok im afraid it would involve bringing in a psychiatrist initially hazel shelbone didnt turn around her whole body had stiffened we need to be sure merrily put a hand on her arm what might at first appear to you or me to be demonic possession could be some form of mental breakdown reverend watkins hazel shelbone stared up at the crucified jesus in the window above the altar weve had our share of problem children david and i weve had children from broken homes children whose parents have been admitted to psychiatric institutions disturbed children a child who ran away after smashing up our living room theres really not a lot anyone can tell me about child psychology we have to be sure merrily said and took a step back as the big woman spun round at her is this what its come to has the church become a branch of the social services now do i have to sign forms mrs watkins its quite simple i would like the darkness to be driven out so that god may be readmitted into the heart of my daughter is that too much to ask of a priest no no it shouldnt be then then merrily needed advice this sounded like a simple and sudden adolescent rejection of parental values but you could never be sure before taking this any further she needed at least to talk to huw owen over in wales who of course would warn her not to leave the village without praying for and if possible with this girl mrs shelbone merrily said softly is there something you havent told me i dont know what you mean it came back too quickly its just that for you to want to put your daughter through the stress of a spiritual cleansing she knows things hazel shelbone mumbled what she knows things she shouldnt know things she couldnt know like what mrs shelbone bowed her head once and moved away from the altar she will look into my eyes sometimes and tell me things she could not possibly know she started to walk quickly back towards the nave where her homely shopping basket sat on the raised wooden floor at the foot of the front pew all right merrily moved behind her where is she now at home i assume in her room she spends most of her time in her room id better go now her father will be home in an hour why dont we both go and have a chat with her merrily suggested al and sally like a fineboned girl he thought pale and graceful and slimhipped lol was suddenly besotted since coming into the museum hed been aware of little else his gaze kept returning to this shadowed alcove overhung with tumbling bines the man standing by the counter covered with books and leaflets was watching him smiling he wore a white linen jacket of edwardian length and looked about sixtyfive he had long white hair and a pointed chin goblinesque and there were tiny gold rings in both his ears he gestured towards the alcove go ahead lol moved closer but didnt touch motherofpearl was inlaid around the soundhole but the softwood top was otherwise plain with a dull sheen but no lacquer no polish there was an orange line of yew in the neck she was like one of those old parlour instruments from the late nineteenth century a holy relic what was it doing here lol said reverently shes a boswell mother of god the man with long white hair strode out from behind the counter shes a guitar carelessly plucking the instrument from its stand handing it to lol go on take her but no plectrum if you dont mind id hate to need a scratchboard im no good with a plec anyway lol accepted the guitar one hand under its sleek butt quite right lad the man clapped his hands two rings tinking plectrums thumbpicks condoms for the fingers why would god have given us nails his sharp rural accent with flat northern vowels was unplaceable the kind sometimes affected by traditional folk singers the guitar was unexpectedly lightweight yours the man smiled check out the back room prof had said earlier winking back room ah youre embarrassed the goblin man said all right ill leave you alone with her for a while from behind the counter he pulled a wooden stool for lol to sit on ill give you just one tip dont be too delicate with her she wont repay you he wagged a finger remember now lol shes not sacred shes only a guitar lol looked up at him unsure whether hed fallen on his feet or into a trap the prof the goblin smiled a couple of gold teeth on show the prof said youd be around sooner or later he unlatched the door i shall be back in about ten minutes enjoy the hop museum was set back from the main road to bromyard about fifty yards from the turning to knights frome like profs place it was the remains of farm buildings but in this case with a few acres around it there were two ponies and a donkey in the field in front and a pond with ducks also a gypsy caravan in green and gold the river frome passed unobtrusively under the access drive through what looked like a culvert earlier lol had played the frome song for prof as far as it went the chorus had written itself but sounded a bit trite the river frome goes nowhere in particular it isnt very wide theres nothin on the other side pity it was pronounced froom to rhyme with doom and gloom lol had decided hed still have it sounding in the song like home and loam so as to carry the vowel in that first line frome goes nowhere he was after all a stranger you dont know enough about the place to finish this song prof had said flatly it might be about what a complete loser you are but you still need some images to carry it what do you really know about this sodding river except its name and that it isnt very wide you ask me laurence its time you went to talk to sally down at the hop museum the river the hills the woods the people sally knows everything about them all sally lol had stared at him you actually know this woman i thought you had a policy of not knowing local people unless they could play something useful it was an accident prof said it was about fivethirty when lol had set off to walk the halfmile or so from the studio the whitehaired man had been closing the gates at the foot of the drive but had beckoned lol in anyway the only visitor theyd had all afternoon he said admission was a pound and there were a few items on sale inside but not presumably the boswell guitar handmade by the great alfonso boswell who had given all his guitars womens names the same instrument on which lol now played the slow and ghostly celtic instrumental he called moons tune knowing it was going to remind him of the abandoned hopyard the place of the wilt and the woman hed seen there hed dreamed of her since twice in one night not pleasant though as dreams went are you all right then letting her approach to within a few inches before he slunk bashfully away registering by the rhythm of her movements and her blurred smile that she was not hurt bar the scratches and had not been attacked or forcibly stripped was more likely some stoned moonbather whod assumed she was alone but didnt really care the lowbeamed room one of three linking up to accommodate the museum was dim and crowded with annotated exhibits that looked at first like junk these included the hopcribs hammocks in frames in which the cones were separated from the bines the giant sausage sacks called hoppockets in which they were collected a huge castiron furnace rescued from some subsequently converted kiln on the walls were blownup black and white photographs of kilns like gerard stocks in which the harvest had been dried on platforms over the furnace the atmosphere in the museum was humid and laden with a mellow musky aroma that could only be the hops themselves and because hops were used to flavour and preserve beer it was easy to find the smell intoxicating it seemed to soften lols senses made it easier to accept the curious turn events had taken he pulled the boswell guitar comfortably into his solar plexus the soundboxes of boswells had curved backs long before ovations became ubiquitous but while ovations were fibreglass the back of the handcrafted boswell was like a mandolins there were probably fewer than a hundred of these instruments so it had to be worth more than anything else in the museum but what was it doing here and did it have anything to do with hops lol played the opening chords of the river frome song b minor f sharp the tone was entirely distinctive deep but sharp a bit like the voice of the man with the long white hair he stopped playing no no really it couldnt be because he was dead wasnt he he would surely have to be dead after all this time al he said jabbing a thumb at his own chest and this is sally my wife they stood together in the doorway looking strangely like a period couple from a sepia photograph sallys hair was ashgrey fine and shoulderlength she was tall and slim and at surely close to the same age as al himself still startlingly beautiful she wore a long dark blue dress and halfglasses on a chain but her handshake was businesslike and her accent clipped and cultured i know she said you thought he was dead everybody thinks hes dead which is absolutely no handicap at all when we have one to sell it gives it a certain patina of antiquity you like her then al boswell asked him you like my baby he meant the guitar al alfonso boswell virtuoso blues and ragtime guitarist and perhaps the most revered if eccentric guitarmaker of the past halfcentury cant believe this lol mumbled hes a little older than he looks sally boswell flicked at her husbands snowy hair but also hes been making guitars and things since he was just in his teens so that rather confuses people i wanted to stop al boswell said but after i finished the last one i awoke in the night with what seemed very like the first twinges of arthritis well im a superstitious man from a long line of superstitious men so i started work again the very next morning lol thought of the gypsy caravan outside according to the legend alfonso boswell would travel the country lanes selecting and cutting his own wood and then set up his workshop in some forest clearing each instrument growing organically in the open air under the sun under the stars there would be no more than three or four guitars a year it was never a fulltime job and hed also be doing seasonal work on the farms fruitpicking and hoppicking looked like al boswell had uncoupled his caravan and settled down and if you didnt know already sally boswell said drily the rom are renowned for their outrageous lies proud of it too for reasons that still escape me after all these years nonconfrontational is all we are al said his face carried very few lines and his skin was lightertoned than youd imagine on a purebred gypsy amazing it is how much conflict can be avoided by a welltimed fib the truth can be hurtful and dangerous sometimes come on lad what do you really think of the instrument lol thought this was getting increasingly unreal he thought why should alfonso boswell care what the hell i think we heard your playing sally said we were listening outside the door im afraid so youll know why im not worthy even to tune it lol was embarrassed he was still holding the guitar but careful to keep his fingers well away from the strings how long you been playing al boswell asked him oh lol blinked nervously since i was a kid with a plastic one sad isnt it its not the technique lad its the heart the relationship you know that al tapped the body of the guitar this one shes very young you see shes the first this year and shell probably be the last i reckon what she needs is a good playingin i never let one go until shes been playedin what do you think now is she worth it oh al sally frowned you can hardly expect a snap judgement why dont you let mr robinson take the thing away for a couple of weeks al stared at her then he threw up his arms well damn it why didnt i think of that aye you take her away lad break her in bring her back in what shall we say september unless you want to buy her of course in which case we can discuss terms lol was shocked he put the guitar carefully back on the stand stepped away from it now whats that mean al said is it some form of gaujo insult sally closed her eyes shaking her head this is all moving too fast lol said i just walk in here you dont know a thing about me i cant just walk out with six thousand quids worth of mother of god al cried is that what theyre fetching now ive never had more than two and a half sally smiled tiredly at lol mr robinson a short time ago mr levin rang us to say you were on your way al has known him for many many years mr levin feels you could use a little inspiration she looked at him over her halfglasses dont as they say knock it al boswell laughed loudly threw up his arms and walked out of the museum he loves his little games sally explained theyre mischievous sometimes like elves hes just gone to find you a guitar case she bent to adjust the guitar on its stand when she straightened up she stood taller than lol where al boswell was volatile sally seemed watchful and serene al owes prof levin some favours from way back and wanted him to have a guitar but mr levin insisted that a boswell should never go to someone who couldnt play this is the guitar he was promised consider yourself an intermediary in this play it while youre there if it agrees with you and then perhaps forget to take it with you when you leave in a few years i suppose itll be worth ten or twelve thousand to a collector lol was still bemused he recorded with prof mr levin would always find al session work when we needed money hes a kind man and hes very fond of you he doesnt want you to fall by the wayside the waysides ok sometimes lol said awkwardly she arched an eyebrow thats the sort of thing al says but we are not romanies you and i when we fall we dont just roll over and land on our feet again grinning all over our faces lol was curious did prof know al was going to be here when he bought the stables i have sympathy for the romanies prof had said pure coincidence actually although al knew simon st john of course were all parts of interlinked circles arent we lol wondered how this very english woman had come to link up with al boswell purebred romany apparently luring him off the road for good but according to the prof you want to know about the frome valley sally boswell said therefore i want to tell you because there are aspects of life here which do need to be recorded and nothing keeps memories flowing onwards like songs and the frome flows through that guitar the vein of yew in it came from prunings from a thousandyearold tree in simons churchyard and theres also a little willow from a tree which bends over the river itself the romany is ever a discreet scavenger he lives lightly on the earth she led him into the next room hopbines were intertwined along the beams silent but as soon as he saw them he could almost hear them crackling and rustling and he felt a small shiver more blownup photographs were spotlit on the walls men in flat caps women in print dresses berets and headscarves people laughing the strange sadness of frozen merriment until mechanization began to take over in the sixties hoppicking was very much a multicultural phenomenon sally boswell explained well four cultures really the indigenous locals the welsh valleys the dudleys as we called them from the black country and the gypsies she told him how at picking time in september the local population would expand eight or tenfold perhaps a good thing leaving the locals far less insular than in other rural areas the hopmasters would have huge barrack blocks for the pickers and the pubs were always overflowing the police constantly back and forth breaking up the fights lol studied a photo in which the smiles seemed more inhibited and there were scowls among the caravans and the cooking pots ah yes said sally when did the travellers ever like to be photographed they were always a settlement apart but usually very honest and faithful to their particular employers they liked being able to return to the same establishment year after year al was here too for a while that was how you met romanies can be charming she didnt smile also infuriating lol peered at a picture showing a girl lying in one of the hopcribs laughing and helpless men standing around cribbing sally said when the picking was almost over an unmarried girl would be seized and tossed into the crib with the last of the hops the unspoken implication was that she too might be picked before next years bines were high on the poles she looked solemn al and i met when i was drawn to the romany ways ive been planning to write a book well i was planning to in the end i gave all my material to mr ash for his book i suppose this place is better than a book in the end more interactive as they say and al like most romanies is suspicious of the written word doesnt seem to have done mr ash much good either lol said hesitantly in the end she looked at him thoughtfully as if deciding how much to say no she agreed eventually stewart was the last casualty we all hope in an unhappy chain of events at knights frome she nodded towards the next doorway go through no hopbines hung in the third and smallest room it was also the darkest with no windows and few lights a long panel in a corner was spotlit it was a painting on board in flat oils or acrylics of a stark and naked hopyard at night with polealleys black against a moonlit sky a tattered bine hanging from one of the frames halfway down the central row hovering above the bare ground was a woman in a long dark dress like sallys billowing in the wind the caption read the lady of the bines a ghost story if sally noticed hed gone quiet she didnt comment on it the hopfarmers angel of death she said with a curators jollity there was a halfsmile on the face of the woman in the picture who painted it i did sally said its really good its as if as if ive actually seen her she laughed lightly perhaps i have sometimes i can imagine i have lol was glad it was dark in here this was unreal the sequel to a dream i expect theres a story he said she was the wife of some local lord or knight maybe the original knight of knights frome for all i know and she couldnt give him a son so he sent her away like you do like you did apparently what was the point of having the king give you a few hundred acres of stolen land if you couldnt found a dynasty anyway he threw her out gave her some money to go away and then settled down with his mistress but the poor spurned lady pined for the valley pined all night long in the fields and the hopyards is this true it sounded like the theme of a traditional folk song until one morning one beautiful midsummer morning with the hops ripening on the bines her voice hardened they found the poor bitch hanging from one of the frames when was this dont know no one does its a legend i suppose if it had any basis in fact the story couldnt have dated back earlier than the sixteenth century because hops werent grown for brewing in this country until the postscript is that from the night she died the knights hops began to wither on the bines and his yard was barren for many years and if you see her ghost then your crop will also wither or someones will lol recalled the shrivelled old hopgarland hanging from the gibbetlike arrangement of poles he didnt want to think about the naked woman in the hopyard he found himself wanting her to have been a ghost ghosts were simpler shes become a metaphor for verticillium wilt sally said and before that for red spiders aphids whitemould all the scourges of the hop wilt particularly renders a hopyard virtually sterile for a number of years perhaps you should write a song about her lol its a thought he said uncertainly although he knew he could if he knew what he was writing about perhaps we could have it playing softly in this room sally boswell laughed lol thought she didnt seem to have much sympathy for either the knight or the lady of the bines she still seen depends who you believe its certainly said she was widely observed in the sixties she nodded towards a black and white photograph of a man with a heavy moustache who looked a bit like lord lucan but then people would say that in the last days of the emperor of frome when all was darkness and chaos she was poised to go on but for lol the darkness and chaos could wait he hadnt planned to ask it he just did does she always have a dress on sally boswells face was gaunt with shadows from two rooms away there was a skimming of strings the legendary al stowing away his creation what an extraordinary question she said coldly full of dead people muffled sobbing gave way to those timehonoured battlecries from the generation war leave me alone just go away its nothing to do with you the clouds were a deep luminous mauve now and the sky looked like a taut wellbeaten drumskin through the long window pane in the front door it was stifling in the small rectangular hall with its beige woodchip and walllights with peeling coppery shades merrily stood under a print in a chipped gilt frame christ on the mount of olives opposite her was a cream door with a little pottery plaque on it amys room the door was closed but its plywood panels were not exactly soundproof merrily thought david shelbone historicbuildings officer was unlikely ever to see his own home listed except as a classic example of s utility how did the shelbones spend their money probably on their adopted child perhaps long educational holidays amy please i am not going anywhere do you understand there is nothing wrong with me and and if there is its nothing to do with you its nothing to do with her just get her out of the house please this is disgraceful please disgraceful comparatively speaking this was a restrained almost polite response in extreme situations kids were rarely able to contain extreme language you sad old bitch had sometimes been janes starting point before things got heated hazel shelbone murmured something merrily didnt catch no amy screamed you how dare you make out theres something wrong with me amy do you really think youd be in any position to judge if there was what do you know what do you know about the way i feel how can you understand youre not even merrily willed her not to say it this was not the time to say it my moth then the unmistakable and alwaysshocking sound of a slap merrily closed her eyes an abyss of silence jane would have been composing a response involving the european court of human rights amy just started to cry again long hollow sobs close to retching but this was surely not the first time shed thrown out the notmymother line there had to be something additional to have provoked hazel the seasoned fostermother the reservoir and when i look into her eyes with no windows you could open it was hard to breathe in here merrily ran a finger around the inside of her dog collar walked away towards the front door she felt like an intruder she felt this was becoming futile she looked across into the placidly glowing face of jesus in the picture and jesus smiled in his knowing way merrily closed her eyes again let her arms fall to her sides stilled her thoughts mrs shelbone was saying oh my darling im so sorry but you go away just go away we only want to you cant help me nobody can help me the good lord can help you amy another silence no sniffles no whimpers then as merrily straightened up amy said theres no such thing as a good lord you stupid woman amy its all just a sick horrible joke theres nobody out there who can protect us or if if god exists he just totally hates us he watches us suffer and die and he doesnt do a thing to help us he doesnt help us ever ever ever he enjoys watching us suffer you can plead and plead and plead and you can say your prayers till youre bblue in the face and nobodys going to ever save you its all a horrible sick lie and the church is just a big a big coverup its all smelly and musty and horrible and its full of dead people and i dont i dont want to die in merrily leaned back against the wall christ gave her a sad smile the door of amys room opened hazel shelbone stood there stonefaced mrs watkins would you mind dont you dare bring her in here im not talking to her do you understand merrily took a step back along the hall something had happened to this kid if not a sneering boyfriend what about some cool compelling atheistic teacher she whispered hazel i think on the whole it might be better if amy came out and im warning you if she comes in here ill smash the window do you hear me ill smash the window and ill get out of here for good ill throw the chair through the window can you hear im sorry mrs shelbone pulled the door closed behind her new lines and hollows showing in her wide honest face i dont know what to do shes never been quite like this before i swear to you you just keep lying to me lies lies lies merrily opened the front door and stepped down to the flagged garden path followed by amys mother the bungalow was detached but fairly small with a bay window each side of the door there were other houses and bungalows either side of the country lane well separated with high hedges and gardens crowded with trees and bushes the sky was the colour of a cemetery in contrast a small yellow sports car parked half up on the grass verge looked indecently lurid hazel what does she mean by lies i dont know ive told you this is not my amy i dont know how she can say these things about god but she looked away as she spoke and merrily thought perhaps she did know knew something anyway whats she been like at school well behaved always well behaved her teachers have nothing but praise for her do you know her teachers most of them weve always made it our business to know them as good parents what about her friends shes a sigh shes never had many friends shes very conscientious she studies hard shes always felt she had to because well shes bright but shes no genius because shes adopted i think she feels she has to make it up to us make us proud do you see good children children who study hard they arent always very popular at school these days are they has she been bullied do you think picked on but after that one small confidence mrs shelbone had tightened up again look reverend watkins this isnt what i expected at all i think she needs an infusion of gods love not all sorts of questions merrily sighed ill be honest with you im not really sure how to handle this cant take it any further without talking to her and if i go in there its likely to cause a scene isnt it the last thing i want is to upset her any more i mean i suppose i could start by taking off the dog collar mrs shelbones brown eyes hardened whats the point of that youre a priest arent you merrily stared hopelessly at the closemown lawn at the wellweeded flowerbeds demonic evil was something you could sense like a disgusting smell sometimes precisely that the only identifiable odour in this house had been floorcleaner wafting from the kitchen all shed sensed in there were confusion distress and perhaps something else she couldnt yet isolate but it wasnt evil in the end all she had the only universally accepted symptom of spiritual or diabolic possession was the mothers suggestion of a sudden startling clairvoyance you said she knew things things she couldnt have known im sorry i said that now a nervous glance back at the house as though a chair might come crashing through the window its nothing i can prove what things this isnt the time mrs watkins what kind of intrusion do you think might be affecting her isnt that for you to find out isnt that what youre supposed to help me merrily said amys mother stared over the low hedge across the lane the spirit of a dead person merrily didnt blink specifically there was a movement at the window of a room to the left of the door the child stood there not six feet away she wore a white sleeveless top her fair hair hung limply to her shoulders she looked maybe twelve she looked stiff and waxen the room behind her was all featureless dark like the background to a portrait its so cold now theres a sense of cold the cold you can feel in your bones merrily tried to attract amys gaze but the kid was looking beyond her she turned nothing nothing had changed in the lane there was nobody about even the yellow sports car was pulling away it began to rain big warm slow drops when she looked back at the bungalow the girl had vanished hazel shelbone walked back to the door my husband will be home presently i dont really want him to know youve been here hes under enough pressure ill take advice merrily promised ill be back ill leave you my number but ill call you tomorrow anyway if thats all right just pray for her mrs shelbone said limply i expect you can do that at least no thunder yet but the rain was hard and relentless clanking on the bonnet of the old volvo like nuts and bolts turning the windscreen into bubblewrap both wipers needed new blades after a few miles merrily was forced into the forecourt of a derelict petrol station where she sat and smoked a silk cut rapidly filling up the car with smoke because she couldnt open the window in this downpour nothing was ever straightforward nothing ever textbook in the car behind the streaming windows she prayed for amy shelbone she prayed for communication to be reopened between amy and her mother she prayed for any psychic blockage or interference to be removed she prayed for the healing of whatever kind of wound had been opened up by the puncturing of what the kid now evidently believed to be the central lie of her upbringing she prayed all too vaguely for a whole bunch of whatevers with hindsight if she couldnt work with amy it ought to have been her mother with extrahindsight she and hazel shelbone ought to have prayed together before they left the church except at that stage merrily hadnt been convinced shed needed to see amy and having seen amy having heard her she still wasnt convinced she could perhaps have persuaded mrs shelbone to let her stay until amys dad got home perhaps the three of them could have returned to the church this evening and with dennis becketts permission conducted a small eucharist just in case in case what six pm and she was back in the sculleryoffice with the window open and the dregs of the rain dripping from the ivy on the wall a silk cut smouldered in the ashtray jane was not yet back from hereford merrily felt like a cartoon person flattened in the road watching a departing steamroller the phone was life support its the old dilemma she said dont know whether im making too much of it or not enough when do we ever said the rev huw owen you should know that by now did i tell you bernie wants me to set up a deliverance group never liked committees focusgroup crap but in this case traps everywhere folk always looking for some poor bugger to blame when it all goes down the toilet do it i would just dont coopt a social worker she could picture him in his study in the brecon beacons his legs stretched out his ancient trainers wearing another hole in the rug the old wolfhound her deliverance mentor technical adviser to half the exorcists in wales and the west midlands tell me that last bit again lass you asked the mother what she reckoned had got into the girl and she said the spirit of a dead person merrily said that was what she said anybody in particular thats what i asked her next but she didnt reply then she started to backtrack on what shed said earlier about amy telling them things she couldnt possibly have known without if they dont cooperate youre buggered mmm basically you want to know whether they need you or a childpsychiatrist mmm huw was silent for about a minute she knew he was still there because she could hear his trainer tapping the fender no matter how hot it was he always kept a small fire going not that it could ever get overhot in a rectory well above the snowline outside a late sun was blearily pushing aside the blankets of cloud got a favourite coin huw said at last merrilys heart sank well said huw when you told us about this on the first course i thought you were kidding then i read martin israel on exorcism but i still think stop shaking your head lass ive done it a few times its always worked far as i could tell it either tells you what you already knew or it tells you to think again and once you start thinking again you find some new angle you hadnt noticed and thats the way ahead i wouldnt have the bottle aye you would take an owd coin and bless it and explain to god what youre doing i use this old halfcrown not legal tender any more therefore not filthy lucre i keep it in the bottom of a candleholder on the altar merrily imagined some hapless parishioner wandering in and witnessing the rev owen apparently settling some vexed spiritual issue on the toss of a coin it could overturn your entire beliefstructure course its nowt to do with the coin huw said any more than the tarot is to do with the cards dont go fundamentalist on me lass merrily laughed look at israel a scientist a distinguished pathologist and they made him exorcist for the city of london what dyou want oh aye i know what you want you want summat foolproof you want a solution on a plate a second opinion would do if you dont like the cold come out of the mortuary thanks a bunch any time said huw merrily sighed look luv give yourself some credit eh idve kicked you out of the bloody ring meself if i didnt think you were a contender you tried that were only before you got your little feet under ttable listen trust your feelings and your common sense if you want a second opinion ask him not me like the song says make a deal with god youre a complete bastard huw then she remembered that he actually was born in a little bwthyn halfway up penyfan and then his mother escaped to sheffield where he was raised after a fashion sorry merrily said huw laughed at least jane looked happier when she came into the kitchen shed been saving up the money shed earned working two saturdays a month at the eighttilllate shop and she was loaded with parcels clothes for the holiday no alluring nightwear merrily hoped though from what shed heard about eirions fathers extended family nocturnal recreational opportunities were likely to be seriously limited a small carrier bag landed in her lap whats this its a top its for you you never get yourself any new clothes gosh flower thats very merrily pulled it out of the bag it was pale orange cotton very skimpy its going to be er how can i put this slightly lowcut isnt it wont go with the dog collar if thats what you mean jane said smugly well thank you merrily put the top back in its bag thank you very much it was very thoughtful if you dont wear it ill be seriously offended jane said its going to be a long hot summer thats what we always say and it never is yeah jane sat down stretched her bare arms i expect lolll be taking a summer break from his course about now you do remember lol yees the greatest living writer of gentle lofi reflective songs and also a cool sensitive person in himself yes flower i think i remember no all i was thinking was if you found me an inhibiting presence this would be a good opportunity thank you flower for considering my emotional welfare any time jane said oh that amy shelbone i remembered she does go to our school i know i suddenly realized who you meant kind of oldfashioned always tidy bit of a pain basically merrily nodded mmmm so is there like anything i can help you with i dont think so merrily said at this stage because like sure merrily said what times eirion picking you up halfnine you looking forward to this sure jane said with the kid upstairs merrily went into the hall and ran a hand along the top of the tallest bookcase it was still there in all the dust where shed popped it hurriedly after theyd found it under the bath when they were having the years big luxury a new shower installed it was thick and misshapen the head of the monarch obscured but britannia distinct on the other side also the date over a century after the death of wil williams the martyr ledwardines most famous vicar feeling faintly ridiculous she slipped the coin into a pocket of her denim skirt stealing the light in the early evening a sinister ochre light flared over the frome valley before the storm crashed in driving like a ramraider down the western flank of the malverns although there wasnt much thunder every light on the mixing board went out at pm leaving only prof levin incandescent some farmer guy comes on to me in the post office in bishops frome ah you want to get yourself a little petrol generator mr levin these hayseeds you imagine recording music with a bloody generator grinding away out there but think of the amazing effects lol said innocently the lights flicker the tape stutters elemental scratching fah youre just being flippant because you got a new toy its your toy im just minding it lol had been trying to identify the different fragments of tree involved in the boswell guitar here in the studio its range and depth were incredible hes getting it back prof said i dont know how i dont know when but hes getting it back they pulled a fast one on me i said to sally help the boy if you can inspire him thats all i said so they palm you off with this ridiculous overpriced he pulled up the master switch so that everything wouldnt happen at once if the power ever returned still you at least know where you are now geographically i would guess well said lol i know why knights fromes all in pieces prof sniffed the great lake he said conrad lake a moral tale prof went back to his swivel chair behind the board the fall of the emperor of frome thats what they called conrad behind his back at first but they say he grew to like it she told you how the gods turned against him his problems with the wilt actually it wasnt the wilt as such it seems that verticillium wilt only verticillium thats the word only really hit these parts in the seventies it started in kent and took a long time decades to reach herefordshire but there were other scourges before that red spiders aphids white mould he got them all like the seven plagues of egypt they were both talking in epic terms lol realized because it had seemed epic the bountiful legacy of four generations of hopmasters wiped out in about seven years conrad lake was in effect the last and for a while the biggest and wealthiest hopmaster in herefordshire his poles and frames had surrounded knights frome like a great creosoted barrier looking like belsen sally boswell had said disdainfully like auschwitz the estate was big enough when he inherited it and twice as big when the first disaster struck lol recalled the portrait photograph of conrad lake in the third and smallest room at the hop museum his smile submerged in a heavy moustache a difficult greedy and obsessive man sally had said referred to by the locals behind his back as the emperor of frome twice married and both wives had left him the second taking his infant son they never divorced the boy adam was raised by his mother and grandparents in warwickshire never again saw his father who stayed in knights frome and fought all through the s against the aphids the red spiders and the white mould and against the banks who kept squeezing him forcing him to sell off his estate piece by piece big drama said prof laconically the land had then been bought by various farmers most of them from outside knights frome which explained why there was no real community any more why so many of the scattered houses were now owned by incomers like prof a few of the old hopyards had been reinstated but demand was no longer so great with so many breweries importing cheaper hops from germany and the usa most of it was grazed now a pity in a way sally boswell had said because the deep river loam in the valleys of the frome and the lugg was so perfect for hops and yet in a way not a pity at all it was no accident that the third room in the museum was the darkest a sober coda to the song of the hop but not everyone it seemed believed it was over least of all adam lake son of the emperor though the storm had passed and the evening fields were left steaming under a bashful sun the power failed to return and prof announced in disgust that he was going to bed you give me a call when its dark laurence if weve got the bleeding juice back i always work better after dark as you know lol watched him stumping across the yard to the cottage then went back and sat for a while in the studio trying the river frome song again on the boswell and then because he felt bad about deserting it on his faithful old washburn but the song still lacked direction and after a while he gave up and went out into the luminous stormwashed evening as the trees dripped and the air glistened with birdsong lol made his first real foray into what remained of the community of knights frome a soggy rug of slurry unrolled from a farm entrance towards the edge of what passed for the centre of the hamlet big old trees oak and sycamore and horse chestnut were still dripping onto the roofs of stone and timberframed cottages that sprouted like wild mushrooms a humpback bridge straddled the frome and on the other side of it was the church sunken and settled as an old barn and next to it the whitepainted vicarage where simon st john lived there was no shop here any more but a pub survived a pub created sixty years ago lol had learned out of a row of terraced cottages to cater for the hoppicking hordes it hadnt changed much there were no friendly signs promising food or coffee no rustic fort for the kids just a rotting bench beside the porch the pub was called the hop devil on its sign nothing more demonic than a red and smoking brazier the sign was hanging from a gibbet at the road end of the dirt forecourt it was reassuring to see places like this still in business but that didnt necessarily mean you had to go inside lol the sometime folk singer the traditionalist was actually wary of country pubs often the haunts of old men in worn tweeds and young men in stained denims bruising you with their stares until you finished your drink too quickly and slid away as he padded cautiously past the pub its scuffed and ruststudded oak door creaked open releasing a richly brackish oldbeer smell and also a man in a checked shirt with the sleeves rolled up moleskin trousers stuffed into high tan boots he came loping angrily over the puddles in the forecourt a tall bloke with muttonchop whiskers swallowing his scowl when he saw he wasnt alone glancing briefly over lols head evening lol took a step back into the slurry to avoid having the guy knock him down and walk over him needed that storm i suppose the man called back over his shoulder he was about thirtyfive with a lean face and a wide beerdrinkers mouth he gave the sky a dismissive glance getting too muggy lol nodded was a bit but the big guy appeared to have finished with him was climbing into a mudscabbed land rover defender on the edge of the forecourt and now another voice was curling lazily out of the pub porch lol robinson profs unwelcome neighbour gerard stock was leaning against the door frame a whisky glass in his right hand a rollup smouldering in his left lol walked over like he had a choice the defender crunched and clattered away through the trees and into the lane while stock stood watching it go wanker he said arsehole lol realized he was drunk wanker strolls in stock tossed his cigarette into a puddle and heres gerard stock sidding at the bar minding his own wanker barks out cursory greeting then drifts off to the dark end of the bar engaging derek the landlord in some trivial chat and all the time liddle sidelong glances corner of an eye wondering whether this is the day to make his move and gerard stocks just smiling into his glass and saying nothing and the wanker knows that gerard stock knows hes a phoney liddle arsehole i dont really know too many people around here lol said who was he stock swallowed some whisky there was a powerful fug of mixed fumes around him like if you struck a match the air would flare and sizzle see i dont have to talk to people if i dont want to its a rare skill and im good at it man i can be very relaxed very cool sidding quietly saying nothing liddleknown trick of the trade people think pr men talk all the time talk any old shite but a good publicist has control tells you what he wants you to know when he wants you to know it timing and gerard stock case you were wondering is still a fucking good operator you coming in lol well i dont think come n have a drink id offer you some spliff and we could sit out here chill out reminisce but poor old dereks very timid for a country landlord stock grinned see ive made you curious you thought you were supposed to know who the wanker was and now you want to you really want to technique i can turn it on man they were inside the hop devil now small and square and dark as a chapel the landlord peered out from the shadows around the bar sorry gents only bottled and shorts powers off see put your glasses on derek its me again said stock with a friend what are we having lol robinson lol said a half of shandy would be good and stock groaned jesus christ no wonder you got yourself out of music have to pay for a pint shandy im afraid the shadowy derek said got to open a bottle of beer see and they dont come in quarterpints and another macallan stock said how longve i been here derek since just before lunch derek sighed on and off after they collected their drinks stock steered lol to a table by the biggest window the only other customer appeared to be an elderly man with a bottle of guinness and a copy of the worcester evening news he surely couldnt see to read lol made out an inglenook fireplace with a brazier like the one on the sign outside whats a hop devil thing they burned coke in hoppickers used to cook their meals over it you wanna know all this rustic shite theres a dear old couple run a hop museum out on the main road sold me a hoppillow he obviously hadnt discovered who al boswell actually was supposed to give you a good nights sleep sleep stock brayed fucking hops work like rhino horn fact man me and steph were living in this old kiln walls impregnated with as much essence of hop as as the beer poor old derek cant pump my wife stock swallowed whisky shook his head and growled leaves scratches a foot long down my back you wan see ill take your word lol avoided stocks eyes wondering how he could find out what the guys wife looked like could use some bloody sleep stock bawled out can i sleep here derek thought you always did gerry said derek gerard you fucking peasant the old man looked up from the paper he couldnt see to read language sir said derek derek goes to church lol stock had lowered his voice but not much derek listens to saint simons sermons cant be so pissed can i if i can say that shaint did i tell you i was briefly head of publicity for tmm for whom saint shimon used to record as a young man wasnt so fucking saintly in those days by all accounts shaint shimon the shirtlifterjesus thats an even better one shaint shimon the shirt im going to have to ask you to leave in a minute mr stock stock waved an arm in the direction of the bar ill be quiet dont send me home landlord im too shagged out you were going to tell me who that guy was lol said the guy with the putting a hand either side of his face to signify sidewhiskers stock beamed i said didn i said i could still do it youre curious yeah lol sighed im curious liddle shit annoyed the piss out of me following me in here like that youd already been here about six hours derek said quietly before mr lake came in as if he thought i was going to make the move that id ask him to make me an offer no chance no frigging chance im sorry lol said im not getting this course you arent im about to tell you wankers adam lake his old man owned knights frome more or less then lost it the lot several farms this pub finally even my place that clappedout old kiln died in penury welldeserved by all accounts and now adam the boy that was him with the the young squire the wanker wants it all back roots birthright the whole sprawling lake estate right said lol some of this hed already had if less colourfully from sally boswell field by field barn by barn hes approaching the buggers who bought land off his old man one by one making em offers only a complete idiot would refuse his heritage geddit buying back his heritage the young emperor of frome he can afford oh yeah big irony is the liddle shit can well afford hes a dot com fucking millionaire stock spat out the words like cherry stones or whatever else they called them fore someone coined the term adam weve since learned invested some of his mas money few years ago in what mightve appeared at the time to be an offthewall software concept proposed by an old university friend which in fact created the worlds fastest searchengine at the time probably be like a bloody steamroller these days sold it off for some obscene sum and then oh this is boring its not bloody important how the cunt got his millions lol sipped at his shandy which was warm im sorry about your wifes uncle poor old bugger stock said viciously wonder how well he knew the fucking vicar thats it said derek softly coming out of the shadows a bald middleaged man with serviceable fists out you go mr stock shimon shirtlifter stock said and giggled into his glass lol couldnt avoid walking back with him and for most of the way stock was talking about his career as a publicist at tmm and other recording and management companies and then working solo for book publishers and film and tv companies outfits that hadnt known how badly they needed him until they had him on board and i could do it for levin too man doesnt see it yet but he will poor old guy thinks hes being cool and enigmatic getting out of london downsizing all that shite doesnt realize how soon hell be forgotten actually i think he wants to be i could make that hovel of a studio worldfamous in six months a hint here a line there i could get levin on the south bank show got a good friend at lwt maybe you lol gave up stock wasnt the kind of bloke to whom you said you dont really know prof very well do you they left the lane and walked down the track past profs stables towards the concealed river under a sky like beaten copper gerard stock raised his face to the sun and it reddened his beard he looked wide and powerful and ruthless and yet somehow lol thought unsure of himself like a viking on a strange shore and you lol robinson shy boy with the liddle glasses very cute to a certain kind of woman you were marketable man once lol said nothing stock was talking the way he had earlier as if it was all too late for a career which prof seemed to see as still salvageable maybe this was deliberate to sound him out or put prof down and let us not forget stock grinned slyly all those years in and out of the loony bin marketable plus lol shot him a sidelong glance oh yeah i know your history checked you out soons i got home my business is to know everything about everybody i am the man stock kicked a stone down the track and then he looked directly into the sinking sun and his voice suddenly sagged and now all right im broke only cash flow of course as we say youve got the house the kiln yeah stroke of luck there cause wed been reduced to living in a bloody trailer at the time poor old stewart perhaps he shouldve taken the wankers offer when he had the chance you see buying the kiln back very very important to adam because that was the site of the original ancestral home conrad lakes mansion lord no that came later but this was the original family farm twice the size it is now but not big enough for conrad once he was on the up built the new place for the new wife bout a mile over the hill there where adam lives all there was left to bequeath to the boy the old mand already knocked down half the farmhouse this is late sixties when you could still get away with flattening history just kept the kiln when he died and the bank or whoever flogged it off stewart picks it up for a song they crossed the river bridge passed between the poplars and then suddenly the kiln was in view halfway up a hill or rather part of a conical tower was visible the tip of its cowl pointing at an angle lol stopped shocked a wall of bright blue corrugated metal concealed the rest of it the side of some huge industrial building rising almost as high as the kiln itself it hadnt been apparent the other night except as a patch of shadow that might have been trees or part of the hill now in an area where most of the farms and cottages looked almost organic its brashness was savage stock watched lols reaction halfsmiling you like adam lakes barn theres another one the other side even higher about ten yards away man were living in a barn sandwich he did that wankers land surrounds us had the first one put in place after stewart refused to sell him the kiln can he do that stocks fury made sudden sense done it hasnt he yeah sure he can country landowners can throw up whatever kind of monstrosity they want long as its an agricultural building and they can show a need for it need jesus you know what those barns are used for nothing theyre empty great echoing empty shells he did it just to steal the light stock was sweating but he seemed sober now its about stealing the light you see this was particularly cruel though whether lake was subtle enough to realize that is anybodys guess because the old boy was a photographer light being his medium yeah stock took out his tin to roll a smoke he loved light course lake wasnt trying to force him to sell he just needed some extra storage facilities for hay and sundry fodder at the extremity of his estate thats what he tells you the cunt didnt stewart make any kind of protest didnt live long enough thanks to his good friends the gypos those lithe and slippery gypo boys dear oh dear but yeah he did make a last meaningful gesture the path forked lol thought this was probably the point at which hed lost his way the other night and stock went to the left and climbed over a stile the kiln house was in front of them now it was built of red brick and was smaller than it had looked by night and now the full horror of the barn sandwich became apparent the actual kiln tower with just one window was at the front but most of the other windows seemed to be on the sides permanently shadowed by industrial metal lol climbed over the stile and found stock standing on the edge of the field lighting his rollup if you hadnt guessed uncle stewarts final gesture was gerard stock stephie was stewarts he coughed out smoke favourite niece always close to her after her parents split hows she repay him marries gerard stock stephs sweet eighteen this guys twenny years older smokes a lot of dope gets both of them busted one time dear oh dear and oh yeah the clincher one night stephie falls downstairs and loses her baby and theres some internal messiness so there arent gonna be any more babies and this is all gerard stocks fault naturally and stephie once beloved gets sliced out of stewarts will we thought they both looked up at the kiln house now why said stock would the dear old turdburglar let his beloved home fall into the hands of a man he couldnt stand the fucking sight of youre right he didnt bequeath his house to gerard stock he bequeathed gerard stock to adam lake stock coughed then laughed the sun was sinking fast and the side of the kiln house facing the nearest barn was already almost black in its shadow when lake finds out who inherited we get a letter from his agent making an offer we refuse thats when the second barn goes up he nodded at the house there you go powers back on lights had appeared in two of the windows in the shadowed wall none of them seemed to be very big windows lol noticed and the stocks wouldnt even be allowed to enlarge them because the kiln house would be on the historicbuildings list living there couldnt be easy it would look like deepest winter all year round you have to keep lights on all day some yeah we live like moles but its a liddle better than the trailer what even though lol broke off he couldnt say it stock could even though we have our dining table resting on the flagstones where the nice gypsy boys spread uncle stewarts brains he burst out laughing again but it was shallower this time and soon tailed off the light that lol remembered from the other night came on palely below the conical roof of the kiln spooky stocks cigarette lit up in his rosebud lips like a spark from the setting sun he stood with his legs apart looking like some kind of psychotic troll its a spooky place you believe in ghosts lol lol thought of the naked woman in the naked hopyard who for one icy moment yeah he said i suppose i do i dont stock squeezed out his cigarette between finger and thumb and winced but something needs dealing with mercury retrograde late saturday afternoon the vicarage seemed more still and vast than merrily had ever known it one woman seven bedrooms even the kitchen was as quiet as a crypt wearing janes old radiohead tshirt she sat down at the table took out the lumpy old penny from a hip pocket of her jeans and stared at the blurred woman with the trident some broads had all the backbone in the dawnlit chancel shed blessed the coin on the altar and then been unable to go through with the rest spending the next halfhour on her knees concluding that she was not a natural psychic and could never imagine herself approaching a state of grace and then it had been time to go home and finish the last bits of janes packing and help carry her bags out to the boot of eirions stepmothers silver bmw where eirion stowed it as carefully as if it was the kids trousseau and kept looking over his shoulder at jane as if to make sure she was still there his guileless face breaking into the kind of smile that told you everything you didnt really want to know merrily caught herself thinking he was the sort of guy jane ought to meet in about ten years time when shed been around god it was always so hard sometimes you wished they could have some kind of lifeexperience cell implanted in their brains as soon as they hit puberty jane was being practical methodical counting off on her fingers all the things she needed to take and avoiding eirions eyes merrily noticed eirion she thought she could understand jane was more complex jane she suspected would always be complex last night the power hadnt gone off they hadnt managed a proper talk but what was she supposed to have said anyway dont do anything i wouldnt do at about three and a half years older than jane shed been pregnant you will be ok wont you mum the kid wore a highnecked lemonandwhite striped top and white jeans shed looked about nine yes flower ill avoid junk food i wont drink to excess ill observe speed limits and ill try to be home before midnight the kid was still looking too serious her mood clearly did not match eirions and erm i expect youll ring occasionally from pembrokeshire course got enough money i wont flash the plastic unless things get really tight if thats whatever merrily said do you want to take the mobile they still only had one between them your needs far greater than mine besides its supposed to be a holiday jane picked up ethel the black cat and nuzzled her a whole month she wont remember me of course she will anyway i can borrow irenes phone ring any time any time at all its all in eirion had closed the boot and stood with his back to the car his baseball cap hanging from both hands at waist level obviously trying to control his smile contain a youthful glee that might be viewed as uncool off you go then flower merrily accepted ethel popping her down on the lawn where she lifted a paw and began to lick it unconcerned cats hugging them at the gate eirion had felt reassuringly stocky and trustworthy janes face had felt hot now merrily laid the coin on the table her eyes suddenly filling up a hollow feeling in her chest she was thirtyseven years old she wondered sometimes if the kids dead father the faithless sean could ever see them she tried to remember if sean had ever been remotely like eirion but the only image she could conjure up was the range of emotions dismay anger resignation and a final apologetic tenderness warping his twentyyearold face on the night shed told him that something that would turn out to be jane had been detected she walked aimlessly into the echoey hall looked at herself in the mirror a good two inches shorter than jane now on her the onesize oncevenerated radiohead tshirt looked as baggy as a surplice she thought about taking the coin to the church again but it wasnt long after five pm and thered probably still be the odd tourist about or worse a local the vicar tossing a coin at the altar itd be all round the village before closing time at the black swan on impulse she went out to the volvo unfinished business a surprise visit to the shelbones in the cool of a saturday evening just happening to be passing in the churchyard at dilwyn the yews threw big shadows across three women leaving the porch none of them was hazel shelbone and when merrily reached the bungalow there was no car in the drive and the garage doors were open no vehicle inside family outing but as merrily drove slowly past she caught a flicker of movement at the end of a path running alongside the garage she drove on for about two hundred yards past the last house in the lane and parked the volvo next to a metal fieldgate with no animals in the field she figured it was safe to leave the car there for a while she got out and walked back to the shelbones bungalow where she pressed the bell and waited no answer ok round the back the flagged path dividing the bungalow and the concrete garage ended at a small black wroughtiron gate as merrily went quietly through it she heard a handle turning like a door opening at the rear of the house around the corner of the bungalow she came face to face with amy shelbone emerging from a glassedin back porch the girl jumped back in alarm her face red and ruchedup thin bare arms down by her sides stiff as dead twigs fists clenched tight sorry amy i rang the bell but amy was blinking breathing hard she had on a sleeveless yellow dress her thin fair hair was pulled back into a ponytail she wore white gymshoes not trainers theyre not here merrily turned and closed the metal gate behind her as if the girl might bolt like a feral kitten well she said perhaps moving slowly to the edge of the path taking a step on to the lawn no the kid backed away towards a small greenhouse in which the suns reflection hung like a lamp no you just keep away from me recognition at last then its ok ill stay here merrily looked down at her tshirt its my day off see no cross no dog collar go away merrily shook her head not this time youre trespassing its disgraceful ill call the police ok amy backed against the greenhouse then sprang away from it and started to cry her shoulders shaking a gawky sticklimbed adolescent in a large plain rectangular garden i only want to talk merrily said or better still listen go away what would be the point id just have to keep coming back people like you make me sick amy said so i heard ha ha amy cawed i was sick in church once its no big deal amy looked down at her white shoes in silence and sometimes ive felt gods let me down merrily said you think hes watching you suffer and not lifting a finger you think maybe gods not not a very nice person and then sometimes you wake up in the night and you think theres nobody out there at all that everybodys been lying to you even your own parents and thats the loneliest thing amy didnt look at her she walked to the middle of the halfshadowed lawn the garden severely bushless and flowerless backed on to open fields that looked more interesting amy stopped and mumbled at her shoes they did lie your mum and dad theyre not yes they are they wanted you not just any baby you thats a pretty special kind of mum and dad amy didnt reply she was intertwining her fingers in front of her kneading them and seemed determined to keep at least six yards between herself and merrily with feral cats you put down food and kept moving the bowl closer to the house it might take weeks months before you could touch them where are they your mum and dad amy produced a handkerchief from a pocket of her frock a real handkerchief white and folded she shook it out revealing an embroidered a in one corner and wiped her eyes and blew her nose shopping she said dully crumpling the hanky they go shopping every second saturday in hereford she cant drive how long have they been gone why do you want to know amy hacked a heel sulkily into the grass then she said they went off about nine they always go off at nine theyll be back soon i expect and you stayed home there was no point it wasnt clear what she meant at first she hadnt seemed much like the teacherspet type of girl described by either her mother or more significantly jane yet there was something that kept pulling her back from the edge of open rebellion making her answer merrilys questions in spite of herself could we go in the house do you think no merrily nodded ok i dont have to talk to you of course you dont nobody has to talk to anybody but you often feel glad afterwards that you did amy shook her head you used to talk to god didnt you merrily said i bet you used to talk to god quite a lot the girls intertwined fingers tightened as if theyd suddenly been set in cement but you dont do that any more because you think god betrayed you do you want to tell me how he did that amy how you were betrayed no have you told your mum and dad amy nodded and what did they merrily broke off because amy was looking directly at her now her plain pale face was wedgeshaped and her cheeks seemed concave she did not look well anorexics looked like this i dont need to talk to god sneering out the word god doesnt tell you anything gods a waste of time if i want to talk i can talk i can talk to her her voice was suddenly soft and reverent for a moment merrily thought of the virgin mary her over amys shoulder the lamp of the sun glowed in the greenhouse justine amy whispered justine in the softening heat of early evening amys lips parted and she shivered this shiver was particularly shocking because it seemed to ripple very slowly through her because it seemed almost a sexual reaction merrily went still whos justine amy amys body tightened up no amy get out amy screamed just get out you horrible lying thing its nothing to do with you as if shed been planning this for some minutes she suddenly hurled herself across the lawn passing within a couple of feet of merrily and into the glazed porch slamming the door shooting a bolt and glaring in defiance from the other side of the glass poor kid three times that evening merrily tried to call hazel shelbone twice it was engaged the third time there was no answer when shed got home thered been a message from jane on the answering machine merrily replayed it twice trying to detect the subtext well we got here all of us the whole family its quite a big place an old whitewashed farmhouse about half a mile from the sea near an old quarry but you can see the sea from it of course so its yeah cool and the whole familys here everybody so well ill call you look after ethel and like your little self night night mum hmm the whole family huh the shadows of apple trees meshed across the vicarage garden in the scullery merrily switched on the computer rewrote her notes for tomorrows sermon and printed them out it was to be the first one in well quite a long time that shed given around the familiar theme of suffer little children to come unto me a complex issue how should we bring kids to christ or was it better in the long term to let them find their own way merrily deleted a reference to janes maxim any kind of spirituality has to be better than none at all dangerous ground we never pressed the church on her david and i hazel shelbone had said never forced religion on any of our children bet you did really merrily thought gazing out at the deepening blue whether you intended to or not she recalled hazel saying in answer to her question about what might have got into amy the spirit of a dead person in a voice that was firm and intense and quite convinced now she had a question for hazel who is justine she reached out for the telephone and as often happened it rang under her hand he said his name was fred potter it was a middleaged kind of name somehow but he sounded as if he was in his early twenties max he said he worked for the three counties news service a freelance agency based in worcester supplying news stories to national papers he said he was sorry to trouble her but he understood she was the county exorcist more or less merrily admitted just that we put a story round earlier fred said but a couple of the sundays have come back asking for a quote from you or the bishop and the bishop seems to be unavailable lets see saturday night probably out clubbing what oh he laughed listen mrs watkins if i lay this thing out for you very briefly perhaps you could see if you have any comments ive got to be really quick because the editions go to bed pretty early on a saturday go on then right this chaps convinced his house is badly haunted he and his wife are losing a lot of sleep over this its an old hopkiln a man was murdered there now they say theyre getting these you know phenomena i see wow said fred it always amazes me when you people say i see and sure like its everyday stuff isnt it wow fred said brrrr is this person living in the diocese of course just i havent heard about it well this is the point fred said our friend gets on to his local vicar and asks him if he can do something about this problem and the local vicar refuses just like that more or less what did the vicar say to you he said no comment odd so what do you think do you think its a genuine case of psychic disturbance hey thats not for me to say is it what i wanted to ask you was what is the official policy of the diocese on dealing with alleged cases of you know ghostly infestation whatever you want to call it like if you get something reported to you we help where we can merrily said and how common is it for you to refuse i didnt refuse its never been referred to me no i mean let me tell you the normal procedure with deliverance which is the umbrella term for what we do a person with a psychic or spiritual problem goes to his or her local priest and explains the situation then the priest decides whether to handle it personally or pass it on to someone like me right do they have to tell you about it no im here if they need me sometimes theyll just ring up and ask for a bit of advice and if its something i can tell them i do or maybe ill need to seek advice from somebody who knows more about a particular type of phenomenon than i do so if i say to you now have you had a call or a report from the reverend simon st john at knights frome about a plea for help hes received from a mr stock no not a word but the vicar doesnt have to refer anything to me even if hes refusing to take any action even if hes refusing to take any action doesnt it worry you that theres someone in the diocese whos plagued by ghosts and cant get any help from the church merrily had dealt with the media often enough to recognize the point where she was going to be quoted verbatim erm if i was aware of someone in genuine need of spiritual support i would want to see they received whatever help we were able to give them but id need to know more about the circumstances before i could comment on this particular case im sure the reverend st john has a good reason for taking the line hes taken there was a pause then fred potter said yep thatll do me fine thanks very much mrs watkins whoa hang on arent you going to give me this guys address phone number mr stock you going to look into it yourself just for the record fred oh all right hang on a sec she wrote down mr stocks address afterwards she looked up the number of the rev simon st john she didnt know the man but she thought she ought at least to warn him no answer lately everywhere she tried there was no answer jane would explain this astrologically suggesting mercury was retrograde thus delaying or blocking all forms of communication bollocks always amazes me when you people say i see and sure like its everyday stuff merrily gathered up the printed notes for her sermon and walked into the lonely darkening kitchen god and music theyd turned stocks kilnhouse into draculas castle rearing against the light looking to lol very much as it had on that first milky night only darker more brooding black hell it shrieked at him from the pile of newspapers in the shop the top copy folded back to page five two other customers bought copies while he was still staring you believe in ghosts lol christ he hadnt seen this one coming had he nobody had judging from the comments in the shop ive heard of this feller a woman in sweatpants told the newsagent hes an alcoholic on bloody drugs more like an elderly man said the newsagent nodded need to be one or the other to live in that place whichever it was a development prof levin did not need to know about lol decided driving back from bishops frome with a bunch of papers on the passenger seat it was eightthirty the sun already high another hot one prof was due to leave for london before ten his cases already stowed in the back of his rotting range rover abbey road beckoning the unstable virtuoso tom storey would already be pacing the floor with his old telecaster strapped on spraying nervy riffs into the sacred space lol considered leaving the people in the astra until after prof had gone not as if hed notice all the time hed been staying here lol had never once seen him open a newspaper it was only lol himself who was insecure enough to need to know the planet was still in motion in the end he gathered the papers into a fat stack with the observer on top and walked into the stables with it under his arm he found prof in the kitchen connected to his lifesupport cappuccino machine froth on his beard two things laurence one when i return i expect to hear demos of five new songs no excuses you get st john over to help if he dont want to come you get his wife to kick him up the behind metaphorically speaking in her case as youll find out the vicars married prof gave him a narrow look why do you ask no particular prof frowned robinson i can read you like the sun whos been talking about the vicar what was the second thing you said two things the second thing maybe i mentioned this before is you keep that bastard stock out of here bad enough he shows up when im around i dont want himwhat whats going down whats wrong lol sighed he didnt want to pass on stocks innuendo about simon he unrolled the newspapers observer sunday times people he handed the tabloid to prof whats this crap prof held up the paper squinting down through his bifocals what am i looking at lol said nothing after about half a minute prof peered over the page at him looking uncharacteristically bewildered glassyeyed as if hed been winded by a punch from nowhere to the stomach he put down the paper on the upturned packing case he was still using as a breakfast bar this man he said at last is the most unbelievable piece of walking shit it was ever my misfortune to encounter is there nothing in his life he wont exploit there were two pictures one of them tall and narrow running alongside the story this was the draculas castle shot of the kiln house doctored for dramatic effect the other near the foot of the page showed an unsmiling gerard stock holding a candle in a holder his arm around a younger woman with curly hair our black hell in the house of horror by dave lang a terrified couple spoke last night of their haunted hell in the grim old house where a relative was brutally murdered and they claimed that a rural mafia had condemned them to face the horror alone gerard and stephanie stock say their sixmonth ordeal in the remote converted hopkiln has driven them to the edge of nervous breakdowns but when they asked the local vicar to perform an exorcism he refused even to enter the house which is so dark they need lights on all day even in summer the couple inherited the th century kiln house near bromyard in herefordshire from mrs stocks uncle stewart ash the author and photographer who was beaten to death there by burglars less than a year ago since they moved in at the end of last january the stocks say they have endured creeping footsteps on the stairs at night strange glowing lights in an abandoned hopfield at the front of the house furniture moving around a bloodstain that wont go away an apparition of a hazy figure which walks out of solid brick walls its become a complete nightmare said mr stock a yearold public relations consultant everybody locally knows theres something wrong in this place but its as if theres a conspiracy of silence its a rural mafia around here and now it looks as if even the vicar has been got at turn to page prof shook his head slowly madness laurence you reckon nah prof turned over the page and creased the spine of the paper laid it back on the packing cases next to his coffee cup contemptuously punched the crease flat with the heel of a fist not in a million frigging years let me finish this and then well talk lol read the story over profs shoulder mr stock and his thirtyfouryearold wife say the house has proved impossible to heat and theyve built up massive electricity bills running to hundreds of pounds and the already gloomy house was made even darker when neighbouring landowner adam lake built two massive barns either side of it blocking light from all the side windows mr lake has claimed the buildings were necessary for his farming operation but mr stock claimed the landowner was furious because both they and stewart ash had refused to sell him the house and had the giant barns built to make the haunted kiln impossible to live in lake showed up here once prof said made me an offer for this place even though it wasnt part of his old mans original estate crazy the guys as mad and arrogant as stock dresses like some oldstyle squire twice his age campaigns for foxhunting jesus i saw him the other night hes a buffoon and he dont fully realize the kind of desperate bastard hes up against though maybe he does now you really think stocks making all this up to try and publicly shame lake into moving those barns look prof said stocks on his uppers right suddenly he gets a break he wins a house with problems attached sure but its a wonderfully unexpected gift and hes determined to capitalize he wants the very maximum he can get hes gonna use whatever skills hes got whatever contacts whats he got to lose nothing not even his credibility whats he got to gain jesus those barns go you can add seventy eighty thousand to the market value of that place why doesnt he just sell to lake for some inflated price and walk away prof opened out his hands in exasperation because he is gerard stock that first barn made poor stewarts life into a black hell gerard stock says but he was a stubborn man and refused to give in but mr ashs determined stand was ended the night he surprised two young burglars they beat the sixtysixyearold author to death on the stone floor of his kitchen i did not believe in ghosts or hauntings but ive often felt uncle stewarts presence in the kitchen says mrs stock i feel his spirit has been somehow trapped in the darkness of this place the stocks approached the local vicar the rev simon st john asking him to exorcize their home but he didnt want to know said mr stock he implied that we ought to be looking for psychiatric help when something like this happens you become aware of a rural mafia at work stewart ash fell foul of it and it looks as if we have too nobody in the village speaks to us except other outsiders ive even been refused service in the pub lol shook his head he only got thrown out because he was completely pissed and insulting people profs beard jutted who was he insulting laurence well simon called him saint simon and other things stock said he used to work for tmm when simon was in a band recording with them the philosophers stone prof said tonelessly for your own information simon was a classical musician a session cellist if you like and he was brought into this band about twenty years ago tom storey was in it too for his sins i worked with them for a while for all our sins it didnt last i think i remember something prof looked hard at lol whatever you heard it was probably crap whatever stock said about simon you can put it to the back of your mind for a while god and music were fighting over simon but it was never really a contest hes a good man he loves his music but he needs his god and his wife and whatever else you hear simon and isabel this is a marriage to die for you understand whatever you say said lol bemused of course he refuses to exorcize the house of this despicable scheming bastard he knows as well as i do that theres no conceivable basis for this garbage stock asked me if i believed in ghosts lol said mr stock added i never believed in ghosts but after what weve witnessed here it seems to me that the spirit of stewart ash cannot rest even though two young men have been convicted of his murder i cant help feeling that the whole truth has not yet come out and perhaps someone in the area knows more than theyre saying we feel very isolated but we feel we owe it to the memory of stephs murdered uncle to see this through the rev simon st john refused to comment about what he said was a private matter but herefords diocesan exorcist the rev merrily watkins said last night that she would be looking into the case if i was aware of someone in genuine need of spiritual support i would want to see they received whatever help we were able to give them she said pah prof tossed the paper to the stained stone flags on the floor hes trying to stir the shit its what he does now they have to try to shore up this nonsensical crap by calling in some stupid woman who doesnt know stock from adam and then they wonder whywhats the matter now laurence what is the matter with you this morning nothing lol said that is i know her thats all the exorcist we lived in the same village when i was with alison and then not with alison prof squinted curiously over his bifocals you know this exorcist this woman priest i thought you couldnt stand priests lol shrugged except for this one eh nicelooking shes lol thought he was too old to be blushing profs little smile indicated that perhaps he wasnt yet i havent seen her in some months shes become a friend a friend we can all change said lol he had a mental image of a small woman in a toolong duffel coat borrowed from her daughter windblown on the edge of an iron age hill fort overlooking the city of hereford requiem my my prof stood up and went to rinse his coffee cup at the sink and see by the way that you keep this place in such a condition that we dont have visits from the jobsworths at the environmental health he placed the cup on a narrow shelf matted with dust and grease he started to whistle lightly what said lol hmmm they got room for a mere man with god in the bed i dont think so women priests women rabbis you ask me its the catholics got it right on this one not that youre an old reactionary or anything plus exorcism that isnt a game underneath the cynicism and bluster prof was some kind of believer lol had always known this this stock crap this is a game youre entirely sure of that prof lol had kept staring at the picture of gerard stock and stephanie stock but like the shot of the kiln it was printed for effect her face twodimensional in the candlelight it could be but he couldnt be sure and if it was what did that say about stock and his alleged haunting listen dont get involved prof unplugged his cappuccino machine began to roll up the flex you let stock and lake get on with destroying each other warn the woman priest to keep out of it as well youre taking that thing with you just work on your songs prof said dont let any of those people into this place when im gone bad penny im just calling to apologize merrily said to the vicar of knights frome i wasnt exactly misquoted i just wasnt fully quoted they didnt use where i explained that i couldnt really comment on a case i knew nothing about and i was sure you must have had good reason for refusing to deal with this guy so im sorry yeah sure i mean thats fine the rev simon st john said there was a pause on the line sorry which paper did you say it was in what it was gone three in the afternoon it had been before nine this morning when shed called into the eighttilllate in ledwardine on her way back from holy communion to ask if she might have a quick flip through the tabloids actually missing the story first time never expecting a spread this size you mean merrily sat up at the scullery desk you mean you havent read it i dont see the papers much simon st john said in his placid middleengland voice but you must have known they were going to publish it i suppose i had an idea yes had a the mind boggled she tried another direction erm the feeling i get is that this mr stock is trying to get back at the landowner mr lake and also his wifes uncle id guess st john said the one whos dead its rather complicated he didnt seem unfriendly but neither did he seem inclined to explain anything last try youve also been accused of being part of a rural mafia merrily said simon st john laughed there was laidback merrily thought and there was indifferent ive been accused of far worse things than that he said eventually but thanks for letting me know thats ok i expect well get to meet sooner or later yes goodbye then he said it was another of those days mercury still retrograde evidently she tried the shelbones again and let the phone ring for at least a couple of minutes before hanging up and calling back and getting as shed half expected the engaged tone the implication of this was that someone was dialling to see whod called so maybe they would phone her back but they didnt and hazel shelbones excuse that she didnt want to talk to merrily while amy was in the house was wearing thin most people now had a mobile especially senior council officials behind that oldfashioned godfearing christianity deep at the bottom of the reservoir of maternal love there was something suspicious about this family so how was she supposed to proceed the request for a spiritual cleansing was still on the table merrily didnt think she could just turn away like simon st john besides she was curious she was finishing her evening meal of malvern ewes cheese and salad when fred potter the freelance journalist rang again before you say anything merrily said who alerted you to this story i mean originally ah well he laughed nervously you know how it goes with news sources yeah down a oneway street if someone like me doesnt disclose something were accused of covering up the truth while youre protecting your sources she paused how about off the record oh mrs watkins you know merrily said thoughtfully something tells me this wont necessarily be the last time our paths cross i do tend to get mixed up in all kinds of things that could make good stories who knows when you might youre a very devious woman im a minister of god she said primly the scullerys white walls were aflame with sunset she lit a cigarette all right fred potter said off the record it was brought in by our boss malcolm millar he knows stock from way back stock was in pr when was all this when did you learn about it couple of days ago malcolm sent me out to see the stocks yesterday morning so its likely they cooked it up between them oh no i dont think so i mean a ghost story thats not something you can verify is it i can tell you its dead right about how dark it is in there i couldnt live in that place its a scandal that this guy lake can just block off someones daylight to that extent there are laws on ancient lights its one for stocks solicitor but the press dont charge a hundred pounds an hour do we what im getting at thats not our problem is it i mean the churchs we just come in on the haunting and if that turns out to be made up please mrs watkins im not making notes fred im just covering myself its like asking if i believe in ghosts he said maybe i dont but a lot of people do dont they presumably you must sometimes ok a pause as if he was looking round to make sure he was alone hes a bit of an operator stock hes been in pr a long time a lot of pr involves making up stories that sound plausible if he did want to make up a story hed know how to go about it and he obviously knew where to take it its only people close to the media who know that if you want to make a big impact very quickly you dont go to a paper and offer them an exclusive you go to an agency like ours because we can send it all round national papers tv radio and the more outlets you send it to the more money you collect sure news is a business but its in our interest at the end of the day to make sure the storys sound or at least you know stands up or else various outlets are gonna stop coming back to us if you get a reputation for being a bent agency its not good longterm but bottom line this probably is a scam fred hesitated i dont know hes a bombastic kind of bloke comes over like big mates soon as he meets you but underneath i reckon there was something worrying him he was really shaky i mean when people are quivering and telling you how terrified they are it could be an act but when somebodys got this veneer of cockiness and something else call it fear shows through thats harder to fake isnt it or it could mean hes got a drink problem or something i really wouldnt like to say youre not gonna drop me in it are you i mean id love to work for the independent or something but youve got to take what you can get lifes such a bitch fred what did you ring for anyway a followup i suppose a new line on the story i mean you said you were going to look into it i didnt really though did i what i said give me a break merrily i think youll find a few papersll pick up on this again tomorrow meaning youll try and persuade them to its fred potter whistled thinly its a business like i said all right off the record he sighed yeah ok im in a difficult position merrily said its hard for me to move on anything unless the local minister requests assistance in this case it strikes me that the local guy st john knows exactly what mr stocks up to so i dont think were going to want to get involved but if you do take it any further ill let you know promise thats what they all say yeah but im a minister of the church fred hmm fred potter said merrily washed up her solitary dinner plate went back into the scullery and called the shelbones yet again the phone rang and rang and she just knew the bungalow wasnt empty she imagined all three shelbones standing in the narrow hall silently watching the base unit quivering these shelbones were wearing starched puritan dress like the pilgrim fathers and the phone was a dangerous conduit to a bad modern world that they believed could only do them harm she put back the receiver picked up her cigarettes and lighter and took them into the kitchen where she put the kettle on she stood at the west window waiting for the water to boil looking out on the twilit garden and the scrum of shadows in the apple orchard where in the rev wil williams of this parish was said to have hanged himself to escape a charge of witchcraft it was claimed wil had frolicked here with sylphs and fauns except it probably hadnt been so simple merrily recalled amy shelbones thin body surrendering to that eerie shiver whos justine amy she slid a cigarette between her lips and flicked at the lighter nothing happened several more flicks raised nothing more than sparks merrily took her shoulder bag to the kitchen table and felt inside for matches something rolled heavily across the table and fell to the floor the room was sinking into the dregs of the day she put on lights and finally found a book of matches with the logo of the black swan hotel its timberpillared porch stood across the cobbled village square from the vicarage under a welcoming lantern and she briefly thought how pleasant it would be to wander across there in the dusk and sit in the new beer garden at the back with a glass of white wine she sat down at the kitchen table lit her cigarette and saw through the smoke an image of jane at the front gate yesterday morning merrily bit her lip leaned back out of the smoke and finally bent and picked up the misshapen penny dated it must have rolled from her bag though she didnt remember putting it in there it just kept turning up like a bad penny if you dont like the cold come out of the mortuary huw owen had said mercilessly merrily sat for a while with ethel the black cat winding around her ankles and smoked another cigarette before she left the vicarage it was that luminous period well beyond sunset when the northern sky had kindled its own cool light show above the timbered eaves of ledwardine and the wooded hills beyond the village lights were subdued between mullions behind diamond panes wearing her light cotton alb anklelength tied loosely at the waist with white cord merrily crossed the cobbles and slipped quietly through the lychgate the church looked monolithic rising out of a black tangle of gravestones and apple trees into a sky streaked with salmon and green in a summer concession to trickletourism the oak door was still unlocked but she assumed shed be alone in here since evensong had been discontinued sunday night was the quietest time she didnt put on the church lights finding her way up the central aisle by the muddy lustre left by dulled stained glass on shiny pewends and sandstone pillars it was cool in the nave but not cold in the chancel behind the screen of oaken apples she took out her book of matches and lit two candles on the altar creating woolly whitegold globes which brought the sandstone softly to life she placed the old penny on the altar blessing it again as i use it in faith forgive my sins it was she realized now not a game of chance but a simple act of faith of trust most priests in times of crisis would open the bible at random trusting that meaningful lines would leap out telling them which way to jump how different was that to one of janes new age gurus cutting the tarot pack the difference was christian faith there was a huge difference wasnt there the candles had hollowed out for her a sanctum of light with the nave falling away into greyness along with the organ pipes and the bull chapel with its seventeenthcentury tomb the atmosphere was calm and absorbent the churchs recharging time just beginning as jane would point out smugly this was a site of worship longpredating christianity youre employing some ancient energy there mum predating jesus christ perhaps shed reply swiftly but not predating god gods jane grinning like an elf and goddesses merrily let the kids image fade like the cheshire cat into the flickering air with its compatible scents of polish and hot beeswax she knelt before the altar her covered knees at the edge of the carpet just within the globes of light ok she closed her eyes and whispered the lords prayer and then knelt in silence for several minutes feeling the soft light around her like an aura she remembered as always those deep and silent moments in the little celtic chapel where her spiritual journey had begun the moments of the blue and the gold and the lamplit path her breathing slowed she felt warm with anticipation and dismissed the sensation immediately then she summoned amy shelbone more minutes passed before she was able to visualize the child amy wearing her school uniform clean and crisp tie straight hair brushed complexion almost translucently white and clear amy kneeling at the altar as shed been on the sunday she was sick i dont know anything about her merrily confessed to god i dont know what her problem is i dont know if shes in need of spiritual help or psychological help or just love i dont know i want to help her but i dont want to interfere if thats going to harm her her lips unmoving the words forming in her heart her heart chakra jane would insist the bodys main emotional conduit without irritation she sent jane away again and put amy at the periphery of her consciousness at the entrance to her candlelit sanctuary she knelt for some more minutes losing all sense of herself opening her heart to shed long ago given up trying to visualize god there was no he or she this was a presence higher than gender race or religion transcending identity all she would ever hope to do was follow the lamplit path into a place within and yet beyond her own heart and stay there and wait patient and passive and without forced piety when if the time came she would ask if amy might join them in the sanctuary amy and justine three questions hovered three possibilities is the problem psychological or demonic or connected with the unquiet spirit of a dead person merrily let the questions rise like vapour and prayed calmly for an answer more minutes passed she was only dimly aware of where she was and yet there was a fluid feeling of focus and at the same time a separation a sublime sense of the diminution of herself the aching purity and beauty of submission to something ineffably higher at one stage although somehow she didnt remember any of this until it was over shed felt an intrusion a discomfort and for a long moment there was no candlelight and the chancel was as dark darker than the rest of the church and bitterly cold and heavy with hurt incomprehension bitterness and finally an allencompassing sorrow she didnt move the moment was gone and so it seemed was amy shelbone and merrilys cheeks were wet with tears and she was aware of a fourth question what shall i do please what shall i do she tossed the heavy old coin and it fell with an emphatic thump to the carpet in the chancel she had to bring one of the candlesticks from the altar to see which side up it was but it didnt matter she knew anyway this was only proof only confirmation she held the candle close to the coin the candle was so much shorter now the candlestick bubbled with hot wax tails nothing demonic she tossed again tails no possession by an unquiet spirit she nodded held the coin tightly in her right hand snuffed out the candles bowed her head to the altar and walked down the aisle and out of the church in the porch it was chilly the goosebumps came up on her arms in the churchyard it was raining finely out of a grey sky that was light though moonless clouds rose like steam above the orchard beyond the graves it had been a warm summer evening when she went in and now now a figure appeared from around the side of the porch carrying an axe one girl in particular the dew on the tombstone was soaking through the cotton alb to her thighs she had her arms wrapped around herself one hand still clutching her coin and she was shivering disoriented she looked up following the steeple to the starless sky puzzled because it was so bright up there yet she couldnt see a moon oughter get home vicar gomer parry said dont bugger about nmore he was leaning on his spade it was an ordinary garden spade not an axe but could be nearly as deadly she imagined in the hands of the wiry little warrior in the flat cap and the bomber jacket so glad it was gomer merrily tried to smile but her lips took a while to respond she felt insubstantial weightless as a butterfly and just as transient she gripped the rounded rim of the tombstone needing gravity wanner get some hot tea down you girl gomers fingers were rolling a ciggy on the thandle of the spade now in semiretirement from his longtime business of digging field drains and cesspits gomer saw to the graveyard where his minnie lay and kept the church orchard pruned and tidy also without making much of a thing out of it he reckoned it was part of his function to look out for the vicar this vicar anyway been through some situations together she and gomer but still she couldnt tell him why shed been in the church tonight or what had happened in there the colour of the sky alarmed her it was streaked with orange cream laying a strange glare on gomers bottle glasses merrily pushed her fingers through her hair it felt matted with dried sweat time time is it gomer time he looked up at the sky behind the steeple all but five now sure tbe five in the morning her knees felt numb strips of of sun were alight between layers of cloud like venetian blinds over the hills gomer struck a match on a headstone that mrs griffiths it was phoned me her dont sleep much nmore since her ol man snuffed it reckoned there was some bugger in the church ennit bit of a glow up the east window see vicar whats wrong it cant be merrily was shaking her head frenziedly her face felt stiff it cant be ive only beengomer i she clutched his arm i went in there maybe an hour ago an hour and a half at the most it was about ten oclock tenthirty and then the earth turned the molten copper of the dawn sent terrifying pulses into merrilys head gomer patted her hand young jane hers gone away then huh first time you been alone yere i reckon vicar it was tenthirty she said faintly i swear to god tenthirty at the latest she remembered then how far the candles had burned down it couldnt be six hours those few minutes had become hours her hands were trembling the penny dropped out of one and fell onto the tombstone where shed been sitting she recalled a blurred britannia on the coin tails gomer lit his ciggy needs a bit of a holiday yourself you ask me vicar pack a case bugger off somewhere nobody knows you or what you do dont say no prayers for nobody for a week i wouldnt she bent to pick up the coin im sorry im really sorry for dragging you out gomer i really maybe i fell asleep or something sure tbe gomer parry stood there nodding sagely patient as a donkey she met his eyes both of them knew she didnt believe shed been asleep in the church not for one minute of those six hours she invited gomer back to the vicarage but he wouldnt come with her strikes me you dont need no chat vicar he said perceptively sides which me and nev got a pond to dig out over at almeley get an early start makes us look efficient ennit she walked back to the vicarage lucidly aware of every step the warming of the air the shapes of the cobbles on the square the tension of the ancient black timbers holding ledwardine together back in the kitchen she looked around the painted walls as if walking into the room for the first time yes shed been away for a while a night had passed she put the kettle on and some food out for ethel the little black cat didnt start to eat for quite a while just sat on the kitchen flags and stared at her oliveeyed while she drank her tea i look different or something puss ethel didnt blink merrily went upstairs and had a shower hot enough to hurt she was aching but she wasnt tired she still felt light and unsteady slightly drunk but also strengthened aware of a core of something flat and firm and quiet in her abdomen afterwards she stood at the landing window wrapped in a bath towel like someone out of a badedas ad and watched the morning sun shining like a new penny lifted up or cracking up state of grace or a state of crisis if shed been seriously stressedout last night she could have understood what had happened the collapse into the arms of god the acceleration of time the flooding of the senses like being abducted by aliens she started to laugh and went to get dressed it wasnt about stress it was about the decision to toss a coin she put on the grey tshirt and the dog collar and an offwhite skirt it was monday usually a quiet day in the parish meetings with the bishop in hereford were on tuesdays with the decision to toss the coin shed broken through something probably her own resistance she went quickly down the stairs and into the kitchen its walls crosshatched now with summermorning light the kitchen clock said nearly eight time still seemed to be moving faster than usual she needed to ground herself she needed another tombstone to sit on she went on into the scullery and sat behind the desk of scuffed and scratched mahogany she didnt plan to wait too long before she phoned the shelbones shed ring just once and if there was no answer shed drive over there knowing that this time she would get some straight answers shed make the call at she went back into the kitchen to make some breakfast then decided she wasnt hungry and cleaned the sink instead scrubbing feverishly she had energy to spare dont question it dont question anything about this just after as she was drying her hands the phone summoned her back into the scullery merrily sophie said quietly can you come in please as early as possible not a question problem yes sophie said im afraid there is merrily lit her first cigarette of the new day it was the usual battle getting into hereford with the hundreds of drivers who just wanted to get through hereford and the inevitable roadworks not half a mile from the belmont roundabout southern gateway to the city lorries were feeding precast concrete into what used to be green belt and would when completed apparently be known as the barnchurch trading estate merrily found herself winding up the car window in response to a sudden sensation of the air itself being polluted by human greed like poison gas dont lets get carried away vicar the traffic started to move again and this time she made it all the way to greyfriars bridge without a holdup hereford cathedral sat at the bottom of broad street snug rather than soaring behind it the medieval bishops palace was concealed by an eighteenthcentury and victorian facade that made it look like a redbrick secondary school with regency and romanesque pretensions this was administration it brought you down to earth the morning had dulled rapidly and a fine rain was falling as merrily parked the old volvo next to the bishops firewood pile close to the stone and timbered gatehouse the quaintest corner of the complex the view under its arch was back into broad street you went through a door in the side of the arch and up some narrow stone steps and came out at the deliverance office with the bishops secretarys room next door from where merrily could hear people talking two male voices she didnt know what this was about hadnt liked to ask on the phone because it had been clear that sophie was not alone now sophie appeared in her doorway she wore a silky dark green sleeveless dress and pearls always pearls and also this morning a matching pale smile she slipped out of the room to let merrily go in ah said the bishop the other man elderly with grey and white hair didnt say anything and merrily didnt recognize him at first well have tea later sophie bernie dunmore called out and then lowered his voice we shall probably need it come in merrily take a seat you know dennis dont you oh god it was too since shed last seen him canon beckett had shed some weight and his beard he looked crumpled and unhappy dennis merrily went to sit in sophies chair by the window overlooking the cathedral green and the traffic on broad street i ah imagine you can guess was this is about the bishop said he sat across the desk in the swivel chair he used for dictating letters to sophie his episcopal purple shirt stretched uncomfortably tight over his stomach the bishop was looking generally uneasy canon beckett just looked gloomy sitting on a straight chair a few feet away with his back to the wall denniss presence offers a clue merrily said merrily did you go to see this girl amy shelbone on saturday evening when her parents were out well i merrily glanced across at dennis who was inspecting his hands i went over with the intention of talking to her parents actually they were as you say out but i met amy in the garden i tried to talk to her about obviously you know what about bishop i mean dennis has presumably filled you in on the background the child behaved in a disturbed fashion during the eucharist as well as exhibiting symptoms of what appeared to be clairvoyance plus personality changes enough to convince her parents she was being ah visited by an outside influence you however seem unconvinced merrily nodded she did seem to have turned away from god but it seemed to me more like disillusion or if there was an influence then it was an earthly influence you didnt offer the parents any suggestions as to how she might have become susceptible to whatever was influencing her i wondered about a teacher or a boyfriend boyfriend but her mother insisted she didnt have a boyfriend quite immature for her age canon beckett mumbled the girl went to church with her parents yesterday said the bishop did you know that merrily raised an eyebrow no not to holy communion this time to the morning service she was all right then dennis the bishop swivelled his chair towards the canon she was fine as far as i could see dennis said i kept a close eye on her obviously she was a little quiet sang the hymns somewhat halfheartedly it seems she and her parents had had a long talk the previous night after mrs watkinss visit the bishop swivelled back to face merrily across the desk the child admitted to her parents that shed been caught up in certain activities involving other pupils from her school one girl in particular activities merrily tilted her head you dont know about this am i supposed to was she being naive spiritualism the bishop said the ouija board making contact with the spirits amy seems unlikely to you it would have at first she really didnt seem the sort far too prissy but then prissy inhibited straitlaced unimaginative if you like but then on saturday night she said fairly contemptuously that she didnt see any point in trying to talk to god but if she did want to talk she could talk to someone called justine her mother dennis beckett said what her real mother she was adopted by these people her real mother was called justine merrily closed her eyes bit her lower lip the apparent opportunity to talk to ones dead mother said the bishop would i suppose be sufficient bait to lure even a prissy child into spiritually dangerous terrain merrily had come down with a bump that was almost audible to her ive been stupid she felt herself sag in sophies chair have you the bishop said i should have made the connection why asked the bishop a lilt in his voice why she felt like crying driving into hereford shed still felt high swollen with what faith certainty arrogance shed cast aside her scepticism opened her heart broken through six hours passing like minutes tails the coin kept coming up tails shed been given her answer and it wasnt the answer it wasnt any kind of answer the inspiring and apparently mystical circumstances had obscured the fact that little had been revealed to her it might even have been misleading where did this happen these ouija board sessions you dont know you dont have to rub it in bernie i dont know the kid wouldnt talk to me the rain was coming harder rivulets on the window blurring broad street into an impressionist painting she felt a pricking of tears and looked down into her lap i really dont think you do know do you the bishops voice had softened she shook her head or the identity of the girl who led amy into these spiritualist games she looked up into his fat kindly face his eyes were full of pity the room tilted what are you saying bishop she turned on dennis beckett what are you saying bernie dunmore shuffled uncomfortably your daughter jane goes to the same school doesnt she yes she it was as if her mouth were full of cardboard no after the service merrily mr and mrs shelbone invited dennis back to their house where amy admitted to dennis that shed been lured into what had become quite a craze at moorfield high school for attempting to make contact with the dead she saidyoud better relay the rest of it dennis i dont want to get anything wrong dennis beckett cleared his throat he didnt look directly at merrily amy told her parents in my presence that a jane watkins had approached her one day in the playground and told her that a group of them had been receiving messages from a certain spirit who kept asking for a girl called amy amy gave this this jane short shrift until the girl told her the woman had identified herself as amys mother from whom amy had been parted as an infant amy of course had always known that she was adopted and she was then persuaded to attend one of these ah sessions was she said the bishop which it seems proved somewhat convincing and immensely traumatic apparently the child claims she was able to communicate with the spirit of her mother who gave her some very frightening information mr and mrs shelbone however declined to tell me what this information was dennis leaned back as if exhausted his head against the wall for which to be quite honest i was grateful suffice to say that amy asked the shelbones certain questions about her birthmother and then proceeded to give them information about things which they did know but had never revealed to the child beginning with the significant disclosure of the mothers name justine merrily whispered oh god they were so shocked to hear her saying these things that amy could tell at once from their reactions that she must be in possession of the truth all of which was quite enough to reduce both the girl and the parents to a state of absolute dread the spirit of a dead person the bishop said did she tell them then dennis about the ouija board sessions because no she didnt this initial exchange took place immediately following amys upset during the eucharist when they got home there was an attempt at a family discussion which ended rather abruptly when amy realized that her adoptive parents had concealed this whatever it was disturbing information from her she became resentful and spiteful she told them she was in contact with her real mother but she didnt explain how this had come about she was i would guess behaving in a rather sly way playing her parents off against her natural mother pretty unnatural mother if you ask me bernie dunmore spluttered so this presumably is what led to the adoptive mothers request for an exorcism hazel shelbone didnt tell me about any of this merrily said tonelessly and as for janes it was only after mrs watkinss latest visit that amy explained somewhat reluctantly about the ouija board dennis beckett said which i would imagine carries less kudos than direct personal contact with ones late mother do we know when the mother died bernie asked no not in childbirth then i dont know im sorry are they still asking for this exorcism i was able to pray with the child dennis said merrily felt the bishops glare this time more than you were able to do i think it was sufficient dennis said but im prepared to go back look merrily fumbled for words i i accept that i probably mishandled this from the beginning and maybe i shouldnt even have attempted to talk to amy when her parents werent there but i cant accept that janes in any way involved in this merrily the bishop said quite gently i think im correct in saying that it wouldnt be the first time janes exhibited curiosity about things that she would not do this there was silence the two men looking anywhere but at merrily the door was open sophie presumably in the deliverance office next door would have heard everything shes my daughter merrily said i would know bernie dunmore pulled out a tissue blotted something on his beach ball of a forehead youd better tell us the rest dennis amy dennis beckett half turned to face the bishop im afraid that amy maintains that mrs watkins was fully fully aware of her daughters involvement merrily shut her eyes shaking her head and when mrs watkins came to see amy on saturday evening when her parents were out she warned the child very forcibly what when her eyes reopened dennis beckett was finally staring directly at her perhaps to show how much he wasnt enjoying this that shed better keep quiet about jane watkins merrily sprang up thats a complete and total if she knew what was good for her dennis said its a lie merrily said bernie dunmore breathed heavily down his nose sit down merrily he said please part two when i am involved in the work of deliverance i admit my own ignorance martin israel exorcism the removal of evil influences everybody lies the lady of the bines in person the rev simon st john was slumped like a tired choirboy on a hard chair hed pulled into the centre of the studio floor his cello case open beside him scary he hauled the cello out of its case it was every bit as dented and scratched as a muchtoured guitar simon drove the bow over the cello strings and the sound went up lols spine like a wire it was scary at the time hed decided he had to tell somebody it wasnt so long ago that a vicar would have been the very last person hed have opened up to but there were aspects of simon st john that made him more or maybe less than what you thought of as a normal clergyman lol had spent the night as usual alone in the stables prof had said he should move over into the cottage but he felt more comfortable in the loft room above the studio all last evening hed been somehow expecting stock to turn up with an explanation of the newspaper story but stock hadnt shown and then this morning when the footsteps sounded in the yard it had been simon st john in jeans and trainers carrying his cello case looking like a refined version of tom petty prof had mentioned that simon would often drop in on a monday to unwind after an entire day of being polite and cheerful to his parishioners before moving to knights frome hed been in some bleak sheepfarming parish in the black mountains which thrived on threats and feuds and general hatred and where the vicar was expected to be hardnosed and cynical but am i right you didnt know the story of the lady of the bines at the time you saw this woman simon said lol sat a few feet away on the hardwood top of an old guild acoustic amp hed picked up in hereford last year no that is quite spooky simons bow skittered eerily across the strings he winced and naked hmm and bleeding from superficial cuts like shed just run through some spiny bushes or brambles or its how ghost stories are born simon said give me your chord sequence again b minor f sharp then down to e minor for the intro to the verse this was the river frome song for which there were still some lyrics to write and you made a careful exit simon said wise i was thinking drugs i was thinking witchcraft i was wondering should i call the police in case shes been you know but she was smiling she seemed relaxed have you ever met stephanie stock simon pushed the bow over the strings of the cello in a raw minor key recoiled ouch im just so bloody atrocious these days no when he comes to church and hes actually been a time or two recently the cunning bugger he comes on his own shes a mouse they say quiet goes off to work in hereford in her little nissan making the best of the dismal place presumably when she gets home because she never goes to the pub with him so what do you reckon dunno is the short answer i dont know what you saw why dont you ring her one night while hes out why were you naked in the old hopyard mrs stock simon lifted his bow no wouldnt be such a good idea anyway it doesnt change my view of the situation hes a lying git i need an exorcism si soon as you can jesus that was what he was asking for when he came here and you said no damn right an anglican exorcism sanctioned by the bishop of hereford would put god and the church of england firmly on stocks side comes to a civil court case i get called as a witness stuff that but why would he then go to the papers why would he expose himself to public ridicule you think that bothers him hes a pr man he knows how transient it all is news today chippaper tomorrow except in knights frome here it might send a slow ripple up the river still whats he got to lose lol persisted ok prof suggests stocks making up the haunting bit to put pressure on adam lake to dismantle his big barns and stick them somewhere else but that still doesnt quite add up getting rid of the barns might put a few thousand on the value of the place but when you think how many peopled want to live in a house well known as a murder site and now even better known at the end of the day lakes going to be the only person really interested in buying it all right simon leaned forward letting his arms droop over the body of his cello ill tell you what i think why i think stock wouldnt talk to lakes lawyer when the first approach was made i think in normal circumstances hed sell that place tomorrow hes a townie an archtownie he hates it here but i dont think he can sell not to lake not to anybody what did stock say to you about the reason stewart ash left them his house he said ash didnt bequeath his house to gerard stock he bequeathed stock to adam lake he wanted to be sure there was someone in that house who wasnt going to do lake any favours yeah but stock doesnt do anyone any favours especially not someone whos both dead and stupid enough to leave him a house but it was his wifes inheritance his wife does what shes told shes a mouse what other kind of woman would stock marry what im trying to suggest to you is that stewart ash would never leave his house in the hands of someone like stock to make sure it didnt fall into lakes hands if he hadnt already taken steps to make sure stock couldnt sell it anyway you mean some kind of i dont know the legal term restrictive covenant stock wants us to think he doesnt want to sell the kiln when in fact he cant id put money on it it makes sense lol admitted its the only explanation that does hes buying time until he can find some way legal or otherwise around it maybe the place is going to mysteriously catch fire one night maybe one of the extra candles he needs to combat the awful darkness topples over oh there are lots of things he could do and still emerge looking clean and innocent he doesnt care lol long as he stays out of jail look he wants ostensibly to get back at lake for what he did to the house and to stewart ash he also wants perversely it might seem but not when you get to know him to get back at ash for saddling him with a saleable country property that he cant sell which means hes almost certainly looking at a way of turning the situation into money maybe even now selling the story a book a tv documentary something simon stood up leaned his cello against the chair seat lol stood up too what if youre wrong what if he really has got problems in that place why are you so bothered lol shrugged anything to do with your forlorn and possibly unrequited love for the reverend watkins lol sighed good old prof yeah yeah he called in at the vicarage before he left for london and then lo she rang me herself apologetic in case shed said something to the press that might have offended me lol went still merrily i truly hope your friend has the sense not to get involved you dont have any influence there i suppose im a songwriter simon i write songs and dont you go making any silly connections between some dopedup woman and the lady of the bines am i allowed to write a song about it simon made a thoughtful sibilant sound through his teeth all right he said im going to tell you the truth about the lady of the bines ok lol sat down again according to the legend simon said if you see her your hops will start to wither before the seasons out right uh huh once the wilt hits somebodys yards the old codgers in the pub will start muttering about the lady youll have seen the signs keep out danger of infection most big yards have them the wilts voracious and it can be carried by people just walking in and out of a field most people observe the restrictions kids though are another matter always been a problem keeping kids out and i guess thats why they made up the story made it up who made it up they did i dont know who but its bollocks lol simon threw out his arms you could almost see the bat wings of a surplice the story was made up to scare kids away from the hopyards the history of hops in herefordshire doesnt go back as far as the days of knights and ladies sally boswell was spinning me a line maybe she made it up shes a clever lady shes been around long enough simon had picked up his bow and was tapping it against his leg like a riding crop this is the country lol in the country in certain situations everybody lies question of diplomacy although she worked for the bishop and the church of england in essence sophie hill served the cathedral if you confided in her only god and those medieval stones would ever know she was not exactly a motherfigure just that little bit too austere and certainly not an older sister agony aunt would probably get closer merrily wondered how many perplexed priests in a crisis of faith or facing divorce or the prospect of being outed as gay had over the years consulted sophie before or instead of bishops and deans and archdeacons except i should have done something merrily insisted from the start huw owen always used to stress that regardless of our own opinions we should never leave the premises without merrily seriously how could you sophie handed her tea in a white china cup if the girl herself wouldnt have anything to do with you and if the mother felt unable to take you completely into her confidence she took bloody dennis into her confidence only because the girl had accused you of threatening her transparent nonsense which in my view throws immediate doubt on her casting of jane as the instigator merrily paused with the cup at her lips you dont see jane involved in this there was a time not too long ago sophie conceded when there was very little of which i would have acquitted jane without a number of serious questions but no theres an element of malevolence here not that i think she was ever malevolent but with younger children mischief and maliciousness can be horribly interwoven and i rather think shes grown beyond that stage well thank you all the same you do need to speak to her without delay where is she now on holiday with her boyfriendswith eirions family in pembrokeshire can you contact her on the phone if i cant merrily said ill be driving down there tonight dont overreact sophie ive just been accused of menacing a juvenile accused by the juvenile i wasnt aware of dennis beckett immediately springing to my defence no but then canon beckett was hardly vociferous in support of the ordination of women i didnt know that ill make you a list sometime sophie pushed the phone across the desk to her merrily gwennan squealed how marvellous it is to hear from you again theyd spoken twice on the phone but never actually met she hadnt met eirions father either the cardiffbased business consultant fixer member of many quangos and chairman of the broadcasting council for wales gwennan was his second wife erm i just wanted a very quick word with jane please merrily said something she might have forgotten to tell me before she left oh dear said gwennan youve just missed her shes just this minute taken the children to the beach what time will she be back oh heavens i dont know really the problem is merrily that dafydd and i have a lunch appointment in haverfordwest so we wont be seeing eirion and jane until tonight theyve taken the children out for the day isnt she marvellous with children merrily blinked she is what ill do ill leave a note in case they come back earlier though knowing jane shell have too much planned for them all but shell definitely call you tonight ill make sure of it if you would its nothing vital just something i need to check shes actually looking after the children then young children eight and eleven gwennan said shes wonderful with them you dont have any other children of your own do you i expect thats what it is merrily put down the phone to the sound of heavy footsteps and puffing on the stairs the bishop returning after seeing dennis beckett to his car he came in and closed the door ive told him to keep this to himself naturally dont feel you have to protect me merrily said bitterly if it turns out to be remotely true about jane ill be out of here before you can say deuteronomy merrily the very last the bishop glanced around to make sure the door was firmly shut then sat down opposite her at sophies desk the very last thing i want is to lose you from deliverance because of something bernie if this is true ill have to leave the parish the diocese everything probably thats ridiculous ive told her she has to speak to jane sophie placed a cup and saucer in front of the bishop poured his tea it looks like itll be tonight before i get through to her merrily told him ill also need to speak to the shelbones of course but not until after i speak to jane no the bishop dislodged his cup splashing hot tea on his cuff out of the question you stay well away from that family dennis has prayed with the girl and thats enough for the present as far as im concerned you cant say that now its out in the open im going to have to find out about this ouijaboard stuff if thats not part of the deliverance agenda what is what this whole business is my girl is a pretty firm pointer to why we need a deliverance support group without delay jobs like this its like the damned police you need to go out in pairs to give yourself a witness have you even provided me with a list of possibles yet well at least ive eliminated dennis she took out her cigarettes would you mind sophie frowned but bernie dunmore waved a hand go ahead if itll make you think clearer suppose i have a word with the headmaster at moorfield do you know the headmaster bernie jane goes there he coughed yes whats his name robert morrell i dont think ive met him yet you probably wont merrily lit a cigarette hes an atheist arent they all but sure go and see him by all means go and see him in your capacity as a concerned parent if he isnt already in the algarve or somewhere thanks ill call him for you sophie said in a moment sophie merrily theres something else we need to look at on the other side of the county as it happens sophie could you get that email youll be glad to know merrily that youre not the only minister in this diocese facing ah flak i know merrily took one more puff on the cigarette and then stubbed it out in the empty powder compact she used as a portable ashtray that was all i needed thanks this would be the vicar of knights frome youve read the sunday paper then i was quoted in it bernie yes of course you were he wiped a hand across his forehead i think i need a holiday and sunday wouldnt be sunday at ledwardine vicarage without the people and the news of the world anyway i thought i ought to ring him he certainly didnt seem overworried and he didnt ask for any help ive also spoken to the guy who well lets just say a journalist the inference is that the story was engineered by mr stock for reasons of his own so my feeling is that simon st john probably knew exactly what he was doing when he said no bernie dunmores dog collar disappeared under his chins just as you did when you said no to mrs shelbone on that first occasion merrily was silent when the bishop had gone she stood up to let sophie repossess her desk he obviously just wants to keep me well away from dilwyn oh more than that i think sophie scoured her blotter for traces of ash if it was anyone other than the reverend st john he might have let it go but i dont think any of us are entirely sure about mr st john tell me merrily sat in the chair vacated by the bishop and its not simply that he used to be in some sort of rockandroll group in the eighties if thats what you were thinking i wasnt aware of that would it be a band ive heard of you probably would but i dont even recall the name nor is it the fact that st john isnt known for his diplomacy or the delicacy of his language sophies eyes narrowed under her compact coiffure even more profane than you merrily by all accounts a quentin tarantino priest certainly a troubled priest or was i believe hes come very close to leaving the church more than once he seems to have what you might call an attitude problem came to us from gwent newly married his wifes quite seriously disabled the vicarage at knights frome had to be considerably modified before they could move in how does that affect his ministry not at all except by eliciting sympathy from the parishioners not that mrs st john appears to welcome sympathy i think in the end it probably does mainly come back to that question of diplomacy he tends to be volatile and arbitrary for instance and this is the instance the bishops no doubt recalling he once refused to marry a member of a very wellestablished local farming family someone with family graves in the churchyard going back at least two centuries because he said it was a marriage of convenience and the couple clearly didnt love one another he told them to eff off to a registry office merrily rolled her eyes the times ive wanted to say that but you didnt did you only because a i didnt have the bottle and b uncle ted the churchwarden wouldve had me on toast come to think of it that comes down to bottle too doesnt it its simply a matter of tempering ones responses sophie said the reverend st john tends to form personal opinions about people and act on them which is why the bishop feels it might be advisable in this instance to have a second opinion theres also this message probably the first serious response to your deliverance website sophie laid in front of her an email printout rev watkins i am grateful that you were less quick to dismiss my appeal for spiritual assistance than was my local minister i am assuming you were not misquoted in saying that if you were aware of someone in genuine need of spiritual support you would wish to see they received whatever help you were able to give them may i therefore appeal to you as a christian to at least investigate the situation here before my wife and i are driven to the edge of sanity may i stress that this is not a windup yours very sincerely gerard stock note where it indicates copies sophie said merrily read copies bishop of hereford c of e press office the people bbc midlands today bbc radio hereford and worcester that explains everything so its on tv tonight is it they havent approached us yet but i suppose they will what do you want me to say better say well be talking to mr stock what choice have we got you want me to reply to him too ill do that i dont envy you any of this sophie began to put the cups and saucers back on a tray your biggest problems always going to be sorting out whats genuine from whats complete bollocks merrily said unsmiling one can only hope you dont get on too well with the reverend st john sophie started to carry the tray to the sink in the corner opposite the door and then she put the tray down again if you dont mind me saying you seem different i do this is none of my business but has something happened in your personal life i dont have much of a personal life sophie merrily looked out of the window over broad street the rain had stopped but the sky was still mainly overcast layer upon layer of cloud fading to amber rather than blue actually something odd did happen but you wouldnt thank me for pouring it out right now sophie nodded and picked up the tray whenever you want to talk im here thanks really she picked up the email went into the deliverance office and switched on the computer to reply to mr stock whose copies list alone revealed his media knowhow was it still conceivable this man could have a genuine psychic problem she wondered if simon st john had tossed a coin thankless the headmaster said it had to be considered heartening to hear of any fourteenyearold girl who was communicating at all with a parent even if the parent was dead well there we are merrily smiled warmly everyone was saying what a complete unbeliever and a rationalist you were but i had faith i just knew youd take it seriously the staffroom had been updated to resemble a kind of scaleddown airport lounge with fitted recliner seats around the walls there were two computers a tv set and a video maybe the teachers played stressmanagement tapes in their lunch hour robert morrell looked healthclub fit in his polo shirt and sweatpants hed reacted to hair loss by shaving what was left to within a millimetre of his skull put it this way there was a faint smile on his face but she could tell he was annoyed by her attitude id rate it considerably lower down the scale of antisocial behaviour than marketing drugs in the cloakrooms morrell was going on holiday with his family tomorrow which was why the meeting had been arranged for this afternoon before merrily wouldve had a chance to talk to jane it was clear he would also rather have put it off probably until next term when it all might have blown over but sophie had enviable ways of dealing with authority figures however he said to forestall any accusations of being antichristian i took the liberty of inviting our chairman of governors to sit in a regular churchgoer mrs watkins he inclined his head to her patronizing bastard and as it happens a golfing companion of your bishops listen she must have looked pained like everybody else he was covering his back im not here to make a big deal out of it mr morrell im just trying to find out whats happening whos involved and if any other kids have been damaged by it damaged a corner of his mouth twisted up not quite a sneer damaged how physically emotionally psychologically she shrugged reluctant to use a word he would sneer at jane despised him for teaching maths playing electronic krautrock in his car and joining the older boys for rugby training his way the kid reckoned of getting around the ban on corporal punishment thoughts of jane made merrily tense maybe shed still been high from the timelapse experience or lack of sleep but so far shed managed not to think too hard about the kids possible involvement now in this deserted school with its hostile head teacher she felt insecure and it seemed altogether less unlikely that jane had been into some psychic scam and do you accept the idea of communication with the dead morrell asked as heavy footsteps echoed in the corridor outside like the dead themselves walking in on cue merrily jumped but morrell looked relieved were in here charlie rob so sorry im the chairman of governors came into the room like someone used to having people wait for him oh a leathery face registered unexpected pleasure i was expecting old dennis whatshisname this is mrs watkins charlie shes i know who she is shes the reason bernie dunmore spends so much time in hereford these days instead of walking off some of that weight on the golf course his right hand flashed charlie howe hullo merrily was letting him squeeze her fingers when she suddenly realized who he was i think i may have encountered your daughter yes indeed he beamed were all very proud of anne his local accent was as mellow as old cider he wore a light suit and a broad loose tie he was in his sixties had wide shoulders and strong stiff white hair in what in his young days would have been called a crewcut charlie howe onetime head of hereford cid father of its current chief dci annie howe the steel angel icy blonde with a serious humour deficiency merrily searched for family resemblance could find none at all shes done well mr howe youngest head of cid weve ever had shell have outranked her old man before shes finished cant hold you girls down these days charlie howe took a step back to have a proper look at merrily my lord when i think of your predecessor old tommy dobbs what awell god rest his poor old soul but what a bloody improvement and she had to smile not least because this was the kind of sexist remark guaranteed to turn annie howe white morrell said mrs watkins believes theres reason to suspect the schools become infested with the powers of darkness charlie merrily sighed they sat at a circular table from which morrell had discreetly removed a pack of playing cards you must know he said that even as the chief executive of this establishment there isnt much i can do without knowing the name of either the victim or the instigator merrily hadnt felt empowered to name amy had revealed only that it involved a girl with a dead mother she didnt think morrell would be able to narrow it down especially with no staff to consult look she said you asked how the child had been damaged what you had here was a wellbehaved considerate hardworking honest and possibly slightly dull kid whos turned into someone who is secretive remote resentful and seems to have rejected god while embracing what some people like to call the spirit world in effect it seems the dead mothers become her private support mechanism to the exclusion of anyone else the way children sometimes find an imaginary friend morrell said smoothly to fill a gap in their lonely lives merrily shook her head not really charlie howe leaned back on an elbow can you believe this young girl might actually be in contact with her mother merrily i could believe it but i think its more likely to be a contact with something else like what morrells chair jerked back with a squeak that amplified his outrage poor rob said charlie howe this ent your world at all is it merrily said when a group of people get together in a circle like we are now with a particular objective in mind then perhaps that focus of group consciousness could result in well it could be like a radio picking up signals or maybe like a computer network and one of the group goes home with a virus attached thats based on science is it said robert morrell merrily shrugged im just telling you it can have harmful effects youre talking about possession said charlie howe merrily wrinkled her nose its not my favourite word morrell said mrs watkins when i was teaching in bristol i used to pass every day on my way to work a former warehouse that sported a large sign proclaiming it to be a spiritualist church a church like your own but less grand and presumably some of the members of this church had children or grandchildren attending local schools where the teaching staff were obliged to respect all the various forms of religion whether islam or sikhism or hinduism or voodoo for all i know were not talking about religion mr morrell were talking about a bunch of kids hunched up in a cloakroom with an upturned glass and a set of scrabble letters and frankly as ive made clear mrs watkins id have to find something like that a good deal less disturbing than if they were trading their pocket money for pills and then when the pocket money ran out clobbering some elderly lady for her pension whoa charlie howe put up his hands lets get this into proportion shall we folks i was a copper for nigh on forty years sure i know what drugs can do and i know what some kidsll do to keep supplied but i also know rob what what religion can do well not religion so much as well i dont know what youd call it but i think i know what merrilys warning us about and in my experience it can sometimes lead to offences a sight worse than mugging morrells lips clamped shut he looked affronted for instance charlie howe said some years back i was on the fringe of a very big murder hunt one that im sure we all know about where the murderer when he was finally nicked insisted hed been told by voices to kill a particular kind of woman charlie thats give me an hour or two and i could find you a dozen or more other cases in the past ten years where killings serious assaults and god knows what else with someone acting entirely out of character have been put down to but charlie this is this is a juvenile certainly but arent youngsters more prone to this kind of thing than adults because their imaginations are that much bigger im going to use the word delusion merrily for roberts sake and anyway we all know that a delusion can be just as real to the person involved now if this childs become antisocial and starts taking advice from what she reckons is her dead mother then who knows what her socalled mothers going to advise her to do next no id be the last to dismiss this kind of problem out of hand merrily felt like filling the silence with applause morrell spread his hands on the table looked down between them for a moment all right he said but what do you suggest we do about it now the summer holidays have just started the students are no longer under my jurisdiction chances are that by september therell be some new fad the truth of it is merrily said apologetically this was supposed to be an informal inquiry nothing formal about me my dear said charlie howe i was hoping somebody might have some idea about what was going on like if there were certain kids known to be particularly fascinated by the occult maybe encouraging or even pressurizing other kids into getting involved teachers usually have their noses to the ground tell me said morrell have you asked your daughter about this shes away on holiday you see im afraid i really cant help you i dont know anything about any ouijaboard sessions they could very well be happening outside school hours outside the campus if you want to give me this girls name we can probably arrange some counselling for her next term or said charlie howe why dont you ask merrily to come and give a talk to the sixthformers we still have religious education dont we social and cultural studies id have to discuss it with my team merrily pushed back her chair well thanks for listening to me although i suspect ive wasted your time absolutely not charlie howe placed a hand over hers emphatically not anything thats affecting the lives of our young people we want to know about it of course morrell said the car park had a view of playing fields and the distant black mountains moorfield high serving scattered villages in north and central herefordshire was half a mile from the nearest one and not a church steeple in sight which wouldnt displease morrell merrily thought watching the head driving away the chairman shook his head its his one blind spot merrily hes a good headmaster in most respects knows about discipline doesnt let the little beggars run wild but hes an unbeliever dont mind me calling you merrily do you reverend i feel i know you after talking to bernie whatevers he been saying he just gets anxious about you poor old devil ah but he handles anxiety very well said merrily its part of being a bishop youre not wrong he patted her shoulder then consulted his watch halffour fancy nipping over to weobley for a coffee id like to mr howe but ive got to talk to someone charlie if i cant be chief super any more ill just be charlie least you didnt call me councillor howe he looked sad for a moment as though his useful life had ended when he retired from the police which it clearly hadnt youre chairman of the education committee now arent you vicechairman he put his head on one side winked at her as yet tell you what why dont you come and talk to one of our subcommittees tell the beggars a few things they didnt know you think theyd want that they never know what they want these days think they know what goes on but they bloody well dont i know youve got a pretty thankless job got to deal with some weird customers youd know all about that what thankless jobs i meant weird oh aye charlie said getting more thankless all the time policing i dont know how they keep going todays coppers with all the restrictions and the humanrights legislation known criminals laughing at you from behind their slippery lawyers he gazed across the fields towards wales sucking air through his teeth a pillow of cloud lay over the black mountains your daughter seems to be coping merrily said you reckon he looked up at the sky for a moment as if deciding whether it would be disloyal to take this any further then he turned to her ill tell you merrily it was the shock of my life when anne joined the force never told me you know never said a word leaves university with a very respectable law degree moves away next thing there she is on the doorstep in her uniform not for very long i imagine oh no fasttrack now doing undercover work while she was still a pc out of uniform altogether within a couple of years detective sergeant at twentyfive chief constable material then aye charlie said his eyes narrowed shrewdly dont get on too well with her do you she tell you that no need when it comes to religion anne stands shoulder to shoulder with brother morrell always been her blind spot hasnt held her back not even in a cathedral city no charlie howe stood with his legs apart his back to the horizon he must have cut an intimidating figure as a detective framed in the doorway of the interview room not as a copper no merrily whod had two encounters with charlies daughter didnt know what to say she wasnt sure she could have got on with annie howe if the woman had been mary magdalene with a warrant card charlie took out his car keys and tossed them from one hand to the other didnt tell brother morrell everything did you i doubt it would have helped what do you think oh no youre quite right it wouldntve helped at all but you wouldnt have brought him out here in the school holidays if there wasnt something about this issue that had you particularly worried now would you merrily met his eyes they were deepsunk but glittery playing with her well she said i dont really like this kind of thing new age stuff i can put up with a bit of fortunetelling astrology meditation trying to contact the dead thats unhealthy let them go i say and where do the dead go young merrily heaven hell purgatory leominster charlie everybody knows that he grinned well you have a think about talking to my subcommittee ill give you a call in a week or two she stood by the old volvo and watched him drive away in his dusty jaguar she thought she liked him but she wasnt sure if she could trust him he was a councillor back in the vicarage she paused under the picture in the hall a goodquality print of holmanhunts the light of the world it had been a gift from uncle ted who knew nothing of the lamplit path and showed jesus christ at his most sorrowfully benign a middleaged jesus laden with experience of humanity at its most depressing what am i learning from this she asked him because it seems to me im just muddling around getting up everybodys noses and not helping a soul summer had never been her favourite season people expected it to be a time of pleasure new feathers cares dropping away like rags but too often the old feathers refused to fall and the rags still clung clammy with sweat inside the house tiredness came down on merrily like a tarpaulin she checked the answering machine nothing pressing no jane drank half a glass of water and fell asleep on the big old sofa in the drawing room with ethel the cat on her stomach and dreamed she was back in the church it was evening the sandstone walls were sunsetvivid and the apple glowed hot and red in the hand of eve in the huge westfacing stainedglass window and merrily was standing in a column of lurid crimson light and she could hear her own thoughts as she prayed oh god please tell me is jane involved in the summoning of the dead please tell me heads for yes tails for no her thumb flicked against old copper it hurt the coin rose up sluggishly into the dense air rose no more than three or four inches and she had to jump back to avoid catching it as it fell she didnt see it fall but she saw it land because it appeared dimly on the flags rolling onto one of the flat tombstones in the floor at the top of the nave into the gaping timeravaged mouth of the skull at its centre she peered down couldnt make out whether it was heads or tails she bent over double and the shadows deepened she went down on her knees and all she could see was a void she started to weep in frustration and found she was scrabbling in her bag buried in the shadows beside the sofa like a great catafalque in the dreary brown light yes mum jane she struggled to sit up clutching the mobile phone to an ear you ok i yeah of course im ok good janes voice was as light and hollow as bamboo are you ok merrily sat on the edge of the sofa hunched up the room was dim and felt stagnant the dull day deprived of any summer glory was refusing to go gently and seemed to be sucking out the last of the light like a vacuum pump the feeling she had was that jane was not ok from hell jane lay on eirions single bed watching the last of the light in the sky over the sea all kinds of emotions were pressing down on her guilt regret some bitterness but mainly she was furious and not only at herself so what did you tell her eirion whispered everything what could i tell her eirion had claimed the only bedroom as yet converted from the attic it had white walls and the smell of new plaster and even he could only just stand up in here but the views towards porthgain and the old mine workings were incredible if would be ok brilliant even if it was just eirion and the views and this amazing moist translucent feel you got in pembrokeshire the mystical otherness of the countryside oh no shed been about to say to mum the house is top its the family thats from hell but shed wound up playing that down in the end because of the guilt and the fury eirion stroked janes bare arm you didnt tell me about any of this what was to tell all kinds of shit happens at school you put it behind you dont you and when you get back after the holidays its all forgotten and theres a new kind of shit waiting so this layla is she a genuine medium dunno she claims to have psychic powers gypsy ancestry all that and shes certainly got this charismas not the word its more threatening than that can there be like negative charisma i mean she lays it on obviously shes clearly found that being threatening looking brooding that works gets you stuff even the teachers dont mess with her ive noticed this teachers are very polite to her especially the men armslength situation they are kind of scared you know what that means dont you jane rolled over enlighten me o experienced one mr been around mr done all that yeah ok eirion said wearily youve made your point so whats it mean half the male staff are shagging layla riddock it only needs one eirion said or maybe she set one of them up and he was just that bit slow saying how dare you young lady theyre only human arent they and then they start gossiping in the staffroom as well warn each other of the traps lets be careful out there shes certainly got steve on a string the groundsman guy there you go but this kid this amy i didnt realize how far it went you know i mean how could i like ok shes miss prim fourteen going on fortyfiveyearold spinster stiff enough to snap any time jane turned over leaned across him and clicked on the bedside tablelamp and she set me up shes scared shitless of riddock so she set me up all it was i just happened to be there and virtually dragged in anyway i was nothing to do with it this amys more or less claiming i organized it and i told mum the truth but all the time im thinking why should she believe me this time you shouldve told her in the first place shouldnt you you knew that stuff was right in her ballpark oh come on irene you dont do you you just bloody dont even if its somebody you dont particularly like unless its life and death you just dont grass them up and now mum could be in some deep trouble over this she sank back rolling her head on her bit of pillow she was really pissed off with me more than she was saying because whatever id done she wouldnt want to louse up my holiday shes cool that way but i could tell she thought i was going to say it was all total crap that i didnt know a thing about it that somebody had obviously fitted me up et cetera she was like totally shattered to find out there was some truth in it sorry eirion said im not being very helpful am i its not your crisis maybe i should have noticed how it was with amy and layla riddock weve all been there havent we bullying intimidation you ever have days you were so scared to go to school you were faking stupid symptoms hasnt happened to me since i was like really young eleven twelve i was quite small then for my age thought i was going to wind up looking like mum little and cute little is not cute at school always the ones who are just a bit bigger who go for you isnt it eirion said the ones whove maybe been bullied a bit themselves they do much worse stuff and they get away with it because nobody suspects them and youre just so scared at the time adults are like oh you should stick up for yourself but you know they can do anything to you at school right under the noses of the staff like even if you die its only going to look like an accident theyre completely outside the law nobody out there realizes how totally evil kids can be its like some falsememory thing sets in with adults and all kids become cute and need protecting and thats how you wind up with teenage psychos like riddock when youre nine eirion lay on his back gazing into the darkness of the room there are elevenyearolds whore like like charles manson who this weird american guy who got people to kill for him murdered this movie star and all these rich people just went into their homes and ripped them to pieces manson was claiming to be receiving these psychic messages and the people who killed for him who included women they wrote pigs and stuff on the wall in the victims blood youre right jane said youre really not being very helpful she wondered if hed grown up thinking of this guy manson as the ultimate bogeyman because his own family was so damn rich there was a knock on the bedroom door shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit jane reached up and snapped off the lamp did they never never never go to sleep eirion that hated tripping lilting littlegirly voice what eirion called out hoarsely ydy jane yno er no eirion replied wel ble mae jane probably gone to the shop aw eirion mar siop ar gau that does it jane swung her legs off the bed she was wearing her jeans and her lemonyellow top she moved across the bare boards to the door eirion was looking anxious look dont he whispered cant you just let it go jane stopped at the door and thought for a moment then smiled she crept back and lay on the bed eirion was sitting on the side of the bed by now shoving his bare feet into his trainers sioned jane called out in this foggy slurry voice jane look would you mind giving us a few more minutes were having sex ok nin er yn shaggio a wonderfully awed silence eirion kind of crumpled again jane breathed loudly harder deeper oh god from hell oh yeah see most of the ordinary welsh people shed met jane liked this might seem like generalized and simplistic but they seemed kind of classless no side to them contrary to what everybody said you could have a laugh with them look at gomer parry look at eirion for that matter chunky honest selfdeprecating and this incredible smile that was as shed written in a poem she was never going to show him in a million years like all the birds starting to sing at once on a soft spring morning the poor sod raised among the crachach this was what they were called the welsh aristocracy the top families a few of them had titles but most of them were contemptuous of english honours although being sharp business people they were usually incredibly polite to the english people they encountered eirion said his dad dafydd sion lewis was some kind of welsh quango king he served on the welsh development agency the welsh arts council the wales tourist board the broadcasting council for wales and he was a major executive shareholder in whatever welsh water and welsh electricity were calling themselves this week there was a bunch of them like his dad eirion said the names of the organizations and businesses might change but it was always the same people in control dafydd sion lewis was plump and beaming and hearty and according to eirion in his darker moments majorly corrupt gwennan was his second wife about fifteen years younger she was a former secondaryschool teacher of the welsh language and now as a result of being married to the quango king a key member of the welsh language board which existed to keep the native tongue alive and thriving not that jane had a problem with this she was all for having more languages around gaelic cornish anything to keep people different from each other to create a sense of otherness at first shed thought that gwennan with her two cars and her moviestar wardrobe was a fairly cool person it had taken only one day of the holiday for her to realize what eirion had already kind of implied that everything had gone to gwennans head the wealth the status the establishment of the welsh assembly she was now a warrior queen of the new wales wielding the language like a spear except it isnt a new wales at all eirion had said morosely its the same old place run by the same old iffy councillors except theyre now known as assembly members supported by the same old bent financiers but with this new sense of superiority suddenly theyre looking down on everybody especially the english jane had suggested especially the english because the english dont have waless unique identity actually eirion said most of the time he found gwennan quite amusing she was essentially superficial and quite naive and she could be very kind sometimes when she noticed you unfortunately gwennan had come with baggage sioned and lowri eleven and eight the little princesses bilingual through and through pocket evangelists for the language and the culture no jane sioned would say wagging her little forefinger until jane wanted to snap it off ive told you and told you im not doing it unless you ask me yn cymreig you know what im really doing here dont you jane said to eirion when sioned had gone presumably to wait for her mother and dafydd to return to receive the shocking facts was there such a verb as shaggio they seemed to have converted every other english term coined since about you know what i am if she says anything well just simply tell her you were joking eirion said uncomfortably kind of a risque joke to make to an elevenyearold mind but im the first english au pair in wales thats what i am do you realize that behind the door in the farmhouse kitchen gwennan had hung an appointments calendar every day this week displayed a lunch date for her and dafydd every evening they went out for dinner in st davids or haverfordwest because several of their friends also had cottages in the area because the pembrokeshire coast was becoming like some kind of welsh tuscany and who had to look after the bloody kids meanwhile its exactly like being an au pair jane said with acidic triumph because i work my butt off for the privilege of learning the fucking language she began to beat the pillow with her fists im sorry eirion almost sobbed i genuinely didnt realize shed be quite so opportunistic eirion was too honest to reply it was a big old farmhouse the first floor had been divided into two sections there was a separate staircase to dafydd and gwennans suite the other staircase led to three small bedrooms sioned lowri and jane in the middle most nights the kids fell asleep with their respective boomboxes still pumping welshlanguage rock through the plasterboard walls either side of janes bed come to think of it gwennan and dafydd were unlikely to be at all put out by the thought of the young master giving one to the english au pair not that he had yet the daily and nightly presence of the evil little stepsisters seemed to be intimidating him more than whoever had been his schools version of charles manson stepfamilies a nightmare shed made the kids supper shed made them tidy their rooms shed made them go to bed at ten pm shed made them go back to bed at tenfifteen and in the course of this endlessly crappy evening shed been grilled by mum over the phone and made to feel like shit at eleventhirty probably looking like some totally knackered housewife shed followed eirion up to his attic bedroom and collapsed fully clothed onto his bed and poured it all out lets go over it again eirion said this layla and this kirsty jane moved closer to him which wasnt difficult on a single bed find that by staging little seances or whatever you want to call them they can wield enormous power over certain kids its addictive i reckon you keep going back even though youre terrified i mean im not terrified ok maybe a little scared but im like somebody whos attracted to all this stuff anyway as you know yeah eirion said grimly but this is a buttonedup kid from some fiercely christian household whos been taught that spiritualism is like firmly in the devils domain and her immortal soul is at risk and she still keeps going back because something about it has grabbed her jane gripped what she thought was going to be eirions arm but turned out to be his thigh sorry go go on kid knows shes like doomed shes totally beyond the pale i mean ive listened behind the door when mums been counselling individual parishioners which is like her version of confession you get some people who are really really scared that theyve thrown it all away because of some really piffling sin gets blown up out of all proportion eirion tentatively slid an arm under her waist youd think it was only a catholic thing or hellfire nonconformism or something but i dont think its anything to do with what denomination you are or even what religion its a psychological condition a kind of dependency a terrible fear of getting on the wrong side of god i mean no wonder she threw up in church holy communion the eucharist youre kneeling there with a mouthful of the blood of christ knowing youve as good as sold your soul to the other guy its all gonna come down on you in a big way isnt it layla would have known about this girls background oh yeah riddock knew exactly what she was doing must have been giving her a major buzz a cruelty high but you cant help wondering how shocked she was when it really started to happen when this justine started coming through and turned out to be amys real mother would heighten the power trip no end mindblowing she wouldnt want to let amy go after that eirion pushed a hand through her hair youve got this pretty well sussed havent you jane i dont know its all guesswork isnt it you tell your mum all this not the theoretical stuff but shell have worked that out for herself by now shes not thick eirion drew her to him the length of his body the length of hers toe to toe faces almost touching you havent told me how it ended jane closed her eyes saw the circle of letters the glass with a mind of its own justine how it ended we got raided didnt we pretty ludicrous the shed door just like crashed open and they burst in the drug squad the deputy head and the caretaker all very dramatic nobody move hands on the table like one of us might pull a gun of course they didnt expect it would be so dark layla just blew out the candles and it was probably kirsty gathered up the lettercards i dont know where she put them down her front i expect they certainly werent there by the time the caretaker found the lights the glass was knocked off the table and smashed it was just a glass they were expecting i dont know es or worse they search you nah layla had her cigs out by then plain old rothmans scattered across the table like she was sharing them out smart bitch you could see the relief on the deputy heads face now it was clearly no longer a police matter now girls because its the end of the term apart from confiscating these disgusting things im not going to take this any further however that was smart of her yeah what will she do now your mum go and tell the girls parents try and patch things up dunno or go after this layla yeah jane said soberly im afraid thats exactly what shes going to do having not the slightest idea of just how massively evil that bitch can be and if i try to warn her itll look like theres something else i dont want her to find out i im like feeling pretty pissedoff irene on every front he kissed her gently on the lips ok jane said except maybe that one she put a hand behind his head opened her mouth to his tongue and moulded her body into his one of eirions hands seemed to be trapped against her left breast jane was feeling less and less like a knackered housewife when they heard the doors of dafydd lewiss new jaguar slamming down in the yard then laughter and then something about eirion the great lover mr experience began to kind of shrink soon afterwards jane crept back to her own room and lay glowering at the ceiling shed been set up shed been framed shed been used to damage her own mother she couldnt live with this mafia lol gently shook the hand of the vicars wife i wont get up she said simon st john said you might think she says that every time just go and get me a drink you bugger isabels accent was valleys welsh she was plump and had light brown hair with tufts of gold and warm eyes no hurry give me time to get to know this boy ill get these lol offered isabel glared at him sit down you simon headed for the bar still in plain clothes the jeans the crumpled collarless shirt vicars night off it was gone nine pm the hop devil threequarters full lol sat down isabels black top was lowcut and glittery over one shoulder strap and a handle of the wheelchair he caught a glimpse of gerard stock sitting in the shadow of the bellying chimney breast so the landlord had let him back in stock was on his own except for a pint of guinness and a big whisky he was leaning back against the wooden settle with an empty smile and an arm extended along the top of the back rest like he was claiming an invisible girlfriend lol thought suddenly of the lady of the bines and felt uneasy for a moment you a catholic lol isabel inquired loudly only ive decided its time i went to lourdes but youve gotta go with a catholic isnt it or it doesnt work is that true what that you need to be accompanied by a catholic well he wont take me anyway and his lots rubbish at healing isabel pouted then she laughed i fell off a high wall lol is what it was a long time ago so that gets that out of the way now whats a nicelooking boy like you doing all on his own simon had said he and his wife had made a practice of going to the pub on monday nights making it known that this was when the parishioners could get to them without making an official visit out of it and therefore when delicate issues could be raised informally hed asked lol to join them explaining that isabel liked to meet new people she didnt get out much so lol had backburnered his usual reservations about country pubs tonight he felt he owed simon several drinks the first analogue recording theyd made of the river frome song lol humming the bits where the lyrics were incomplete had been so much stronger more atmospheric more ethereal than the demo playing in his head and this was all down to the cello of course the cello dark lowlying sinuous had become the spirit of the frome simon had sat there listening to the playback with his arms folded wincing at the cello parts and then remarking shrewdly somehow you cant settle anywhere can you lol youre the kind of guy who really needs a proper home but you dont know where its safe for you to be huh rejected by the bornagain parents shafted by the shrinks dumped by the girlfriend in ledwardine you want to trust but youre scared to trust people and then you fetch up here and the first thing you latch on to is a sad little river very perceptive of you vicar lol told him but ive learned how to psych myself now thanks isabel leaned her head close enough for lol to smell her shampoo expecting trouble he is she murmured simon lol wiped condensation from his glasses needs you for backup isabel confided me and me whos going to assault a clergyman minding a shortsighted songwriter and a cripple lol grinned he loved the way she said crippel and troubel now isabel had turned away and was loudly advising a woman who didnt look pregnant to get the christening booked before she missed the boat the woman looked alarmed for a moment then dissolved into giggles and tossed isabel an oh you kind of gesture on her way into the toilets lol thought that maybe the vicars wife had already become more a part of this community than the vicar was ever going to be theres a reason someone would want to assault him oh always someone whod like to isabel grimaced some people here theyd do anything for simon others well trouble is he doesnt care see doesnt give a toss not about himself nor who he offends one reason i had to marry him give him a reason to keep himself alive sorry youre not one of those men who says sorry all the time are you sorno good play well for you today did he it was almost spooky you want to hear him on electric bass always be a fallback for him when they chuck him out of the church theres a danger of that he tries isabel said lol stood up to help simon with the drinks lagers and something goldenbrown for isabel the atmosphere in the pub was like in the days before ventilators and smoking restrictions thin fluorescent bars glowed mauve between the beams as isabel jogged her neckline to and fro to fan the air on to her breasts lol tried not to look stocks over there he remarked isabel pushed her wheelchair back to see on his own too poor dab shes a funny one his wife adapted to that dreary hole like a bloody barn owl invite him over shall i this woman is a liability simon said to lol then he turned to his wife and spoke as to a child isabel stock has probably been in here three hours at least do you know how drunk that makes him lol said why exactly are you expecting trouble after a while you learn never to ask him that isabel said never tempt fate trouble came just the same it came with the arrival of adam lake and a lovely young woman with a wide sulky mouth and short hair the colour of champagne his wife lol wondered fiancee said isabel amanda rae shes got a discreet little chain of tiny fashion shops in cheltenham and worcester places like that not hereford mind they wouldnt pay those prices for that tat in hereford she sipped her drink dont much in cheltenham either i reckon thats why shell always need someone like him shallow pointless people they are supporting each others public facades my wife the social analyst simon murmured theyllve come out for the first time today i reckon isabel told lol all these press people about the place see and the wrong kind of press rip off all their clothes for a centrefold in horse amp hound but the buggersll lie low till this ones over she smiled slyly at simon bit like him taking off before ten in the morning with his cello case simon glanced uncomfortably at lol lol thought about the magical enhancement of the river frome song it was an ill wind it was getting very warm in the bar he noticed that all the tables had been taken except for the one in front of stock who sat there motionless still smiling see i dont have to talk to people if i dont want to its a rare skill and im good at it man i can be very relaxed very cool sidding quietly saying nothing the level of stocks pint had gone down a couple of inches though like he was taking it intravenously lake usually come in on a monday night too lol asked simon more often than not meets his friends from the hunt hes taken up the cause a crucial part of the salvation of his birthright just become local organizer for the countryside alliance so called leads demonstrations to london hypocritical bastards they are isabel growled still the norman overlords isnt it all the countrysides their hunting ground it is a class thing whatever anyone says but they also grow to enjoy killing ive seen it doesnt have to be like that she means that in the country sometimes things do have to be killed if theyre preying on stock simon explained but there has to be something questionable about people who simply love to do it he said that in the pulpit one week isabel said proudly that old bugger complained to the bishop lol followed her eyes to a fat man seventyish in a khaki shirt at the centre of a group at the bar oliver perryjones simon said former master of the hunt failed politician almost made it into parliament once until the true nature of his politics became apparent thanks largely to revelations by paul foot in private eye he swallowed some lager leaned back and scanned the room knights fromes like all rural communities scratch the surface and you come away with all kinds of crap under your shhhh isabels warning hand on his wrist good for you vicar adam lake said im sorry simon looked slowly up at him lake wore a light tweed jacket his muttonchop sideburns had been pruned and razored to sharp points the whole style looked too old for him too old for anyone of his generation lol thought lake was like a gangly mature student playing a spoof squire in the college review it wont be forgotten lake said and simon was on his feet oh shit said isabel what wont be forgotten simon said quietly your support lake said he was taller than simon taller than anybody here your support for the community against potentially disruptive influences right listen the bar noise sank around simon like it was being faded by a slide control on some hidden mixing board i support what my particular faith tells me is right and you adam you dont represent the fucking community dead silence adam lake smiled nervously his girlfriend looked annoyed fine language for a socalled minister oliver perryjones muttered ok simon said as adams raised the issue is there anything anyone thinks i ought to know about and lol realized what this was about the vicar making himself available for questioning about the stock affair most clergy might have saved it for the pulpit but that would leave no opportunity for argument in pubs though arguments never lasted long before they turned into rows and rows turned into fights this was simon st john opening his arms to the accumulating shit which was admirable lol thought also a little crazy simon looked around raised his voice anyone here who thinks im under the thumb of what gerard stock likes to call the rural mafia anyone thinks i declined to assist mr stock purely for the purpose of currying favour with the man who would be squire silence no sign of anyone rising to the bait maybe it wasnt so crazy simon shook back his hair isabel had a hand around her glass as if she was expecting someone to knock it to the floor eddies of tobacco smoke fuzzed the lights and then a slow handclap began pock pock pock heads started turning cautiously stock didnt lift his head just went on clapping his pint glass was down to its final quarter his whisky glass was empty the space in front of his table soon grew bigger people instinctively edging away until there appeared a meaningful emptiness between stocks table and the one lol was sharing with simon and isabel although no one was looking at him lol who hated an audience felt exposed i can get you a nationwide tour prof levin promised in his head pock pock pock whats the problem gerard simon said stock stopped clapping his eyes were like smoked glass youre a hypocritical bassard vicar simon shrugged but thas how the church survives isnt it never take sides isabel shouted thats ridic simon put his hand on her shoulder and she gripped her glass tighter clammed up thas right stock said keep the liddle woman out of it oliver perryjones called from the bar why dont you just clear out stock his voice was high and drawly like a hunting horn lol thought take your money from the gutter press and your drinksodden fantasies go back where you came from people like you dont have a place heah stock stared into his beer for a moment and produced a leisurely burp before turning his head slowly he was clearly very drunk he peered in the general direction of perryjones jus like old stewart me eh din fit in either did he the old gypoloving arsebandit take your foul mouth somewhere else perryjones said predictably there are ladies here isabel smiled i bet stock pointed unsteadily at perryjones i bet you were so fuckin delighted when stewart got topped served the bassard right and hey it also took a couple of dirty liddle gypos out of circulation no reaction stocks rosebud lips fashioned a blurred smile lol caught sight of al boswell with his wife at the end of the bar expressionless nonconfrontational is all we are din like the gypos did you you old fascist gypos and the jews you and old man lake eh fuckin blackshirts still got your armbands lol wondered if derek the landlord might intervene at this point but derek was looking down at the glass he was polishing hed know there were enough people here to deal with stock and enough people who would want to watch it happening perryjones had started to vibrate with fury but lakes tanned face was like a polished wooden mask his girlfriend amanda had her mobile out im calling the police go head darling stock said mildly not looking at her lezz have the coppers in whole wagonful of the bassards swell the audience lezz get the fuckin press back he shouted out any hacks in the house amanda clutched the phone but didnt put in a number wheres the lake boy gone wherere you you liddle arsehole tell me one thing what you gonna do if the smith boys geddout appeals gotta come up soon casell be wide open again the smith boys geddoff if stock was expecting a reaction from lake he didnt get it he searched out simon again you think they did it vicar maybe the police were a liddle hasty there whaddaya think man youre a liberal sorta guy you think the smith boys really did it you ever wondered who else wanted poor ole shirtlifting stewart out the picture lol sat up a new agenda was forming like invisible ink appearing between the lines of the old one he heard lakes girlfriend saying right i am calling them but felt nobody was really listening to her adam lake finally spoke put it away he told amanda let him finish himself plenty of witnesses here we can talk to my solicitor tomorrow he walked out into the space between simon and stock spell it out stock what exactly are you saying you think someone else killed ash rather than the convicted men that it theres a turnup isabel murmured lake said coolly well he was either hugely arrogant or he really had nothing to hide stock picked up his beer glass and drained it calmly come on lake suddenly roared scared to say it are you scared to say it in front of witnesses he put both big hands flat on stocks table stock for christs sake how much do you really think i care about that place you really think id you think anyone would kill for it for a brokendown bloody hopkiln have you seen my place have you seen where i live you really think im now going to offer you some ridiculous sum for that hovel is that it just to get you out of my hair are you mad are you sick stock stared at him froth on his beard set the glass down hard about an inch from one of lakes hands he said nothing hed got what he wanted lake was losing it let me tell you gerard let me tell everybody lake looked around wildly and lol saw emotional immaturity twitching and flickering in his big angular frame like a fortywatt bulb in a street lamp you picked the wrong man lake levered in towards stock you couldnt have done it to my father and you wont do it to me his face inches from stocks exposed to the booze and the sour breath you can stay in that dump for as long as you like you and your imaginary ghosts you stupid pathetic little turd like some soiled buddha stock gazed blandly into the bared teeth and the glaring eyes for maybe a couple of seconds before his own eyes seemed to slide up into his head and his body wobbled lol knew what was coming and so did lake but too late simon stood with lol on the forecourt under a night sky like deep blue silk shot with rays of green his white shirt was dark and foul with brown vomit the good shepherd it was simon whod guided gerard stock outside in his life of ducking and diving bartering and bullshit stock had probably come close many times to getting beaten up lol reckoned maybe he was now so physically attuned to the proximity of a kicking that his metabolism automatically came up with the most effective defence after it happened adam lake could have battered him drunk or sober into the stone flags without blinking but it was clear that all lake wanted women and some men shrinking away from both of them with cries of abhorrence and disgust was to get into the mens toilets and wash stock away on his way hed collided blindly with simon now simon stank of stocks vomit too but stock was clean and dry leaning casually against the pub wall the calm in the eye of the storm you are a piece of work gerard simon said it just drips off you doesnt it im a survivor simon stock said youd better go home lakes going to be out in a minute in search of a change of clothes he sees you out here he hes a big boy gerard and not a happy boy stock made a contemptuous noise you as good as accused him of murdering stewart you accused him in front of a score of witnesses oh no stock straightened up apart from the sheen on his face caught in the blue light from the window he looked almost sober you dont listen simon i asked a question was all i asked who else might have done for stewart if it wasnt the smiths no libel in a question didnt even ask him either i asked you he doesnt get me that easy nobody gets me that easy simon walked over to the pub door and pulled it until the latch caught where did you get that idea anyway gerard stock tapped a meaningful finger on the side of his nose not telling but what a reaction vicar what a beautiful instantaneous reaction and inclining his head to simon in front of witnesses lol wondered precisely how drunk stock had really been in there how pissed did you have to be to throw up on cue a good publicist has control tells you what he wants you to know when he wants you to know it timing what was happening here lol felt on the edge of something from which he could still if he wanted to turn away you ok to walk home he said to stock or you want simon or me to stock looked down at the dirt and cindered surface of the forecourt not going home yet lol thank you gonna take a walk clear my head time is it nearly closing time simon said in case you were thinking of going back inside to attempt to get served actually i think this may finally call for a change of hostelry stock produced a hawking laugh what dyou think vicar i think youre walking a narrow ledge simon said reason i need a clear head stock said is ive got your lady exorcist coming to visit tomorrow we lay stewart as it were lol froze as the latch of the pub door clacked thanks very much isabel said to someone and wheeled herself out then she saw stock bloody hell you still here youre going to ask this woman to exorcize your place then are you simon said quietly it isnt that simple you know gerard it isnt just a formality stock sniffed goodnight boys goodnight mrs st john he began to walk away towards the lane above him rose the broadleaf woods that enclosed the village the pinnacles of occasional pines piercing the greenwashed sky stars beginning to show gerard simon called out its not something you fart about with stock stopped about fifteen feet beyond him and turned round he was quite steady he pointed a finger at simon dont you he said presume to patronize me sunshine i came to you with an honest request and you told me to piss off whatever happens with this woman its down to you remember that lol thought the pointing finger quivered he thought he saw a smear of something cross stocks halfshaded face and then stock stiffened and turned and walked away at some point before the shadows took him lol thought the walk became a swagger lol walked back to the vicarage with the st johns simon pushing isabels chair lights blinking up on the malverns bloody hell isabel said stink rotten you do simon they crossed the humpback bridge over the silent frome hopyards either side the bines high on the poles simon looked over to the church about fifty yards from the river bank small and inconspicuous among trees risen higher than its stubby tower maybe the stink around stock is subtler im not sure hes right about lake lol said the way he claimed he just threw out a question and lake dived on it like this was a sign of some kind of guilt i dont think be nice it would to think he did have a hand in it isabel looked up at lol but it didnt feel right to me either boy was clever enough to realize smartish where stock was going but not intelligent enough to control his reactions if he had something to hide does that make sense lol nodded lots of money well educated but nowhere near as clever as stock and yet he turned to simon took a breath look what you said about exorcism they came to the vicarage against dark woods and hills and the lines of foliate poles in the hopyards its whiteness seemed symbolic there were no lights on in the front rooms but a soft glow seeped through to most of the windows from some inner core is there something youre not telling me lol said simon didnt reply went to open the gate isabel reached up and squeezed lols arm listen love he gets things he cant put into words sometimes you know what i mean lol looked up over the wheelchair to a broken necklace of moving lights rising up into the malverns to a band of black below the stars comfort and joy sod it not a question of keeping confidences not any more merrily switched on the anglepoise in the scullery picked up the phone at pm this wasnt going to make her very popular however the situation had altered she hadnt been in a position to give away any names before when all her information had come from hazel shelbone but now there was another and possibly more reliable source reliable merrily sat in the circle of light and prodded in robert morrells home number really little jane watkins now learning that there was no such thing as a free holiday had done it again while she hadnt actually initiated the spirit sessions she had been involved albeit peripherally peripherally shed had a finger on the damned glass the phone was ringing out at the other end morrell was going to be in bed getting a preholiday early night sleeping the sleep of the selfrighteous the phone would also awaken his wife and kids always hard to get kids off to sleep on the eve of a holiday merrily wondered how easily jane would sleep tonight getting it into proportion she couldnt really imagine herself as a kid the blackclad blacklipsticked siouxie and the banshees fan standing up and warning her mates that their ouija game was actually a form of psychic russian roulette then walking primly away to communal jeering not even if shed been a vicars daughter yes the womans voice wasnt sleepy but it wasnt exactly accommodating either mrs morrell could i speak to your husband im sorry its so late my names merrily watkins one moment resentful now merrily waited the fact remained that jane hadnt even mentioned the incident afterwards even knowing it would be in confidence this hurt shed thought theyd got beyond secrets beyond concealment shed thought there wasnt anything they couldnt discuss any more shed thought they were friends for gods sake the phone was snatched up mrs watkins i have to tell you that in just under seven hours were leaving for the airport with three small children look im really sorry but this is something i need to know and if i left it until tomorrow id be doing it behind your back which if this is about what i think its about id be immensely glad if you did look into it behind my morrell calmed down all right im sorry its been a difficult year i need a holiday go on ill be very quick i understand the organizer of what we were talking about is a girl called layla riddock he breathed heavily into the phone and youre asking if im surprised i can tell that youre not which is interesting before we take it any further morrell said anything i tell you has got to be absolutely unattributable and i mean of course because normally id only discuss any of my students in this way with the police and only then if there was some suspicion of sure all right morrell said layla riddock god almighty do i really need this layla is a dominant kind of girl stepdaughter of allan henry yes allan henry of allan henry homes with all the baggage that implies and more obviously i dont have an overview of their domestic situation but if i had to guess id say that like a lot of wealthy men with potentially problematical stepchildren hes been throwing money at her for years buying her compliance until such time as she leaves home shes driving around for instance in the kind of car i couldnt afford well i probably could but you know what im saying mmm shes an intelligent girl but shes got away with too much at home which is why she expects to get away with the minimum of work at school swans around the place under this thin veneer of disdain at having to spend her days with children you getting the picture a bully would you say not in the physical sense far as i know to be honest i dont think shed lower herself i think she can be intimidating enough without resorting to physical violence i mean shes quite the line went quiet janes word had been sinister something youre thinking about particularly merrily pulled her sermonpad into the lamplight reached for a fibretip something which might save us both some time she heard him breathe down his nose im thinking inevitably about the christmas fair we held at the school last year did you come no i was a bit busy before christmas and jane was off school she wasnt veryno we didnt come well he said i can tell you we were all quite surprised to say the least when ms riddock volunteered to take part in the fundraising a christmas fair being something she might normally consider well beneath her what she did she approached the teacher in charge of the event and volunteered to set up a fortunetelling stall oh did she yeah he said ruefully i thought that might get you made a few of the staff sit up when she appeared on the day in full gypsy costume very exotic and very expensive too according to my wife long lowcut black dress big gold earrings gold not brass black hat with a dark veil all very mature very mysterious just a bit sinister i suppose but that may be hindsight she always looks tainted somehow jane had said merrily lit a cigarette some of the staff had reservations from the start morrell said but as it was the first time in anyones memory that layla riddockd shown any enthusiasm for anything apart from burning rubber outside the gates they werent inclined to push it so they set her up in the hall back of the stage behind a curtain somebody painted a sign gypsy layla and as all the other stalls were fairly routine people were queuing up to cross her palm with silver men too once theyd seen her shes very attractive i suppose you would say she exudes a certain hormonal something something you dont often find at school christmas fairs anyway and was she good at telling fortunes she was bloody good at frightening people robert morrell said bitterly wouldnt have frightened me as you probably realize by now but i accept that a lot of people are taken in by that kind of rubbish against all their better instincts anyway i dont know much about this sort of thing but i gather that the usual routine is to tell the customers theyre going to cross the water or come into some money live long and happy lives have lots of children what was she using crystal ball i wouldnt know she was certainly reading palms at some stage anyway the staff started to notice that very few people were coming out actually smiling and the ones who did their smiles tended to be rather strained then some granny emerges very whitefaced and almost fainting one of the female staff sits her down brings her a cup of tea learns that laylas looked at her palm and advised her to start getting her affairs in order because she aint got long oh quite there were several others we found out later one pregnant woman for instance had been told to prepare for the worst or as layla apparently put it i see a withering in your womb you found this out on the night not all of it some of the stories came out over a period of days but i suppose the atmosphere on the night itself well as christmas fairs go its fair to say there was gradually less of an ambience of comfort and joy than one might have wished for she wasnt stopped oh she was stopped eventually one of the parents had been kicking up about it long before it became widely known that she was taking peoples money for predicting death and sickness the guy was objecting on religious grounds eventually to my shame we had to use that as a way of bringing it to a close anyone talk to layla afterwards ask her why she was doing this to people i had sandra the deputy head haul her in on the monday morning waste of time the girl pretended she couldnt understand what the fuss was about she was simply passing on the information she was picking up psychically she claimed there was a long line of gypsies on her fathers side her real father i wanted to make her an appointment with the schools psychiatrist merrily wrote down gypsies ask j but sandra talked me out of taking it any further let it go just make bloody sure gypsy layla and her crystal ball dont get invited back any of the kids the other students go in to get their fortunes told i dont know who was the parent who complained a religious nutter im sorry i should say one of our churchgoing parents appalled that such a thing should be allowed to go on in an educational establishment was threatening to take it up with the director of education i was a bit short with him at first what was his name is that important might be shelbone a thoughtful pause david shelbone father of a fourthyear girl and unfortunately he works for the council he actually knows the director of education merrily kept her voice steady layla know about this well yes of course everybody did i the way we played it and im not proud of this but it seemed expedient at the time shelbone was still around in another part of the school so we had someone tip him off that people had been upset by the girls predictions sure enough he comes rushing back in gods name stop this wickedness embarrassing really morrell chuckled but i dont think anybody else went to have their fortune told after that after a few minutes gypsy layla walks away through the hall head held high grim little smile on her face crisis over you thought merrily sat in the circle of lamplight and tried to remember if jane had ever mentioned the incident but she hadnt gone back to school until the january term probably all blown over by then and thats all i can tell you morrell said however if you are planning to take this any further id offer two suggestions one if youre going to take on layla riddock remember youre taking on allan henry too and hes a man with unlimited money and with friends in high places not as high as mine i always like to think merrily was starting to feel lightheaded how peevishly simple this could all turn out to be shelbone terminates laylas powertrip layla puts the frighteners on shelbones daughter morrell said my other advice is leave shelbone alone you think he might try to convert me to christianity if you want to know about david shelbone talk to our friend charlie howe hell tell you what kind of fanatic youre dealing with and i dont just mean religion which would probably never seem like fanaticism to you the other reason not to bother shelbone is that im afraid the poor guy has personal problems at the moment i i had a call about it earlier this evening his daughter attempted suicide this afternoon merrily froze the cigarette at her lips less uncommon im afraid than it used to be morrell said especially at this time of year children thinking theyve done badly in their gcses therefore their lives must be over maybe nothing at all to do with us so im not going to theorize at this stage summer can be a stressful time for some kids what did she do to herself half an inch of ash fell to the desk friend of janes is she what did she do overdose i believe taken to the county hospital they got to her in time i gather merrily closed her eyes the penny started spinning always sad morrell said just like merrily he must have been putting two and two together from the moment the name shelbone left his lips but he did have to be at the airport by seven so if thats all ill get off to bed he said she called dennis beckett he knew nothing about amy and an overdose he couldnt seem to absorb the significance but i prayed with her he said querulously we prayed together and then he added vaguely perhaps she should have seen a doctor her parents wouldnt well he said when i left her she was spiritually calm and how could you possibly know that merrily asked him if hed be visiting the parents tomorrow you are still minding the parish arent you why did this have to happen dennis said plaintively meaning why did it have to happen while jeff kimball was on holiday what is it you want me to try and find out he asked her at last with resignation he clearly didnt want to have anything more to do with this case could you find out if theyll talk to me merrily said both of them she switched off the anglepoise and sat in the dark watching the red light on the answering machine wondering how she would have handled this if shed known from the beginning about layla riddock when she switched the light back on nothing seemed any clearer and it was eleventhirty she called huw owen who never seemed to sleep i tossed the coin she told him eventually it came up tails twice tails no spiritual interference no unquiet spirit and how did you feel lass weird come on talk grownup eh sorry i felt separation transcendence little me big god plus i was in there all night but it felt like not so long how long six hours felt like i dont know less than two and you dont fall asleep on your knees do you contraction of time eh and it was profound moving exalting all that stuff but im trying not to get carried away because somehow it didnt tally with what happened afterwards out here in the material world its not been a great day for me huw bugger me she heard him drawing in a thin breath like the wind through a keyhole youre still expecting god to make it easy i should scourge myself put brillo pads in my underwear what im thinking merrily huw said reasonably is if you were in the church all last night you should be getting some sleep just a thought i grabbed an hour or so earlier look ive got a kid who tried to kill herself what can i do nowt let this dennis pick up the mucky end of the stick for a change hang back see what transpires what transpires hasnt enough bloody transpired the girlll be safe in hospital for the time being and what about layla riddock aye he said theres your problem looks like but were not the police and even if we were whats she done wrong apart from terrifying old ladies and driving a little girl to the point of suicide as an act of pure vengeance all right its a tough one he admitted needs thought prayer or the toss of a coin get off to bed merrily huw growled she lay in bed with ethel the cat in the cleft in the duvet between her knees she slept eventually she dreamed over and over that the phone was ringing she dreamed of a withering foetus inside her and awoke sweating and then closed her eyes visualizing a golden cross in blue air above her and slept again and awoke something coming back to her from the night in the church and she thought justine awakening stickily into blindingly mature sunlight and the echoey squeakandclang of the castiron knocker on the front door panic jane would be late forstumbling halfway downstairs dragging on her towelling robe before she realized there was no jane to worry about the knocking had long stopped she didnt know how long it had been going on and now the phone was shrilling she dragged open the front door and found nobody there she ran through to the scullery saw shed left the anglepoise lamp on all night and grabbed the phone oh i was begining to think youd left already sophie oh god what time is it its just gone eight are you all right er yeh sorry i late night you havent forgotten mr stock mr s the haunted hopkiln sophie said youre due there by nine remember i made an appointment for you oh shit merrily i was ringing to warn you that weve had more calls from the press the people asked if they could be there exclusively for the exorcism we said on no account we also declined to confirm that there was going to be an exorcism also more alarming as far as the bishop was concerned the religious affairs correspondent of the daily telegraph did you know amy shelbone had tried to kill herself what consequently i need to speak to both the shelbones i think ive finally got some idea of what its about now obviously theyre not going to want to speak to me after what is the child all right i think so i dont know i havent had ill talk to them ill arrange something if i can merrily meanwhile i hate to do this over the phone and i did try to reach you last night but you were constantly engaged i have to tell you the bishop would like you to expedite this hopkiln thing with the minimum fuss and the minimum publicity he doesnt want it dragged out he doesnt want to see you walking out of there into a circus of flashbulbs and tv lights sophie its not that big a story his exact words as i recall were tell her to throw some holy water around and then leave by the back door put a bottle in the post and do the rest down the phone shall i hes nervous merrily since the ellis affair where deliverance is concerned hes been like the proverbial cat on hot bricks rarely a day goes by when he doesnt ask me if we have a shortlist yet for the panel meaning he doesnt quite trust me hes nervous sophie repeated and once he finds out about this attempted suicide hes going to be very nervous indeed fortunately hes leaving at ten for a threeday conference in gloucester transsexuality in the clergy should absorb his attention for a while three days this year alone surgery has increased the number of female clergy in britain by four sophie said dryly i need to speak to simon st john obviously i trust hes not in the operating theatre sophie made a small noise indicating it wouldnt surprise her unduly i shall call him and tell him youre on your way just go ill call you when its over merrily said whatever the hell it turns out to be lightform and this is where youre standing on it mr stock said although a despicable shiver had started somewhere below her knees merrily made a point of not moving the police it seems dont operate a cleaning service he said so we could hardly avoid knowing precisely where it was they were standing just the two of them on stone flags in the circular kitchen at the base of the kilntower the place had a churchy feel because of its shape and its shadows the light was compressed into three small windows like square portholes above head height above merrilys anyway and it was cold outside july in here november what was that about its about doing your job isnt it its about not prejudging the issue on secondhand evidence she let the shiver run its course let it sharpen her focus shed driven over here with a head full of amy shelbone and layla riddock and jane everybody but gerard stock whose problem had been devalued because he was allegedly a professional conman a manipulator a spindoctor and then you walked out of a summer morning into this temple of perpetual gloom and it came home to you in hard tabloid flashes that a man had actually been beaten to death in cold blood right here where you were standing his face his skull repeatedly crunched into these same stone flags violent death would often have psychic repercussions you knew that then there was gerard stock himself bombastic bit of an operator possible drink problem this morning gerard stock was wearing a clean white shirt and creamcoloured slacks his hair was slicked down and his beard trimmed the impression you had was that mr stock had bathed this morning in the hope of washing away the weariness in his bones changed into clothes that would make him feel crisp and fresh but the weariness remained in his bleary eyes and the sag of his shoulders if this was an act he was good there are two different versions of the story he was standing with his back to the cold rayburn stove that sat on a concrete plinth probably where the old furnace had once been his voice was as arid as cinders the prosecutions submission was that stewart had been in bed upstairs alone when the boys broke in boys glen and jerome smith nineteen and seventeen travellers members of their family had been helping stewart with his research into the links between the gypsies and the frome valley hop farms hed bought the boys drinks in the hop devil paid them also in cash for their research assistance mainly a question of finding romanies who were willing to talk to him but according to the prosecution the smiths got greedy and they came to believe he had a fair bit of money on the premises merrily looked around no indications of wealth and no obvious hiding places in a circular room that didnt seem to have altered much from its days as the lower chamber of a hopkiln its walls were of old bare brick hung with shadowy implements nonculinary romantic maybe but not an easy place to live in their defence mr stock said the smith brothers told a different story which to me has more than a ring of truth it certainly didnt do their reputation any favours basically they admitted visiting poor old stewart on a number of occasions at night to administer to his needs you mean sexual merrily said for money next to her was a dark wood rectangular table top on a crossed frame which looked as if it had once been something else a largeformat book called the hop growers year lay face down on it on the back of the book was a photograph of the author small features under greywhite hair so dense it was like a turban the photo was one of those oldfashioned studio portraits with a pastel backcloth like the sky of another world and the face brought home to her the reality and the unreality of why she was here for this was him the kilnhouse ghost her first task to determine whether it was reasonable to believe that some wisp some essence of this person was still here madness even half the clergy thought it was madness agreed theyd accepted money several times gerard stock was saying for research and for giving him hand relief as it was described to the court all rather sordid but gypsies arent squeamish about sex as stewart pointed out in his book their society might be closed to the outside world but its very open and liberal when youre on the inside gypsy kids tend to get their first carnal knowledge at the hands of siblings if not parents prudish theyre not which is healthy in a way i suppose you wont find many romanies in need of counselling he inspected merrily as if checking how prudish she might be no way could she align this stock with the slick pr man described by fred potter the reporter and hinted at by simon st john he was just someone trying to rationalize the irrational more scared by it than hed ever imagined he could be hed told her frankly that stewart ash and he had never got on ash always blaming him for leading his niece into a world of ducking diving and periodic penury people will talk to you as a human being the bishop had said meaning she came over as small and harmless no black bag look if you want to sit down over there mr stock indicated a chair pulled out from the table im afraid stewart really was found lying with his head almost exactly where your feet are im ok go on well he was wearing pyjamas there was a lot of blood his face was almost unrecognizable weve scrubbed and scrubbed at the flag but when the suns in the right position you can still see the stains distinctly merrily made a point of not looking down inspecting the upper part of the room instead shed been in hopkilns before and couldnt help noticing how basic this restoration had been rough boarding fitted where once thin laths would have been spaced out across the rafters supporting a cloth to hold the hops for drying over the furnace the smiths always fiercely denied killing him insisting at first to the police that someone must have followed them in and done it after theyd left any evidence of that of sexual activity apparently not when there was nothing in the forensic evidence nothing from the postmortem to suggest stewart had recently had sex they panicked and one of them changed his story claiming theyd come here to do the business and found him already dead that couldnt have helped them merrily said finished them completely far as the jury was concerned found guilty sent down for life theyve appealed now every one appeals couple of civilliberties groups assisting probably wont succeed but i imagine one or two people in the area are getting a touch jittery about it we certainly are he laughed nervously if they didnt do it who did its one thing to live in a place where a murder was committed something else to live with the possibility that the murderers still out there you think thats a real possibility oh yes he walked over to the wall pulled down a wooden pole with a slender sickle on one end unexpectedly the crescent blade flashed in the shaft of sunlight from the middle window merrily stayed very still as he hefted it from hand to hand they used these things for cutting down bines i sharpened it i thought theyre not going to get me like they got stewart ridiculous he shuddered replaced the tool i just dont trust the countryside so why hadnt the stocks sold the place and got out i dont understand why would anyone want to get to you i he looked at her as if he was about to say something then he hung his head i dont really know i just dont feel safe here never have lie awake sometimes listening for noises hearing them too the country is what sort of noises oh creaks knocking birds and bats and squirrels he shrugged uncomfortably i dont know nothing alarming i suppose except for the footsteps i do know what a footstep sounds like youve actually heard footsteps not loud crashing footsteps echoing all over the place like in the movies these are little creeping steps always come when youre half asleep its like theyre walking into your head you think youve heard them though youre never sure but in the middle of the night thinking is quite enough really it wasnt quite enough for merrily what about the furniture being moved he looked up sharply oh we didnt hear that happen we had the table over the bloodstained flag to cover it keep it out of sight wed come down in the morning and find it was back where where it is now this happened twice but we never heard anything and you talked about a figure you said in the paper youd seen a figure coming out yeah he walked over to the part of the wall opposite the door coming out just here i said a figure because youve got to make it simple for these crass hacks my working lifes been about avoiding big words but actually it was simply a a lightform do you know what i mean a moving light a luminescence something that isnt actually shining but is lighter than the wall and roughly the shape of a person wed finished supper a very late supper it was our wedding anniversary and sudenly the room went cold now that happened thats one cliche that did happen its a funny sort of cold you cant confuse it with the normal goes right into your spine do you know what i mean yes i do this was on the whole convincing when you thought of all the embellishments he might have added the familiar smell of stewarts aftershave that kind of stuff merrily shivered again glad shed put a jacket on to hide the radiohead tshirt actually shed left the vicarage in a hurry no breakfast just a halfglass of water throwing her vestment bag into the boot usually shed spend an hour or so in the church before a deliverance job but thered been no time for that either mind you its so often like a morgue in here gerard stock folded his arms and dark in itself creates a sense of cold doesnt it the living room through theres no better that was formerly the part where the dried hops were bagged up put into sacks hoppockets merrily said oh you know about hops a bit stewart had absolutely steeped himself in the mythology of hops not that theres much of one he got quite obsessed over something thati mean its just an ingredient in beer isnt it a not very interesting plant that you have to prop up on poles there was a hopyard at the back here was the wilt got it is that still happening i believe there are new varieties of hop so far resistant to it but it happened here you said you saw lights out in the hopyard my wife my wife saw them i never have that was the first thing that happened it was soon after we moved in winter just after dusk wed brought in some logs for the stove and she was standing in the doorway looking down the hill towards the hopyard and she said she saw this light a moving light not like a torch more of a glow than a beam hovering and moving up and down among the hopframes appearing in one place and then another faster than a human being could move she wasnt scared though she said it was rather beautiful just that once no i suppose not after a while we didntthis might sound unlikely to you but we stopped even mentioning those lights when far worse things were happening in the house itself i suppose unexplained lights in the old hopyard seemed comparatively unimportant hops merrily said when you say stewart was obsessed by hops you mean from an historical point of view or what well that too obviously but also hops themselves i wouldnt claim to understand what he saw in them to me theyre messy flakey things not even particularly attractive to look at but when we first took possession of the house the walls and the ceiling were a mass of them all these dusty crumbling hopbines twelve fifteen feet long and the whole place stank of hops i mean i like a glass or two of beer as much as anyone but the constant smell of hops no thank you and when you opened a door theyd all start rustling it was like he shook his head roughly go on like a lot of people whispering i suppose anyway we cleared out the bines it felt as though they were keeping even more light out of the place some of them were straggling over the windows the windows in the living room back there once looked out down the valley apparently through the central window in here she could see blue sky through the other two blue paint it probably hadnt even been this dark when it was a functioning kiln with a brick furnace in the centre the barns she said he nodded thats awful merrily agreed but im afraid its not your problem no have you talked to a solicitor ive talked to a lot of people mr stock said erm that aroma of hops merrily breathed in slowly through her nose i almost expected you to say youd been smelling it again she thought his eyes flickered but it was too dim to be sure he shook his head no nothing like that so what about your wife he was silent his face seemed to have stiffened i mean how badly has she been affected she saw the lightform my wife he turned away shoulders hunched wont talk much about it when the hacks were here we had to virtually manufacture some suitable quotes for her maybe she thinks itll all just go away you mean shes not so scared as me probably not obviously neither of us likes the darkness its the kind of darkness you have to fight and you lose in here a twohundredwatt bulbs like a forty billsve been horrendous but stephie perhaps she just doesnt believe stewart would harm her also more of a religious background than me catholic lapsed but it doesnt go away not like merrily smiled im sorry didnt mean to be insulting i was raised in the c of e all i meant about your wife merrily said is that i think she should be here too when we do whatever we do as a blood relative of mr ash well she will be shell be here tonight mr stock merrily said if i could just make a point here unless you really think that for some reason its important for this to be done at night i dont necessarily think thats a good idea i think it might be better for all of us better for the bishop too if we said some initial prayers perhaps a small requiem service for mr ash without delay now he didnt quite back away by daylight anyway personally i always think theres an inherent danger in making this all too serious almost snapping sinister ill probably need the book but we can dispense with the bell and the candle she could almost see his thoughts racing something almost feverish in his eyes did he have plans to involve the media had something already been arranged for tonight he unfolded his arms all right i can call stephie at work maybe she can take time off how long will the exorcism take that might be too big a word for what we do not very long i shouldnt think best to keep things simple oh and id also want to ask the vicar if hed like to join us two ministers are better than one in this kind of situation and its usual to involve the local guy when possible st john hint of a sneer he wont want to know tell you that now id like to ask him anyway if thats all right with you he shrugged your show yours actually and your wifes and it would actually be helpful to have a few other people who knew your wifes uncle is there anyone you think oh no both hands went up definitely not i dont want local people in here im sorry we dont exactly have any close friends in the area id rather this wasnt talked about but you went to the press i was desperate ive told you i felt threatened i didnt know who i could trust especially after the vicar refused to help us bottom line is i dont want any of those people in here all right ok erm another point at a service of this kind we need to draw a line under the past a big element is forgiveness i think that means were looking for some kind of reconciliation between you and stewart which of course has to be initiated by you he laughed id guess that for stewart one of the best things about death would be never having to see gerard stock again but you know best well i dont really know anything for sure merrily said were assuming mr ash is what you might call an unquiet spirit huw owen would call it an insomniac our fundamental purpose has to be to guide him away from whatevers holding him down here towards a state of look he put his hands on his hips faced her is this going to you know tell us anything im not a medium mr stock what if stewarts spirit whatever you want to call it is unable to rest because it wants to get a message across like for instance that his killers still out there ah merrily looked down at the flags around her shoes she could now make out the outline of what might have been a stain hidden agenda coming out at last whos the killer then in your view i cant tell you that he said because you dont know or maybe youve got ideas ive got ideas however i might be open to legal action were i to share them with you mrs watkins ok whats the actual time now im afraid i came out without my watch he held his wrist up to the light just after ten minutes to ten god was that all she needed breathing space prayer space look ill call her now he said something seemed to have lifted inside him daytime yes i shouldve thought of that daytimes much better and meanwhile ill go down to the church talk to the vicar and change see you back here in an hour or less yes fine thank you they went back through the living room the former hopstore where any extra light not blocked off by the barns was absorbed by drab leathery furniture stewarts probably by the back door merrily turned looked up at stock could i just ask you what do want this to achieve i mean you personally he wasnt ready for this one didnt meet her eyes instead he went to open the door for her and the day came in like a golden cavalry of angels i want things to be normal he said thats all she drove up to the minor road leading to knights frome and was almost through the village before she realized that it was the village the church was out on the edge the other side of the river the white house nearby could only be the vicarage no car outside she pulled on to the verge about fifty yards away from the church took off her jacket threw it over the passenger seat lit a cigarette and checked her mobile for messages just the one merrily sophie im afraid i cant raise the vicar but bernard says go ahead without him hell clear up any political debris which i suppose means i shall right then merrily switched off the phone and put out her cigarette as she was climbing out of the volvo she saw through the wing mirror a rusting white astra pulling in about twenty yards behind it was already hot and not yet tenfifteen a single cloud powdered the sky over the church which was low and comfortably sunken with a parttimbered bell tower pigeons clattered in what had once been a hedge surrounding the vicarage from the car boot merrily pulled her vestment bag and a blueandgold airline case containing two flasks of holy water shed knock on the vicarage door on the off chance someone was home if not shed change in the church always assuming it was open slinging the bags over her shoulder she bent to lock the car as she pulled out the key there were footsteps behind her a quiet padding on the grass she turned quickly wishing she hadnt locked the car she froze the mirage was wearing a black tshirt jeans and those same round brassrimmed glasses she was aware of the birdsong and the laboured chunter of a distant tractor as they stood and stared at one another for two long seconds he shuffled a little nodded at the radiohead motif on her chest so er what did you think of kid a erm stunned she put down the vestment bag adjusted the plastic strap of the airline case she swallowed well you know it kind of grew on me parts of it uh huh he nodded then he said rapidly merrily im sorry to you know spring out at you like this i did come round to the vicarage quite early this morning but that that was you knocking but there was no answer so i went to buy a mars bar and a paper at the shop and then i ran into gomer parry and we talked for a few minutes and then when i got back your car had gone i overslept merrily saw flecks of grey in his hair it was shorter now the ponytail hadnt come back she bit down on her smile shaking her head you really choose your times lol because youre working yeah i mean could we i mean gerard stock right she felt the smile die completely as as you know lol said hesitantly im about the last person to try and tell you anything about your job but dont do this what put him off could you do that stall him please i no no i cant do that then at least come and talk to the vicar lol said and then peace the vestry at knights frome was about the size of a double wardrobe and didnt have a proper door never mind a lock she had lol stand guard just inside the church porch while she changed this was getting crazy too much to take she unpacked the bag full kit plus pectoral cross jane of course jane would love this situation wouldnt she just all the times in the past six months the kid had asked innocently have you heard from lol has lol been in touch does lol spend all his weekends in wolverhampton merrily took off her skirt and tshirt got into the cassock that she never wore except for services since a certain incident laurence robinson palely sensitive singersongwriter in downbeat lowkey minor chords unlucky in love survivor of a nervous breakdown and some years of psychiatric treatment might well have become the next nick drake q magazine if like poor nick hed killed himself the less satisfactory route to immortality but lol had survived to become droll selfdeprecating and from janes point of view dangerously cool the stepfather to die for and flirt with obviously merrily did up all the fabriccovered buttons of the cassock fortunately the kid was away her own feelings she could control up to the present the last time shed seen lol robinson had been on dinedor hill above hereford where a few days earlier a young womans death had been shatteringly avenged leaving lol in the middle of steaming wreckage with two people dead and one dying heavy trauma in a still december dusk before christmas the two of them had stood next to a fallen beech tree on the edge of the celtic hill fort and looked down over the city where steeples and the cathedral tower were aligned under a shadow of cloud and the distant black mountains a prayer a meditation in remembrance of the victims and then theyd walked back down the hill hand in hand and then lol no big fan of organized religion had told her he was wondering if there wasnt some middle way between spiritual guidance and psychotherapy a new path maybe and theyd walked away to their separate cars and shed known in her heart that they would meet again sometime at least as friends but that this wasnt the moment to allow things to go further lol robinson just about the last person shed expected to meet today materializing in a heat haze at the roadside and more confusingly revealed as one of the antistock contingent warning her to back off like she had a choice abandoning attempts to contact merrily lol had been on the road by seven am knowing that if he didnt catch her before she went out she could be anywhere in the diocese and thered be no chance of talking to her until she arrived at stocks tonight by which time it would be too late i truly hope your friend has the sense not to get involved simon had said and then last night isabel he gets things he cant put into words when he found merrily had left the vicarage hed gone into hereford checked the bishops palace parking area then called the office to make sure she wasnt there mrs hill remembered him but wouldnt tell him where merrily had gone shed offered to pass on a message lol said it was ok no problem hed decided to stake out the entrance to stocks place all day if necessary to catch her before she could go in but hed arrived back in knights frome to find she was already there shoved the car into some bushes gone running down the gravel track by the kiln about to go and hammer on the door disrupt whatever was happening when the door had opened and shed walked out followed by stock merrily and stock together the first time hed seen her in six months and here she was with stock who was looking from this distance as pristine as the husband in some old soappowder ad a man on the side of the angels merrily had been nodding to him conveying understanding and sympathy and at one point seemed about to take his hand but then shed turned and walked towards her car and lol had sidled along the bushes back to the astra to follow the volvo when shed parked close to simons church it had seemed meant hed made his move shock value it hadnt even been too difficult to persuade her to walk with him the few yards to the white vicarage where it had all seized up like an overwound clock the door had been opened by a woman of about sixtyfive in a pinny who told them the vicar and mrs st john had gone shopping in hereford they always went on a tuesday see because it was a slack day in the city between the weekend rush and the wednesday market easier for isabel to get around town the housekeeper had explained easier for hereford if isabel was in a good mood shed implied blank wall how could he persuade merrily to back away from this when he couldnt tell her any more than she already knew like what was the real reason simon had refused to exorcize gerard stocks kiln it was becoming clear that there was more to it than the vicars declared belief that stock was fabricating the whole thing either to screw lake or milk some money out of an inheritance he couldnt sell isabel had implied trust him lol didnt trust him too many suggestions of instability there and if anybody could spot instability it was lol he stood gazing down the aisle of simons very basic little parish church no fancy carving no stained glass towards the altar the truth was he had no reason to trust anyone in the clergy except he turned at the swish of the velvet curtain and she emerged from the vestry like she was stepping out of a dressshop cubicle apparently some men were kinky for women priests like with nurses and meter maids because of the uniform but when lol watched merrily stepping into the nave in her cassock and white surplice it only made him scared stock was very bad news simon knew more than he was saying lol was just a guy who wrote songs she gave him a small smile she looked like a child playing dressingup the sillyvicar outfit then he saw the lines at the corners of her eyes new lines dont look so worried merrily said its what i do walking back to the car she sensed his discomfort she didnt think hed ever seen her in the full gear before now she was a priest with an aura of black and white sanctity not a woman any more there was even a new stiffness a formality in the way he spoke to her i just think lol said that perhaps you should ask him why he cant sell the kiln just to see what he says lol thats it was childish but she did it pushed herself onto the bonnet of the volvo with the surplice fanning out around her thats irrelevant isnt it ive heard all about him i know what kind of man hes been i realize he probably went to the papers for the express purpose of stirring it for this guy lake or capitalizing on it in some other way but it it doesnt change the fact that i do think hes got some trouble here if i had to like and admire all the people i was asked to help then well id be having a lot of days off you know lol kept peering up the road and merrily knew he was hoping to delay things until simon st john got back from hereford if youre thinking about me she felt suddenly edgy and embarrassed and delved in her bag for cigarettes im protected from above by the bishop and from further above i mean you know come in with me if you want in when we do it i dont imagine mr stock would mind i wouldnt merrily bit her lip she hadnt thought about that shed just said it she thought about it now the standard advice to deliverance ministers was to have a few good christians around at an exorcism including a second minister if possible backup what kind of christian you could call lol she had no idea but he was actually living here he actually knew gerard stock and however he felt about dogma and the clergy generally she knew by now that she could trust him all the way the car bonnet was warm under her cassock she looked at the fragmented cloud over the little church of knights frome and then back at lol he was coincidence charismatic christians like the infamous nick ellis saw every small coincidence as a pointer from god look there are two ways of looking at an exorcism of place she explained its not waste disposal pest control rentokil whatever its helping a dislocated essence spirit soul back on to the path what i mean is maybe were doing this less for gerard stock than for stewart ash whom neither of us knew every day in crematoria all over the country merrily said sadly duty clergy conduct funerals for people they never knew in front of grieving relatives theyve only just met maybe well meet him today lol looked up startled its been known for the subject of an exorcism to make one final appearance she said and then peace hi stephanie stock sprang up from the old leather sofa its really really nice to meet you at last a central ceiling lightbowl and two lamps were on in the living room at the kilnhouse it still didnt get close to summer daylight the walls had been painted white but the furniture was old and dull unexpectedly the brightest thing in the room was not the whiteshirted stock but his wife she squeezed lols hand lingering over it smiling into his eyes ive kept on saying to gerard hey bring him over i had the first hazey jane album years ago when i was at school and im just dying to know what youve been up to since its not as if i mean youre looking good lol blinked stephie stock wore a short white summer dress like a lowcut tennis frock she was considerably younger conspicuously more animated than her husband who close up was looking as worn and grey as you might expect after last night in the hop devil shes a mouse simon st john had said dismissively what other kind of woman would stock marry steph this is merrily watkins stock said this was a different stock sober and withdrawn he had raised no objections to lol being here expressed no particular surprise that lol and merrily were acquainted the feeling lol had was that stock was just relieved it wasnt simon stephanie slowly let go of lols hand running her warm slender fingers to the tips of his she looked at merrily and her wide mouth flexed into a onesided grin you know its still really strange to see a woman with the full steph was brought up a catholic stock said quickly convent girl and let me tell you you dont escape that easily stephanie said ruefully lol was studying her he still couldnt be sure he remembered that his lady of the bines had had darkish hair stringy or maybe just wet stephanies hair was golden brown shorter looked altogether healthier as did the woman herself smiling confident in essence not the keening banshee wreathed in dead bines but then nor was this the stephanie stock hed been told about coffee stephie offered beer wine merrily shook her head maybe afterwards afterwards wow this is really going to happen isnt it of course it is stock snapped then he straightened up pulling his shoulders back poor love said stephie he gets so spooked one thing about catholicism it teaches you not to be too afraid of what goes bump right look mary merrily right sorry look am i suitably dressed for this i could go up and change youll be fine merrily said i was saying to gerard earlier i dont like this kind of service to seem sinister because its basically about liberation were asking god to give you back your home and at the same time free stewarts spirit from this earth and let him go into the light in fact it could be that when weve finished youll notice a difference here what lighter lets just see what happens wow said stephie she seemed very young to lol although she had to be over thirty she still had the confidence of inexperience innocence even he couldnt understand seeing her now why shed kept such a low profile locally why neither prof nor simon had ever met her it couldnt be that stock had kept her penned up like some exotic pet she didnt seem the kind of person you could treat that way and anyway she was the one who went out to work while he stayed at home so how much time have you got merrily asked her well im currently temping for this big cardealer and its quite busy but i guess ive got two hours is that enough i mean i can phone them lets see how it goes erm stephanie ive already asked gerard but is there anything else you think i ought to know about uncle stewart about anything well not really im just im just glad youre doing this for gerard im glad someones taking him seriously but how do you feel about it how do i feel you dont seem too scared whats to be scared about hes my uncle my charming camp old uncle stew merrily smiled tentatively lol could see her dilemma trying to put them at their ease saying she didnt want it to be sinister but this girl seemed more at ease than the exorcist ok then merrily said lets make a start i want to organize some things in the kiln area what id like the two of you to do is sit quietly and think about about what this is for think about stewart think about helping stewart maybe recall some happy memories of him stock snorted mildly i can think of some stephie said good merrily beckoned to lol and gerard maybe you can think in terms of reconciliation like we talked about the airline bag was open at her feet she brought from it one flask and placed it on the table this was once a hopcrib lol observed see the crosspieces thered be like a big canvas hammock thing hanging here gosh merrily said you know your way around hops then theres a museum down the road theyve got several cribs lol sensed that merrily was less sure about all this now after meeting mrs stock he wondered if he should tell her about the lady of the bines he looked around the circular wall of old bricks some of them actually blackened by the furnace it was like being in a big chimney and nearly as dark apart from the stove and a tall juddering fridge everything in here seemed to be still hoprelated even the shelves on which crockery was piled looked old and stained ok merrily said quietly she looked around the kitchen then took down one of the coffee cups put it in the centre of the table she bent and took a small canister out of the airline bag stepped back closed her eyes lol moved away looking down at his trainers he couldnt quite believe he was doing this he felt privileged to be here but that didnt make him feel any closer to her she was the reverend watkins merrily said softly we come to bless this place and pray that the presence of god may be known and felt in it we pray that all which is evil and unclean may be driven from it as a sign of the pouring forth and cleansing of gods holy spirit which we desire for this place we use this water water has been ordained by christ for use in the sacrament of baptism she poured water from the flask into the coffee cup whispered to lol were guarding against anything else that might be around he nodded the fridge rattled lord god almighty the creator of life bless this water as we use it in faith forgive us our sins support us in sickness and protect us from the power of evil merrily made the sign of the cross opened her eyes and picked up the small canister she took off the lid salt she blessed the salt sprinkled some on the water water for purification she explained softly to lol salt representing the element of earth a formidable combination in any religion merrily stepped back from the table you up for this lol lol nodded think calm sure merrily put her right hand briefly over his her fingers were cooler than stephie stocks the light at close to noon glanced off her pectoral cross lol thought unhappily of vampires i think we can bring them in now merrily said the metaphysics it was particularly during a requiem eucharist that images of the departed had been known to appear sometimes standing next to the priest they would usually look solid and entirely natural an extra member of a select congregation sometimes as the rite was concluding they would smile gratitude the received wisdom was that the hovering essence presented with an overview and offered assistance would usually recognize the pointlessness and the tedium of haunting nine out of ten cases huw owen had told his students theyre not going to resist you theyll not fight most times youll get a welcome like an aa van at a breakdown on the m and so sometimes they appeared smiling actually this had never happened to merrily either that or she wasnt sufficiently sensitive to have noticed always nervous enough anyway before it began who was she to go dancing on the great boundary wall never never never show nerves huw owen would warn his students all the same dont let them think its a bloody tea party a balancing act then these dealings with the dead initially merrily had prepared for a requiem for stewart ash the dining table the converted hopcrib was to be her altar on it shed set out wine in a small chalice she kept in the airline bag and communion wafers in a tupperware container and then woman priests privilege shed changed her mind question of sledgehammer and nuts huw had said more than once you dont even get out the nutcrackers if you can squeeze it open between finger and thumb so she ended up telling the stocks she didnt think there were enough people here for a valid requiem not enough committed christians she didnt actually say that shed explained to them that she proposed in this first instance to offer a prayer commending the soul of stewart ash to god and maybe a prayer of penitence for his killer followed by a blessing of each room a sprinkling of holy water a eucharist for stewart would be the next step if all this proved ineffective gerard stock had nodded whatever the priest thought best stewarts book on hopgrowing still lay on the table merrily was unsure about this perhaps it should have been taken away it represented his work part of his attachment to the earth which it was now necessary to break his other known attachment had been to young men how strong was that now the pull of earthly obsession weakened but not necessarily severed by death in the otherwisesilence of the kiln the growling refrigerator was an unstable presence its noises varied and fluctuating as if it were trying to tell her something our father it remained the most powerful prayer of all an exorcism in itself this was how they all should begin how you took it from there well there was always an element of playing it by ear by sensation by perception always remembering that in the end it wasnt you doing this you were only the monkey you didnt have any powers you could only respond to signals in the kilnhouse kitchen the sun shone through as best it could the fridge still shivered the timing seemed about right nearly noon the time of no shadows nothing sinister merrily offered the prayer conversationally with only a little extra stress on the crucial line and deliver us from evil us four of them in a semicircle in this halflit brick funnel gerard stock with shoulders back eyes closed lips invisible in the beard but she knew now that those moist rosebud lips were clamped tight on gerards hidden agenda oh there was one something raging inside him like the fire in a brick furnace merrily was sensing anger and frustration made unbearable by fear even fred potter the journalist had picked up on that but fear of what exactly for ever and ever amen amen an echo from gerard stock and lol sorry stephanie giggled amen convent girl huh there was and face it it could be relevant almost certainly a problem in stocks marriage no concealing that stephanies eyes were wide open the twist of a smile on her lips not taking this seriously and not caring who knew there were perhaps twenty years between her and gerard maybe hed been slim and successful when theyd met glamorous parties cool contacts now he was looking florid and finished careerwise anyway stephanie was standing between the two men but closer to lol than to stock their shoulders sometimes even touching and stephanies was bare her strap slipping and merrily felt a stirring of whatever the emotion was she squashed it she was the priest here all right the metaphysics had the transition of stewart ash simply been too sudden merrily caught a cold shocking image of the spirit flung out flailing and struggling as the skull went crack crack crack crack on the flags an implosion of shattered bone and dying brain cells huw owen again most hauntings are imprints caused by the atmospheric shock of sudden death your imprint is no great problem a tape loop a magiclantern show its with the insomniacs and the sleepwalkers you need a bit of onetoone or was there as gerard stock had suggested a powerful residual sense of injustice because the nature of the crime had been misunderstood the wrong people convicted merrily prayed silently to understand to get a feeling of what was needed and then intoned aloud o god forasmuch as without you we are not able to please you mercifully grant that your holy spirit may in all things direct and rule our hearts through jesus christ our lord amen amen stock and lol nothing from stephanie she looked hazy suspended in the column of the midday sun next to her stock seemed dense leaden was stephie already building another life for herself away from here and where would stock be if she left him this was after all her house at this point well have a period of quiet merrily said if thats ok sure stephanies voice was crisp and stock glared at her like a disapproving father but said nothing merrily turned her face away from a collision of light beams emanating from the tiny trinity of windows and looked down at the flags where stewart ash had been taken down and then closed her eyes greyness stewart careful not to reach out for him or call him back it was about being receptive she kept her eyes shut allowing any unfocused thoughts to drift away there was a metallic shudder from the fridge then comparative quiet in her head stewart dont be afraid to let go i know its very confusing for you you must have been utterly terrified and outraged you must have felt along with the pain a terrible sense of betrayal perhaps youre still feeling that but theres no progression without forgiveness try to release your resentment the sense of injustice were with you gods with you let go please she lifted her face towards the central window now framing the full sun an orange glow through her eyelids appealing now to jesus christ to come into this place because it was always better to welcome in the light than simply drive out the darkness jesus we ask that stewart might be free of all earthly bonds free to go into the light and the warmth and the sublime reality of your eternal love she bent her head the commendation came next a call to the spirit in the name of its creator to leave this world an appeal to god to send his angels to meet stewart guide him home something told her to omit the prayers of penitence for the killers keep the killers out of this whoever they might be next the cleansing father you have overcome the power of death strengthen us now with your spirit and make us worthy to perform correctly the blessing of this home let evil spirits be put to flight and may the angel of peace enter in in the name of jesus christ our lord amen lol thought this has to be a scam but whos using who he watched the priest his friend through halfclosed eyes her hands together the tips of her fingers parallel with the bridge of her nose the pectoral cross catching the sun through the inverted v of her blacksheathed forearms doing her best for these people no scam no sham merrily if there was only stephanie stocks bare arm slid up against his own again he tried not to think about it merrily opened her eyes to a light lancing through the central window was momentarily blinded and felt an intense heat all around her as though there was still a furnace in here and the doors had been flung open she felt sweat on her forehead and a harsh rawness at the back of her throat she fought the urge to cough oh god it had caught her off guard until then thered been nothing a growing sense of anticlimax no sense at all of stewart ash now the kiln seemed claustrophobic suddenly stifling and when the fridge grated like a passing container lorry she realized what shed forgotten to do she saw lol watching her a flaring of alarm in his eyes she put a hand to her throat swallowed her throat was burning she was gasping on a stench of gunpowder and rotten eggs and the smell of cheap fireworks from when she was a kid fierce and searing as a jet from a blowlamp hot breath of hell the brimstone tray sulphur as she struggled for breath she was asking herself is this real and turning to glance at the stove in case it was pumping black smoke it wasnt then lols voice merrily his normal voice no wheezing no coughing he wasnt getting it none of the others were she began to utter in her head the lines of st patricks breastplate christ be with me christ within me hand to her mouth she crossed the room and pulled open the door leading to the hopstoreturnedlivingroom rushed in and grabbed a wooden dining chair to wedge the door open christ behind me christ before me huw owen coming through whatve you forgotten merrily huw putting them through their paces in a victorian chapel in the brecon beacons doors all of them catflaps cupboards open and wedge firmly come on its not a joke do it open and wedge open and wedge she dragged open the door of the huge old fridge a cold white bulb blinking on inside then the heavy door began to swing back on her and she pulled down two bottles of chardonnay from a shelf inside to set on the flags and wedge it open when she turned back into the room lol was moving towards her she croaked no one of them must have jogged the hopcrib table because the chalice instantly tipped over and the red wine began dribbling into the cracks in the wood why hadnt she put away the sacrament when her plan for the eucharist was shelved why hadnt she done that she snatched the flask of holy water to safety as the spilled wine dripped down and pooled in the outline of stewarts bloodstain on the flags below when she could manage to speak she said its all right not what i thought it came out both hoarse and shrill no kind of reassurance what she meant was its not stewart ash something was loose playing with her senses but it wasnt stewart grant lord she broke off and took a deep breath watching droplets of holy water from her flask twinkling in a channel of sunlit dust grant lord to all who shall work in this room that in serving others they may serve you but in her voice the recommended blessing for a kitchen sounded as potent as watered milk shed blown it shed been unprepared had come in here unforgivably as a partial sceptic her mind absorbed by something else and whatever was here had known it and gone for her and only her what is it whats here who are you she cleared her throat hands trembling around the flask she could still taste the sulphur stephanie stock was watching her amused as if storing up the whole event for a party anecdote stephies famous impression of the loopy woman who thought she was an exorcist the living room merrily asked gerard stock nodded he kept glancing at the small pool of wine on the floor now a stain on the stain coincidence coincidence but stock was sweating wet patches the size of dinner plates under each arm ive lost it merrily thought in horror ive let it through its come through me she was aware of lol watching her intently as if there were only the two of them here lol who rarely judged almost never condemned because he was a loser and a wimp hed insist stock began to lead the way into the living room she stopped him a hand on his arm gerard i think i need to go first how ridiculous that must sound from the smallest person in the place and plainly incompetent she saw stephanie suppressing a smile with difficulty and then she goes gerard i need to go first howls of laughter in the living room the only smell was a faint aroma of mould from the two heavy armchairs and the lumpy sofa merrily called on god to unite all who met therein in true friendship and love it sounded trite and hollow she saw a woodburning stove and over it a framed photograph of a younger slimmer gerard stock with two people she didnt recognize and the late paula yates bedroom of course she should already have known where it was she should have been up there already should have been all round this place through that doorway stock said and the stairs are on the left thanks the bedroom was instant vertigo lol came last up narrow wooden stairs that were not much more than a loftladder passing through where a trapdoor must once have been joining the stocks and merrily on the platform where hops had once been strewn to dry it was floorboarded now but it didnt feel safe somehow probably because you emerged gazing straight up into the apex of the big timberlined cone the witchs hat of the hopkiln all that darkstained wood rising to the windcowl someone had switched on lights metalcased bulkhead lamps bolted to the sloping walls just as well the only windows up here were like the arrow slits in a church belfry on a stormy night lol thought it would be either wildly exhilarating or terrifying weve got quite a lot to do up here yet as you can see stephie stock said as if they were potential buyers viewing the place shut up stock rasped what a turnaround bullying boisterous stock become all edgy and anxious swaggering stock turned sober and tense his back to the wall his back to stephanie and to the bed the only furniture apart from a modern sectional wardrobe its louvred doors now being flung open by merrily was a double bed without a headboard still unmade stephie went to sit on the edge crossing her legs lol was aware of a slightly sour amalgam of scents including he was fairly sure hops hoppillows maybe or the residue of millions of rustling hopcones sleep fucking hops work like rhino horn fact man me and steph were living in an old kiln walls impregnated with as much essence of hop as as the beer poor old derek cant pump my wife leaves scratches a foot long down my back the other gerard stock the one who did not bring his wife to the pub from the bed stephie gave lol a conspiratorial smile her goldenbrown hair was in provocative disarray her eyes still and knowing she was now the only one of them who appeared entirely relaxed lol smiled briefly uncomfortably turned away to look for merrily something had happened to her down there maybe just an attack of nerves and shed temporarily lost the plot and then recovered now she was moving round the sloping wall with her bottle of holy water and she looked forlorn vulnerable like a child he felt useless worse than that faithless he didnt believe this exercise was helping anyone least of all the murder victim he didnt know why they were here at all what stock was after he felt superfluous and embarrassed an extra he felt merrily was being made a fool of joke vicar he felt an irrational and unusual urge to put a stop to this melodrama demand an explanation what prof levin with style and finesse would have done ages ago only two people were taking this seriously now pressing on stand up stock said tiredly to his wife please it was clear to lol now that whether stock believed in the power of the holy spirit or not this was something he still very much wanted to happen stephie came languidly to her feet stood by the bed merrily moved into the centre of the room and they formed a small circle the boards creaking lord god our heavenly father merrily began you who neither slumber nor sleep bless this bedroom water flying again like a handful of diamonds the bedroom formally cleansed and blessed but nothing for lol seemed to have changed at the end flask in hand merrily stood at the top of the stairs her forehead was gleaming she faced the bed lord god her voice was louder now lol sensing defiance holy blessed and glorious trinity with her right hand she made the sign of the cross bless another cross hallow and again sanctify this home that in it there may be joy and gladness peace and love health and the noise came out of her surplice she drew a wretched breath and closed her eyes carried on goodness and thanksgiving always to you father son and it didnt stop it shrilled and shrilled piercing the prayer like a skewer over and over holy spirit merrilys voice shook and let your blessing rest upon this house and those who with a peal of pure joy stephanie stock reeled back on to the bed a shoulder strap slipped all the way down half uncovering a breast with two livid scratches forking up from the nipple i think youd better answer that vicar stephie squeaked convulsed it might be god the minutes after midday a brutal sun global warming so unbritish christ merrily pressed her back against the ouside brick wall shed pulled off her surplice and she buried her face in it for a moment im so so sorry these things happen stock was beside her sour with sweat i switched it off i was sure id switched it off i distinctly remember switching it off you dont understand he leaned his face into hers suddenly almost aggressive his eyes red and squinting in the full sun these things happen here they happen i thought you knew this stuff in a pocket of merrilys cassock the mobile phone went again answer it stock said go on answer it therell be nobody there i guarantee therell be nobody there dont go she said you dont have to go skirt hitched up shoes kicked off she was squatting at the top end of the bed her head back against the wooden wall she raised a hand a double click and two of the bulkhead lights went out leaving only the one over the bed still on she was very much in shadow now and there was no doubt at all any more she was from his dreams look she was reaching down now to the side of the bed then underneath a rustling remember merrily had left very quickly making the sign of the cross then almost stumbling down the stairs with her phone still screeching she couldnt seem to switch it off stock was right behind her lol making to follow until stephanie had called him sultry siren in a slippery tennis dress slipping off she glanced down at it then back at lol blinking hard as if trying to wake up he wont come back she said rapidly hell see the vicar off and then hell go to the pub drink himself stupid come crawling home in the early hours collapse on the couch like the sad pig hes become im sorry whats to be sorry about she lifted a forefinger crooking it at him baring her teeth she said something he didnt understand which began with a sibilance usha he didnt like it he started down the wooden steps it was the sound that made him look back he had to and he saw her haloed under the utility lamp fingered by the slitted sunlight garlanded again a kam mangela she was breathing hard her breath surrounding her it seemed like a chilled mist i warn you he heard dont say no to me now the voice came rolling warmly out of the phone so loud merrily had to pull it away from her ear stock heard and hmmmphed and walked away shoulders hunched hands in his pockets merrily wasnt sure id get you knew you couldnt be in church this time of day least i thought you wouldnt charlie you had lunch yet merrily charlie listen im with somebody right now oh i am sorry charlie howe said just that ive got some information for you my dear talking to brother morrell last night about this sad business with the shelbone girl and a couple of things rather clicked into place and i thought i thought you ought to know about them thats all and of course i also thought you might like some lunch well thanks but actually i dont feel too hungry i was thinking ofwell its been a complicated morning a coffee then ill be here for an hour or so yet where the green dragon in broad street if you dont manage to show up look give me a ring tonight though ill be out till quite late but you might find it worth your while ill say nmore than that all right thanks thats very good ofcharlie how did you get this number he laughed that sophie hills a hard one to crack but her armours got its weak points like everyone elses my you do sound a bit subdued girl nothing else going wrong in your life is there cant take on all the troubles of the world no she saw gerard stock walking back towards her and realized how badly she wanted to get away from here ill try and get over there ill do my best gerard stock had made an irritable circuit of the yard and as he came beefing back she saw the change at once and got in first gerard would you do something for me he looked suspicious if i give you some prayers would you be sure to say them he stared at her ive got some appropriate ones printed out in a case in the car she said id like you to say them at specific times both of you if possible if not one of you will do that going to help is it merrily for the first time he was challenging her was this because shed quite clearly messed up in there or was it because his wife was no longer with them so where is she and wheres lol it will help she assured him but id also like to come back again i think this may need more attention and more preparation than we were able to give it today you and liddle lol she sighed like i said ive known lol robinson for some time although i didnt know he was living here hes somebody i can trust thats all hes a bloody psychotherapist that why you brought him just tell me the truth no really she shook her head and hes not yet officially a therapist anyway so what was it that made up your mind im sorry what im asking he tilted his head scrutinizing her sideways is what happened liddle lady to make you decide i wasnt after all just a scheming townie trying to shaft his neighbours id never decided you were because something did happen in there didnt it she took a breath all right something happened so tell me ive got to go on living here tell me something what does sulphur mean to you why is there anything around here that might or might once have released sulphur fumes not now not any more meaning what he shrugged ill show you she followed him back into the kitchen the gloom seemed at once oppressive or was she imagining that he went straight to the wall where the implements hung brought down a short pole with what looked like an ashpan from a stove or grate attached he sniffed at it cant smell anything now he thrust it towards her can you what is it was known im told as a brimstone tray used for feeding rolls of sulphur into the furnace whyd they do that some sort of fumigation it also apparently made the drying hops turn yellow which the brewers preferred for some reason made the beer look even more like piss i dont know i dont think they do it any more would sulphur have any special interest for stewart ash can you think of youre saying you smelled sulphur quite powerfully he tilted his head again fire and brimstone merrily that was what it smelled like could be argued it was subjective i suppose oh subjective stock held the wooden shaft of the brimstone tray with both hands like a spade theres a good psychologists word why dont we ask lol what he thinks like you said things are inclined to go awry in there a few minor elements which when you put them together suggest a volatile atmosphere not necessarily connected with the murder of stewart ash volatile i would like to come back mr stock she saw lol in the doorway what about tonight to do what there are quite a few things stock hurled the brimstone tray to the stone with cacophonous force merrily flinched but didnt move things we can still try you dont really know what the fuck youre doing do you stock snarled lol walked in no geddout both of you stock picked up the chalice and the tupperware box of communion wafers shoved them in the airline bag tossed the bag to the flags near merrilys feet youre a waste of time merrily i heard you were a political appointment merrily bit her lip been better off with the fucking arsebandit stock said well lol picked up the bag this is actually quite reassuring for a while back there i was almost convinced youd been possessed by the spirit of a nice man stock looked at him silently then back at merrily he was waiting for them to go merrily paused at the door id like to come back if not me then someone else geddout stock said barnchurch merrily charlie howe stood up tossing his telegraph to one of the tables in the hotel reception area he was wearing a creased cream suit and a yellow tie with the lipsticked impression of a womans red lips printed on it as though it had been kissed he looked genuinely delighted to see her putting an arm around her shoulders he steered her into the coffee lounge what a job youve got girl devils and demons on a wonderful summers day shed shed the cassock was back in the tshirt how dyou know i wasnt doing a wedding contacts charlie tapped his long leathery nose sophiell be mortified when mrs hill wouldnt tell me where you were look nigh on forty years of being a detective told me a wedding wasnt an option smart pathetic more like he pointed to a window table over there fine she followed him why pathetic cause i miss it of course they sat down dont let any retired cid man tell you he dont miss it im even jealous of my own daughter im jealous of your daughter merrily said ambivalently charlie laughed and patted her wrist scones he said i feel like some scones you dont diet do you my whole jobs a diet scones my love he called to the waitress before shed even made it to the table lashings of jam and heaps of fresh cream and coffee just spring water for me please charlie im afraid i dont have very long im sorry she and lol were due to meet at the deliverance office in the gatehouse at five lol had said he had things to tell her but neither of them had wanted to hang around knights frome it was a blessing in merrilys view that someone like lol had been there seen the way it had gone the two faces of gerard stock we better get down to it then charlie said brother shelbone he clicked his tongue not wrong about that one were you merrily as for the little lass little lass he looked pained give me some credit girl this suicidal shelbone child and that kiddie getting messages from her dear dead mother courtesy of allan henrys stepdaughter one and the same or what you never retired at all did you i tell you my sweet said charlie howe the longer you live in this little county the more you wonder how anybody manages to keep anything a secret there are connections acrisscrossing here that you will not believe really she was very lucky mind the child the version i heard the mother only found out because shed got a headache herself and saw the aspirins were down to about three in the bottom of the jar another halfhour and your colleague over in dilwyn wouldve had a very sad funeral i didnt know that no cry for help this one kiddie mustve been messed up bigtime you were dead right and brother morrell was dead wrong out of touch he didnt know the full circumstances nor wanted to merrily nor wanted to i tell you another thing nobody who was at the christmas fairs likely to forget that girl of allan henrys jesus christ no he looked suddenly appalled oh i am sorry easy to forget what you do reverend when youre out of uniform doesnt offend me charlie long as its not gratuitous keeps his name in circulation charlie howe raised both eyebrows the scones arrived put plenty of jam on charlie said youll be needing the blood sugar then on to david shelbone got to admire him really charlie said sticks his neck out for what he believes you know anything about listed buildings i live in one so you do frozen in the year i pray we never get an inspection because my daughters created what she calls the mondrian walls in her attic all the squares of nice white plaster and whatever between the beams are now painted different colours good example charlie said most listedbuildings officers would let that one go because you can always paint them over again in white brother shelbone forget it a stickler told one of our lady councillors she had to take down a conservatory porch shed put on her farmhouse when the good councillor tries to square it with the department under the table it gets leaked to the press red faces all round thats david shelbone staunch christian not for sale and thats bad is it charlie grinned oh its not bad its good its remarkable and thats the point in the world of local government a very religious man who cannot tell a lie or condone dishonesty of any kind is remarkable meaning a pain in the bum correct it was widely thought that when the councils were all reorganized hed get mislaid as it were in the changeover but he survived he looks after the old places makes sure nobody knocks them down or tampers with them hazel shelbone in the church they offered him early retirement last year but he said he wouldnt know what to do with himself merrily licked jam from a finger his wife indicated hed been under some pressure migraines hazel had explained maybe thats not been a happy household for a while she didnt look at charlie howe helped herself to a second scone anything said to her by mrs shelbone ought to be treated as confidential on the other hand charlie expected give and take after forty years in the police and now local government it would be how his mind worked pressure he said oh no question about that brother shelbones under serious pressure over barnchurch alone the new trading estate up past belmont source of much weeping and gnashing of teeth charlie confirmed well it looks awful merrily said there was a time not too many years ago when hereford used to resemble a country town i mean do we really need a supermarket every couple of hundred yards diy world computerland its like some kind of commercial purgatory between rural paradise and traffic hell my my charlie added cream to his coffee nothing personal he leaned back hands clasped behind his head what do you know about the origins of barnchurch the history of the site fields and woodland home to little birds and animals gethyn bonner you know about him not a thing thought youd know about gethyn bonner he was a preacher came up from the valleys in the s sometime like that ten a penny merrily said with a small smile tell a few of my colleagues that tell english heritage im not following gethyn bonner was an itinerant firebrand preacher with a big following who came out of merthyr tydfil and decided hereford was the land of milk and honey as you do charlie drank some coffee hadnt got a chapel of his own but a good christian farmer name of leathem baxter had a barn to spare a few local worthies including a craftsman builder all gathered round and they put a big gothic window in the back wall and in no time at all leathem baxters barn was a bona fide church barnchurch exactly well in time gethyn bonner falls out of favour as these fellers are apt to do and moves on up to birmingham or back to the valleys i wouldnt know which and leathem baxter dies and the church becomes a barn again and the gothic window gets bricked up and its all forgotten until the third millennium comes to pass and lo there came property developers said merrily barnchurch trading estate phase one should be completed in time for christmas shopping phase two however thats the problem nothing in its way except a derelict agricultural building not very old victorian brick and falling to bits i see merrily poured some spring water well even before work started on phase one the developers had been assured by the hereford planners that thered be no bar at all to flattening this unsightly structure which as it happens also blocks the only practical entrance to the site of phase two reckoning of course without brother shelbone suddenly i like him a lot who helpfully points out that although the building itself is of limited architectural merit and not in fact very old its historical curiosity value makes it a monument well meriting preservation its fair enough merrily said they shouldve consulted him before they started charlie leaned forward merrily nobody in their right mind consults david shelbone they just pray hes otherwise engaged at the time brother shelbone gets involved its gonner cost you time and money and the stress factor so hes put a preservation order on the barnchurch can he do that on his own what he does is gets it spotlisted it then goes to the council with a report and a recommendation from shelbone well this is seen as a very significant project with considerable economic benefits for the city and the council by a small majority goes against the advice of the listed buildings officer and declares that the barnchurch can be flattened i dont remember reading about this in the papers charlie smiled thinly the authority has a certain leeway these days to conduct business not considered to be in the public interest less publicly which stinks of course but is quite legitimate anyway david shelbone isnt a man to be put off by petty local tyranny he goes directly to the body responsible for conservation of historic buildings english heritage and they step in so then which way did you vote charlie just so we know where we are charlie howe grinned whipped cream on his teeth i abstained of course ah didnt really think i knew enough about the issue why do i find that hard to believe so can english heritage overrule the hereford council not just like that itll have to go to central government for a decision because what had happened see was that the developers had already lodged an appeal contesting the scheduling of an old heap of bricks as a building of historical merit therell be a public inquiry before an inspector from the department of culture or the ministry of artyfarty timewasters as one of my colleagues likes to call them which will take time to organize i suppose months and months and then more months waiting for a decision even if they get the green light at the end of the day its going tove cost the developers a vast amount of money what with all the delays and their contracts with prestigious national chains on the line in the meantime some of those firms are bound to go elsewhere the situation is that barnchurch phase twos already looking like a financial disaster on a serious scale and all because of one man you got it who are the developers merrily asked firm called arrow valley commercial properties merrily shook her head not heard of them subsidiary of allan henry homes said charlie you with me now merrily put down her scone charlie howes arms were folded she studied his face tanned the colour of lightly polished yew she knew very little about him either as a councillor or a former senior policeman but if she had to guess why he was going out of his way to feed her controversial information she wouldnt get far beyond the fact that he clearly enjoyed causing trouble stirring the pot gosh she said you talk for a bit and ill listen charlie glanced around youre all right no witnesses well phew where do we start david shelbone may well have got himself crossed off allan henrys corporate christmascard list charlie poured himself more coffee you ever actually come across allan henry merrily he doesnt go to my church hes an ambitious man and a very lucky man thingsve fallen his way just a moderately successful smalltime housebuilder for quite a few years then his horizons got rapidly wider took over colin connellys little workshop development beyond holmer when colin had his accident and then things started falling into his hands a few slightly iffy green belt schemes but he got them through one way or another erm would you say he found success in ways that might have interested you in your former occupation charlie howe said very slowly i am saying nothing that might incriminate any of my colleagues on the council i see said merrily charlie drank the rest of his second cup of coffee so david shelbone could be getting in quite a few peoples hair i think i said as much earlier why are you telling me all this he cupped his hands over his eyes and nose rubbed for a moment before bringing them down in the praying position got nobody else to tell any more he said last thing annie wants is the old man on her back most of the people i mix with well you never know quite who youre talking to do you what happened to your to annies mother oh it was a police marriage average life expectancy five years better nowadays actually now there are plenty of professional women around so you can take up with one who understands all about funny shifts and latenight callouts and having to cancel your fortnight in ibiza because youre giving evidence at worcester crown court back then it was this huge majority of fulltime housewives and mothers who didnt understand at all im sorry he grinned dont be bloody sorry vicar ive had a lot more fun in twentyfive unencumbered years than i had with her anyway i met you there at the school and i liked your attitude and i thought we were likely to be on the same wavelength on certain matters and then that little girl taking the overdose that rather clinched it well thanks i dont much like brother henry he said i dont like him as a businessman or as as a man because because well hes ruthless and hes vindictive for starters the rest id need to think about and layla riddocks not even his daughter he brought her up though charlie said didnt he i dont know me neither really i dont know how long he and shirley riddock have been together but it makes you think dont it just he mustve been very disappointed when certain people failed to persuade david shelbone to take early retirement merrily broke off a small piece of scone and then put it back on the plate oh hell this is getting ridiculous nothings ridiculous said charlie howe hello merrily looked up a man had come in through reception and was walking directly towards their table well well charlie said merrily recognized andy mumford hereford division cid being promoted to detective sergeant in the twilight of his career must have given him new heart because hed lost weight sadly it had made him look even more lugubrious andrew mumford as i live and breathe charlie beamed but didnt stand up this your local now then boy in keeping with your newfound status hello boss mumford said heavily dropped in for some career advice is it stick it as long as you can id say half these socalled security jobs youre just a glorified caretaker have a seat i wont thank you boss in fact it was actually mrs watkins i was looking for well you can study for the ministry up to the age of sixty merrily told him but at the end of it caretakers still earn more money mumford didnt smile mrs watkins mr howes daughter and my er governor would like it a lot if you could come to her office for a discussion oh she sat up surprised ok i mean just give me half an hour because i do need to pop over to my office first no mrs watkins mumford said if you could come with me now only somebodys going to be waiting for me you see if its mr robinson you mean mumford said weve already collected him at the gatehouse mumfords unmarked car was parked in one of the disableddriver spaces at the top of broad street he drove merrily across town and entered the police car park from the gaol street side it was the pleasantest time of day layered in shades of summer blue mumford didnt have much to say hed evidently been warned not to spoil the surprise but hed said enough annie howe had been given a new office merrily couldnt remember how they reached it she didnt notice what colours the walls were she didnt remember if theyd taken the stairs or the lift she felt like she was walking on foam rubber through some bare grey forest in the wintry hinterland of hell howes office door was pushedto not quite closed they could hear voices from inside mumford knocked no answer he pushed it a little maam inside the room was dim the window blinds pulled down merrily could see a tv set switched on the picture on the screen looked down at a group of people standing about awkwardly looking at each other as if they didnt know what to do next oom a woman said one of the others a man nodded and walked across the screen and out of shot better wait here a moment mrs watkins mumford said on the tv screen nobody moved for a second or two then a woman much shorter followed the man the sound was not very good with lots of hiss you could hear the voice although you couldnt see who was speaking the voice said awkwardly gerard i think i need to go first poppies in the snow sit down merrily annie howe switched off the tv she went over to the window and reeled up the blind revealing a small yard and the back of the old magistrates court it was possibly the first time shed said merrily rather than ms watkins using the first name the way police talked to suspects patronizing to make them feel lowly and vulnerable right now it was entirely superfluous merrily sat in an armless chair one with aluminium legs she felt sick wishing shed said no to the scones and to gerard stock the last time she and annie howe had been face to face howe had said i dont know how you people can pretend to do your job at all to me its a complete fantasy world merrily put her hands on her knees wheres lol robinsons being interviewed separately by inspector bliss frannie bliss if you only knew howe said how badly im wishing there was something i could charge you with she was in white blouse black skirt her ashblonde hair was tied back she was wearing maybe a little eyeshadow mauvish if shed worn glasses they would doubtless have been rimless like a nazi dentists janes line merrily thought there is absolutely nothing i can tell this woman that shes going to believe she bit her lower lip the whole office was painted butchersshop white there were no plants no photographs the calendar did not have a picture it was framed in a metal box and you expected it to have ten days in a week ten months in a year andy mumford sat in the corner by the door presumably in case merrily should try to do a runner still annie howe said i suppose by the time you leave here youll at least be in a better position to assess your own degree of responsibility she ejected the videotape from the machine at some point you and i will have to watch it all the way through to verify certain points did you know you were being recorded no it never even occurred to me two cameras howe went to sit behind her desk which was away from the limited distraction of the window semiprofessional one digital one hieight both of them wedged between timbers in the ceiling its a fairly primitive ceiling with small holes and gaps all over it so all he had to do was prise up a couple of boards in the bedroom and position the cameras underneath one wideangle one focused on the table why do you think he wanted it all on tape i dont know of the suggestions so far the most likely is that he may have been planning to make the material available for some future television documentary im told hes always looking to the main chance perhaps lets not overestimate the mans intelligence perhaps he thought he might even capture something looking vaguely paranormal mediaoriented i suppose hes a professional pr man really according to people in the village hes a washedup drunk he wasnt drunk when i was with him merrily said no amazingly he wasnt so you didnt even hear the cameras one was quite old and noisy there was a big fridge which made a lot of noise if i heard anything i would have assumed it came from that howe thought for a moment expressionless it was hard to credit she was probably only thirtytwo years old doesnt seem to have been a very successful exorcism does it ms watkins or are they always like that theyre all different in my limited experience but no it wasnt as productive as i might have hoped depending on how one interprets the word productive merrily winced what time did you leave im not sure exactly it couldnt have been long after midday id suggested we might go back tonight he didnt seem to take that proposal terribly well no merrily was looking down into her lap her hands were on her knees but they wouldnt stay still my impression from the tape is that hed about had enough of you yes he described you as amateurish i remember exactly what he said you and robinson left at the same time yes where did you go i drove back to hereford i had an appointment to meet someone at the green dragon who you know who your dad why why dont you ask him im asking you it was in his capacity as a school governor he rang me while i was at knights frome to tell me he had some information relating to an attempted suicide by a young girl whose parents thought she was spiritually troubled howes top lip lifted in disdain and was this attempted suicide before or after you were called in to assist this child in her alleged religious distress merrily didnt answer really not your week is it did you go directly to the green dragon no i went to the deliverance office first i parked on the bishops palace forecourt which as you know is only a couple of minutes walk from the green dragon was robinson with you he followed in his own car we had a brief discussion and then i had to go and meet your father lol and i agreed to meet up afterwards she shook her head cant get myi cant believe how quickly this all happened if its any help the videotape shows that it happened precisely eleven minutes and fourteen seconds after you and robinson made your last appearance on the tape useful that videotape merrily moistened her parched lips from our point of view its unique like being handed a case giftwrapped with a pretty bow on top howe stood up looking down on merrily we can even say that it was approximately sixteen minutes after the event itself when gerard stock telephoned here asked to be put through to cid and baldly informed dc little that hed just slaughtered his wife it was an interview room with a tape machine for suspects and that didnt help di francis bliss was about lols age with red hair a merseyside accent and a chatty manner and that didnt help either it all took lol back to when he was twenty a baby rock star the accused so hard to tell with young girls these days isnt it laurence how old did you think she was stitched up by the police and a ruthless bassplayer called karl and by the parents of a nice girl called tracy cooke prelude to the great psychiatric symphony listen im gonna get yer another cup of tea di bliss said im all right thanks youre not you know youre in shock be a shock for anybody bliss perched on a corner of the interview table sorry about this room but im not based here so ive not gor an office of me own known merrily long just over a year and you two just met up in the village this morning after not seeing each other for a few months and she told you what she was doing and she asked you to go in with her yeh i know that sounds bliss put out placatory hands im not trying to catch yer out lol im just trying to get the basic picture thats all i was worried about her doing it lol said because of what you knew about mr stock lol nodded thats fair enough idve been a teensy bit worried meself after reading that stuff in the papers and the local vicar himself refusing to have anything to do with him it was the vicar who suggested i should try and talk her out of it was it now he was suspicious of stocks motives but merrily doesnt like to prejudge people shes a very nice person bliss agreed fervently i was there during that thing back before christmas at oh what was that little church called anyway she was giving it a spiritual cleanout after this bugger broke in and hacked up a crow all over the altar she wasnt very well that night mind i wasnt there she was with this priest looked like an old hippy hugh somebody he took it over in the end cause she wasnt well bliss had a gulp from a can of diet pepsi see unlike the snow queen in there ive gorra very open mind about all that stuff comes with being raised a catholic in a big catholic city youre a christian yourself obviously im not sure what i am lol admitted just a good friend of merrilys then lol bliss put down the can listen pal i do know a bit about what happened to you way back and i accept you mayve had a bad time with coppers in the past but i do like merrily and i fully understand the problem shed got with this guy and i know its her job and i realize that after that stuff in the papers there was no way she could duck out of it no so youve gorra believe me when i say im not trying to stitch her up im not trying to stitch either of yer up its just weve got a feller down the cells putting up both hands to the big one and before we start talking seriously to him we want as much background as we can get make sense to you lol nodded he decided that for merrilys sake more than his own maybe he should open up a little to this cop to a point a point stopping well short of the lady of the bines sorry he said i just youre all right pal take your time truth is i was on edge from the minute we went in there i mean i didnt think not in a million years that the guy was going to do anything like goes without saying but everybody whod had anything to do with stock was on about what a conman he was and a manipulator and how hed drop you in it without a second thought also id seen him in the village pub a couple of times when he was well pissed had a big chip on his shoulder about this bloke adam lake virtually suggesting he was behind stewart ashs murder rather than the two lads who went down for it lets not open that can of worms for the time being eh lol i was just worried he might try and involve merrily in that how i dont know but she doesnt like to turn away from anyone so what was he like when you and merrily went along today not himself i mean he couldntve been nicer why was that you reckon well it might have been genuine maybe he was serious about needing an exorcism and he didnt want to put her off or make her suspicious that was what i started to think but now i suppose thatd be for the tape wouldnt it like if he was videoing the thing hed want to appear on it as a sincere and honest man genuinely concerned about what was happening in his house thats a good point lol bliss thought about it mind he wasnt being very appreciative at the end was he when he threw yer out but hed got it all in the camera by then hadnt he everything that counted the deliverance stuff he could just have wiped the end of the tape afterwards true whyd he turn nasty you reckon apart from his wifes attitude i dont think there was anything apart from that stephanie started taking the piss so stock took it out on merrily bliss nodded certainly the times you see him looking at her you can tell hes trying to keep his temper or something but then she was a lot younger than him and clearly not too worried at being in a haunted house or was that bravado she was a catholic like you protected she said earlier maybe before we went into the kitchen that she didnt think uncle stewart would do her any harm oh were not scared of ghosts us catholics bliss blew out his lips news to me how did merrily react to the wife tried to ignore it just carried on a true professional a good person lol said doing the best she could youre fond of her arent you bliss smiled who wouldnt be eh lol said you havent told me exactly what he did how he killed her lol looked at bliss pale skin freckles an unusually small nose what happened when you all went upstairs lol well just lol had a terrifying thought the only cameras in the bedroom were the ones under the floorboards pointing downwards but suppose their microphones had picked up the voices from above during merrilys blessing of the upstairs room and during what happened afterwards when merrily had followed stock downstairs if there was anything on the tape the quality would be terrible but they could work on that someone like prof levin could clean up the thinnest of recordings just more or less what happened in the kitchen he said with different words he could tell bliss about stephies implicit invitation but it sounded too incredible unless you knew about the lady of the bines incident which hed also kept quiet about which he hadnt even told merrily about lol blanked it out he was terrible at coverups he would look furtive hed sweat bliss said nothing happened up there you think might throw more light not not that i can think of you wanna see the tape lol not really dont blame yer but i think youre gonna have to i think were gonna have to take the both of you through it im sorry bliss thought for a moment then sighed look all right ill be frank wid yer hes not saying a lot stock in fact the buggers not saying a thing wont see a solicitor wont make a formal statement just sits there like some bloody big buddha but he phoned you to confess oh aye when we get there he hands us the videos looking relieved if anything he wont talk about it though wont explain thats why you and merrily are so important to us at the moment i see dont tell the snow queen i told you that annie howe said have you heard of the case of michael taylor yes shes loving this merrily thought a case on a plate me in the toaster she was desperate for a cigarette but she wouldnt give howe the satisfaction she was also desperate for silence somewhere to collapse and think and if necessary scream nothing made any sense nothing had made sense for days she felt a welling hatred for gerard stock and a bitterness towards simon st john who had known enough to shut the door in his face happened near barnsley in yorkshire howe was back behind her desk in the midseventies i know most of the details because of the pseudosatanist person we found in the wye last year i called up some background on satanism and related issues and this case was the first to come up on the screen merrily closed her eyes and inhaled on an imaginary cigarette this was one of huws cautionary favourites which howe would just love relating michael taylor was thirtyone a good christian a family man and a member with his wife of some local religious group at some point for reasons ive never found entirely understandable he came to believe hed been taken over by the devil howe had a set of files on her desk she opened one and extracted a cellophane folder two church ministers agreed that taylor appeared to be possessed by evil and they spent all night trying to exorcize him claiming to have expelled i think forty demons the statistical exactitude here obviously adding important credibility to what most people might consider an inexact science however taylor left the priests early the following morning went home i know merrily screwed up her eyes in anguish i know what he did theres no need to he went home and with incredible savagery attacked his wife with his bare hands yes he tore at her skin ripped out her tongue and her eyes merrily leaned her head back stared at the ceiling eventually she choked to death on her own blood howe said and taylor claimed in his statement to police merrilys voice was starved she couldnt look at howe that he loved his wife very much but there was an evil inside her that had to be destroyed not i think its fair to say the churchs finest hour exorcism of a person is a complex and dangerous process merrily said but this this case wasnt anything like that wasnt it it wasnt an exorcism i made that completely clear to mr stock from the start i even decided to hold off the customary requiem eucharist because it might look too much like christian magic it was prayer thats all prayer as the first stage in dealing with a suspected spiritual presence there being no reason to suspect any demonic infestation lets go back to taylor howe said found not guilty by a jury for reasons of insanity caused quite a stir didnt it what should be said about that verdict although michael taylor had been by all accounts a friendly and popular man with no history of violence nobody not the judge nor the jury nor the media seemed prepared even to consider that he might actually have been possessed by a metaphysical evil he was considered insane to howe the difference between insanity and possession would be indiscernible his mental decline appears to have coincided with his taking up membership of a christian group his recourse to almost unimaginable violence immediately followed his socalled exorcism by two christian ministers isnt that true merrily could only nod knowing now where this was going a goods train with a toxic cargo inexorably picking up speed and nothing she could do to stop it howe was still flipping through the file on her desk im trying to find what the local bishop said at the time i can tell you more or less exactly what he said here we are exorcism is a type of ministry which is increasingly practised in christian churches there is no order of service for this it is administered as the situation demands clearly a form of ministry which must be exercised with the greatest possible care and responsibility but this was not ms watkins the tape clearly shows the sacrament laid out on your impromptu altar and the sprinkling by you of water which i assume is what you regard as holy water the sacrament wasnt even used it was annie howe wasnt listening she was back into the report flipping pages yes the taylor case was also commented on by the then archbishop of canterbury donald coggan who said i quote we must get this business out of the mumbojumbo of magic i do not see exorcism as something set off against and in opposition to medicine far from it i think there are many cases where the more rash exorcists have bypassed the work of psychiatrists howe looked up partly as a result i believe of the taylor case there was a reexamination by the church of the usefulness of exorcism and how such disasters might be avoided in the future as a result the guidance now to exorcists is that they should always work with community psychiatric resources is that correct ms watkins before an exorcism is carried out on an individual its recommended that they should be seen by a psychiatrist to make sure they arent for instance schizophrenic yes and when an exorcism takes place its advised that a qualified psychiatrist should be present is that correct merrily sighed yes howe rearranged the papers in the report applied a paper clip and slipped them into the folder she smiled pleasantly at merrily so is your idea of deploying community psychiatric resources in carrying out a ritual that might loosely be described as mumbo jumbo at the behest of a notoriously unstable possibly alcoholic individual to take along with you thats not what take along with you as your expert medical consultant a former psychiatric patient with a police record you stay the fuck away from me stock screamed you do not come near me he was backing into shot his shirt had come out of his trousers the sweat patches under his arms were the size of hihat cymbals lol thought and it was all so beautifully bright this was what video did it compensated for the conditions clear and clinical then even if the quality was not great bliss had said these were quickly made vhs copies of the two originals the one they were looking at was wideangle evidently shot from a camera position just above the fridge the constant picture included all of the table and an area of flagged floor about three feet around it on the table were stewart ashs book on hopgrowing and a wine stain frannie bliss froze the tape i think boss that this bit gives the lie to the theory that this whole thing was like some big theatrical production that he even had an idea how it was gonna end whatever shes doing now you can tell hes not expecting it not necessarily dci howe said we cant even see stephanie at this point we dont know that shes doing anything she might not even be there this could be part of his act hed have to be bloody good bliss started up the tape again stock was shaking he just stood there trembling almost fullface to the camera his beard was shiny with sweat and spittle the fridge noise was rumbling out of the tv speaker lol thought of rocks before an avalanche he thought of stock in the seconds before hed spouted a gutful of sour beer over adam lake he prayed that both stock and his wife would be out of shot when the killing happened if i didnt know the circumstances id say he was shitscared bliss said what would he be scared of merrily what could she be doing that would put the fear of god into him i couldnt give an opinion on that merrilys voice was all dried out were looking for ideas thats all bliss said doesnt have to be a thesis merrily had been placed near the covered window dci howe standing next to her chair like the angel of death theyd brought lol into the room but only just seating him near the door between frannie bliss and the other detective mumford he couldnt even exchange glances with merrily not saying much is she young stephanie bliss said she still taking the piss is she taunting him you reckon whats she doing lol what dyou reckon lol said nothing why should bliss think he would know had he given something away with a reaction an expression had merrily told them that lol and stephanie had been alone together upstairs not long before the killing bearing in mind that her body was unclothed bliss said when we found her i dont lol was thinking of stock that first night in the pub derek the landlord must certainly have overheard when stock had said my wife leaves scratches a foot long down my back stock implied that his wife was highly sexed lol said he talked about it in the pub a few nights ago boasting kind of hes not looking too turnedon now is he there was a movement on the screen stock reaching up to the wall recognize that thing ms watkins yes its a hopcutters hook it was part of stewart ashs collection of hopfarmers implements stock said breaking off because stock had walked out of shot again carrying the hook lol had seen enough both howe and bliss had gone quiet and were watching the screen there was nothing to see there now but stone flags a curving brick wall and a table with a book on it the fridge was going whump whump whump irregular as though its metal heart was about to fail after about a minute there arose from somewhere in the house perhaps everywhere in the house this cavernous animal bellow mingling with its own echo and the sound of the fridge rage and terror lol thought numbed then only the sound of the fridge what were you about to say ms watkins howe asked mildly as if the tv was merely screening some corny old melodrama theyd all seen many times before what did stock say he told me hed sharpened it himself merrilys voice was flat he said that because of what had happened to uncle stewart hed become afraid of someone breaking in at night and so he he wanted to be ready on the tv screen flags table book the only sound was the fridge frannie bliss said delicately i wouldnt think theres any particular need for merrily to watch any more would you boss lol heard merrily saying he said it might seem ridiculous but he just didnt trust the countryside boss bliss said plaintively do you really think this is annie howe didnt reply lol was still hearing but he just didnt trust the countryside repeated like a loop in his head when gerard stock walked casually back into the kitchen he wasnt carrying the hopcutters hook any more the picture quality was crisp and suddenly very pleasant the midday sun throwing a bright path from the middle window across the flags creating a golden alley into it gerard stock the stains on his white shirt as startling as poppies in the snow put down stephanies head part three if a terrible crime has been committed in the area especially if justice has not been properly carried out the disturbances will be potentially very unpleasant the entity is inflamed by a combination of fear and anger for the injustice it feels has been committed against it if a person believes that they have been especially wrongfully treated they may be inspired to curse the individual who they blame or else the locality in which the wrongful action has taken place martin israel exorcism the removal of evil influences being lost traffic had faded the shops and the city library were all well closed broad street was cooling into torpid evening and the trees were draping long shadows over the cathedral green inside the gatehouse merrily sipped tea the colour of engine oil not tasting it furrows of concern on sophies forehead were dislodging strands of her fine white hair i mean what was the woman trying to do to you doesnt matter merrily watched a man aiming a camera up at the gatehouse just the one camera not very big a tourist then it would be the real thing soon enough the pack unleashed she probably did the right thing in the circumstances until we saw the video i dont think i quite believed it thought maybe i was being set up or that hed told them hed killed her but he hadnt not really she was probably right to show us i shouldnt have gone in with you lol said theyd both had to make full statements which had taken another hour and a half it isnt as if i was any use in there the three of them were hunched close to the window as if putting on lights might draw the eyes of the world siege mentality already sophie looked at lol mr robinson were you posing as a qualified psychotherapist when you went into the kiln with merrily merrily smiled wanly hes not good at posing even if he was qualified youd never get him to admit it quite sophie said so theres no real argument is there a neither of you was suggesting that mr robinson was there to fulfil the psychiatric or psychological function b this was a minor exorcismofplace for which a psychiatrist would hardly in normal circumstances be considered essential anyway thats not how its going to read though is it lol said the fact remains sophie told him severely that for reasons of her own resentment religious antipathy whatever else detective chief inspector howe is fabricating a spurious scenario it doesnt matter merrily almost howled a mans murdered his wife would that still have happened if i hadnt gone there and done what i did possibly but possibly not and possibly not is enough to hang me but more than that just dont hang yourself first lol said you know really that you didnt have a choice more than that ive got to live with the killing of a young woman and the inference the increasingly strong inference that it it doesnt work or when i do it it doesnt work dont be stupid sophie snapped so what do you think gods telling me look sophie raised a finger if if any one person can be said to carry any blame here and i dont necessarily accept that anyone should then it has to be the reverend simon st john doesnt it whatever st john knew about stock to convince him to stay out of it he kept it to himself you dont understand merrily lit a cigarette and for once sophie didnt frown i was approaching this right on top of the amy shelbone issue oh merrily that no look merrily glanced apologetically at lol ill explain this properly sometime but in essence i was being accused of not responding to a situation with sufficient effectiveness following which a young girl tried to take her own life sophie hissed exasperated for heavens sake merrily dennis beckett look at the facts heres me driving down to stocks place this morning with a head full of amy shelbone and like totally insufficient background about stocks own problem in fact not really believing he has a problem and then while talking to him and coming to realize there is a situation am i not then subconsciously thinking god i cant underplay this one as well less concerned with finding out what the hells going on than with covering myself was i she stopped realizing her speech was becoming swollen by sobs and aware of sophie getting decisively to her feet drink your tea merrily pull yourself together through a film of tears she saw sophie walking over to the door beckoning lol to follow her sophie hill almost dragged him down the stone stairs her expression was taut and her eyes were like grey stones in the halflight mr robinson i dont know what your current relationship with merrily is but i think youll agree that what we need to do now is get her out of here before she does or says something from which therell be no going back lol nodded bewildered anything i can do anything sophie took his arm led him to the foot of the steps and even then kept her voice low i was very much playing it down in there as you probably realized lol nodded he instinctively liked sophie wished she didnt have to keep calling him mr robinson this is actually rather grim she opened the door leading out to the stone archway we both know that the press and the church of england are going to hang merrily out to dry and if she thinks shes in any way at fault she wont even fight back he remembered merrily in howes office what he could see of her cowed shattered in any situation she always tends to feel responsible all right sophie said lets examine the situation first i cant see them charging stock with murder tonight can you not unless hes had a change of heart and given them a full statement they wont charge him even then not immediately and you know what that means gives the press free rein to rake over the story they go back to the original piece in the people and they find that quote from merrily saying shes going to be looking into it carefully and theyll want to know if she ever did and whatever answer they get will be the wrong one if she didnt actually do anything the church was being fatally neglectful and if they find out the truth merrilys dog food lol said sophie stood in the gatehouse doorway gazing through the stone arch towards the bishops palace yard an elegant whitehaired englishwoman with a cardigan draped over her shoulders formidable i dont know how much you know about the church of england mr robinson but i can tell you with some authority that like any large secular organization its essentially selfserving and selfprotective lol said nothing it was hardly a revelation for the church its going to be more than merrily on trial its the credibility of the entire deliverance ministry arguably one of the few dynamic arms we have left they may not even try to defend her simply wash their hands of it all theyll have an inquiry at the end of which theyll agree that she behaved in an arbitrary fashion reacted too quickly disregarded the guidelines failed to take advice can they throw her out of the church sophie looked him in the eyes with what you know of merrily watkins would they need to merrily stood at the window staring down at the evening light on broad street stephanie stocks severed head lay in the middle of the road she wondered when stephanies head would no longer be visible everywhere she looked with its smile slashed to doublewidth and one of its eyes fully open and the other one missing in fact she realized that she and lol must have been spared the worst theyd only seen stocks video the polices own footage while it might have less narrative tension would be far more explicit shed heard frannie bliss and andy mumford talking in the corridor and so she knew that stephanie had not died by having her head cleanly cleaved off like anne boleyn but that stock had gone at her at the bottom of the stairs like some barbaric dark age butcher this had happened immediately in the wake of what the papers would inevitably describe as an exorcism a botched exorcism howe hadnt exactly been concealing the existence of stocks video its contents would inevitably be leaked and had this supposed exorcism it would be asked brought out something savagely malevolent long dormant inside gerard stock it wouldnt matter that unlike michael taylor stock had not been personally exorcized no induced convulsions no speaking in guttural tongues no green bile no out demons out wouldnt matter that it had been simply a modest entreaty to god for the stocks home to become dwellerfriendly again merrilys fists tightened how could that possibly cause a man to go into a murderous rage how could it it wouldnt matter tell her to throw some holy water around and leave by the back door she wondered if bernie dunmore would even remember saying that the phone rang she turned slowly perhaps this was bernie himself fresh from the conference on transsexuality and the church disturbing gossip having reached him while he sat nursing his single malt in the bar of gloucesters swishest casually approached by some journalist perhaps as he debated with the bishop of durham how best to react to an archdeacons new breasts she started to laugh and let the phone go on ringing a clattering on the stairs sophie rushed in dont touch that wasnt going to sophie sat down behind her desk took two calming breaths and picked up the phone diocese of hereford bishops palace sophie hill speaking lol came in looking a little brighter sophie could do this dont depress merrily no sophie said im afraid shes on holiday is there anything i can do for you she the only two women working from this office were sophie and merrily when sophie said well i dont know precisely i know she was supposed to have left yesterday but i believe she delayed her departure for some reason no i couldnt im afraid thats not the sort of personal information im permitted to give out merrily held her breath and moved away from the window they could be out there somewhere on a mobile no ive no idea im afraid youd have to ask mrs watkins herself about that sort of thing no the bishops away at a conference hell be back on thursday night look im sorry but im only a secretary im really not party to that kind of information i should try our press officer tomorrow goodnight sophie hung up the daily telegraph why am i on holiday sophie for the sake of your health not good enough for the health of the christian church then sophie snapped look ive just been asked if you conducted an exorcism today at the home of gerard and the late mrs stephanie stock what would you have said if youd been asked that question id have explained that it wasnt exactly an exorcism sophie and lol exchanged glances yeah i know and they wouldnt have believed a word of it merrily reached for her cigarettes glared from one to the other of them im supposed to run away yes sophie said for the moment at least until such time as the police charge gerard stock with murder and the media are formally gagged until after the trial what about the bishop ill phone gloucester and advise him to stay in his hotel room and lock the door and where am i spending my holiday learning welsh in pembrokeshire with jane you can stay at my house tonight sophie lived with her husband in one of the streets behind the castle green which would implicate you merrily said thanks but forget it anyway i have to go home and feed the cat dont throw up silly barriers sophie said irritably phone gomer parry he has a key to the vicarage doesnt he sophie knew everything or mr robinson has an alternative suggestion she said in the fields to either side cut and turned hay lay like a choppy green sea the road and the fields and the woods lay in shadow but the malverns above them were caught in the sunset their foothills glowing as if lit from underneath like a tiffany lamp it was serenely beautiful and yes she had to agree it was the last place anyone would think of looking for her eye of the storm merrily lit a cigarette she felt a little scared actually trepidation or the electric armbristling fear of another imminent revelation lol had driven her back to ledwardine vicarage and shed packed a case and phoned gomer parry gomer had been round in minutes how about he move in tonight feed the cat keep the newshounds off the premises hed caretaken once before when merrily and jane had been armlocked into a family wedding in northumberland now widowed and restless he liked being the guy who looked out for them both which also brought him closer to the action good old gomer a holiday merrily inhaled and leaned her head over the torn back of the astras passenger seat and closed her eyes so whats that like exactly boring lol said as i recall we had a few odd days when jane was younger not for a while though how is she raging eirions stepmother seems to think she enjoys being a nanny to her youngest kids taking a risk there and can she even begin to know how much of one merrily closed her eyes dont really want to get there i want to drive through the night talking inane crap like when we were young thats a holiday i remember now inane crap with bits of sex in between you and alison once five days in northern france you ever see alison in the village well shes still with james bulldavies if thats what you mean they say shes really taken him and his decrepit house in hand but they dont come to church so who sits in the bull pew now nobody people are so superstitious arent they she felt the car slow and turn and when she opened her eyes the road had become an alley between rows of short wooden pylons entwined around them luxuriant growth seemed to be surging towards the awakening stars it was lol who was shivering he pushed his compact body back into the seat to stop it but she felt the tremor and she knew his hands were tightening on the wheel time to abandon the prince of wales guide to making stupid conversation i think merrily caught some ash in the palm of her hand what havent you told me lol watched the road winding between the hopyards put on his headlights so exactly how long have you been a vicar he said she recognized the church embedded in shadow fusing with the bushes above the river bank there was a light on in the vicarage just one it was the kind of light you left on when you went out for the night to create an illusion of habitation the astra crawled through the village if you could call it that there were several cars on the forecourt of the pub one was a station wagon with its rear hatch flung up a man pulling out a black tripod didnt take them long did it lol drove slowly past he even managed to give the man a suspicious glance like a true local in his battered old car subtle there are rooms at profs studios hed said its not finished yet but its quite respectable who else would be there only me in a loft out in the stables the road curved out of the village up a slight incline and down again the malvern hills disappeared and reappeared undulating with lights like gems mounted on a jewellers velvet tray is this going to help merrily said us coming here trust me im a dropout trainee psychotherapist well im not any kind of psychotherapist she squeezed out her cigarette turned to look at him her back resting against the passenger door but ive learned enough about your little ways in the short time weve known each other to know that when youre at your most facetious it usually means youre also kind of scared lol turned through a gap in the hedge went very slowly downhill and eventually came to a stop she could see the humps of buildings but no lights what had she expected the prof levin studios in neon youre obviously not scared of the dark though merrily said no i like the dark yes you would lol switched off the engine when he hesitated when i first came here i went out for a walk in the dark well actually it wasnt that dark bit like tonight i walked down there he pointed through the windscreen to a line of poplar silhouettes over the river bridge then i picked up a path and wandered into a wood then i got a bit lost your thing being lost merrily said softly is it but its produced some lovely songs ask jane shes just being kind shed take that as a serious insult go on you went for a walk you got lost and then i came to this abandoned hopyard everything cleared or dead with the poles and the frames naked he paused and a woman stephanie stock she was naked too merrily stiffened the summer night gathered around the old car opaque now like november fog soured down past the inn at the edge of the old harbour there was a stony footpath and if you followed it for about half a mile you came to a fairly secret cove or at least it seemed secret at night there was probably an oil refinery beyond the headland you cant eirion stood with his back to a millpond sea there were just the two of them on the beach one of the great things about pembrokeshire was that you could still find lonely beaches in july jane climbed onto a rock so that she was looking down on him postsunset the sky was luminous almost lime green what hoping her eyes were glittering with an equally dangerous intensity eirion backed off the heels of his trainers almost in the water well yes all right of course you can he would always start to sound welsh when he was agitated you can do what you want youre free youre sixteen years old youre english he moaned to the brilliant sky dont start that again please please dont hit me with that racism stuff again theyve just been brought up to be proud of their language and their culture oh right said jane their culture this evening theyd been to the movies to a cinema in fishguard well not actually a cinema a cinema club where theyd seen this thriller with notbad car chases and a couple of halfhearted love scenes and a leading actor who jane recalled from tv and who was moderate totty in his freshfaced way it had actually helped that it was in welsh and that snogging had been rendered impractical due to two small girls sitting in between them with their chocolate ripples it had allowed jane to contemplate the terrible turn events had taken and the element of guilt she could no longer reject an unexpected wave hit eirions ankles and pooled into his trainers he groaned jane please dont do this to me stay until the weekend at least then we can think of something ive thought of something ive thought of a taxi ive thought of the nearest station ive thought of lots of things but theres nothing you can do there eirion sat down in the sand and took off his trainers to empty the sea out of them i let her down dont be daft i dumped her in it thats ridic because i didnt have the guts to say to riddock this is naff this is dangerous this is wrong jane came down from her rock and began to ramble up the beach but slowly always keeping eirion in sight people here still talked about that couple who were murdered years ago on the pembrokeshire coastal path and nobody was ever caught english couple as it happened on holiday jane were all eirion picked up his trainers and ran barefoot along the sand towards her were all braver after the event shes not going to hold it against you you think she doesnt understand how hard it is you think she was never in that position herself of having to keep her street cred at school huh plus shes your mother plus shes a you know a christian and also a very nice woman jane stared at him in pity irene did i even mention my mother youll have to excuse me eirion said im a stranger on your planet ok she stopped this evening when i went up to change before we went to see the film i pinched the cordless from the sitting room leaving three quid in the dinky little box marked ffon i hasten to add and i locked myself in the bathroom and found the number from directories and i tried to ring amy shelbone ah he sighed i did wonder if you might shed fitted me up irene shed lied she was supposed to either put that right or give me a bloody good reason why not she wouldnt talk to mum but shed have to talk to me also i was gonna tell her what a disgusting old slag riddock was and how she should tell her to piss off out of her life try and put her right you know all right she felt eirions hand close around hers that was a reasonable thing to do but whyd you have to be so secretive about it wasnt anything to do with anybody else thanks eirion had trodden on an old bottle in the sand and let go of her hand to rub his bare foot i didnt mean you im sorry im a bitch im a bitch im a bitch anyway she wasnt in i got her mother and i said like when will she be in i didnt say it was me of course just a friend from school but then her mother shes just like screaming at me dont you go claiming to be one of her friends she hasnt got any friends just enemies and then she goes youre evil youre all evil but you wont hurt her again shes not going back to that school and im like what gobsmacked obviously i mean come on lets get this thing in proportion you know oh for christs sake irene put your bloody shoes on she walked up a couple of steps where the beach joined the stony path and waited for him to pull on his trainers she could see a light far out in the bay this was such a romantic place and then it came out she said as if you didnt know shes screaming as if you didnt know you godless wretch know what he reached for her hand amy tried to top herself jane pulled away overdose of aspirins oh dear god said eirion yeah jane picked up a big pebble pulled back her arm as if to hurl it at the sea then let it drop by her feet could you live with that eirion said it doesnt mean it does irene itll all come out now though wont it therell be an investigation you reckon probably proving what gonna nail riddock are they not a chance her old man her mothers husband is one of the fattest fat cats in the entire county itll never come out unless oh shit eirion said jane glared at him how do we know there arent other kids being terrorized i think it was actually you who said the other night that when youre nine an elevenyearold could seem like charles manston manson didnt you yes hissed eirion through his teeth what kind of holiday do you think im gonna have dangling my toes in the ocean listening to sioned trying to teach me the complete works of taliesyn and all the time thinking about the evil that slags wreaking and what could you do if you were back home loads of things i could speak out about it for a start i know this woman bella at radio hereford and worcester i could go on there live and talk about it and i could just like name names before anyone could stop me theyd prerecord you eirion said and then theyd edit out the names i could do something i could get that slag i will get her they both stood looking at the light out at sea jane thinking what a magic night what a magic place to make love what an incredible memory to have for the rest of your life too late now it was all soured cats lol would keep pausing glancing at her to see if she believed him as if she might be thinking hed invented these two bizarre creepy and sexually provocative encounters with stephanie stock both of them ending with him walking away but this in fact confirmed it walk away was what lol would do of course she believed him but what was it all supposed to convey apart from that stephanie had been as mad as gerard as she followed lol across the yard a sensor switched on two lamps projecting from the stable wall revealing the cottage in front of them she could see it had originally been quite small a typical herefordshire farmworkers timberframed home two up two down and a leanto there was a brick extension probably nineteenth century longer and taller than the original dwelling just the four bedrooms at present lol had a long key for the cracked and illfitting front door but theres scope for conversion of a few more outbuildings if prof can get listedbuilding consent merrily thought that with david shelbone around this could turn out to be more of a problem than prof might figure unexpectedly she discovered she was starting to feel less depressed it was clear that the case of gerard and stephanie stock had several dark and as yet unprobed levels was more complex than either the police or even she had imagined and went deeper than a violent rage inflamed by a botched deliverance if she could be convinced of this it was a start she wouldnt be able to live with herself as an exorcist a priest or a person if she thought anything shed done had led however indirectly to the slaughter of stephanie stock its a nice idea in principle lol was saying musicians can come and stay no real time limit and help out generally around the place when theyre not recording van morrison on orbital sander thats yet to happen but people will do all kinds of things for prof he pushed open the front door and put a hand inside feeling around for light switches this is the living room its still a bit er merrily stepped inside looking around by the harsh light of two naked bulbs she saw several wooden packing cases a bubblewrap mountain an inglenook full of cds a tv set on a tea chest two deckchairs and one padded garden recliner in the middle of an ice floe of polystyrene packing lol this is a dump yes he said thats er thats one way of its the only way lol the bedrooms are tidier lol said which was true merrily chose the smallest of them which contained just a tiny porcelain washbasin a rag rug and a bed it was in the old part of the cottage but had recently been done up fresh plaster between the beams the threequarter bed had no headboard but there was a new duvet lying on it still in sealed plastic it was stuffy in here it was supposed to be my room lol prised open the window one pane eighteen inches square but for some reason i keep going back to a camp bed in one of the lofts over the stable yes he would do that hed need the feeling of impermanence merrily sat on the bed she felt like an asylum seeker in a hostel tomorrow seemed as impenetrable as prof levins living room hang on a minute lol went off and came back with a small wooden reading lamp with a parchment shade he placed it on the deep window sill and plugged it into a socket underneath with the ceiling bulb switched off the lamp turned the room a hazy buttermilk monastic cell to cosy boudoir in two clicks lol asked if could bring her up a drink probably better if you didnt see the kitchen tonight bad he shrugged the rats live with it is there a kettle say and a teapot that we could perhaps bring up sure he was hovering in the doorway ill fetch your case in then you want some help lol held up both hands stay luxuriate she spread the duvet on the bed and sat down again staring at the rough plaster she and lol had shared some secrets again she wondered if he still had the sweatshirt with the roswell alien motif with lol it all went back to a teenager called tracy who had a mate called kath was it karl windling the aggressive and unpleasant bassplayer in hazey jane had fancied this kath and set lol up with tracy she was about four years younger than lol but you probably wouldnt have known seeing the two of them together and he certainly wouldnt have suspected and then windling had decided he wanted tracy as well and it had all turned nasty and windling had squirmed out of it leaving lol innocent in everyones eyes but the laws with a conviction for having sex with an underage girl six months probation and rejection by his family that was the start of it a long time ago a long time for anyone to remain an alien but it would partly explain his reaction both times to stephanie stock you must have thought she was unreal a ghost idve been happier with a ghost lol put down the tea tray merrily thought back to his involvement with the ethereal moon whod lived on dinedor hill its like cats isnt it cats put a cat in a room with someone whos afraid of cats or allergic to cat hair the cat invariably heads straight for them jumps onto their laps i like cats well i know that and you quite like women too i realize this is an inexact analogy im talking about women with problems weird women they tend to come on to you like cats and you put out a tentative hand and then experience tells you to back off im not proud of backing off i dont like to imagine what might have happened if you hadnt merrily poured the tea could she have been stoned or was she ill lol wondered what something longterm schizophrenia could that have been why stock kept her apart from the community was he drinking to excess to cope with it the mad woman in the isolated kiln but you cant really do a mr rochester these days can you you cant keep this kind of thing secret any more if she was on medication for instance and schizophrenics are almost invariably on medication and she apparently went out to work yeah but did she she said she was temping for a cardealer in hereford but was she merrily leaned her head against the side of the bed all this will have to come out she looked at lol that night in the hopyard was she aware of you yes lol drank some tea and no good answer helpful it was dark she was aware of you in the bedroom though and she was certainly aware of you downstairs before we began well coming on to me like i used to be this big rock star what kind of crap was that shed probably never heard of me until stock mentioned i was staying at profs but she gave absolutely no sign of recognizing me from the hopyard not then anyway but you recognized her wasnt sure at first not till we were upstairs together and she was on the bed and you and stock had gone and then suddenly she was because of the hopbine the lady of the bines who never existed who is an invented ghost remind me about that again merrily lit a cigarette shed smoked it by the time hed finished so the museum woman made it up you been back to ask her lol he shook his head hops merrily tapped the tea tray with her fingertips think hops hoppillows stock said hoppillows were supposed to give you a better nights sleep but not in this case hops as a turnon the first time you saw her she was naked and winding a hopbine around her and up in the bedroom she was playing with an old hopbine again a hopbine which she was again using in a lubricious fashion how did you feel embarrassed scared and maybe just a bit ill stick with scared and embarrassed basic nymphomania merrily wondered that can be a mental illness cant it i mean people have a good laugh about it men in pubs always like to pretend they wish their wives would catch it but its a mental illness isnt it lol considered i dont even think its a clinical term there are no criteria to back it up its applied to women who want too much sex but how much is too much and what do you call a male nymphomaniac could be a purely sexist term because a woman who lives for sex is a slut while a man who cant get enough is a role model wow merrily said you really have been on a course he looked uncomfortable at that he pulled off his glasses and began to polish them on the hem of his tshirt merrily slid down to the rug and leaned back against the side of the bed her bare arms around her knees she was aware of the irony of being alone in a bedroom talking about sex with a man shed always found attractive but in circumstances that rendered the whole subject forbidding like going into a tobacconists to discuss emphysema were going round in circles lol he told her about the odd words uttered by stephie in the bedroom the foreign language which definitely wasnt french might have been welsh and then dont say no to me as if someone else had been saying no to her well stocks a lot older than she was and probably close to being an alcoholic which is no cure for impotence lol said and i think im right in saying the number one reason for men killing their wives is being drunk and on the receiving end of taunts about not being able to perform and stocks an arrogant guy very very hard for someone like that to admit to sexual inadequacy and if he doesnt say another word to explain why he did it thats probably what theyll put it down to if merrily said heavily there hadnt also been what they will insist on describing as an exorcism they were both silent it occurred to merrily that she might have done rather better if lol had accompanied her as a psychologist part of her putative deliverance team he stood up and leaned against the window sill next to the lamp how about if i go back to bliss and tell him about stephanie she looked up at him youd hate to have to do that it might alter the direction of their inquiries and its the truth she went and stood next to him they wouldnt believe you you did also howe would take enormous pleasure in bringing up your past record he smiled hazey jane two they looked at one another she saw his face soften it was the kind of confluence of gazes that might normally have progressed rapidly to a meeting of mouths but the moment passed and merrily went and sat on the bed call this a vague guess she said but its my feeling that if theres one person who could explain much of this its simon st john lol used a phone plugged into the wall next to profs garden recliner the call was answered in seconds whos this its he always found it hard to identify himself its lol a sigh sorry mate thought you were the media about to tell you to fuck off you said that to the papers he really didnt care did he what must it be like not to care had many calls tonight not as many as i expected simon sounded tired though like hed been doing a lot of talking but the police have been round briefly lol said so you know everything this is the english countryside simon said everybody within a sixmile radius knew everything by teatime you dont sound surprised im getting over it the thing is lol said merrily watkins is here good for you its not looking good for her i can imagine we thought you might like to talk now or tomorrow morning theres quite a lot to no there isnt simon st john said curtly its over let the police sort it out hang on how can you its over lol the vicar hung up on him the old pine door of lols loft opened on to a rickety wooden gallery directly above the mixing board overlooking the studio floor moonlight now falling through the skylight on to snaking cables and the boswell guitar on her stand it must have been after three am when he came out and stood there leaning on the basically unsafe rustic railing times like this when you smoked a cigarette maybe he should start if only to get through the nights hed just dreamed of the lady of the bines again weaving and rustling towards him and this time she was a ghost and she came in a shroud of cold and her eyes were like smoke and lol had shuddered awake he stood on the gallery the minstrels gallery prof called it and thought about merrily lying no more than forty feet away thought about how close hed come to kissing her clearly it just wasnt meant as shed pointed out herself only weird cats jumped into his lap and although he thought about her every day only negative circumstances had ever brought them together and even then he was aware that tonight theyd attempted to analyse his experiences but hadnt even touched on hers whatever had happened to her in the kiln whatever it was that had made her appear to choke sent her dashing around the place flinging open doors its over simon st john had said was it was gerard stock lying awake in his cell at hereford police station going back over the day screening the movie lol tried to see that movie stock still angry after showing merrily the door walking in on stephie dont say no to me predatory stephie gerard stock imploding like an old radio blowing all its valves it struck lol that stock could still virtually walk away from this only in exceptional circumstances these days did the perpetrators of hotblooded domestic murders get life a domestic killing was a oneoff the killer no danger to the public in this case the killer had been under massive stress heightened by an exorcism that hadnt worked it could in the end be merrily who came off worst a career wrecked more than a career a calling its over in the hour before dawn the only way to cool the fever of his thoughts lol wrote a song and as the sun came up sat in the shadows of the booth with the boswell guitar and played it through complete it even had a title the cure of souls scalding as she opened her eyes a shaft of sunlight from the one small window threw her back into the kilnhouse she tasted sulphur heard the shrill cold calling beep beep beep beep invoking dead stephie racked with laughter i think youd better answer that vicar it might be god she clawed around the bare boards for the mobile yes merrily sophie she sat up in the bed no headboard stone and rough plaster against her back and shoulders dungeonlike where are you im in the office of course are you alone im in bed yes she said im alone i have the morning papers here oh do i want to know this gerard stock was charged last night with the murder of stephanie stock merrily closed her eyes i think that for you we can take that as a sophie hesitated i was about to say reprieve think the phrase is stay of execution merrily fumbled for her cigarettes what do they actually say its made page one in the mail and the telegraph all the reports identify the stocks as people who complained that their home was haunted and how it was the site of the murder of stewart ash nowhere im relieved to say is there any mention of an exorcism taking place although the telegraph reminds us youd voiced an intention of looking into the problem i would think that theyve said all they consider themselves allowed to say until after the trial which since hes confessed may be not too many months away sophie said calmly has he what confessed he was the one who called the police merrily tried to grip a cigarette between lips that felt slack and rubbery but you dont know if hes made a formal statement do you sophie said we may not even find out hell probably be shipped off to a remand centre if he hasnt gone already well it means im back in circulation at least merrily looked around the tiny monks cell and felt a small pang of regret safe haven sanctuary for the present ah sophie said about that ive spoken briefly to the bishop at his hotel in gloucester he feels as i do that since weve already told several people that youre away on holiday perhaps it would be best if you were to remain away for a week at least what about the parish thats all been arranged a locums been organized for the sunday services if you agree its the ubiquitous canon beckett im afraid jeffrey kimballs back in dilwyn tomorrow so the canons available again oh i imagine dci howe will need to talk to you again but i wouldnt make the first move there if i were you id keep your head well down whats bernies attitude guarded sophie said thats a useful word and theres something else someone else wants to see you i pass this on now but ive also told him youre going away who mr shelbone david shelbone perhaps you could talk to him on the phone if you must somethings happened merrily swung her feet to the bare boards well it seems mrs shelbones done something rather drastic oh jesus the unlit cigarette fell from her lips nothing like that sophie said hastily whats happened is that shes apparently left home and taken the child with her convinced he claims that in the wake of her attempted suicide social services will try and take amy away from them and put her into care mr shelbone reckons theres a story going round that he and his wife are religious extremists and the child may be psychologically dam does he know where they are if he does he isnt saying sophie i need to talk to him a couple of days ago this would have seemed like a serious breakthrough and it was still important maybe lol could give me a lift in if you must do this ill pick you up an hour dont wear a dog collar first time sophie had ever said that lol had somehow produced scrambled eggs in the microwave hed spread a clean tablecloth on a packing case merrily looked around felt quite touched either hed lied about the condition of the kitchen or hed been up for a long time scrubbing he brought her more toast from the toaster he was actually wearing his old roswell alien sweatshirt faded now to light grey big slanting eyes on the chest holes in the elbows she told him about sophies call and that the worst of the heat was off for a while she also told him about the shelbone situation why it was important for her to go back to hereford and afterwards lol said lightly ill get sophie to bring me back here if thats ok with you lol smiled or maybe ill just pick up the volvo not as if its got a deliverance sticker in the window sophie was perhaps being a little overcautious last night i just dont think she trusted you on your own lol said how do you feel now well im eating thank you she looked at the remains of her breakfast then at lol cant say i feel a more seasoned human being for having seen a man carrying his wifes head around like a potted plant first shudder of the day get it over with why had stock done that brought in the head put it down in a beam of light like a stone age priest with a sacrifice commemorating the arrival of the midsummer sun she carried her plate to the sink turned on hot water lol when when i said stock had confessed sophie said has he like there was some doubt she watched his reaction lol was looking unhappy am i missing something well he picked up a tea towel maybe she means what if he pleads not guilty but he did call the police didnt he he did actually tell them hed killed his wife but hes had time to think about it hasnt he i didnt like the idea of him refusing to make a statement hes clever suppose he gets a smart barrister and they try to hang the whole thing on exorcism you mean on me right i dont know you studied law for a while didnt you but saying what the backs of her legs felt weak that stock had acted out of character due to a sudden infusion of the holy spirit i dont think even that was quite suggested in the taylor case but you said that was over a quarter of a century ago probably twice as many people going to church as there are now weve become a secular country very quickly you might talk about the holy spirit i imagine some barrister would argue thats become a meaningless term mythology theyd probably bring on a tame shrink lol said there are dozens of the buggers out there university professors authors of distinguished textbooks theses awesomely eloquent frighteningly fluent oozing with certainty ive been listening to them for months theyre scary not necessarily right but convincing he put down the tea towel and came to lean against the stainlesssteel draining board merrily let the hot water run over her wrists this was a new lol wasnt it so they screen stocks video in court he said the jury see you at work then they see stock at the end when hes about to throw you out hes angry almost irrational this is the real stock of course but the jury dont know that the first stock they saw was this quiet subdued compliant character who just wants peace restored to his home theyre thinking to themselves what happened in there what brought about this change he was annoyed at stephanie the way she was behaving but on the video he isnt going for stephanie hes going for you and me hes questioning what im doing there am i there as a psychotherapist in case hes bonkers so whats this other guy about the jury asks itself is directed to ask itself merrily said by the smart brief meanwhile back on the video stocks trying to find out whats been achieved there and hes not satisfied with the answers he loses it completely hurls the brimstone tray to the floor and what do we do we just walk out leaving this unstable and clearly violent man with the offer of a few prayers to tide him over merrily said bitterly and then they i suppose they put you in the witness box and screen the what theyll keep on calling an exorcism they take me through it prayer by prayer line by line demanding explanations justifications they ask what happened to you when you looked like you were choking why did you suddenly start rushing around opening doors why did you do that well that was that was just something i shouldve done before we started youre supposed to open all the doors so the evil spirits have nowhere to hide i she stared down into the sink something like that you actually had an awareness of evil maybe the water was very hot on her hands and wrists but she didnt remove them lol took a step back did you yeah i know how do i qualify that how do i define evil no lol said this is me not the barrister i want to know did you feel an evil i i smelt sulphur i tasted sulphur it went to the back of my throat in this raw searing way that sulphur does i cant explain that but it did feel like i was choking for a couple of seconds i felt like i was going to the water began scalding the backs of her hands and she pulled them back with a small scream lol wrenched a hand towel from a hook on the wall die she pushed her hands gratefully into the towel now that sounds really stupid doesnt it imagine having to say that in court but yeah i mean obviously what happened afterwards took the edge off it in a big way but for one terrifying split second i really thought i was about to choke to death or at least pass out lose consciousness so i started to say in my head something called st patricks breastplate which is a complete spiritual selfdefence thing surrounding yourself with the power of christ and i went around opening doors and it it went away and i got my act together and carried on how would your psychologist and your agnostic barrister react to that lol didnt reply he was holding her hands still wrapped in the towel go on she felt her voice shrink finish the scenario crunch of tyres on the track outside sophie lol took his hands away he stood there in that same old alien sweatshirt those same sad whippedpuppy eyes behind his brassrimmed specs but this was lol back from psychotherapy school six months exposed to concerned humanism sympathetic psychobabble he was right he did know these people now theyd take me apart right merrily said they have full access to science and psychology and scepticism and cynicism im look he said im sorry we shouldntve started this it could be that none of it will happen he followed her to the door i was just playing devils advocate she turned and stared at him and he realized what hed said and smiled ruefully eyebrows rising above his glasses jesus he murmured two thousand years of exorcism on trial merrily said it seemed so ridiculous when you put it like that so why was she sweating a religious man lol followed merrily out to the grey saab its engine running she was wearing a short orangecoloured skirt and a crumpled white jacket and carrying a canvas shoulder bag under an arm the exorcist he thought theyll do it theyll sacrifice her at the car as though shed simultaneously reached the same conclusion merrily turned to him tried for a smile but failed she shrugged instead her image misted behind her in the meadow sloping down to the frome the hay had been cut and turned and lay heavy like acres of gold leaf a heat haze hanging over it from behind the wheel of the saab the stately sophie raised a hand in formal greeting like the queen or somebody she wore a dark blue business suit and no smile she revved the saab like a getaway driver sophie would do her best for merrily probably even the bishop would do what he could but in the end theyd both have to walk away lol watched the saab turn crunching baked red earth vanishing around the curve of the track a cold electricity was branching through him as he walked rapidly away down the footpath across the hay meadow to the river that seeped below the brambles under the hedge and the fat purplespotted banks of willowherb the river frome flowing invisibly like the truth just when it seemed entirely unimportant the substance of the final verse of his river song seeped unbidden into his head what you did lol realized was join another river walking through knights frome he saw nobody no police no press he crossed the bridge to the small sunken church the churchyard was wilderness so overgrown around the perimeter that you couldnt tell where the countryside began several gravestones even poking out of bushes lol stood in the porch and listened no voices no clatter he went in letting the iron latch fall behind him sometimes they still oppressed him churches with their rigidity and weight the ungivingness of them their atmospheres dense with the residue of humourless old hymns this one was almost frugally plain the air inside ochre with sunlight and dust lol went and sat in a back pew over in a corner he couldnt quite see the altar that was ok he sat for a while in silence the prayerbook shelf was thick with dust in it someone had fingerdrawn two sets of initials and a heart lol took off his glasses wondering how often merrily did this how many times a day how long it took to break the ice his feeling was that it could be like meditation that youd have to connect with your deepest inner self the part that flowed into some collective unconscious rippling under the light of whatever it was you called god rivers again listen he whispered when the level seemed beyond his reach i mean we dont really know each other at least i dont know you but weve got one mutual interest and i hope youre not going to let her down his eyes had half closed and all he could see was a dark yellow haze with blobs of white where the windows were because shes not going to help herself you know that shell just keep on telling the truth as she sees it and that might be the wrong kind of truth for certain people and i realize we only learn by suffering by screwing up and maybe she did screw up but her heart was in it and what else can you ask and if she goes she wont come back and i dont think thats going to help anybody i mean how do you want to play this you want a church run by politicians or by people who actually give a shit he glanced over his shoulder towards the vestry which merrily had entered as a woman and emerged from as a priest he leaned back and thought for a few minutes so like dont you think some things need to start coming out i mean dont know how far this goes back but i think it probably predates stewart ash i think something bad happened there apart from stewarts murder and i think that stewart as a lingering presence was an irrelevance and i think stock knew that so what did stock really want why did he want an exorcism why did he approach simon and then go after merrily talking to himself now hed tried to puzzle it out last night and early this morning as hed mopped and scrubbed the kitchen but puzzling had produced nothing he just didnt know enough sorry he said this is bollocks isnt it he stood up nothing resolved no revelation no inspirational feedback from his inner self when he put on his glasses the white blobs hardened into pearly gothic windows he slid wearily out of the pew and across to the church door daylight filled the crack around the door when he put a hand up to the latch he found it was already up which was odd because he was sure hed closed the door and heard the latch fall into place it was probably warped he opened it and went out and there she was in the porch blocking his path with her wheelchair a religious man after all then is it lol there were no unfamiliar cars in the palace yard no one was waiting under the arch or at the top of the stairs sophie unlocked the office door if he doesnt show up now i think i shall be very annoyed indeed inside the phone was ringing they heard the machine pick it up this is for mrs watkins weve met before tania beauman formerly of the livenight programme now researching for the witness series on channel four id appreciate a call back thank you merrily drew a surprised breath shes got a nerve after last winters fiasco dont worry about it sophie said i can handle this i didnt tell you but weve had a similar approach from panorama at the bbc theyre all thinking ahead to the court case they make a background programme in advance to be screened immediately the case is over and the shackles are off the spiel is that theyre going to make the programme anyway and if you dont agree to appear your views may not be fully represented what did you tell them i said wed discuss it when you returned from your holiday adding god forgive me that i was sure we could trust the british broadcasting corporation to produce a balanced and accurate account with or without your help there were two other messages on the machine one from the bishop nervously demanding an update the other from fred potter of the three counties news agency look nobody can print anything now so i wont be on your back for a good while i just wanted to say thanks for your help and if theres anything i can do to help you at all because you know ive heard one or two things which dont sound that promising from your point of view so if you think theres anything i can maybe tell you you know where i am ok thanks ill give you the number again just in case little shark sophie lifted a finger to delete the message no im going to ring him youre not what have i got to lose besides he was everything sophie snapped for a start youre supposed to be on holiday but merrily was already tapping in the worcester number the young woman who answered said fred was on the phone asked who was speaking its mrs sharkey from hereford ill hold when fred potter came on the line merrily said quickly just dont say my name aloud or ill have to hang up mrs sharkey never mind well thanks for calling back mrs sharkey hold on a moment ah sinead you dont fancy getting me a tuna on rye from the sarny bar plus whatever rabbity morsels you allow yourself excellent thank you this enough cheers pause right mrs sharkey were on our own bloody hell that was a bit of a turnup wasnt it a turnup yes it was you know about the video video all right ill be honest i knew stock had the place bugged and wired up for sound and pictures he told me himself did he he had one camera wedged into a shelf at the time and of course it fell over while i was there and it was dangling by the strap he asked me if id mind keeping quiet about it said he was convinced he was going to get something mindblowing on tape that would prove he wasnt making it up thats why i said i believed he was on the level i couldnt tell you id agreed to say nothing thats ok thanks a bunch besides i was thinking if he does get something mindboggling seems like he has merrily said you reckon he thought something might appear during the exorcism youre just trying to find out whether i did one or not he laughed all right forget it anything i can tell you stuff you might not know no notes no recording swear to god what did you think of mrs stock fred good question er well the first thing i thought was hes landed on his feet there hasnt he just jammy bugger meaning whats a clappedout old drunk doing with a charming young thing like that i wouldnt say say charming sexy not beautiful but shed got a certain its funny he was going on about what it had done to them living in that place making them withdrawn nervous all this and she kept very quiet while i was there but after it came out about the murder when wed got all we could in the village i drove into hereford and hung around outside the secretarial agency where stephanie worked back of aubrey street and i had a word with a few of the girls when they came out and i got just a completely different story there was a tapping on the door merrily glanced up as sophie let in a man who had to stoop in the doorway she saw grey and white tufted hair a face like a tired horse david shelbone in these situations fred potter said youre just after kind of were all absolutely shattered she was a lovely person who remembered everybodys birthday predictable stuff because this is the victim and it usually helps if the victims a nice person you normally find the workmates or the neighboursve already had the cops round and the initial excitements worn off a bit but on this occasion as it happened i was in there first these women didnt know about it sophie offered the visitor a seat merrily put a hand over the phone whispered sorry ill be one minute so what i was getting was genuine offthecuff reaction fred said the women looking at each other shocked naturally gasps of horror as youd expect then grilling me for information but the quotes i was getting from them were not what i was looking for in the end i put the notebook away because i was getting a load of stuff i couldnt have used asking more questions than it answered and we werent going to get any answers not now with her dead and him questions what i was getting was not a lot of genuine sorrow to be honest shed worked for that agency four or five months when she first arrived she seemed very very quiet very proper very polite butter wouldnt melt the kind if she met a bloke on the stairs shed shrink into the wall to avoid him brushing against her stephanie stock and when she talked about her husband it was like he was some sort of guru her mentor her guardian gerard this gerard that oh i dont know id better ask gerard no i dont think gerard would approve this was when she talked at all so what happened she changed damn right she changed merrily said not overnight it was a continuing process if id been writing it up for the tabs idve had the girls saying something like stephanie was very quiet at first and hard to get to know but the job really brought her out of herself and in her last few days shed been full of life and getting on with everybody meaning youre clergy mrs watkins i cant oh sod off merrily looked up uncomfortably with a strained smile for mr shelbone all right fred potter said there was a bloke upstairs an accountant divorced sports car theres always one isnt there the one no woman likes to meet on the stairs on a dark morning the one where they always prefer to hold open the door for him yes i know again this is one of those bits where the girlsre exchanging knowing glances and frankly i dont think any of them knows exactly what happened between stephanie and this randy accountant but someone saw her coming down from his office one lunchtime and after that the man was very subdued more than he bargained for no he was actually scared that was the consensus i dont know if this was an exaggeration but they said he was working from home the rest of the week like he was frightened you serious yeah fred said yeah i am actually these women they didnt like her i think its fair to say they did not like poor stephie one of them started whispering that she was probably a bit mental and who knows what her husband had to put up with and then another ones shouting hey this isnt going to be in the papers is it and of course that was it for me everybody clams up well no way was it going in the papers even if he didnt get charged last night this is the victim if you make a victim sound too much like a slag the level of interest goes right down meaning the amount of space you get the amount of money well yeah what about the haunting did she ever talk about that at work i mean she must have after that spread in the people somebody apparently said something like how can you go on living there but she just laughed and then the boss sent her off to this garage tanners temping so they never saw her again whats the name of the agency the joanna stokes bureau merrily made a note thanks fred thank you he said ive been wanting to tell somebody its like ive been carrying her around a little laugh part cynical part embarrassed part something else its different isnt it merrily said when a murder victim is somebody you knew however slightly somebody youd seen not long before it happened yes fred potter said its different look is it ok if i ring you again if i if you of course she gave him her mobile number she didnt usually do that it was that phrase carrying her around the plagues of frome even from a few feet away it looked as though the wheelchair was gliding through the undergrowth cutting brambles like boudiccas legendary chariot with the knives in the wheels in fact isabel knew where the overgrown path went burrowing through the tangled churchyard to the bank of the frome where the wheelchair stopped you could see the river down below like smoked glass look at that she said contemptuously no rocks no rapids seemed such a nice boring place it did after wales no historical baggage see no ruins no megalithic sites no history at all that wasnt to do with hops she wore a shortsleeved tropical top with big golden flowers and cord jeans her hair had amber highlights there was a thin grey shawl folded on her lap perfect it was she said perfect for us and now blood everywhere everywhere not yet huh isabel shook her head apparently shed sent the vicar off on a pastoral visit to the farthest of his four parishes up towards ledbury missionary work starting to mope see becomes dangerous when he mopes she looked up coyly at lol you want a church run by politicians or by people who actually give a shit i like that thats telling him of course shed overheard it all every whispered word and now youre throwing it all back at simon cant blame you for that fair play though he did say bring her along to see him first if she had plans to go into that place we tried lol said tonelessly you werent at home you were in hereford shopping my fault he was moping and i got the feeling he was getting ready to go in there himself to exorcize the kiln or whatever was needed hed made it pretty clear he didnt think anything was needed ah well said isabel what he says and what he thinks youre saying lol looked up in despair at the flawless sky he did think something was needed im not saying what he thought you can blame me like i said i didnt want him in there i didnt mind him warning your lady friend that was only right but i didnt want him in there so you see its me to blame lol didnt say anything isabel wheeled herself back from the river bank along the path to the base of an arthriticlooking apple tree funny though isnt it this whole religion business god working in mysterious ways how do people expect him to work bolts of lightning all the time and there i am sitting at the door and you pleading for enlightenment isnt it time it all came out me thinking i must be it the mysterious way what a bloody honour lol shook his head mystified hands folded on the shawl on her lap isabel fixed him with a gaze blazing now with what looked like a fearsome candour and her voice acquired a flint edge time for us to talk isnt it boy she got him to push her back to the vicarage gates and then down towards the main road the haze had been burned out of the sky and the tarmac was beginning to sweat there were hops on either side of them now high on their frames the fruit tight and green on the bines preserve the beer they do isabel said and the memories i bet and all the old hate lol sensed a stage being set out and climbed up onto it so who do you think killed stewart ash does it matter isabel gazed downhill towards the justvisible roof of the hop museum wasnt adam lake himself was it no hasnt got the balls big man macho image but no balls i reckon see that what stock was trying to suggest the other night was that lake got somebody else to do it no balls plenty of money thats what stock was saying but like lake said would he really kill somebody just get back another little bit of his old mans estate ah well isabel said youve got to look at the whole picture isnt it son of his father when alls said and done lol recalled what gerard stock had said in the hop devil about conrad lake you mean some kind of nazi wasnt far out they still dont say too much out loud round yere about all that because old perryjones isnt dead yet and perryjones and conrad lake were part of the same disease armbands stock said nothing so obvious rightwing politics racist stuff you dont get so much of that in the country you get tories of course theyre all bloody tories the old kind stuck into their little england feudal ways no tubthumping though no rabblerousing its the cities where the real extremism starts isnt it the cities where all the immigrants go how many black faces you ever see behind the wheel of a tractor life just trundled on in places like this the same families the same faces the same hairstyles isabel reached out and fingered a bine except in september of course the hop harvest september see that was when the people of the frome valley had a taste of what life was like in the cities drunkenness debauchery robbery violence all those thousands of common workingclass folk from the black country and the valleys people like me in fact my mam and my auntie used to come round yere hoppicking when they were young great times she always says hard work but a lot of laughs debauchery oh no more than youd expect with all those thousands of people and not much to do at night but drink and flirt got out of hand sometimes and there was jealousy and rivalry bar brawls beatings the odd stabbing the hop devil that was a nogo area for local people until about halfway through october bit like the wild west then one night a farmers boy they found his body in the frome what murdered never proved this was the early fifties they didnt have fancy forensics back then but it was enough for perryjones he was off these barbarians the welsh thank you lol no the welsh mostly they just sang this was the gypsies ah the welsh looked like everybody else but the gypsies looked like foreigners another race the gypsies werent sociable clannish set up their own camps and only mixed with their own kind not that they werent loyal to their employers because they were more than any of the others in some ways but they were a race apart and they knew it what are they originally from india or somewhere i think so and heathens oh perryjones made the most of all that ambitious he was see only a young man then in his twenties and a firebrand didnt care what he said well nobody did back then no such word as racism you call the gypsies a bunch of nogood lying evil murderous bastards nobodys going to jump on you for not being politically correct get them out hes screaming clean this filth from our farms he said that with the war not long over what about the holocaust all the gypsies who went into the death camps was that not fresh in peoples memories if you listen to my mam lol all that was fresh in peoples memories back then was the war itself and what a relief it was all over besides i think it was years later before they even knew the extent of the holocaust anyway perryjones he was up for the county council and looking for a future in parliament and he got a fair bit of support blaming the gypsies for every bit of trouble a lot of people they have a natural fear of anything they dont know about and nobody knows about the romany folk do they except other romanies not to this day lol recalled that al boswell had been among the romany pickers at knights frome back then and wondered how hed managed to drink in the same bar as oliver perryjones nonconfrontational is all we are al had said hed have to be isabel explained how perryjones was forever on at old man lake this was conrads father to ban the gypsies from knights frome for good in the nineteenforties and fifties the lakes owned the two biggest farms in the village but old man lake he said the gypsies were good workers and thats all that concerned him wasnt one of his boys that wound up dead in the river but if there was no proof no proof whatsoever but then the old man he died and conrad took over and conrad was very ambitious too went at it like an industrialist buying up every bit of ground going until he owned what amounted to the whole of knights frome and he was around the same age as perryjones and a close friend of his and perryjones was on the council by then and oiling wheels for conrad so well the first thing conrad does is cut the gypsy pickers pay hoping this will drive them away didnt work they still came back resentful sullen but they came back no loyalty to him now mind and a good deal more poaching and theft including his wife it was said lol stopped pushing they were at the crest of a rise and the land before them sloped panoramically away low hills and woodland towards hereford his wife isabel peered over her shoulder at him nobodys told you that he shook his head isabel smiled his first wife this was not adams mother caroline her name and quite a prize highborn beauty goddaughter of the earl of soandso and well she just disappeared one day isnt it gone vanished and it was never explained well the police certainly werent called in so its clear that conrad mustve known where she was and was too proud to let it out but this was the height of the picking season and the rumour was shed been bewitched by the gypsies seduced kidnapped spirited away thats what they do isnt it gypsies conrad never mentioned it never a word but that was it for the romanies and the tinkers and whathaveyou conrads manager told them to take their money clear out and never come back lol pushed the chair into a passing place near the bottom of the lane and sat on the grass verge in front of isabel when was this oh the sixties you dont hear the full truth about it ever because this was the time when machines were taking over from the hoppickers generally so most of them were going to be out of a job soon anyway the gypsies the dudleys and the welsh all of them together and some people still say conrad kept quiet because his wife had run off with one of his own friends and he just took it out on the gypsies because they were there and because perryjones was his best mate today youd have questions asked but in the sixties people knew their place though that was about to change mind and conrad lake was the boss and he owned the whole bloody village so this was when he was living at the house that was originally behind stocks kiln isabels eyes shone correct it was after caroline left he started building his new place turned his back on the old farmhouse knocked it down just left the kiln as if the house itself was responsible for the failure of his marriage and the gypsies all went oh they went in their own time and their own way the hoppicking see that was part of their seasonal cycle hereford for the hops and apples then down to evesham for the plums what have you they went but not before buildings were set on fire fences cut stock loosed into the hopyards and that was when the police arrived in force not very nonconfrontational the police the gypsies al boswell says the romanies are essentially nonconfrontational aye well what had happened they accused lake or one of his managers of taking one of their own women an enormous outcry there was police out searching for her in the end i think the cops decided the gypsies had made it up to get back at lake the gypsies of course were saying still say that the coppers never really tried to find her because she was only a gypsy see and not worth shit maybe something in that at least some things have changed for the better since the sixties what do you really think well i dont know lol but stewart ash thought he did gone into it all he had and of course it was all going to be in his book in detail lol blinked which book the book he was working on when he died the book the smith boys were supposed to be helping him research he was going into the whole business the reasons the romanies were banished from knights frome never to return if you dont include al and what really happened to the girl rebekah she was called with a k and an h rebekah smith smith oh its a big tribe lol the smiths none bigger doesnt mean she was related to the boys who killed stewart it does give them a reason for not killing stewart though doesnt it i suppose you could say that and did stewart claim to know what happened to this rebekah smith i dont know the thing is lol you cant libel the dead and if stewart wanted to suggest that conrad lake was in some way connected with the socalled disappearance of rebekah smith there was nothing much to get in his way except adam lake maybe how much does stock know isabel spread her hands who can say especially now is there a manuscript ive no idea i dont even know if hed started writing it before he was murdered but yes youre right of course it wouldnt make young adam feel any more at home to have some book on sale for ever and ever in bromyard and ledbury and hereford linking his late father with some nasty old scandal especially isabel smiled gently as the local people have always said and sally boswell will confirm this for you that the terrible collapse of the lake family hopempire is down to what you might call a very traditional romany curse of course the aphids the red spiders the white mould and the verticillium wilt the four plagues of the frome valley and the lady of the bines where did she fit in lol stood up so that was where stock was coming from bit clearer now is it thats a joke right lol said you asked god said isabel and god in his mysterious way asked me to fill you in on a few basics can we go back now i need a wee i do and i cant just nip behind a bush any more not till ive been to lourdes lol pushed the wheelchair back into the lane he wondered when god might think it appropriate to ask her exactly why shed been so afraid of simon going into stocks kiln element of surprise eirion took the big roundabout at carmarthen on two wheels it felt like throwing jane into the passenger door theres a station here right she demanded but he didnt react he drove on until quite soon there was only open countryside in front of them i did not ask for this jane said i did not want this eirion was heading north towards llandeilo he was like serious he was even wearing his baseball cap the right way round id really hoped jane said that you were not going to turn out to be one of those guys who think women cant transport themselves from a to b on their own he still didnt respond well stuff it jane was thinking now why should i complain if he wants to drive me to hereford and then turn the car around and drive all the way back to the bosom of his incredible family except this is gwennans car isnt it she lets me use it eirion said through his teeth eyes fixed on the road and anyway theyve still got dads car as i understand it she only lets you use it because youve got some heavy dirt on her like that shes really english or something if youre just trying to make me dump you at the roadside eirion said it wont work i was merely trying to envisage the scenario when little sioned and little lowri returned from y siop maybe half an hour ago to find out that wed pissed off without them and their mummy discovered she was obliged to take care of them for the entire day i would have gone on to make the point that whatever dirt you have on her and i would be the last one ever to ask would then count for like not a great deal i just make the point eirion slowed the bmw she saw that despite the airconditioning he was sweating i just dont want you to get disinherited in favour of those spooky kids is all jane said it would like distress me if you were to be taken away from the cathedral school and forced to work as a rent boy in abergavenny what makes you think i dont already youre not pretty enough why dont you call your mum eirion said its not your problem then why did you tell me about it weve been through this i just didnt want you to think it was a racial thing when i went over the wall eirion pulled into the side of the road though it was a main road it was still fairly quiet the hills were low and green and there were broadleaf woods apart from the colour of the soil it didnt look dramatically different from herefordshire eirion turned to face her and took off his baseball cap his eyes were solemn his famously amazing smile now in cold storage ill be straight with you jane im going to be in deep shit over this gwennan and dad have a big lunch today in tenby with some arts council people and national assembly delegates and a cultural delegation of irishspeakers from ireland its informal but there could be a significant pr contract in it for gwennan in connection with this panceltic cultural festival turn the car round now jane said with this like dark menace no theyll deal with it theyll find someone to look after the kids things will be a little tense for a while i may have minor transportation problems nothing i cant handle why are you telling me this brownie points thats all eirion said i mean id really hate you to think i was in love with you or anything like that he turned on the engine and pulled back into the traffic without looking at her jane sank back into the leather holy shit she whispered almost to herself they stopped for lunch at a roadside diner where they were served chips only slightly broader than matches then made it through llandovery and brecon without once being stopped by the welsh national assembly cultural police looking for a stolen bmw and reached the outskirts of hereford by early afternoon it was like eirion had crossed over some barrier and nothing emotive was touched on again his mood was lighter but jane also sensed an underlying determination and by the time he pulled into a side road off kings acre it was clear it had never been his intention to drop her off at the bus station where exactly do we find this suicide kid it wasnt my intention even to try jane said it would mean getting past her old lady that could take time she sounded like a very difficult woman then lets be sensible about this and go and see your mother youre missing the point my mother is in an invidious position and if she gets involved with riddock it will like rise off the scale of invidiousness so you want to go and face up this riddock christ no shed chew us up especially you thanks youre a guy guys she eats for an aperitif an aperitif is a drink jane try hors doeuvre i thought children of your ethnic persuasion had to do welsh instead of french i didnt need to do welsh jane it was my first language well almost sometimes you scare me youre so alien bollocks eirion said neither somehow do i believe this riddock scares you doesnt scare me exactly i just dont want to go near her until ive got the means to like bend her to my will no listen jane hammered both fists on her knees listen listen listen i can work this out you were right of course there was no way i could go to the media with half a story we have to know first what the complete score is with this slag like are we talking extortion because when i first sat down at that table in steves shed the first thing kirsty ryan asked me was had i got the ten quid i mean was that a joke or have they actually been taking money off little kids for letting them talk to their dear departeds little kids tend not to have dear departeds eirion said death doesnt mean that much to them jesus jane said when did you have your midlife crisis besides which i thought you said she had this rich stepfather who bought her a yellow porsche mazda look we dont know enough ok therefore we need to talk to someone who does turn the nice german wheels around and i shall endeavour to direct you and yes im very grateful to you for sacrificing your cultural heritage on the altar of um dont embarrass us both eirion said we have all the time in the world for that crap wasnt that in an ancient james bond film sorry bonds like we have all the time in the world then his woman gets shot you have to turn everything into widescreen dont you jane its a cultural thing jane said its about seeing the big picture being outwardlooking rather than all right forget it she had a vague idea where the farm was because kirsty and her sister had thrown this barnrave for kirstys sixteenth about a year ago and these little maps had been given out despite her old friend dr samedi doing the music jane hadnt gone along in the end because well because of a nobodytogowith kind of shortterm situation if you wanted the truth but she remembered the name of the farm the bluff eirion said is this an omen he was taking it very slowly because this was after all gwennans car and they were into rough tracks now hed left a terse but nervous message on his dads answering machine explaining about the car all jane knew was that it was terse and nervous because it was also in welsh i couldve sworn this was right she was sitting up peering from side to side fields full of hay like big rolls of butter a distant church steeple that could be weobley the bluff implied high ground but this was all fairly flat it was getting very hot she wished shed worn shorts you didnt say youd never actually been here eirion said crossly the bmw lurching on a baked rut and you dont know shes going to be there when we find it in fact you havent really thought this out have you im an emotional volatile charged kind of person irene when i see what has to be done i just go for it i thought that was one of the things you dont push it eirion growled all right jane said id have rung her if id thought about it but anyway i always think the element of surprise works best dont you she looked over the back of the seat through the rear window you know this this has got to be right eirion if weobleys over there and sarnesfields back there she pointed across the field ok look theres a guy on a tractor why dont we just ask him just like drive across youre ok i cant just drive across his field course you can hes already done this bit eirion changed down the bmw chugged across the spiky surface of the mown meadow when they got to within about ten yards of the tractor the big machine stopped and the driver was jumping down walking slowly towards them the driver wore a red shirt and jeans and a dark blue baseball cap with ford across the front the car couldnt go any further they were into this rolling sea of cut hay there was another guy messing about with whatever you called the piece of machinery the tractor was pulling he looked up both of them looked sweaty and knackered eirion wound down the window and hot urban music came in along with the industrial juddering of the tractor sorry to bother you the driver whipped off the cap uncovering short red spiky hair and unshadowing a face that was despite its deepening tan not a happy face right mate deal you show me the sign that says picnic site and i wont ram you into the bloody ditch oh jane leaned across eirion to the open window the tractor driver peered past eirion at jane er hi jane said hi kirsty you got a couple of minutes kirsty ryan wiped the sweat from her nose with the back of a hand and a clinking of the outsize noserings not allowed in school she looked butch and she looked sullen she also looked like she knew exactly what this was going to be about piss off watkins kirsty said we got nothing to say to each other element of surprise eirion murmured yes that always works best little taps david shelbone didnt look well there was something static about one side of his long face as though hed had a stroke no im all right quite all right hed kept saying to sophie as she offered him more tea a paracetamol ive always suffered from migraines this is nothing merrily didnt like to stare but she wondered if perhaps he had only one eye he was not what shed imagined charlie howe had led her to expect some stern prophet type wielding the banner of christ and the law of listed buildings but david shelbone had a diffident faraway look like some ageing poet weary of words sophie had read something in his manner announcing that she had some papers to collect from the bishops palace she left them alone merrily led mr shelbone into the little deliverance office a few weeks ago shed turned the desk around so she now had her back to the palace yard and was facing the door a feng shui arrangement recommended by jane she had to admit it did feel betteroriented she felt more in control even this morning i owe you an apology david shelbone didnt have a local accent like his wife there was something vaguely northern about it and his voice was flat but thin like card when amy came home from hospital we had a talk she told us your daughter was not one of the organizers of this spiritualist circle that she in fact only attended once and was virtually dragged into it merrily nodded thats my understanding too amy said it had been on her conscience she felt pressured not so much by you as anyway im very sorry there was im afraid some overreaction that was understandable we were going to write to you to apologize no need how is she it mustve been it could have been a lot worse we thought thered have to be a stomach pump but fortunately she was very sick in the ambulance anyway i rang canon beckett last night and he said i should talk to you although he wasnt sure whether or not youd gone on holiday yet failing that he thought i should go to the police but wed rather keep the authorities out of this shes our only child you see the only child well ever have now police erm sophie said your wife and amy had gone away somewhere because you were afraid social services mighti mean can they do that can they take her away if shes been formally adopted its complicated im afraid mrs watkins but broadly yes they can take away any child they might consider to be in danger merrily thought of all the battered wives abused children in unstable homes she didnt understand mr shelbone coughed nervously also you see im this is going to sound ridiculous there was a patch of white stubble on his neck a grease spot on the collar of his faded grey shirt which is what most people say when they come here merrily told him normally i abhor talk of victimization vendettas she said carefully we are talking about amy here were talking about school er not entirely he cleared his throat or at least we were probably also talking about me i see i think i see do you possibly i happened to be talking to one of the councillors his eyes flickered a hunted look which one well i dont think id better no he said of course not his breathing had quickened but someone who i think you could say is neutral on the issue of the barnchurch development merrily said he blinked hard then looked almost relieved closed his eyes for a moment the wall clock clicked on and merrily remembered with an inner shudder precisely where shed been standing this time yesterday i have to be careful what i say here mrs watkins mr shelbone said as you may have heard im not a very popular person in some quarters though i try to do what is right and christian merrily nodded tell me about it the problem with councils he said is that although different departments lets say planning and social services have very different functions and officials rarely encounter one another in the course of their work theyre all closely linked through the elected members in that a councillor who serves on shall we say planning may also serve on social services he nodded youre being very perceptive i think no im just putting two and two together from what ive been told youve a history of getting in the way of certain peoples plans theyd like you out your wife indicated youd been offered some sort of earlyretirement deal but you wanted to go on we all feel were here for a purpose and protecting the past is mine he said simply how could i relax at home knowing wrong decisions were being made and important buildings were in danger of disappearing for ever especially religious buildings he bowed his long head like a shirehorse over a gate so someone who might be adversely affected by a planning decision influenced by a ruling from you merrily said slowly spelling it out might seek to use any influence they might have in social services to damage you in other ways knowing that if i became ill or disgraced in some way it would be difficult to continue you dont believe people would behave like that to get rid of someone seriously damaging their potential incomes of course i believe it but just so we know where we are are you suggesting a bunch of councillors are on the take from allan henry i doubt its as simple or as provable as that it might involve a new garage or an extension to someones house all peanuts to henry of course but im not naming names he looked directly at her eyes full of pain and fatigue all i want to convey to you is that if anyone took amy away it would destroy hazel thered be nothing left for either of us ever these fears are very much in the wake of amys overdose gossip travels fast in herefordshire in no time at all people were linking amys sudden hospitalization to the incident in the church they were linked werent they he looked defiant it was a horribly stupid and dangerous thing to do and she knew it i said to hazel if amy wanted to draw attention to herself shes certainly done it now is it your feeling she was just trying to get attention rather than wanting to be with her mother and its all horribly exaggerated im sure avoiding her question because serious churchgoing is so unfashionable these days people have accused us of being fanatics forcing amy to go to church all the time operating a strict religious regime at home i he passed a hand across his eyes thereve been all kinds of stupid stories people are so needlessly cruel and vindictive and social workers have big ears you dont need big ears when somebodys whispering into them merrily said have there been any formal inquiries any contact at all from social services i have some friends left in the office ive been discreetly warned put it like that as a result of which hazels actually taken her away i no no she hasnt of course that was untrue when he half turned she thought it was to hide tears but he was putting a hand into an inside pocket he slid a folded paper across the desk to her merrily unfolded it carefully though the message was wordprocessed it didnt looked official probably something to do with the fact that the paper was pink and had a kitten in the top right hand corner oh god dearest mum and daddy i am so very sorry i have behaved abbominably and feel i am ruining both your lives i pray that you will understand what i am doing and support me in this and not worry for my safety because i have definately learned my lesson and you need have no fears on that score any more i know it is not your fault and that you were only trying to protect me by not telling me the truth about justine but i know now beyond all doubt that my real mother is very unhappy and cannot rest in spirit and i know i cannot live a normal life until i have done all i can to help her by the time you read this i will have been to a cash machine and drawn out the money that you said was mine from your account i am sorry i borrowed your card and will post it back to you please try to understand how important this is to me and do not try to find me or tell the police i am quite safe but if i find out that they are looking for me i will be very upset and might do something stupid so please trust me and i shall return home in a few days when justine is at peace yours sincerely your loving daughter amy merrily folded the letter oh god oh god oh god erm im with dennis she said as calmly as she could i think you should take this to the police david shelbone reached for the letter and quickly pocketed it no he said very quietly david just a couple of days ago she tried to kill herself tell me do you trust your daughter when she tells you something i it was the things jane didnt tell you about yeah i suppose i do she thought quickly he wouldnt want to go to the police for two principal reasons one that amy might indeed do something stupid if she thought there was a search on for her and two it would confirm any social workers suspicions but this development might be more serious than david shelbone could imagine for instance how much did he know about layla riddock anything at all shes never lied to us you see he said not from being a small child not about anything its the way she was brought up certainly but also the way she is merrily sighed she lied im sorry but she lied about jane didnt she no he insisted she didnt she said your daughter was there the rest was implied she didnt lie so when you told sophie that your wife i lied hazels gone to try and find her she knows where to look she has a good idea yes where up near birmingham its where amy was born and where her mother died and amy knows this we assume she does from initially from the socalled messages she received the spirit messages whatever they were they were horribly accurate and so in the end we had to tell her where she came from and what happened to her mother merrily said do you think you could tell me shed been born amy jukes at tipton in the black country her parents were even married before the happy event just about justine was seventeen when amy arrived and not yet a heroin user she came from a respectable family was doing a levels hoping to become a doctor this was what the court was told the father wayne jukes was twentytwo an assistant manager at a night club what this actually meant was that wayne had been responsible for selling various stimulants to the punters he also did a little pillpeddling around the schools and colleges for a bit of extra cash and that was how he met justine wayne wore nice suits and a tie and was smooth and plausible he had a toyota sports car so it didnt take long justines parents were disappointed naturally but they thought wayne was a presentable enough boy with an apparently promising managerial position they helped wayne and justine get a house a little semi on a notbad estate ready for the baby david shelbone knew all these details from the social services people in the black country and in hereford hed also gone out of his way to obtain the inquest and court reports in the local papers destroying them of course before amy learned to read hed even traced justines parents david was very thorough anything that might help understand amy better he and hazel wanted to know justine had been very young had never really wanted this baby found it awfully hard work especially with wayne out most nights pursuing his junior managerial role justine at home with the infant amy had very rapidly become depressed and it became clear that wayne jukes had taken to slipping her a little something to make life seem easier sometimes hed even keep her company they thought they were cool rising above it they thought because he was in the business somehow that meant they could control it and they were young too young for life to appear seriously bad when you were young you bounced it was a long time before justines parents realized what was happening by then wayne was himself using more than he was selling too far gone to realize he was being eased out of the club operation because he was becoming untrustworthy careless a risk and the mortgage wasnt getting paid and the baby cried too much and justine complained sometimes to the extent that wayne had found it expedient to give her a little tap from time to time david shelbone was telling the story in his colourless hesitant way but merrily was seeing it in harsh documentary flashes hearing the voices the accents the headspinning squashy bloody sobbing reality of those little taps there was a serious fallingout with her family and wayne and justine sold the house and got a small flat in a rundown area at the end of one of those streets that went on for ever a greasy ribbon of tatty garages and betting shops chip shops halfdead pubs at the very end was a church which had been a big parish church back in the days when this had been a village street but now had a congregation of about seven pensioners some days justine would retreat into the church taking the baby when wayne was in one of his moods which was most days because wayne was drinking heavily now as well hed made friends in one of the halfdead pubs and justine had found it best not to be around or to be there but completely out of it when wayne got home it was worse at night obviously a neighbour who cleaned the church for the vicar who had four other collapsing congregations to try and shore up became concerned for justine and gave her a key to the side door next to the vestry and some nights that was where justine would go carrying the baby and a carving knife in case there was anyone already in there and one night there was wayne had been wondering for a long time where justine went the times she wasnt there when he came home in need of some kind of action so one night he left the pub twenty minutes earlier than usual and waited in a derelict doorway across the street and followed her when she came out with the kid next day he found the church key in the back pocket of justines jeans and had a copy cut for himself and that same summer night when justine came into the church with amy wayne was waiting for them behind the dusty motheaten drapes in front of the vestry door it might have ended differently if justine hadnt done some business of her own that afternoon with a bloke she and wayne used to know when wayne was at the club a bloke who gave her a little something for her trouble if justine hadnt shot the little something into her arm before she came out if she hadnt been up there and ready for anybody wayne included it might have ended with just a few more little taps and amy saw all this merrily said how old was she nearly three dear god thats old enough to absorb everything even if she had no conscious memory it would all be there the social services were very careful about where she was taken david shelbone said the grandparents didnt want her theyd recently taken in an elderly relative and well mmm it was an emergency obviously they wanted to get the child well out of the area and we were experienced reliable fosterparents unencumbered at the time we were approached told the background we were fully prepared he fell silent and nothing to cause alarm not ever no particular problems at all and believe me hazel and i have coped with some very taxing children in our time but amy settled down remarkably quickly no nightmares beyond the norm nothing to suggest suppressed memories of violence she was always a very wellbalanced if rather serious child our daughter we both decided very quickly that if at all possible she should stay with us and become our daughter there were no indications at all that she might have remembered something not until i mean yes i have sometimes wondered if her serious and rather orthodox approach to life didnt reflect a subconscious need to impose an order that would in some way cancel out the chaos of her early years but its not something thats greatly worried me and hazel was always most emphatic that amy should never be exposed to any kind of psychological assessment we were naturally glad when she without any coercion from us began to embrace christianity from quite an early age perhaps four or five hazel always believed that if she ever required solace she would find it there rather than in counselling or therapy merrily recalled hazel shelbones reaction to the suggestion that some kind of psychiatric assessment would be needed as a preliminary to exorcism what did you tell her when she asked you about her real parents we told her we understood thered been an accident and she never questioned that we always accepted that there may come a time when wed have to tell her the real truth but not until she was old enough to deal with it so when after years of going happily to church she suddenly knocked the chalice out of canon becketts hands and it all ended at the altar you see david shelbone said thats the point that was what frightened us the most no one knew exactly how it had ended wayne jukes had presumably either decided or been told that it would help his defence if he was unable to remember anything after emerging from behind the curtain to find the baby sitting on the font and his wife crouched snarling the kitchen devil glinting in the feeble light swishing the air less than half an hour later police summoned by neighbours who had been afraid even to go in found the threadbare chancel carpet already slippery with blood wayne standing in the aisle with his face opened up from eye to chin justine vomiting blood over the altar rail amy sitting on the altar itself laughing justine had stab wounds to the lungs throat and stomach david shelbone said she died in the ambulance the trail of blood apparently suggested that justine had first slashed wayne and then picked up the child and run to the chancel the trail of blood along the aisle showing how wayne had blundered after her shed put amy on the altar and then either shed put down the knife in horror at what shed done and he picked it up and attacked her with it or he overpowered her and in the struggle what happened to wayne i gather hes out of prison now david shelbone said without emotion doing youth work in bristol merrily felt faintly sick thinking not about justine jukes but stephanie stock and gerard with the wild poppies on his shirt domestics the most common kind of murder why didnt hazel tell me about this at the very beginnning wed never told anyone anyone besides hazel and i both fervently believed that the way out of this was through christ her mother died in church so amy had some sort of flashback again in church so hazel never really believed that amy was possessed by justine it didnt matter david shelbone insisted she was possessed by the past if the memories could be reawakened by these foul experiments then they could be exorcised by christ we have oldfashioned values mrs watkins today wed probably never be accepted as fosterparents when did she go missing she wasnt there when we got up this morning that was a terrible shock her bed hadnt been slept in her mobile phone was gone weve tried ringing it but its always switched off and you think shes somehow made her way to the black country does the church still exist oh yes and also we searched her room something weve never done before we found an old road atlas of mine under the bed the area was ringed hazel set off for there about three hours ago how much money has amy got there was five hundred pounds of her money in the account she can draw two hundred a day from a machine and what do you think amy might do there i dont know i havent a clue what theyd do they i doubt shes on her own thats one reason i wanted to talk to you your daughter would know who the other girls were wouldnt she didnt you ask amy herself she wouldnt tell us except for naming your daughter this was when mr beckettwe asked her again later as i was ready to go to see the headmaster but she insisted it was all over she told you that i honestly believe she thought it was over and it was clear that if we tried to take it further shed throw a tantrum she once said if we attempted to find out shedmrs watkins you have to understand this is not the way she normally behaves its clear looking back that shes under someone elses influence and i rather doubt were talking about her dead mother so he actually didnt know yet about layla riddock he didnt have the information to make this other very meaningful connection with allan henry and how in his present state would he react if she told him about it merrily wasnt prepared to put it to the test erm my daughters on holiday with her boyfriends family ill try and get hold of her ok i dont know how long itll take but if i find out anything ill ill get back to you at your office and if hazel finds her ill get straight back to you of course he said thank you mrs watkins thank you he stood up there is one more thing if hazel finds amy and brings her back i dont think itll be safe for her to come home i wondered if the church had any place of of sanctuary i suppose somewhere you could recommend as safe for both of them i mean hazel as well im sorry to put this on you merrily stood up too if you think its necessary well find somewhere until all this is sorted out even if its in my vicarage she smiled this was all she needed right now ill help you all i can she said but if hazel doesnt find her by tonight i really think you should go to the police when sophie returned merrily laid the whole story on her including the information shed had from charlie howe at the green dragon before andy mumfords arrival had rearranged everyones priorities sophies eyebrows rose several times what was i supposed to do merrily asked her do you think i shouldve warned him about layla riddock sophie thought about it hands clasped on the desk that would be giving him a target she said at last not good especially if the targets allan henry what do you know about him sophie i know that he isnt what one might call a friend of the earth particularly the herefordshire earth he began by buying small derelict properties in villages and hamlets a petrol station that went out of business that sort of thing demolishing them and developing the sites and then somehow those sites would start to expand into adjacent fields his own thoroughly tasteless dwelling began that way he gets away with things luck of the devil as it were charlie howe said that and theres a man whod recognize it sophie said darkly however you have no proof whatsoever of any connection between this girls evident persecution of amy shelbone and her stepfathers grudge against david shelbone no i think you did absolutely the right thing in not telling him at this stage at least i think you have enough to worry about without having an already distressed individual behaving in a probably irrational fashion because because of something i did merrily sighed sophie glared at her i certainly intended no parallel with the stock business but what if amy shelbone is out there with layla riddock this is a girl even jane is scared of sophie thought for a moment then reached for the hereford phone book after a couple of minutes tracking along columns of names she slammed it shut exdirectory only to be expected merrily said i imagine theres quite a lot of people would like to ring allan henry late at night well at least we know where he lives a little bit of dallas in canon pyon oh no sophie said you stay away from there what would be the point we could at least find out if laylas there if she is she cant have gone off with amy and then it all falls down doesnt it sophie scowled why doesnt that man just tell the police but he hasnt hes told me almost as if he knew you sophie said with bitterness and whatever he says amy did lie she claimed jane had approached her initially to lure her into the circle jane not layla she also tried to stitch me up when i went to the bungalow when her parents were out so we know that amy does tell lies but the attempted suicide why did she do that well there was a vague mention of pressure merrily said but it was clear he didnt want to talk about it i dont think and this is possibly the most worrying thing of all i honestly dont think he knows why she did it the big lie i mean youre not gonner scare me watkins kirsty said i dont give a toss who youve talked to the school years over the slates wiped clean they cant touch any of us now and like by the time we go back those timeserving gits ent gonner want to remember also i may not even go back im undecided i mayve had enough of education she sat down with her back to a tractor wheel stretched out her legs fanned herself with her baseball cap jane thought she looked disgustingly smug came to me couple of months ago ok you get your a levels you go to university you get some pissy little job in some nasty overcrowded city so that in twenty years time you can afford to take your kids to live in the country its insane ennit youve got a point eirion agreed but but meanwhile yeah yeah amy bloody shelbone kirsty closed her eyes in a kind of weary contempt why dont you just let it go watkins the kids neurotic she tried to kill herself socalled but she didnt make it after an hour or so on the end of a stomach pump or throwing up whatever she ent gonner do that again in a hurry is she stupid little cow jane stared at the chunky girl sprawled in the hay the other guy had gone just slipped away kirsty didnt need backup she was wholly selfsufficient this was her place but for the tractor and the blast of massive attack from its cab she could have been part of a scene from centuries ago questions are being asked all over the place jane said and it isnt you in the frame or layla either its me right im the only one she named like to the doctors and the police and people like that jane didnt know if amy had named her to anyone except her parents but she needed to bring it down to a personal level that kirsty ryan just might relate to tough kirsty said go tell morrell about it like you said why should morrell care schools out but i am so not gonna sit here and take the shit for you and riddock im going public on it you ever heard of bella ford from radio hereford and worcester nope well shes a mate of mine anyway and im going over there to see her tonight and im putting you and riddock in the frame for bullying and terrorizing this younger kid into trying to top herself kirstys eyelids flicked up believe it jane said grimly i only listen to radio one kirsty said therefore i dont give a monkeys ok jane shrugged so you wont hear it so why you telling me cause im kind of a straight person i dont go behind peoples backs i just wanted to tell you why i was doing it is all and to warn you theyll probably be ringing you up for a comment eirion put in swiftly with his newsreporting ambitions and his dad having fingers in bbc wales htv and the welshlanguage outfit sc eirion knew quite a lot about radio and tv theyre obliged to do that to give you a chance to get over your side of the story well they can piss off cant they sure sometimes its easier for them if you do refuse to comment they only need to give you the opportunity jane said its just you know that id started to feel a bit bad about you thinking maybe you werent as majorly responsible as layla and i wanted to tell you what id done and now ive done that so like well go now she turned away it was beginning to get uncomfortably hot in this field anyway like the hay was extracting all the juice out of the sun eirion pulled the car keys out of his jeans kirsty sat up youre an evil little cow for a vicars daughter arent you less than ten minutes out of the centre of hereford you could be into deep countryside there werent many cities like this any more and the way things were going merrily thought as she thought almost every time she drove out of the city it wouldnt be long before hereford had become like the rest rampant megalomania disguised as essential economic growth egotripping councillors and unscrupulous developers allan henry sophie stopped the saab with two wheels on the grass verge near the top of a low hill a mile out of the straggling village of canon pyon they were in a quiet lane looking down on sloping woodland on its lower fringe the sun was reflected darkly from the huge picture windows on the side of a long brick villa that had been built on so many levels it seemed to cascade down the hill where they were now parked was probably the only place you could get a good view of allan henrys home the surrounding trees failed to conceal a wall with railings enclosing about two acres of garden suggesting allan henry must also own the land between the wall and the lane in fact merrily supposed he owned the whole hill what do we do now she was in need of a cigarette but sophie had a yellow and black no smoking sign on the dash and she meant it i suppose that depends on to what extent you think henry might be implicated sophie said personally i wouldnt even get out of the car think about it if we assume david shelbone is costing him hundreds of thousands of pounds maybe millions because if the hereford bypass goes through there the barnchurch estate would be gold dust then anybody might feel frustrated to the point of i mean people have killed for less havent they much less sophie nodded its frightening when you think about it which is why if i were you i wouldnt get out of the car so accepting that killing people can seriously damage your future allan henrys looking for ways of neutralizing a sober cleanliving godfearing man who cant be bought what are the most important things in shelbones life his family sophie said reluctantly wife daughter and his religion adopted daughter originally a fosterchild taken in by the shelbones under very difficult circumstances now david shelbone might think amys origins are a secret but quite a few people in and around social services will be aware of the history including councillors present or past in some quarters it would be quite an open secret sophie agreed it wouldnt take much for the information to get back via certain councillors to allan henry whose stepdaughter goes to the same school as amy this is very much the tricky part merrily but if you work from the premise that allan henry initially asks his stepdaughter what she knows about amy shelbone and layla tells him that amys this prissy stuckup little swot and from then on layla starts to take a particular interest in amy now why as a teenager would she particularly want to help her stepfather no sophie said they dont as a rule do they not without an incentive usually monetary has her stepfather told her the full background do you think that this girls father is a serious thorn in his side who could affect their future standard of living does he perhaps exaggerate that situation merrily thought of robert morrell on the phone the other night like a lot of wealthy men with potentially problematical stepchildren hes been throwing money at her for years mmm maybe he tells layla that if the barnchurch project goes down his business will be in ruins and her lovely new sports car will have to go she caught a glimpse of shimmering turquoise behind henrys villa or even the swimming pool i mean maybe he isnt exaggerating at all we dont know the size of his stake in barnchurch i dont normally like to encourage flights of fancy sophie said but i suppose there is a certain tainted logic to all this at some point allan henry tells layla what hes learned about amy shelbones history the background even amy herself doesnt yet know so then what happens most girls would simply confide it to a best friend and within a couple of days itd be all round the school and amy would probably become a more popular figure as a result attracting a lot more interest even some sympathy for a change but henry realizes that layla being layla is going to come up with something far more elaborate merrily thought of gypsy layla black hat dark veil predictions of death and destruction had layla also been aware that it was the father of amy shelbone whod complained about her at the christmas fair and ended her show the very same david shelbone who was now trying to shut down allan henrys show so gypsy layla becomes madame layla confidante of the dead in session every lunchtime in the caretakers hut she has at least one friend in on the secret and between them they work the glass she has a lovely name to play with justine she takes it very slowly feeding out bits at a time to amy there are probably usually other girls involved as well so it wont look suspicious like jane in fact and slowly and exquisitely little amy is hooked the barb really taking hold when amy went home and asked hazel shelbone certain questions saw the instant dramatic effect on hazel immediately amy would feel herself to be at the centre of this awful conspiracy her beloved adoptive parents had been lying to her for all these years the only person who wasnt lying to her was her real mother reaching out from beyond the grave layla with her sense of drama could create whatever kind of justine she needed for the purpose lonely sad unloved imploring and horribly seductive to an adolescent who perhaps did sometimes feel like an alien without previously having known why had something previously hidden been unblocked horrific memories awoken so gradually layla was feeding it out to amy blood in the church blood on the altar then heres dennis beckett in his vestments with his chalice the blood which he shed for you the blood of christ keep you in eternal life and amy shelbone kneeling in the chancel is getting a whole different slant on this all smelly and musty and horrible and its full of dead people there must have been some ghastly images in her head by then wayne jukes maddened with pain and shock half his face hanging off plunging the kitchen knife into justine and eternal life was some churchbound tortured spirit the big lie the great coverup merrily was rocking in the passenger seat everything suddenly making blinding sense he watches us suffer and die and he doesnt help us ever ever ever nobodys going to ever save you its all a horrible sick lie amy only knows one church one altar shes imagining her mother dead in dilwyn church she stopped hearing what else amy had screamed from her room and i dont i dont want to die in had justine predicted that amy too was going to be killed or at least die in church had she given some kind of terrible warning that made suicide seem like a soft option the essence of all this sophie said is that the child has been virtually programmed to turn against everything the shelbones cling on to if thats true then in its insidious way its actually extremely sophisticated almost satanic in its do you know what i mean in the way the poisons been introduced however i dont even see that any laws have been broken and i still dont think you should get out of this car you bastards kirsty ryan lay flat in the churned hay staring up at the deepening blue i dont know whether youre lying to me or what it dont matter either way to me though look cause i ent catching no armful of shit for that bitch i can tell you that much why dont you just tell us everything eirion suggested kirsty rolled her spiky head back into the hay who is this guy thinks hes geoffrey paxman just a friend jane explained thanks jane eirion said well all right a really good friend jane conceded kirsty grinned then whynt you both just go and have a roll behind that hedge and leave me alone eh please kirsty jane leaned over her this is really important kirsty sat up all right siddown got any blow naw forget it only kidding wouldnt do at the vicarage would it listen ill go so far and no further so dont go asking me more stuff when i say no and you keep me out of this right else ill come after you with the fourten ok jane sat down in the mown grass kirsty with a shotgun that was entirely believable we never even spoke to you this thing it got out of hand right i went so far with it then i was out finished i even tried to bust it all up but that didnt work so that was it i was outer there plus i mean in school you need diversions right you gotter have things to get you through it though i dont need that now do i i look like i got time to mess with the mind of some stupid little cow no jane said all right well its simple enough layla knew some things about shelbone look about her parents her real parents how did she eirion began but jane put a warning hand on his knee and he shut up like for instance that her dad knifed her ma to death in this church kirsty said jane clutched at the hay both of them bloody junkies both parents junkies and her dads a murderer and shelbones this holierthanthou paininthearse stuckup little cow whod grass you up to the teachers soon asunbelievable ennit where did this happen eirion asked somewhere up the midlands not round yere in a church jane felt numb now layla she had a very good reason to bring down that family on account it was shelbones ol man her adopted ol man that messed it up when layla done that gypsy thing at the christmas fair i wasnt there i was sick well ill tell you jane that was real scary that stuff she was coming out with when she gets in that gypsy gear its like shes another person wouldnt have my fortune told by her no way but thats beside the point the point is ol man shelbone protests that its unchristian and he gets it stopped so in laylas view they all got it coming to them now bigtime gypsies dont forget right and she done me a few favours mostly money you know so i couldnt say no to helping her stage the ouija but after a while i could tell this was fucking the kid up serious merrily gazed over the glass waterfall that was allan henrys home she thought about getting out going for a meditative walk around with a cigarette perhaps there was something obvious she was missing wheres her mother stand in all this she asked suddenly sandra henry sophie said sandra riddock you know her not personally but she worked for an estate agency where my sister was manager for a while it was how she met henry they were the agents for one of his first shoddy housing estates twelve fifteen years ago she was quite a beauty apparently i remember my sister saying that no one knew she even had a child then the father was a gypsy jane says i wouldnt know but youre right i do wonder if sandra henry knows what her daughters been up to i wonder if shes in i wonder if shes down there now on her own i wonder if laylas away supposedly staying with friends or something equally suspicious sophie stiffened on what basis would we be calling on her we well me id have to play it straight im a minister of the church ive just found out my daughters been involved in experiments to contact the dead along with mrs henrys daughter and a girl who attempted suicide as a priest im naturally very worried about that whats she going to do laugh it off turn me away youd be using jane im not using jane jane didnt even tell me about it dennis did all right sophie started the car lets try and find the entrance to the drive im told it isnt obvious i wont say on your head be it its both our heads youre a mate soph oh shut up sophie pulled into the lane drove very slowly down the hill it was very quiet there were no other houses or farms in the vicinity no cows or sheep grazed the hill as far as merrily could recall no other vehicle had passed them since theyd stopped likes his privacy evidently sophie stopped opposite a tarmacked opening on the right you think this is it try it sophie drove into the entrance the deep shade of big forest trees immediately closing over the car after about fifty yards they came to the perimeter wall with its railings on top a couple of brick gateposts eight or so feet high with metal gates open a black sign on the lefthand post decreed in yellow lettering no unauthorized entry probably be security cameras somewhere sophie guessed they passed a small bungalow with a van outside staff there i expect we supposed to check in i wonder nobody about anyway carry on on the left was a clearing in the trees sophie braked good heavens either its a reproduction or a museum piece or laylas dads dropped in the vardo stood alone it was crimson and gold like an outsize barrel organ it had ornate giltribbed panels a porch with sidebrackets like golden wheels and brass carriage lamps the windows had intricately patterned shutters the vardo looked immaculate out of a childrens picture book really has thrown money at her merrily thought for a couple of seconds she even wondered if amy shelbone was in there with gypsy layla too easy sophie murmured and drove on after a few yards the full sky reappeared as the drive widened into a forecourt with three vehicles in it a range rover a black porsche carrera and a small sleek yellow sports car there was a flight of about five stone steps up to a front door that was about the size and thickness of the one accessing ledwardine church a man came down the steps merrily got out of the car im looking for mrs henry are you indeed he wore jeans and an old cheesecloth shirt open to the waist gardener handyman security this is the right house isnt it merrily said and you are my names merrily watkins he nodded slowly waiting i just wanted to talk to mrs henry on a private matter i wouldve rung first but its exdirectory so it is he said well shes not here he looked her up and down like she might have a set of burglars tools under her jacket maybe i can help he put out a slow hand allan henry kirsty ryan said shed first started to get cold feet when she realized that amy shelbone had actually not known about her real dad killing her mother until they pulled the spirit scam on her in steves shed even layla was surprised how easy she went for it wed give her a bit of a spirit message from her ma and shed write it all down like it was tablets of stone and next day halftwelve on the dot shed come scampering across the field desperate to contact her ol lady again im saying ol lady she was just a kid herself when the bastard carved her up i was getting pissed off with it i mean a jokes a joke but you dont let it take over your life whose life eirion asked she needed it as much as the kid by then layla dont get the idea shes playing at this mate kirsty pushed a hand through her foxy hair shes into the gypsy thing in a big way whole shelves of books wardrobes full of exotic clobber the veils and the hats and the flouncy skirts she got crystals and a dozen packs of tarot cards she got her own gypsy caravan she mixes herbs and things shell do you a love token to get the bloke you want involving locks of your hair and his hair and ribbons and stuff calls herself a shuvani a gypsy sorcerer like ok once there was this bloke i fancied and i wanted to know if i was wasting my time right laylas like ok wait for the right time of the month gimme a tampax jane recoiled gross we make this necklace of beads out of clay and menstrual blood i was supposed to hang it on the guys locker and then if the beads had like dissolved by morning it meant he wasnt gonner be interested in the end i bottled out threw it away said somebody mustve nicked it i mean what she really believes this stuff eirion said its her life mate so she didnt think it was entirely a scam the spiritualism it started out that way like i said but when it began to work when the kids really gone for it shes like oh this is how it happens this is how it happens you know not really it was like she believed the kids ma really was in touch now she believes shes got the power all the things she told people at the christmas fair ever since shes been like oh mrs soandso just died you hear that i told her she was gonner die going on like that jane shivered theyre really cooking you know her and the kid i dont know how she found out about the murder i really dont but then she reckons a load of other stuffs coming through that she didnt know layla is very excited not that youd know that if you ent known her as long as me come the holidays no way does she wanner let go of little shelbone that afternoon after the heavy mob crash into stevies shed and bust us up im like right thats it you can count me out sister i got better things to do but shes already making other arrangements so you havent been in contact with layla since school broke up jane said she rang me a couple of times i said i was too busy next thing i hear about the kid chucking up in church well nobody knew what that was about except me i thought this has gone too far this is well over the bloody top next thing i hear shes tried to do away with herself thats spooky ennit kirsty stood up there it is you got the lot now eirion said youve known layla a long time then all my life give or take we were at the same little school at eardisley course they werent rich then her and her ma when allan henry come on the scene he wanted to take her away from moorfield to some private school but she wouldnt go you never met her father she never met her father she used to have like fantasies about him this mysterious gypsy he was probably some travelling scrapmetal dealer but she had him roaming europe in his romantic caravan seducing women with love potions and doing the business the business the magic doing the magic for his friends and cursing his enemies she got all the books and whenever there was gypsies in the area shed spend hours with them she even went off with the buggers once for two nights her ma went bloody spare and then oh yeah she cursed a teacher once we had this gym teacher at moorfield mrs etchinson gave us a hard time gave everybody a hard time team spirit all this shit layla was never a team player cursed her how jane asked this was probably before my time it mustve been before your time because everybody knew about it i dunno what she did the evil eye the bad words gravedirt in an envelope what happened put it this way within a few months it was confirmed shed got multiple sclerosis not good for a gym teacher that takes years to come on eirion pointed out she must have had it already that was what we said kirsty said but it does makes you think dont it it didnt give jane a good feeling she stood up too what did she do for steve to get him to lend her his shed more what she didnt do if you ask me kirsty said enigmatically like being considerate enough not to shrivel his genitals but shes still seeing amy look all i know is when she rang me she said amy was coming out to meet her at night like really at night when her parents were in bed shed ring amy on the little phone that amy kept under the pillow and layla would say the word and amy would be up and dressed and out the front door and layla would pick her up at the bottom of the lane where would they go i mean shed need somewhere with a table to lay all the letters out and no way kirsty said scornfully that is history what thats primitive stuff now they got well beyond the glass and the little bloody letters whats that mean you dont wanner know jane kirsty started to walk away she looked back over her beefy shoulder or more to the point i dont wanner know item allan henrys sitting room had one wall that was all plate glass perhaps forty feet long it had wide green views across to one of the conical wooded humps known as robin hoods butts appropriately according to legend the butts had been dumped there by the devil making him herefords first sporadic developer and this is your allan henry studied sophie evidently trying to decide whether she was mother or sister secretary sophie said quickly and firmly she and merrily were at either end of a white leather fourseater sofa one of two in the vast snowy room under their feet was a pale grey rug with an unusual design a tree growing through the centre of a wheel merrily didnt recall ever seeing sophie looking more agitated sophie wanted out of here sophie was old hereford to the core to her this man was the devil vicars have secretaries now allan henry said sophie works for the cathedral merrily told him and what do you do mrs watkins specifically erm official title deliverance consultant im afraid i dont have a card or or a dog collar so what is a its somebody who deals with problems of a paranormal nature merrily said for once without embarrassment used to be diocesan exorcist his eyes widened they still do that its never gone away mr henry well he leaned against the towering brick inglenook long mirrors either side of it reflecting the greenery im now trying to think if i have a problem of a paranormal nature lets see when things go bump in the night i can usually explain it and although i often have people leeching off me i wouldnt call them vampires can i offer you both a glass of wine he laughed that is can i offer you each a glass of wine thank you but im driving sophie said quickly and ill be driving in a short while merrily said not even one glass not even one between us honestly we dont have very long weve got a number of parents to see oh parents is it his local accent had been planed down to a light burr he was probably in his late forties he had strong lank hair deep lines tracking down his tanned face from eyes to jaw a modest beerbelly overhung his jeans but you had the feeling it was being gradually ironed out so why did you want to see my wife rather than me we didnt think youd be here merrily said we thought youd probably be out somewhere building something with my bare hands we all have our fantasies she said and then realized there were two ways he could take that sophie frowned at her sophie was sending out the message get out now make some excuse this is a mistake allan henry laughed he laughed merrily was noticing with a confidence that was almost selfconscious maybe hed had a lot of costly work done on his teeth was determined to get his moneys worth otherwise she sensed around him a kind of conserved energy she could imagine him in board meetings relaxed and expressionless and then jumping on someone without preamble like a jungle cat laughing maybe rare afternoon off he said you were lucky to catch me and my wifes away as it happens the only parent here is me a parent from my first marriage that is the youngsters live in france now so i dont see them very often perhaps well come back when your wifes at home sophie half rose its nothing terribly pressing unless its about layla of course he said shes with her mother merrily asked him i hardly think so her mothers on a cruise around the azores with her sister who was recently widowed poor woman thing is i dont think of layla as a child any more and shes my wifes daughter not mine this is about layla yes as he leaned forward a medallion on a black leather thong swung out from his bare chest it was clearly made of gold engraved on it was the symbol of a wheel yes merrily said its about layla sophie sank back in her seat with a leathery creak that sounded like a cry of pain jane said i remember mrs etchinson now it was at one of the prizegivings she was in a wheelchair a guest of honour everybody was making a fuss over her and she was smiling so much that you thought it must be hurting her all that smiling and somebody said she used to be a teacher and she had ms and i remember thinking god shes so young she flopped back into the soft leather and felt for eirions hand and squeezed hard as if to make sure she still could they were parked on the grass outside a farm shop overlooking the ledwardine valley the sunlit steeple of her mothers church poking out of the surrounding orchards like a terracotta rocket listen jane thats how they get these reputations eirion said they utter a curse and then something like that happens and everybody conveniently forgets how many curses have been laid on people who go on to have completely troublefree its the fact that she could even do it jane could feel tears of anger coming on wish illness and misfortune on someone you never done that in a fit of pique wish that someone would have a bad time yeah but i dont ever believe its gonna have any effect whatsoever and then i take it back anyway in a couple of minutes or a couple of hours or before i go to sleep whereas riddock she believes like totally that she can do it and then she does it it doesnt matter whether she gave mrs etchinson this awful degenerative disease with the gravedirt in the envelope or whatever the fact that she wanted to thats just as bad isnt it it comes back on you though doesnt it eirion said karma allegedly but not necessarily in this life sounds to me he said thoughtfully like she needs this kid amy as much as the kid needs her you know what i mean she lays a curse and somebody falls ill or dies or something well she isnt really sure is she she might like to fantasize but she knows thats all it is but when she sets up this spiritualism scam then suddenly shes getting what seem to be real messages from the other side how trance automatic writing whatever it is its proof to her that shes got the power shes a medium now shes a shaman and maybe thats never happened before except with this young kid whos so precious she drove her to attempt suicide jane said what do you want to do then its getting a bit late if im going to get the car back before nightfall youve got hours yet but sure by all means drop me somewhere to do what ill think of something theres only one thing you can do you can go home and lay the whole lot on your mum and leave it to her eirion nodded down at the valley stop putting it off shell probably be a bit gobsmacked to see us why do i doubt that eirion said what they told allan henry was that a teenage girl had tried to take her own life after being drawn into ouijaboard experiments at school the deliverance service was trying to establish how widespread the craze was and whether other children were at risk or in distress merrily said finally that a number of kids had mentioned layla riddock as the girl presiding over psychic sittings at moorfield high school close as it was to the truth the story sounded worryingly thin to merrily and foreboding arose just a second or so before allan henry got to work on it well he sat in a steelframed swivel armchair his left ankle resting on his right knee i didnt know about this it came out through the hospital where the child was taken sophie had evidently assumed responsibility for any necessary lying when a schoolchild takes a potentially lethal overdose quite a lot of people start wanting to know why in this case as the parents are churchgoers no thats not what i meant what i didnt know mrs hill was that the anglican church had its own investigative branch its not quite like that merrily said because you see i find that very disturbing are the lay police also involved not yet sophie said not yet i see he was silent for a short while during which merrily became aware of a giltframed painting on the wall high in the alcove to the right of the great fireplace in glowing colours style of gauguin it showed an unsmiling black woman robed and veiled with either a crown or an ornate halo over the headdress ok let me get this entirely correct allan henry said slowly neither the tone nor the pitch of his voice had altered only the sense of laughter had gone on behalf of the church of england you are accusing my stepdaughter of psychologically abusing young children the absolute accuracy of this left merrilys mind momentarily blank she couldnt meet his eyes and went on staring at the picture of the black virgin we dont accuse people mr henry sophie was saying we try to help them where we can mrs hill is it the reverend mrs hill certainly not you have to excuse me for feeling threatened mrs hill you two women arrive at my door like jehovahs witnesses with some assumed authority look merrily said its not about the individuals involved its about the practice itself and what it can release psychologically if you like it might seem harmless a game though i dont think it is but this is certainly not a witchhunt as soon as the word was out she wanted to snatch it back but it was too late allan henry caught it in the air like a fist closing over a fly witchhunt now thats a very interesting term the church has a long history of persecuting minorities im sorry persecuting kids minorities i said not minors if we look at the romany culture for instance theyve been subjected to the most appalling discrimination and persecution over the years the world over because of their customs their lifestyle and of course their well yes but no no let me tell you about layla shes a very serious young woman very mature for her age with a brilliant academic career ahead of her and she has romany blood which gives her a striking presence that some people find intimidating and also certain abilities that some people cant accept ignorance breeds prejudice twas ever thus mrs watkins ever thus merrily was aghast youre implying theres something racial behind this again your term mr henry all im concerned about she wished she was the other side of the plate glass she would run and run all the way to robin hoods butts is kids dabbling with the dead that kind of worries me i cant stop them all i can do is advise them that they could be messing with something that cant easily be controlled in your culture cant be controlled in your culture lets say not easily i think he said that you need to consider your position very carefully before you come here and accuse someone you dont know of pressuring a child into suicide like one of those mad californian cultleaders oh you know thats not we should go merrily sophie stood up allan henry didnt move im not pushing you out im just warning you to be very very sure of your ground these are terribly serious allegations which could have repercussions merrily felt mauled he hadnt even raised his voice or moved his ankle from his knee persecution she wanted to cry out what about david shelbone but she knew the most that would get her would be a writ or an injunction by morning he hadnt got this far without being able to push people over with one finger like dominoes she suspected there would indeed be repercussions from this everything shed touched lately there were repercussions ok im sorry if she stood up her face felt hot as she rose she became aware of a group of objects laid out on a ledge in a small cavity inside the fireplace acorns two dice a magnet something that might have been a rabbits foot allan a woman had entered the room through a narrow archway at the furthest end she had on a fulllength black kimono open over a tiny white bikini she wore sunglasses she carried a champagne glass halffilled allan she said i didnt leave my mobile allan henry stood up layla he said warmly we were just talking about you merrily could almost feel sophies stomach contract ethel met them on the driveway and jane picked her up and carried her round to the back where they found gomer parry placidly weeding the path welshies throw you out is it gomer said they found my arms cache and there was this car chase but we made it over the border

take him on one side somebody he really trusts and believes in and why dont you invite lol over sometime you know hes never going to invite himself you ever think about the future mum what its going to be like when ive gone actually jane felt kind of resentful if you wanted the truth mum going behind her back giving it a little try at lols love nest in bromyard to see if things worked out and if they didnt that would be it and jane would be none the wiser if she called her on the mobile she could pretend to be at home anywhere bloody sneaky really just when you thought you knew how certain people would react to a given situation they did something to surprise you shock you even in a way it made jane feel a lot better about not immediately telling mum what had gone on in steves shed shes still fairly young eirion said when gomer had gone and they were in the kitchen yeah jane said airily sure its always hard to imagine your parents still feeling oh come on i know that dont be patronizing irene hes a good bloke eirion said i know that too and interesting an artist and vulnerable women like guys who are vulnerable and a little askew askew you know eirion was sitting at the kitchen table with his chin in his hands he eyed her sheepishly eyebrows disappearing into his hair what would a guy have to do to appear a little askew hmmm jane came to a decision little bloody sioned and lowri werent here gomer had gone to sink a cesspit mum was out east finding out if everything still worked after all these years even ethel was a cat of the world irene jane said did i ever tell you about the mondrian walls eirion lifted his chin out of his hands this would be in your apartment on the top floor formerly attics where you painted the plaster squares between the timbers in different primary colours in the style of the great dutch abstract painter correct it sounded very experimental jane nodded i thought maybe you could give me your expert critical assessment well eirion stood up im not an expert good jane said jane wasnt wrong there was something forbidding about layla riddock a big girl with a mature not to say ripe figure a mass of dark brown curly hair still slick from the pool she had smoky brown eyes under heavy brows she was seventeen going on thirtyeight and darkly radiant and she was here she was here as in not in the black country with amy shelbone layla love allan henry said excuse me but these ladies would like to know if you have much regular contact with the dead layla riddock backed away mockstartled wrapping her kimono and her arms around her we talking about necrophilia she cocked her head necrophilias useless for women isnt it i mean rigor mortis doesnt last right allan henry laughed again for the first time in several minutes as if a little light had come back into his life no actually layla he said this could be very serious for somebody this is mrs hill and mrs watkins mrs watkins is a minister of the church of england and it seems one of her parishioners a young girl from your school has attempted to take her own life layla nodded casually amy shelbone oh he said you know about this do you merrily was watching him closely now she saw nothing no obvious reaction from henry to the name shelbone and there really should have been shouldnt there sad layla said but horribly predictable im afraid thats one disturbed little girl really allan henry looked at merrily and sophie in turn triumph in his eyes then back at his stepdaughter layla would you tell us about this about what about any previous dealings you might have had with this young child please layla shrugged not much to tell ive never made any secret about my bloodline and so im always getting approached by kids who want their palms read or their cards or something anyway one day a few weeks ago i suppose up comes this rather solemn little girl says would i help her contact her mother for heavens sake her mother is you know dead she approached you did she this little girl oh yeah very politely i told her not to be silly i told her that whatever she may have heard about the rom we have great respect for the dead but we dont get involved with them on a personal level i said you know like run along and that was the last you heard layla sighed wrapped her kimono tighter in frustration wish i could say it was next thing i hear that some other students principally a girl called kirsty ryan have taken amy under their wing and theyre holding these kind of seance things what dyou call them where you lay out letters in a circle and have a glass upside down merrily said nothing anyway i thought id better check it out theres a lot of this stuff about the school lately little witchcrafty groups popping up awfully childish i dont like to see kids playing at it if you have psychic skills its your responsibility to develop them sensibly if you havent got it dont mess with it so yeah i found them in this shed on one of the fields and i layla paused and smiled im afraid i arranged a little surprise layla glanced around holding court now a dominant kind of girl robert morrell had said perhaps the kind of girl where all the teaching staff both sexes would be relieved when she left school it was hard to believe this woman was only about a year older than jane it was also hard to believe shed want to waste time on a little girl like amy shelbone what did you do layla allan henry was taking a back seat playing the feed the straight man and proud to do it merrily thought which was interesting in itself i grassed them up layla said smugly i discreetly tipped off one of the staff and there was a raid caught them at it allan henry said layla put up both her hands absolutely nothing to do with me she wore five rings all gold everyone was quiet it was not so difficult to believe that layla riddock would consider her natural peers to be found among the staff rather than the pupils allan henry glanced at merrily and sophie in turn again he was smiling gently very mature for her age good for you merrily said hoarsely to layla and the schoolgirl smiled at her too the tip of her tongue childishly touching a corner of her mouth but her eyes were cold with malice merrily felt sure it was malice you cant touch us the smile said you cant get near us neither of them said a word until they were in the lane heading back towards canon pyon merrily was expecting a hard time stay away sophie had advised back in the office what would be the point and then in the car if i were you i wouldnt get out when had sophie ever not been right she was looking at her most severe sitting stiffly eyes on the road both hands positioned precisely on the wheel like she was taking her driving test merrily sat with her bag on her knees a hand inside playing with the cigarettes she couldnt keep the hand still im sorry sophie sophie said nothing but you could almost hear her thoughts ricocheting like pellets from the upholstery and the windscreen and the dash it was a very bad idea merrily said i should not have dragged you into it shed crushed a cigarette strands of tobacco teased between fingers and thumb i dont know how hell get back at us but he will i was useless in there i let him walk all over us a corrupt developer a crook and i let him let them both walk all over us sophie turned right towards hereford and the car speeded up a mile or so along the road she said mildly theyre an item arent they those two the sky was flawless the blue deepening across the edge of the city you could see all the way to the hooked nose of the skirrid the holy mountain above abergavenny merrily closed her bag on the tobacco mess im glad you said it first is sandra really away on a cruise i wonder maybe shes buried in the garden he can do anything cant he hes got everybody in his pocket and now hes sleeping with his stepdaughter merrily was momentarily horrified at how high her voice had risen he might sail close to the wind sophie said but hes not stupid i expect sandra is on a cruise quite a long cruise so you think she knows wouldnt you i wonder how long its been going on a more interesting question is which of them initiated it sophie said a very lucky man charlie howe had observed thingsve fallen his way and people have fallen out of his way sophie said the girl was lying rather cleverly wasnt she beautifully forget about the trinkets thats probably the best evidence of genuine romany ancestry im sorry theyre supposed to consider it an art form lying mmm and what else do you know about them not enough not yet anyway well forget about it for tonight sophie said get a good nights sleep if inspector howe or anyone else rings wanting to speak to you ill put them off no put them through youre getting personally involved thats not helpful to anyone i am personally involved and now theres a child missing only two three years between amy shelbone and layla riddock but one was a child and one was a woman merrily folded her hands in her lap couldnt keep them still a teenage girl had done this to her she closed her eyes breathed in sophie she said could i possibly have a cigarette the cure of souls ha he said the drukerimaskri he seemed to be dancing in the last of the dusk willothewispish the late evening was rich and close the atmosphere laden with herbal scents there was going to be a full moon merrily said drukeri maskri its a romany term al boswells white hair flurried as he did a little bow she suspected he was mocking her a lantern hung from the bowed roof of the vardo a thick candle inside it on the grass in front of the wagon a heavy wooden table was set up with bentwood chairs a shaggy donkey browsed nearby in the distance beyond the building housing the hop museum glittered the tiered lights of malvern al boswell presented himself in front of lol hands behind his back wheres your guitar why didnt you bring your guitar we could have played for the moon lol told him prof had insisted the guitar was a shortterm loan besides it didnt seem appropriate al boswell arched his back like a thin white cat relevant seemly all those lol said plus you cant surely be afraid to play alongside an old man whose arthriticky fingers slur drunkenly over the frets tonight i can manage without total humiliation lol admitted certainly not in the presence of the lovely drukerimaskri i am not going to ask what it means merrily thought or are you afraid the drukerimaskri would think it was wrong to play for the moon and besides look at her shes in a hurry theres no time shes on hot bricks she needs the information therefore she might find you trivial al boswell walked right up to lol peered into his eyes and that would never do al for gods sake the beautiful frail silvery woman in the long skirt came down the steps of the wagon carrying a tray with glasses on it hes such a terrible walking cliche sometimes she said to merrily except of course in the presence of other romanies on which rare occasions hes almost withdrawn shes such a bitch tonight al boswell howled he took lol on one side so have you heard from levin the donkey had ambled up to merrily and she ran her fingers through his heavy fur and gazed into his billiardball eyes there was an unreality about the night or perhaps a hyperreality a sensual intensity she hadnt been prepared for lol had brought her here and suddenly she wanted lol to take her away again she wanted to be alone with him things needed to be said worked out if that were possible youre terribly tense arent you mrs boswell was standing next to her and exhausted im going to fetch you something that might help no honestly its merrily let the donkey nibble at the sleeve of her jacket whats his name stanley does that mean something in romany i do hope not merrily smiled a wave of tiredness washed over her and the lights of malvern blurred about stock mrs boswell looked insubstantial in the dusk like steam like a ghost but for the glasses on a chain you felt you could have put a hand through her theres nothing you could have done it shouldnt have been allowed to happen but theres nothing you could have done you werent to know know what mrs boswell didnt reply merrily let it go a false trail probably this woman didnt look at all like a gypsy but shed been married to one for many years whats a drukerimaskri merrily said al called you that originally i think it meant soothsayer then it became applied to christian priests who could lay spirits to rest drukerimaskro is the more familiar form in the masculine an exorcist a healer of souls merrily held on to the donkey and looked for lol healer of souls the song had been happening when she got back to knights frome just after seven pm shed insisted on driving back in the volvo which had meant first returning to the office and submitting to two cups of sweet tea a biscuit a paracetamol and a dissertation on the parameters of responsibility the bishops back tomorrow sophie had reminded her finally seeing her to the car im going to advise him to put off the inevitable formal meeting with you until next week id rather get it over with and admit to things for which you were not to blame sophie held open the door of the volvo i dont think so if i lose the job i lose the job there were things i got wrong im not just going to keep denying everything to preserve my dubious status merrily sophie said very clearly i have to tell you id be more than pleased for your sake at least if you were to leave deliverance behind for ever merrily stared at her in dismay but certainly not under the present circumstances id never forgive myself if you went down for either gerard stock or allan henry and layla riddock now go back and get an early night ill talk to you in the morning sophie pushed the car door closed except it didnt this was an old car and you had to slam the door merrily opened it again to do that overheard what sophie was muttering to herself as she walked away shed sat there with the door hanging open maybe her mouth as well until sophie was out of sight then to avoid having to think shed snatched the mobile and called david shelbone at home intending this time to insist he get the police in no answer in the silence of the bishops palace yard shed prayed for the shelbones and then started the car and put on the stereo very loud something sparking with ideas but not too profound gomez abandoned shopping trolley hotline at pm shed driven out of the lane from knights frome and on to the nowfamiliar track parking the volvo between the stables and the cottage lols astra sat there years older than the trees prof levin had planted to screen off his studio in profs absence nature was running things again green hazelnuts in the uncut boundary hedge and a golddust haze on the seeded long grass of what was supposed to be a lawn the stable door was open and merrily went into the kitchen area putting down her bag on the breakfastbar packing case walking down the short passage to the studio door it was ajar she peered through the gap some of the stable remained as it had been three of the stalls turned into recording booths lol was sitting in one his back to the door a guitar on his knee on the smaller of the two tape machines to her left she could see spools revolving hed be laying down a demo for prof levin she knew hed had his orders there was a pair of headphones hanging from a metal bracket beside the tape machine she could hear the tinnitus buzz of music and she slipped off her shoes and padded across the air was still and warm feeling like whatever was the aural equivalent of a voyeur she slipped on the cans the music stopped shit lol murmured wearily into her head there was silence then a string was retuned the crisp acoustic was frighteningly intimate she could hear his breathing the movements of his fingers on the machineheads lol said take six the guitar in minor chord was awesomely deep and full this kind of weighted fingerstyle sounding like a piano she felt like she was inside the soundbox and somehow also inside the heart of the guitarist and tears came into her eyes as lols voice came in low and nasal and smoky and the first shockingly resonant line fell like a stone into a deep deep well as you kneel before your altar merrily froze lol stopped he cleared his throat he sighed seven he said merrily had been holding on to the sides of the tape deck as if she was part of the machine recording it too every softly explosive questioning phrase she recalled lol waiting for her in the dappled quiet of the church at knights frome reexperienced his expression of loss as she emerged from the vestry as a priest he began again as you kneel before your altar can you see the wider plan can you hear the one youre talking to can you love him like a man did you suffocate your feelings as you redefined your goals and vowed to undertake the cure of souls merrily had hung up the cans and walked rapidly out of the stable with her shoes under her arm the stones and baked mud brutal on the soles of her feet the black virgin al boswell said sara la kali candles in bottles dramatized his goblin profile hed calmed down now after a couple of glasses of wine and the four of them were sitting around the wooden table outside the vardo medieval french saint merrily recalled linked to mary magdalene a servant was this the woman in the unlikely picture on allan henrys sitting room wall gypsies in france became strongly identified with the catholic pilgrimage of saintesmariesdelamere in the camargue sally boswell said this is where the three marys mary salome mary jacobe and mary magdalene were said to have landed and where their relics are presumed to have been found under the church and later in a bronze chest the remains of their black servant sara why did the gypsies adopt this sara lol leaned away from the candlelight his elbows on the table hiding the holes in the famous alien sweatshirt theyre a great paradox the rom said sally boswell flamboyant volatile and yet subtle and secretive they were pagans originally some still are but most adopted the dominant religion of whichever country they travelled they may have chosen sara because she was the humblest of the saints the most unassuming the least obtrusive lol nodded he would understand that given the options shed have been his patron saint as well merrily thought tears pricking again she was overtired that was the problem or sally went on they may have seen her as a christian incarnation of the hindu goddess kali there was talk of blood sacrifice but i think thats an exaggeration or a corruption of the truth hmm merrily said after leaving the studio shed walked through the fields for a while before going up to her cell in the cottage shed washed and changed come down and then she and lol had raided profs fridge for scraps of salad while she told him about layla riddock and allan henry and the objects in the big white room the picture on the wall the conclusion she and sophie had come to and then lol had suggested al and sally boswell might throw some more light on this and hed phoned them can i ask you about some symbols she said to al the wheel for instance on its own like a cartwheel with spokes al glanced at his wife money she said wealth so a gold talisman with a wheel engraved on it worn around the neck would obviously be designed to promote wealth i wouldnt wear one al poured himself more wine ok merrily moved on a group of objects acorns dice a rabbits foot oh and a magnet al drank then put down his glass to which you might want to add a few gold coins and a magnifying glass because this person whoever it is wants or needs considerable wealth why wouldnt you wear the talisman merrily asked you would want unearned wealth little drukerimaskri but youre not a priest his eyes flashed how do you know that sorry i dont know that he sniffed sharply my father was a chovihano wellknown guy a shaman a healer a healer of souls and bodies and the living and the dead not many left in the world now its hereditary he looked glum sometimes but you need to work at it its a calling a commitment youd understand that me i was a disappointment to my family he offered the bottle round got no takers poured more wine for himself no youre quite right im not a priest youre not rich either lol said you dont make enough guitars you could have had a boswell guitar factory turning out thousands like i dunno the martin family mother of god al half rose the wine spilled and the candle flame wavered not that i was actually advocating that lol said just making the point valid quite valid al shook his head sadly sat down and topped up his glass again im no businessman lol and no chovihano ive lived too long in gaujoland but i try to honour the old code which is about living lightly on the earth taking what you need taking selectively taking secretly sometimes taking in a way so that nobody notices that what youve taken has gone its not quite stealing if nobody notices its not there any more this was questionable morality but merrily was too tired to ask the questions she sipped some of the sweet soft drink that sally had brought her it apparently contained hops and nettles you want to know the truth of it im still paying back al drained his wineglass in one im paying back for the one time when i took and it was noticed how could it fail to be bloody well noticed and thats how i brought a curse upon my own family why i live among the gaujos and keep my head down its why we have a museum devoted to hops and most of the romany memorabilias in the back room behind a locked door sally boswell said in a low voice you could have paid you get off my back al growled there was an uncomfortable silence a bat flittered in an arc over the table merrily had one more question what about a wheel with a tree through it al looked up where did you see that it was a design on a rug in the house of the man with the wealth talisman nothing particularly to do with wealth he poured the last of the wine a dribble and pulled over another bottle the wheel would be the medicine wheel the tree is the tree of life comes in three sections the branches are in the upper world of vision and inspiration the middle where the wheel goes through is about our life and dealing with it the roots are in the lower world of the ancestors and the dead the gypsy dead arent in the upper world al smiled ruefully sally said not all gypsies believe in a heaven and anyway the dead are gone and must stay gone the dead are unhealthy death pollutes a place meant for living so when someone was dying it used to be that they were taken out of their home and put in a tent or a bender the person is always washed and dressed in fresh clothes before death it was coming out pat now merrily thought the museum curators voice also in romany society the names of recently dead people must never be mentioned lest this might call them back at one time when a gypsy died his vardo would be set alight with all his possessions so there would be nothing in this world to draw him back of course these days al said the vardo is worth a lot of money but its still usual for something to be ritually burned something closely associated with the dead person there was an important question here merrily couldnt untangle it lol did so gypsies dont try to communicate with the dead not recommended sally said but isnt that what a shaman does talks to the spirits merrily nodded gratefully this was it their ancestors mainly sally said which is different also spirits of nature spirits of living things everything has a spirit this table those trees the river frome a guitar lol said al turned slowly smart boy merrily saw that lols face was alight with understanding all the wood for each guitar you take sparingly he said so that it isnt missed so maybe even the tree doesnt have to die aha al leaned back a knuckle depressing his cheek two fingers making a v around an ear so that the living spirit of the tree or trees all those different species goes into the guitar lol said and maybe you consult the tree spirit first to make sure its ok to take the wood al pointed a long forefinger and ill tell you something else lol boy if you ever bring that instrument back youll be insulting those spirits have you thought of that he flung back his head and laughed directly above the table merrily was aware of the full moon the colour of custard cream it seemed warmer than the day had been as if the moon was putting out its own heat she said carefully so a gypsy who was attempting to arouse the dead for whatever reason sally said you know of a gypsy doing this i know of somebody trying to do it somebody claiming to have a gypsy father a poshrat al boswell asked sounds vaguely appropriate halfbreed is this the same person seeking wealth seeking even more wealth would be more accurate and ensuring his wealth involves damaging another person a family in fact have nothing to do with this person al said erm its my job mr boswell his face was blank in the milky moon and candlelight what at the end of it all is so important about a bloody job its a gaujo thing lol said black magic al said flatly raising the dead to damage another person or acquire wealth thats the black arts and also let me tell you its far too stupid a thing for a traditional romany ever to go near there are no evil romanies lol said you dont understand boy romanies respect sometimes consult the ancestors but they let the dead lie most of us dont even like to touch a body after death this is about fear he leaned towards merrily and into the candlelight as if he was concerned that she should see how agitated he was listen to me drukerimaskri i want to tell you and this also concerns the other thing the thing in the kiln i want to say to you dont ever trust the dead in merrilys bag she jumped her phone began to shrill just like it had in the stocks bedroom when she could have sworn it was switched off she didnt touch the bag go on she said to al the phone went on bleeping al glancing nervously at the bag as if this might be a spirit coming through ill get it if you like lol said merrily nodded gratefully dug in the bag and pulled out the phone handed it to him lol took it over to the boundary fence we have a word al said and he whispered it mulo this is the romany word for a ghost the same word this word is also used for a vampire the living dead sally boswell was silently observing her husbands melodramatics with a faintly sardonic expression but her skin looked whiter than the moon the point being i think that we dont see that much of a difference al said merrily didnt know how to react to this was she supposed to say something inane about not all ghosts sucking your blood the moon picked out a circle of pink as perfect as a tonsure on the crown of als white head this is our dead im talking about we dont worry about your dead well settle down to sleep in your cemeteries any night of the week we believe that the romany dead we believe they dont come back for no reason and theyll leech off you theyll steal your lifeenergy theyll keep on taking it until youre a cored and cancerous husk we are very afraid drukerimaskri of the vengeful power of our dead she didnt really know what he meant she didnt understand what he was saying to her lol came and sat down again but said nothing nervously merrily drank some more of the nettles and hops the night was suddenly swollen with tension whatever it is sally said to lol youd better tell her well go away and leave you no its ok its no big secret lol handed the phone across the table to merrily it was sophie the police are trying to get hold of you merrily drew a fearful breath she was thinking of amy shelbone david shelbone not answering his phone theres been an incident at the remand centre in shrewsbury where gerard stock was taken he um lol cleared his throat stocks hanged himself left to hang the turned hay was a rich confection baking under the moon merrily stood on the hard mud track that bisected the meadow below profs place the mobile damp against her ear a cigarette in her other hand the air was so very still and dci annie howes voice so crisp and distinct and authoritative it was like the news was being broadcast to the whole valley easier for them to do it in remand centre she explained as if she was talking about laundry or something fewer personal restrictions there as they havent been convicted of anything theyre not forced to wear prison clothing the full moon merrily was thinking outraged she and lol had walked all the way back from the boswell hop museum before shed felt able to make the call to hereford police why the hell dont they watch them more carefully under a full moon unfortunately its not too infrequent an occurrence annie howe said theres more of an element of loneliness and despair among remand prisoners but a man of stocks apparent intellect and resilience i have to say i wouldnt have expected it from him and i do wonder what pushed him over the edge did he suddenly realize he enormity of what hed done was it remorse or had something perhaps altered his state of mind meaningful pause what do you think ms watkins merrily thought about the court scenario lol and she had built from what they knew of the mind of gerard stock she didnt like howes innuendo but she let it go how did he do it with his shirt annie howe said the shirt was torn and soaked hed urinated on it and rolled it up tight not a cry for help then merrily said dully his white shirt white for innocence white for the side of the angels out in the endless darkness gerard stocks heavy body was revolving slowly his feet inches from the floor dont really know what the fuck youre doing do you youre a waste of time geddout stock revolving slowly for ever an obscene enigma i do feel obliged to warn you howe said that all legal barriers must now be considered down no impending court case any more only inquests no ones freedoms at stake so the gates are wide open the media can go in now with all its fangs bared you understand what im saying merrily said nothing she imagined howe in her halflit office relishing the moment it means they can exploit the exorcism angle to the full howe said they can print whatever they like i cant stop them even if you wanted to and it means of course that theyll come after you ms watkins if they arent after you already i expect youll give them a full description merrily said so they dont miss me everything under the full moon was bright and sharply defined the crisp ridges of hay a line of graceful poplars lol still and compact standing looking down at his trainers i should get some sleep howe said its been a fairly stressful couple of days for you i imagine she didnt say but nothing compared with the stress to come eirion sat up in horror staring around the moonwashed attic oh my god oh my god he bounced out of bed ran to the window look at it what its bloody dark its got to be after ten jane put on the light five past no sweat she looked at him head to bare toes she smiled doesnt take the little guy long to shrink does it jane im dead i wouldnt go that far on the mondrian walls the moon spotlit the yellow rectangle and the blue square and jane sighed in some kind of weird rapture irene isnt life sometimes so really quite good in spite of everything it eirion came back and sat on the bed and tenderly stroked her hair well yes yes it is but theres always a vague downside like we fell asleep we werent supposed to fall asleep afterwards were we jane it happens jane shrugged knowledgeably release of sexual tension even if i leave now im not going to get back until the early hours so dont leave theyll have locked me out youve got a key theyll have barred the doors out of entirely justified spite just say the car broke down jane its a twoyearold bmw its still under warranty plus we didnt even say we were going anywhere you know what jane said what i dont actually care a lot she linked her hands behind her head she felt like all woman the car your family all this is so not a problem eirion looked into her eyes and amy shelbone he said ah jane went quiet that was a problem yes oh god i think we were going to see amy werent we eirion said either before or after or instead of ringing your mum if you recall we looked up the address in the phone book some hours ago irene what are we going to do she was confused part of her wildly happy the rest horribly anxious the combination bringing her to the brink of tears i mean what are we going to do about amy now yes he stood up again i guess we do have to do something because that would like destroy everything wouldnt it if it dont go imagining things jane irene that stuff you couldnt even imagine it everything came back to her in the tough noshit tones of kirsty ryan theyre really cooking you know her and the kid she covered herself with the duvet as if some astral layla riddock might be watching her from the shadows you couldnt dream it up could you no eirion walked around discovering into which corners hed thrown his clothes how long would it take us to get over there dilwyn ten fifteen minutes but suppose shes already in bed then she can get up cant she at least if shes in bed shes not going to run away go on get dressed i wont watch you dont want to watch yes id love to watch thats eirion gathered up his jeans why im getting dressed in the bathroom irene jane slipped on her bra eirion paused at the door you will come in with me wont you at the shelbones youre more likely to convince the parents than i am sure were an item arent we official i jane smiled a little stiffly wondering how she felt about that like postcoitally hey she reached down to the little pile of her clothes lying beside the bed maybe he left a suicide note lol said they were on the wooden footbridge the river was down there somewhere but even the full moon couldnt find it lol was standing over the frome which went nowhere in particular maybe aching to join another river before it was too late if he refused to make a statement merrily said i dont see him leaving a note do you lol didnt have an answer to that he couldnt imagine why a man like that would ever have hanged himself taking gerard stock out of the picture robbing the world of a sensational trial at which he might easily have put up a strong defence with merrily watkins left to hang sophie mention the media he asked yes so do you want to risk staying here risk she was wearing a blue cotton skirt a top the colour of the moon a small gold cross on a chain she looked very small what are they going to do to me the press are only people in the pack they tend to lose their humanity well see what happens look i she brought out her phone id better call david shelbone again she switched on the phone and the screen came up green merrily put in a number and listened engaged what was it al told you lol said when i was taking the call what was al so keen to tell you oh hed had a little too much wine something about not trusting the dead he was talking about the gypsy dead romany ghosts what he called the mulo he said gypsies were terrified of their own ghosts though they didnt give a toss about ours it didnt seem entirely logical to me but what do i know he say anything about there being a presence in the kiln only in passing she stepped onto the footpath on the other side of the bridge but it doesnt matter now does it nothing to explain to the crown court just an inquest lol followed her and yourself if you cant somehow explain it to yourself youll never trust deliverance again will you well sure id rather have got myself shredded in the witness box have the whole exorcism thing held up as some kind of tawdry medieval spoof than lose another life she waited for him by the first of the poplars the moonlight on her face shadows under her eyes or maybe im fooling myself maybe im secretly glad hes dead because hed already set me up and he was probably going to do it again you dont have it in you to be glad anyones dead he said as a vicar not even lets be honest here as a person oh well you you kind of stop being a person when you join the church merrily said you have to learn to suffocate your feelings it went so quiet you could even hear the frome moving below ah lol said redefine your goals that kind of thing damn lol said nice tune merrily said they both stood with their backs to the door so there was no way out short of physical violence and although they were both seriously into middle age they were big people she was kind of pudgyarmed and hefty and he was tall and thin and although he didnt look too well he did look desperate enough to damage somebody like for instance somebody who might know where his daughter was but was refusing to tell him honest to god jane said scared we didnt even know she was missing we came here to see her invoking god because it looked like this might well cut some ice here the room was too bright from a big white ceiling bowl loaded with highwattage bulbs there was a wooden crucifix on the mantelpiece over the calor gas fire and round the walls these really awful religious paintings by one of those pedantic preraphaelite guys who thought it was important to paint every blade of grass individually i wouldnt lie jane insisted my mums a vicar i wasnt brought up to lie ok your mother knows youre here then said mr shelbone he had a weak voice that sounded kind of laminated and jane felt slightly sorry for him it was clear his wife called the shots of course she doesnt mrs shelbone snapped her mother seems to know very little of what goes on jane let the slur go past no she doesnt but only because i feel responsible for dropping her in it when i didnt tell her at the time because i didnt think there was anything particular to worry about but now i know i was wrong and i want to put it right she drew a long breath why should we believe you mrs shelbone demanded how do we know youre not just sensationseeking this is silly janes only trying to help eirions welsh accent coming through thats all she wants and to find out whats going on and what said mr shelbone is going on in your opinion jane swallowed it was one thing telling amy what kind of psychotic slag layla riddock was it was something else laying it on her parents in her absence serious as this whole thing could turn out to be it broke some kind of code of honour you didnt grass until you reached the stage where it was impossible to deal with it yourself this didnt seem to worry eirion however maybe hed just had it with the whole thing or maybe he thought this was the stage it comes down to bullying mr shelbone your daughters been picked on by an older girl who evidently thinks shes something special picked on ensnared you must know what im talking about especially as its been suggested to us today that she this girl might have wanted to use amy to get atwell to get at you mr shelbone was silent once eirion mentioned the christmas fair layla riddock would be in the frame best to leave it here jane decided they should say as little as possible get out and go and grovel to mum let her decide what to do sit down mr shelbone indicated a sofa in a pine frame like the bottom half of a bunk jane said we have to be eirion just shrugged and went over to the sofa and sat down now then son said mr shelbone lets start at the beginning well her names layla riddock eirion said confluence lol tensed there was the tower across the fields just as hed seen it the first time the tip of its witchs hat askew as if a lowflying aircraft had clipped it he remembered how hed thought it looked like a fairy castle with that glow in the window where a glow was now what merrily demanded theres he sagged his back to a tree trunk the breath forced out of him as if hed been punched sorry its just the moon its just a reflection of the moon it seemed to be everywhere tonight what did you think it was how about we go back he searched for the path then spotted where hed gone wrong the last time there was a stile he could have climbed over to follow a circular route back to the bridge and another path that led into the tangled wood merrily erm lol how do i get to the old hopyard where you saw stephanie that night oh no lol stood in the middle of the path i really dont think so lol merrily tell me thats why were here look she said i havent got the gear i havent got the holy water i havent got the sacrament but i can pray i can do the words words words to get them out of here who stock stephanie call it precautionary call it to stop them becoming earthbound right to fix it so nobody in the future goes for an innocent walk in that field and lol actually shivered sees something all right to try and fix it youve got to try havent you its what i do like i keep telling people im actually trying very hard to believe its what ive been put here to do cure of souls lol said he sensed how close she was to tears yes souls of the living or the souls of the dead dont you know merrily its just a phrase i heard with the right balance the right metre if it sounds right use it what does it mean its she shook her head at him just an old description of what we do what were supposed to do implies we have curative powers which i suppose we dont most of us we just know how to ask nicely and all i want to do now is say please god will you accept the souls of these two people help them break the bonds of obsession anger lust hatred help them leave it all behind is that so bad youve known you were going to do this ever since we left the boswells havent you something to prove he thought stocks death must have made her wonder if she wasnt so much a force for good as a force for chaos it kind of grew merrily said its a responsibility least i can do you dont have to join in or anything just point me in the right direction if you think its crap thats ok lol nodded joining another river he murmured sorry just another song the trees were closing overhead the moon shining through a grille of high branches like the wires around a hurricane lamp he wasnt even sure of the way but he was in no doubt that theyd get there he wondered if merrily was secretly hoping that if she prayed in the haunted hopyard god would mystically grant her knowledge an explanation of the deaths of both stephanie and gerard stock because it seemed unlikely that anyone else could you know what im beginning to think she said with alarming synchronicity im thinking stock because of his professional history because of his attitude was sorely misjudged im tempted to think he approached simon st john out of pure need having come to the conclusion very gradually and very reluctantly no doubt that stephanie was possessed by something evil i think it was her he wanted exorcized not the kiln but wasnt the type of guy who could ever come out and say that lol held up a branch for her to duck underneath so he laid it on stewart the obvious ghost the email he sent to the office was very straightforward and very sincere she said he appealed to me as a christian he said he and his wife were being driven to the edge of sanity i also spoke to a journalist today called fred potter who spent some time talking to stephanies colleagues at the agency where she worked she seems to have gone through a radical personality change from mouse to someone altogether more predatory are you actually talking about possession i dont know im the only person who ever has to consider that possibility so i try not to i think it was conan doyle who had sherlock holmes sayoh just as hed done the first time lol almost walked into it the first of the abandoned hoppoles they walked out of the wood and into full moonlight into the first alley of hopframes the moon overhanging the hopyard making the lines of naked frames gleam whitely like prehistoric bones god merrily whispered you were right it isnt nice at all is it she took his hand and led him to the centre of the hopyard the field of crucifixion they stood together beneath a broken frame the crosspiece hanging down a frizzle of bine dangling from it lol had an image of stephanie with the bine in the bedroom he blinked hard and shut it out has to be done tonight you see she said because this place will probably be crawling with people tomorrow she looked around id like us to get protection first against anything else that might be here so well do st patricks breastplate christ be with us christ within us you know and perhaps we could visualize a ring of light around the hopyard and the kiln spreading out to knights frome sure i mean ill try the truth was he felt an unexpected slightly shameful excitement this was nothing like the cleansing of the kiln just the two of them this time and the big full moon she said to be honest im not sure i could do this alone tonight well ill do whatever just be here and think no harm of them wish them love maybe repeat a few things after me merrily i mmm i believe you can do this i believe in you i know they were quiet for a few moments looking across at the kilnhouse sootblack now against the creamy sky erm its about guiding the undying essence to god merrily said the moon was full on her face and she didnt look like a saint or a goddess she looked like a woman thats deliverance he said on impulse merrily how can you love him how can you commit your can i love him like a man words to that effect you want this straight he nodded when i pray i dont see a man or a woman i just experience it started out as imagination but now it truly exists a warmth and a light and a great core of what youd describe i suppose as endless selfless love which asks for nothing in return but an acceptance of it which is faith it sometimes comes in a kind of blue and gold but thats subjective its just some incredible benevolence so beautiful and so close so intimate that no she said this is not a man its completely different lol was glad for a moment you feeling any of it here the benevolence no thats what worries me somehow i cant get going until i feel theres something some small light something to connect with so what exactly are you feeling scared the moon hung in the black wires several feet above them the moon was not christian it was not about selfless undying love the moon was cold rock and had no light of its own they stood together between the poles looking down a whole avenue of poles towards the wood and then lol was aware of them turning and facing one another and he didnt actually perceive merrily coming into his arms she was just there a small warm slippery animal not a saint and her mouth was soft and moist not like the marble mouth of some sacred statue and the air around them was full of the caramel essence of tumbled hay oh god lol murmured drawing back in final fractional hesitation and then lowering his head again as he felt her lips part and her breath meeting his breath a confluence her breasts pushing against him he felt the two of them were pure energy blown down the alley the poles to either side blurring in the warm racing night he felt this was the moment his soul had been rushing towards through days and months and years and lives and and yet it was wrong it was sickeningly shatteringly wrong it grew cold the air around them grew as cold as the moonlight lol heard wooden poles creaking as if one had cracked they were old poles some had fallen many were probably rotting inside their creosote shells held inert by a damp dread he heard a crumbly rustling that his mind translated into images of brittle hopcones on mummified bines he heard the humming in the wires and looked up at stringy clouds in the luminous greengrey northern sky through the hopframe a black gallows no he heard behind the studio silence the crisp eggbox acoustic come out merrilys back felt cold against his hand the cold of an effigy on a tomb their faces were apart a chill miasma around them as if theyd dropped into a vault and lol felt sick with the wrongness of it and sick at heart with what this implied rebekah close to midnight sweet black tea a cardigan around her shoulders a warm summers night and she was still cold under a moon that now looked pocked and diseased the iron table was wobbling between clumps of couch grass on the cracked flagged yard in front of prof levins studio the four of them seated around it merrily between al and sally boswell with her back to the hay meadow and the moon i called you sally was telling her didnt you hear me i stood in the clearing and i shouted to you to come out of there my voice she looked at her husband in sorrow and some irritation doesnt have the carrying power any more she means i should have gone in for you but she thinks i was afraid al was sitting with his back to the stable wall i wouldnt go further than the little wood he put a hand over merrilys well maybe but the real truth is id onlyve made it worse my father was the chovihano i just make guitars sally said after youd gone we talked about it and then we came after you with stock dead there seemed to be no reason at all any more why we shouldnt tell you everything i suppose opposite merrily with his chair pulled a little further back from the table than the others lol was looking down at his hands on his lap merrily felt his confusion also the distress coming off him in waves al was talking to her like we were saying earlier about the romany custom of burning the vardo was this your christian way of ensuring that the stocks did not maybe it seemed such a long time ago had she actually done that had she completed her impromptu apology for a deliverance had she even started it couldnt remember couldnt remember brave girl al was saying but maybe not so wise that yard the yard in the shadow of the last kiln they tried to turn it into pasture once and the cattle kept aborting why couldnt she remember was it the potion sally had given her she said can someone tell me what happened did something happen in there lol looked up bewilderment in his eyes we couldnt see what was happening sally said quickly too many poles laurence brought you out al said i respect him for that she didnt understand lol said to sally why dont you tell us about the lady of the bines thats what this all comes back to isnt it rebekah smith sally shot him a glance the lady of the bines theres been more than one of course lol nodded but the original i suppose sally said was conrads first wife caroline it was the local secretary of the national farmers union who had got into conversation with sally this was in the midseventies when verticillium wilt first hit herefordshire in a big way they wanted to discourage young trespassers who might carry the disease from yard to yard and sally had said in fun almost why not put a ghost story round and shed thought then about the emperor of frome and how much more resonance the story would have if it carried echoes of the truth according to the legend the knight of knights frome had banished his wife because she could not give him a son it wasnt quite like that with caroline but the basis was there it was true that she couldnt have children threatening conrads dynastic dreams conrad collector of farms with his lust for land each new field turned into a sea of stakes a medieval battleground eight centuries earlier sally said conrad would have impaled the heads of his competitors on hoppoles as a warning to other potential rivals and yet he could be charming especially away from his domain on one of his wild weekends in london or at someone elses house party hed charmed caroline still in her teens a city child with dreams of vast green acres and dawn walks through wildflower meadows caroline had actually loved the hops the exuberance of them their mellow smell much nicer than sour old beer caroline had loved especially the month of september when the welsh came and the dudleys and the gypsies she loved to talk to them especially the romanies who did not want to talk who reeked of mystery conrad had said she should not mix with them the lower orders lower species hed implied conrad would drive among the hopyards in his land rover a royal visitor he looked on his pickers it was said much as the american cotton kings had regarded their slaves the fifties this was and the early sixties feudal times still in the empire of frome it was said the gypsies took caroline away lol said explaining quickly that isabel st john had told him a little of this some of the dirt on conrad lake which would have been published in stewart ashs book and i suppose they did in a way sally said caroline became particularly close to one family after helping them get medical assistance for a child who turned out to have meningitis caroline called out her own doctor in the middle of the night and the condition was diagnosed in time to save the child this was something the romanies would not forget and from then on the doors were open to the young empress the mysteries revealed under the tutelage of an old lady the puri dai the wise woman and some others she became aware of an entirely new way of looking at the countryside the world she learned about living lightly on the land taking what you needed and no more and then moving on fires from the hedgerows water from the springs the secret of not owning ecology green politics all this was far in the future sallys face shone in the light from the stable walls and her hair was like steam to conrad it was simply communism of course conrad lived very heavily on the land for a while she thought she could change him women do as you know and sometimes they succeed but conrad was already middleaged and heavy with greed and caroline still in her twenties was learning fast too fast they gave her a present al said the romanies this was the mother of the baby she helped save made her a dress a beautiful white dress exquisitely embroidered she wore this wonderful garment with pride to a party at the end of the hop season this was the first and the last time she was to wear it the emperor went into her wardrobe and took out the dress sally said took it into the kiln yes yes that kiln gave it to the furnaceman to put into the furnace the furnaceman couldnt bear to do it and took it home to his wife who wore it to a dance the word got back and the furnaceman was sacked of course after this the dress was considered bad luck but no one wanted to destroy it it was passed from hand to hand and well we have it at the hop museum now one day i like to think it will go on display when its safe when the full storys told what did happen to caroline merrily asked she left him presumably yes after ii believe that conrad began to abuse her in a more direct sense physically conrad was an owner body and soul caroline had to leave him of course she did she had a little money of her own and the gypsies had awoken in her a need for more within less there was we assume a discreet divorce she joined a community set up to develop human potential at coombe springs with jg bennett who had been a pupil of the armenian guru gurdjieff at fontainebleau and she embraced schumacher but caroline is not so important to our story from then on if she ever came back i imagine it was to haunt conrads hopyards shes dead shes not important sally said rebekah smiths the important one now the rom were always very protective of their women the term communal existence didnt come close it was a vibrantly crowded life among siblings and parents grandparents greatgrandparents eating together sleeping together part of the same chattering organism al explained the point being that young gypsy women did not go for solitary walks outside the camp even outside the vardo they were always within sight of the brothers and the uncles part of the traditional defence mechanism so how could rebekah disappear ill show you some photos of her sometime al promised youll see the long coppery hair the wide white gash of her mouth as if shed like to seize the whole world in her teeth it gives you a small idea of what went wrong no one could explain how rebekah came to be quite as she was poshrat didekai no way her lineage was impeccable this was a good family and rebekah was deeply grounded in the traditions also she had the sight had been dukkering from early childhood rebekah could read your palm and your very eyes rebekah could look at you and know they used to say a true chovihani was the result of some dark union between a romany woman and an elemental spirit well everyone knew who rebekahs mothers husband was but her father if you look carefully at the pictures youll see the courage and the arrogance she was not afraid to be out there al said she was twentythree years old and they all said she ought to have been married when she wanted to go off for a night or longer shed always outwit the brothers and the uncles who would suffer the consequential tirades from the wizened lips of the puri dai every time they lost her but lose her they would whenever rebekah decided it was time to make one of her forays into the gaujo world it was as if something would be awakened in her during the hoppicking season in knights frome when the gypsies were as close as they ever came to being part of a larger community after she went missing the police discovered she was already well known or at least very much noticed in some pubs in bromyard and ledbury also further afield hereford worcester a woman of the world it seemed two worlds in fact rebekah smith once away from the camp wore fashionable clothes was never even identified as a gypsy where did she get those clothes who bought them for her it was clear she wanted out the police said she wanted the bigger scene shed be in birmingham now or cheltenham or london or even in america wherever she was shed have landed on her feet she was twentythree years old said the travellers she should have been married she was dead said their puri dai but no body was ever found and the emperor of frome still raging in private over the corruption and defection of his wife oh he was never even questioned in any depth al looked like he wanted to spit sally boswell said we look at the s and we tend to think that was not so very long ago the young musicians now are all influenced by sixties music the beatles and the rolling stones and the grateful dead and people freaking out on hallucinogens the voice of youth she leaned forward under the walllight as if to make herself more real her museum curators voice taking over she must have been breathtakingly beautiful back then merrily thought but the sixties were a long time ago sally said particularly the early sixties when there was still an almost mystical aura around the royal family when in the countryside this was still feudal england when the lakes were the squirearchy clear descendants of the norman marcher lords and when their actions were not subject to examination conrad lakes friends included mps and wouldbe mps like oliver perryjones the emperor dined and drank with senior councillors magistrates chief constables and this was the time when the senior police would tend to be exarmy officers with medals from the second world war men for whom stability meant the preservation of a hierarchy and the structure at all costs when the police knew their place conrad was himself a magistrate for a time sally said he was also worshipful master of the local masonic lodge and the gypsies were vagrants and their socalled culture was primitive and they lied of course and they also had a grudge against conrad so when the police were told that rebekah smith had been seen getting into conrads car and they were told al said there was more than one witness uncles or brothers lol asked al smiled you see the problem merrily saw how intense lol had become as though hed channelled his confusion and distress into an urgent need to know isabel told me the police finally concluded the gypsies had simply made it up to get back at lake for banning them from his hopyards he said sally nodded that was one suggestion yes but she also thought stewart ash had evidence linking lake to the disappearance does that mean he just spoke to the gypsy witnesses who the police chose to disregard oh more than that said al it would have to be more than that like what like photographs she took a very good picture did rebekah merrily stayed quiet lol hadnt told her any of this not that thered been time especially naked als eyes glinted metallically gypsies arent the most inhibited of folk and rebekah well she was not the most inhibited of gypsies i imagine there would have been times when she had conrad crawling to her feet conrad took many photographs sally said quickly he liked to have photos of his land and the things he owned or wanted to own hed bought all the most expensive equipment you sound as if you know that stewart had pictures lol said well of course al extended long hands that bore no signs of arthritis we know stewart found some of them when he was carrying out his rudimentary renovation of the kiln stored behind the furnace like a private porn collection for a long time stewart preserved the old furnace i guess it would be when he looked at his wife early last year when he decided it was going to have to come out to make more kitchen space it was certainly well into the spring when he showed you one of the photographs and asked you if you recognized the woman sally turned to lol when the furnace came out the builder had found a space at the rear well away from the heat where the bricks could be removed and that was where an old briefcase had been stowed it contained apparently about two dozen photographs of the same naked woman though not necessarily the same hopbine al said merrily saw lol flinch slightly she drew the cardigan around her she didnt like where this was going and those pictures of rebekah lol said they were going in stewarts book right so where are they now al laughed you tell me he showed me just the one he said he had the others we became excited naturally that an old mystery might be solved an old injustice exposed but i warned him to keep quiet obviously it must not get back to adam lake and did it merrily asked she wasnt convinced this would have exposed an injustice what was there to link these pictures to lake well if it did it wasnt us who told him al protested if it did get back to adam sally said it was probably through stewart himself consider stewart bought the kiln at a knockdown price after the receivers moved in conrads death being almost contemporaneous with all this the emperor became old quickly and died quickly al said with evident approval when his second wife left him taking the child adam they said his mind was already going they said he drove her away eventually the old bastard had a timely coronary while out patrolling his shrinking domain he was found by a walker dying in the hopyard below the kiln yes that hopyard i like to wonder if knowing the kiln was being sold the emperor was on his way to retrieve his photos when he was struck down and died knowing his final crime was there to be discovered why would he keep them there merrily asked we cant know can we sally said perhaps it was his old hiding place going back to when the kiln was part of his farmhouse he knocked down the house in the bitter wake of his first marriage built the new house for his second thats another thing why did he knock down the house and leave the kiln standing we dont know sally said too quickly why would he have kept those pictures at all obsession mrs watkins merrily didnt ask her to expand didnt think it would get her anywhere not yet you were about to tell me why stewart might have told adam lake about the pictures to get him off his back of course al said obsession again adams obsession was to recover what he could of the old empire especially that bit maybe he even knew there was something in that kiln maybe that was another reason why he was so anxious to get it back that he was prepared to make stewarts life a misery maybe stewart told him about the pictures and tried to blackmail him who knows al lol said softly who really killed stewart als head tilted youre asking me you couldnt let stewart turn those pictures over to adam lake could you not at any price if stewart had let lake have the pictures theyd have been destroyed so the truth would never have come out al looked down at his long guitarists fingers yes he said calmly quite right lol and he would have wouldnt he lol said hed have given them away in exchange for money or just the removal of the big blue barn just to be left in peace and a decent amount of light to get on with his books i mean i never knew stewart obviously but i dont see him as any kind of investigative writer the idea of publishing those photos that wouldve scared him to death probably i mean how often do you find soft porn in a localhistory picture book the story of conrad lakes war with the gypsies maybe culminating in an undiscovered murder it wasnt exactly an obvious sequel to the hop growers year was it merrily stared at lol with for the first time a kind of awe she wondered how long hed been brooding about all this and what had happened in that cold sterile hopyard to sharpen his focus there was momentary quiet around the table then sally boswell pushed away her mug of cooling tea youre right of course stewart ash was a gentle soul i feared very much for him with the appalling adam lake pursuing the kiln he was so happy there compiling his little books talking to the locals about the old days taking his careful photos with equipment so old that conrad lake would have discarded it without a thought youre right poor stewart just wanted to be left alone in his beloved kilnhouse sally said shed once asked stewart to whom he planned to leave the place it would have to be his favourite niece he said despite her dreadful husband and so it was sally who had suggested half humorously that he make a will leaving it to the most obnoxious of his relatives with a clause preempting resale and then tell lake what hed done on the other matter the book sally had asked stewart if hed consider turning the photographs over to her saying she was prepared to write the book and publish it too and sell it in the museum if no one else dared take it he could keep the profits for all i cared sally said and what did stewart say lol asked he was thinking about it sally said he was still thinking about it when he was killed by who al exploded mother of god theres no big mystery here boy stewart was gay he was doing a book on the hoppickers of yore and his bits of research did indeed bring him into contact with some very nice gypsy boys most gypsies have very few hangups about sex twenty quid for a threeminute hand job would sound very reasonable indeed and these are nice boys sally said cynically very friendly he can trust them so perhaps we werent the first ones to see those photographs lets just imagine al went on that stewart no doubt more interested in the hopbine than the naked girl gives one of the photos to the smith boys and asks if any of them can tell him who the girl is they say theyll take it back to their family and ask around they return the picture a day or so later heads shaking terrible sorry guvnor nobodyd recognize this one at all al flashed his goblins grin around the table but in fact someone in the family whose opinion you do not under any circumstances discount has said to the smith boys it is your duty to the family to go back and get the rest of these photos and if you know whats good for you for the rest of your dishonourable lives you will not return without them so the smith boys did do it merrily said never any doubt in my mind it was probably much as it was told to the court an attempted burglary they went for the pictures all of them and the book too whatever stage it was at to find out how much stewart knew find out what really happened to rebekah smith oh a mission of great importance and had it been anything else anything but his precious book stewart wouldve said go ahead take it take it all al sat back anything but his bloody book a large moth with black rings on its wings landed in the centre of the table moved around it for a few moments and then fluttered away there goes stewart now al said whimsically lol kept asking about the pictures where were they now did the smith boys take them or did they panic and leave emptyhanded as had been implied in court if the smiths had taken them would they have had time to pass them on before they were brought in by the police merrily thought lol seemed obsessed as if he was determined to spread out all the mysteries of knights frome like the cut and turned hay under the full moon if the family have the pictures al said theyll keep bloody quiet about it now at least until after the appeal no stronger evidence of the boys guilt and its all spoiled now anyway who could ever justify the murder of an innocent man to prove the guilt of another whos already dead besides which merrily said its just a photograph of a naked girl no proof of who took it and no suggestion of what happened to the girl lol looked at al and then at sally and what did happen to the girl no one knows sally admitted we dont know how the relationship between rebekah and lake came about which of them seduced the other who exploited whom but everything i know of conrad suggests that it was probably going on before caroline left him he would have taken a perverse delight knowing of her friendship with the romanies in forming one of his own however conrads idea of a relationship was not a twosided thing but he picked the wrong woman al pushed long white hair behind his ears he picked the woman with the mouth which would eat the world its likely that the departure of caroline would have fed some ambition into her head so what does he do does conrad lake good friend and supporter of oliver perryjones marry a gypsy out of the question can he pay her off perhaps ha does even the emperor of frome have enough money to pay off rebekah smith i think not sally said i dont know how he killed her probably strangulation but i think i can guess how he disposed of her remains merrily stared at sally and the night quivered around her vision when it came could knock you sideways the burning stench of gunpowder and rotten eggs the smell of cheap fireworks from when you were a kid fierce and searing as a jet from a blowlamp the hot breath of hell brimstone just because the pictures of rebekah were found in the kiln didnt mean merrily put a hand to her throat she saw the sudden concern in lols eyes recalling his anxiety in the kiln during the deliverance the utterly needless deliverance of the soul of the inoffensive stewart ash to god it wasnt stewart it had never been stewart stewart wasnt the type al boswell put his head on one side drukerimaskri is it possible merrily said that rebekah smith might have died in the kiln was this the conjecture at the time sally boswell raised up her glasses on their chain put them on gazed through them into merrilys eyes her face was severe and for once she looked her age oh yes she said and could she have choked sulphur sally said do you know what sulphur does yes ive a strong idea sally spoke in her museum curators voice without emotion what happens in a hopkiln is that when the sulphur is to be burned everyone gets out very rapidly sulphur in small quantities or as an element in spa water can be beneficial to health sulphur burning in a confined space can be horribly poisonous it causes extreme reactions very quickly it attacks the eyes the throat the lungs the skin it turns hops yellow i think that anyone exposed to sulphur fumes in a confined space and unable to get out would be grateful to suffocate al said lake always took his women to that kiln common knowledge women how many women did he have how many sheep in a flock sally said and after the cursory search for rebekah was over he became less cautious hed pick up prostitutes in hereford and worcester and bring them back right up to his death he had a mattress in the loft al regarded merrily gravely how do you come to know of this merrilys phone began to shrill al suddenly smashed a fist down on the iron table he locked her in didnt he he locked rebekah in the fucking kiln with the sulphur rolls burning blue in the brimstone tray i dont know that merrily said i just he turned her yellow and then he came back and did whatever else was necessary and then he fed her to the furnace the reliable old oilfired castiron furnace burning at two million btus cremation guaranteed merrily stood up and found she was shaking she took the phone to the edge of the weedchoked terrace mmerrily watkins behind her sally was saying wed always suspected he must have spread her ashes on the hopyard then had them dug in mum jane mum i swear to god we thought we were doing it for the best but it like its all gone wrong where are you were in the car were on our way to canon pyon merrily said tightly i didnt know there was a canon pyon in pembrokeshire oh jesus christ mum we went to tell amy shelbone to stay the hell away from layla riddock but shes pissshes run away behind her lol was saying what do you mean in the real sense jane merrily said what have you done so we were in this like really difficult situation and we ended up telling mr and mrs shelbone about layla riddock but it was only when you did what it was only when i said just like in passing that laylas stepfather was was allan henry dear god merrily said drably when she came back to the table al boswell was saying intensely to lol drains him you know exhausts him sexually but its like a drug until he doesnt know what day it is you know what im telling you boy physical dependency if the shelbones knew they were being followed it didnt seem to bother them their renault was puttering steadily along like this was some little jaunt to the allnight supermarket even in his seriously unstable condition mr shelbone was driving with impeccable care slowing for every bend and she said what exactly eirion was keeping a steady distance between them all the same she said kind of you know be careful jane said these were her actual words close she said go home didnt she eirion didnt take his eyes from the tail lights ahead well yes she did she said that too but the phone signal wasnt great at that point i would guess maybe the full moon affects them the road at this stage was absolutely dead straight probably an old roman road and there was no other traffic so eirion let the shelbones increase the space between the two cars what did we have to lose after all he said morosely there was only one parent left to alienate the point is irene she doesnt know what we know and she wouldnt let me explain jane you really think we know everything you see the looks those shelbones were exchanging as soon as they heard layla riddocks name what was that about it was the christmas fair thing of course and anyway that was your fault for telling them the shelbones are immensely strange people all those awful sombre pictures you can tell why amys turned out the way she is if theyve got a shotgun in the car with them allan henrys blood will be on your hands but she is coming out here what your mum oh yeah and lol i expect and ok she did say to keep out of it but what she really meant what she really meant was keep right on top of it so you dont miss any of the action i would not forgive myself if something happened i couldve prevented riddocks psychotic and allan henrys some kind of semicriminal with pockets full of councillors and police bit like your dad eirion let this go there were some issues beyond argument they drove through canon pyon which was strung out like a welsh village what is it with you jane maladjusted angry eirion said they drove in silence eventually leaving the village lights behind then jane said actually that day in the shed when riddock when she kind of dominated me it was like she was a woman and i was just a little girl i was feeling screwed up and insecure whereas now eirion braked slowly as the renault in front indicated right the moon shone down on woodland dont say it eirion said do not even whereas now jane smiled grimly now i reckon i should be able to take the slag no problem lol drove his old astra wasnt as fast the volvo but when you lived in the country you knew that speed didnt help because cars didnt own country roads he headed straight for hereford the most direct route to canon pyon at least thered be no holdups past midnight he concentrated on his driving there were issues he didnt want to think about until there was something meaningful he could do if there ever could be at the burley gate crossroads merrily said lol he heard her groping in her bag for cigarettes lol i have to all kinds of stuff rattling in the bag getting thrown about look what happened back there in the hopyard oh god nothing happened lol said nothing at all thats not entirely true is it flick of the lighter what i remember feeling was what you might describe as a at that moment an unseemly need i mean dont get me wrong thereve been times and and quite recently when it would not have struck me as unseemly not at all he heard her sink back against the vinyl god the older you get the harder it is to talk about these things or is that just me could i have a cigarette you dont smoke yes i do since when since after you hand me one no all right forget it he sighed if youre asking was it normal healthy adult passion well i would love to have thought it was but in the end thanks merrily said there was a long silence where does that leave things lol said i dont know lol swallowed after a while merrily said what did al say to you when i was on the phone you know gypsy stuff he heard her blowing out a lot of smoke al is saying that the presence in the kiln is this rebekah smith isnt he thats what he seems to be saying and even though he knew rebekah had known her since she was a child hes very much afraid of her now isnt he he lol could see clusters of lights in the distance maybe the city itself the difference apparently is that gaujos were ambivalent about our ghosts we have bad ghosts we also have vaguely tolerable ghosts but the romanies i may be wrong but i think mulo is the only word they have for a ghost and it can also mean vampire merrily said in the real sense they dont have to take your blood al says theyll just take your energy thats he sensed her strained smile i was going to say normal its usually suggested by those who accept these things that spirits need to absorb energy in order to manifest hence cold spots in haunted houses hence in extreme cases possession in the case of the mulo or muli lol said it seems to be sexual energy its sexually voracious sometimes it comes back to its old partner in the old gypsy stories it would come out of its grave and appear in its lovers wagon and spend the night the next day the lover would be physically drained and this would go on and eventually the lover would die exhausted a husk maybe become another mulo something like that i dont know al was losing it by then and you were just coming off the phone this is not going to be pleasant merrily murmured its going to be much worse than i could have imagined when you asked sally why conrad lake would have knocked down the house but kept the kiln i mean why would he especially if that was the place where hed left rebekah to die where hed burned her body youd think it would be the very first place hed choose to demolish wouldnt you unless the kiln was the place where they used to meet and would perhaps go on meeting merrily said yes and if he had to keep going back there i mean had to he said merrily coughed boswell said lake became old quickly and died quickly he said he virtually drove his second wife and the child away as if he wanted to be alone there people were saying his mind was going lol heard al talking exhausts him sexually but its like a drug until he doesnt know what day it is you know what im telling you boy as if he had to be alone with her merrily said tonelessly and with what hed done killed a gypsy but he couldnt kill the need kept her pictures in the kiln a memorial a shrine and she was still there in his head a physical dependency lol glanced at her she was holding the cigarette between finger and thumb eyes focused on its smouldering tip but he wasnt always alone there he said according to al hed pick up prostitutes in hereford and worcester and pay them to come back with him i believe that you cant take women regularly in and out of the kiln without somebody noticing but people would keep quiet at least until such time as conrad no longer had any money left to pay them still found money for the women though because she needed them rebekah yes lol drove faster as he saw the lights of hereford gathering ahead and then surrounding them he wanted them to get there soon wherever they were going he didnt want to talk about this any more he didnt want the theory expanding to take in stephanie stock and the scratches shed made down her husbands back maybe stephie and rebekah between them stephie and rebekah on the bed with the bine stephie and rebekah in the hopyard rustling and crackling with the cold electricity of the dead and the keening in the wires had stewart ash known this would happen when he left them the house but why would he do that to his favourite niece the answer lol supposed was simple stewart was unaware of it he was gay so rebekahs muli could never have reached him it had taken predatory males to destroy stewart lol drove into halflit hereford with its shutters up its pubs long shut a cruising police car waiting at the traffic lights he thought of merrily finally in his arms breath on breath the warm confluence then the passion turning cold as they became a foursome lol and merrily and stephanie and rebekah the lights changed he felt her hand on his arm rich girl with a hobby big black metal gates not decorative gates but gates with bars more than an inch thick and with spearprongs on top gates designed to keep you out white security lights pooling the turning circle in front of them the renault was stopped outside them with its engine running and its headlights on full and its horn was blasting an unbelievable noise down here in the woods what was more unbelievable was that this was adults in the oldfashioned sense staid middleaged people it was kind of shocking and sooner or later it was going to have to get a reaction it was cooler now in the hours before dawn jane in her old fleece jacket was hunched down by some rhododendrons about ten yards behind the renault shed got eirion to drop her at the end of the drive and shed walked down through the trees while hed gone to find a place to park the bmw so it would be ready for a fast getaway he said also so it wouldnt be damaged in the event of whatever happened jane couldnt blame eirion for being cautious he was in enough trouble domestically and anyway she wasnt in any mood to blame him for anything tonight right now stocky solid eirion was very ok jane still carried that warm glow warmer than the fleece and her body felt different felt stronger felt like a complete unit though maybe the unit now was her and eirion an item official yeah ok cool it felt like the start of a journey scott eagles and sigourney jones had it come to this stop that now this guy was inside the gates on the edge of the area floodlit by the headlamps big guy in a leather jacket and jeans the horn stopped though jane could still hear it in her head so the silence was kind of shattering mr shelbone got out and stood next to the renault staying behind the headlights a long silhouette i want to speak to allan henry his voice sounded harsh and fractured the way cardboardy voices did when they were raised weve got an office the guy in the leather jacket said you can phone in the morning and ask for an appointment like anyone else now go away you tell allan henry i want to see him now tell him its shelbone do you know what time it is tell him if he doesnt come out i shall stay here all night blowing my horn you wont you know because if you arent away from here in two minutes im calling the police and you are the gardener dont you even know its illegal to sound a car horn after dusk now get back in your car and get out of here before i get annoyed oh yeah he really looked like a gardener the kind of gardener who planted people mr shelbone got back into his car like hed been told and just leaned on the horn again it filled the night like a wild siren jane felt a little scared if this was a bunch of kids like drunk or stoned it wouldnt mean a lot but these were quiet suburban middleaged extremely christian people and they believed this man and his stepdaughter had somehow taken away their precious child and jane was now inclined to believe this too though it didnt make any proper sense it was one thing for layla riddock to be very turnedon by the idea of real communication with the spirit of amys murdered mother something else entirely to kidnap the kid and bring her here thus connecting allan henry to it an arm around her waist she screamed ssssh irene not so loud cariad he pulled her down into the rhododendrons cariad welsh term of endearment whats happening i know that theyre demanding to talk to allan henry that guy claims to be the gardener would you believe whereve you left the car theres a little clearing about thirty yards back i turned it round and tucked it under some trees she had the feeling that now he was sure gwennans car was safely off the road he was almost enjoying this hes breaking the law making that noise he drove here like he was on his driving test and now he knows the gardener guys threatened to call the police shelbones just ignored him maybe he wants them to call the police maybe he realizes that if he went to the police himself and asked them to start questioning this allan henrys daughter about the disappearance of his kid it would be quite a long time before they even took him seriously yeah jane said thats good thinking welshman but if henry does know where that kid is getting the police up heres going to be the last thing hell want the gardener guy was no longer visible maybe he was taking instructions on the phone shelbone was still blasting away on his horn hes even beginning to annoy me eirion said jane became aware of a small gate set into one of the big gates became aware of it because it opened and the guy in the leather jacket came through and walked around to the drivers door of the renault open the window no reaction the horn went on blaring you could just make out the shelbones heads and shoulders frontfacing neither of them moving you felt they ought to have placards in the windscreen save our child they were a little crazy open it no movement inside the car the guy in the leather jacket swung an arm and stepped back there was a faintly sickening snapping sound jesus jane whispered hes smashed the wing mirror eirions arm tightened round her waist i cant believe he did that open the window the guy said almost conversationally like he was into his stride now shelbone revved the engine a little but stayed on the horn the guys arm went back again there was a glint of moonlit metal bloody hell jane hes got some kind of big wrench the arm came down fast and there was this massive crunch oh my god irene he cant the gardener had begun smashing in the drivers door and the side panels his arm pumping with a deliberate workmanlike savagery which reminded jane of those disgusting clips of the bastards beating baby seals to death the whole car was rocking with each blow the horn intermittent now fractured beeps mrs shelbone screaming the woods echoing to a scrapyard symphony of violence eirion let go of jane we cant just stand and watch this he pulled out his phone thrust it at her call the cops he stepped out of the bushes no jane grabbed his arm shed seen lights coming on some way behind the gates wait the guy in the leather jacket backed away from the car as both metal gates started to swing back then this man in a check shirt and jeans strolled coolly out making these casual but authoritative sidetoside wiping movements with his hands until the gardener guy and his wrecking tool went back into the shadows and the man just stood there waiting until the horn stopped and mr shelbones door began to open with this really horrible rending noise the man didnt move didnt wince mr shelbone got out unsteadily kind of topheavy like a wallflower that had come unstaked its david shelbone isnt it the man was talking like this was a cocktail party from the planning department mrs shelbone shouted david dont go near but the rest was muffled by mr shelbone slamming the car door and taking a step towards the casual guy who just stood between the headlight beams his arms by his sides well he said i was going to say id be surprised if this were an official visit mr shelbone at one in the morning but then on reflection i suppose i wouldnt be surprised at anything you did shelbone was breathing hard where is she henry what who what are you talking about this your idea of a night out is it shelbone taking a tour of historic buildings in the moonlight to make sure nobodys replaced any slates with the wrong colour tell me where she is allan henry stood with his legs apart he wasnt the puffy bloated tycoonfigure jane had imagined he looked quite young from here he looked fit a lot fitter than mr shelbone so whatve you got against me david its just your name keeps cropping up time and time again everything i do to bring new business into this town improve the local economy create jobs youre there trying to sabotage it i dont understand its just you every time a reactionary little man a deluded loner with a grudge nobody at the council can figure you out whats the problem whats the matter with you you and your thugs mrs shelbone was out of the car now a big bulky woman arms flailing you can have your thugs destroy our car but you wont intimidate us with the with the lord jesus christ on our side destroy your car allan henry looked for a moment like he was going to laugh but in fact jane thought his expression had turned suddenly menacing thugs you arrive at my private residence at one in the morning in a car thats either been in an accident or been quite deliberately damaged by you and your husband and you wake everyone up to accuse me and my gardener you mr shelbone stabbed a quivering finger at him youre filth god will punish you ah youre a sad and a sick old man david shelbone allan henry said almost lazily you should be having treatment you should be on medication its you thats made my husband ill mrs shelbone shrieked and youve turned our daughter you and that witch ah yes allan henry turned on mrs shelbone thats something else isnt it i had a silly little woman vicar here allegedly investigating some ludicrous allegations against my stepdaughter i might have known where all that came from jane began to quiver eirion put a hand over her mouth save it he whispered just remember everything thats said youre a witness she thought she caught a movement behind allan henry a figure flitting like a moth eirion took his hand away you david shelbones rigidly pointing arm began to shake suddenly god jane thought what if he has a heart attack you tell me where youve got his voice rose to a howl of helpless anguish got my daughter and suddenly allan henry was losing it shelbone advancing through the gate in the illumination from the headlights what would i want with your fucking daughter truth is you and this mad old bat should never have been allowed to adopt that child and if shes run away then youve driven her away we he half turned as headlights appeared behind him there was the mean throaty snarl of a powerful engine and then the lights were full in janes eyes its coming out eirion yelled he started to drag her back into the rhododendrons jane heard mrs shelbone scream saw the woman throwing herself in panic across the bonnet of the renault as the yellow car came through the gates there was a vicious scraping of metal on metal a small splintering crunch as it tore a tail light from the renault and spun off into the bushes no more than a foot from janes legs to get past and back onto the drive she heard tyres spinning and then the wheels hit the tarmac skidding and the car took off into the night and jane yelled layla eirion was frantic you ok jane jane feverishly pushing foliage aside like he might find both her legs severed at the thighs that was layla riddock jane cried wheres the car get after her her legs worked she began to run back up the drive come on what please irene go go go go nice idea quick thinking in the circs except that when the bmw reached the lane there was no sign of the yellow car she could have gone either way either left towards dilwyn or right to hereford jane was sobbing in frustration scanning the horizon for tail lights but the horizon was no more than five yards away here high hedges either side of the twisty road right irene go right why i dont know but weve got to try something it just seems more likely just do it call the police eirion was poised at the junction holding the car on the clutch the phones on the dash dial and tell them what tell them theres a disturbance at allan henrys tell them youre a neighbour and you heard crashing and screams there arent any neighbours please irene go go call the police and if you really want to help the shelbones give the cops our names as witnesses oh all right jane stabbed at the phone and eirion sent gwennans car racing towards hereford jane half hoping that after a couple of hundred yards theyd find the yellow sports car upended in some ditch emergency which service police eirion made pained noises as jane described the sounds of what could have been a massacre coming from the henry spread and then conveniently got cut off why the hell did you just keep going irene why whats the point havent you figured this out yet forgive me im welsh shes got the kid in the car jane said shes got amy merrily was breathing again in the confining darkness of lols car theyd approached the absurd cornered the chimera been able to talk about something that otherwise might have remained undiscussed possibly for ever putting a permanent distance between them a gap that might never have been crossed now she was feeling closer to lol than she had to anyone except for jane sophie sometimes and curiously gomer parry since first coming to ledwardine and taking on this impossible job and discovering that the people she could trust to try and understand her were all too few ironically lol remained unconvinced about the threat posed by layla riddock maybe because without her they wouldnt be here wouldnt have reached this level of communication shes seventeen he said as they neared canon pyon shes just a rich girl with a hobby however she reminded him she clearly believes that being halfgypsy gives her access a power base imaginary power base and shes now got remarkable influence over one of the richest developers in the county it happens taking over his house his bed from her own mother shes a young girl hes a rich middleaged man lol said sadly the gypsy magic could be entirely superfluous and the fact that shes also assuming responsibility for conserving and regenerating his finances and somehow being allowed to its not a fact though is it lol said its only what she thinks he scatters her mystical charms and talismans around it keeps her sweet he doesnt believe any of it and they both know it wont last maybe she watched lol driving the sliteyed alien on his sweatshirt lit green by the dashlights the mature womans dream a nicelooking man who targeted by a young girl any young girl could be firmly relied on to run like hell so what about the persecution of the shelbones it starts as a game becomes a serious fixation for the persecutor as well as for the principal victim and its working why is it working it just does merrily said black magic just works in the short term it works people who go down that road find they can get what they want very quickly then it starts to mess them up and they cant get out im not being metaphysical here pure calculated evil works shortterm because it nearly always takes us by surprise were not conditioned to turn the corner and meet the man with the knife and what happens when we are conditioned then maybe we also start to carry knives merrily said miserably then it gets ugly hang on lol i think weve just passed the turning shed spotted a man standing by the roadside smoking a cigarette lol pulled in and reversed the man threw down his cigarette and stamped on it the astra drew level with him merrily wound down her window good morning reverend watkins allan henry said wearily on the edge of the holmer industrial estate at the top of hereford there were temporary traffic lights they took for ever to change there was already a great wide dutch container lorry waiting at the lights mum was right after all jane said there is a god behind the container lorry its headlights full on was a chromeyellow mazda sports car its driver kept revving impatiently it was clear that if it hadnt been for the dutch lorry this particular driver would have shot the lights just as i was convinced wed got it wrong and layla had just kindly taken her home to dilwyn jane said wed got it wrong just dont lose the slag eirion said nothing this was not such a happy development for him evidently over the old city the moon was very bright you could see right across to the hills and wales beyond jane didnt think shed ever felt so wide awake bleed dry they followed the yellow car down to the silent city past hereford uniteds ground and the livestock market losing the dutch lorry at the big traffic island just the bmw and the mazda now and on greyfriars bridge eirion let layla widen the gap youll lose her jane wailed not now i know where i am now i know all the escape routes what if the lights turn against us at the bottom and shes away you want to lose her dont you that would be nice eirion admitted but unfortunately im an honourable sort of person sorry jane glanced back across the river wye where the cathedral sat placidly beyond the old bridge above a nest of modern buildings turned greyly medieval under the moon they watched the mazda go around the bottom island and up towards belmont and the abergavenny road jane leaning forward peering through the windscreen to see if there were two heads in there but the sports car was too low amy could be sunk down in the seat the clock in the bmw said five past two look how do we know shes got the kid eirion said its obvious isnt it layla was there all the time behind allan henry at the gates im sure i even saw her once shed have heard everything she knew the shelbones were raising hell and the police were likely to be involved she had to get amy out out of where she was staying with the henrys does that sound likely to you irene the whole things sick i dont know what the arrangement was for instance laylas supposed to have a gypsy caravan somewhere in that wood maybe the kid was in there maybe thats where they were doing their seances i dont know all this presupposing shes so much under laylas thumb that shed let her nearly run her mother down on the way out without protesting leaping up shouting out admit it none of this is making a lot of sense just stay behind her they tailed the mazda through the belmont district past the allnight tesco another roundabout a halfmile or so of main road and then layla took a left and eirion slowed but didnt turn this looks like a minor minor road if we so much as turn down here shell know were following her who cares lets not blow it now jane for the sake of a bit of caution there was woodland both sides of the entrance but it wasnt too thick anyone the other side would see their headlights eirion switched them off i dont think there are many places you can get to from here anyway i think it just goes into plant roads huh industrial development so like maybe she killed amy and shes going to have her body set into some concrete foundations lets try and retain just a modicum of proportion here oh yeah lets be sensible ok lets not then eirion turned left put his headlights back on they were into a newly made road through woodland that you could tell was being cleared another ecological disaster zone about half a mile in they came to a fully cleared area washed by sterile highlevel security lamps eirion suddenly slammed on the brakes cut his lights because there was the mazda parked outside some utility wiremeshed metal gates a sign behind and above them said danger keep out all trespassers will be prosecuted at the side of it another sign arrow valley commercial properties barnchurch trading estate phase i dont get it jane said stay here eirion warned jane snorted what was the point of that she zipped up her fleece and got out of the car she walked out into the middle of the clearing the big lights shining down like this was a prison yard a lone tree a scots pine towered over the site its steep trunk filigreed with moonlight there was nobody in the mazda it was dead quiet surreal after a couple of seconds eirion stepped out too and jane turned to wait for him it was now that a shadow peeled off the base of the pine jane squeaked the shadow spoke little jane watkins the vicars child we are honoured allan henry leaned down to the astras wounddown window my solicitors on his way not his usual office hours but with all the money i pay the fat bastard hedve been reaching for his pinstripes even as we spoke he grinned all those nice white crowns shining in the moonlight teeth like stars basically unworried merrily concluded up against it yet perversely energized a stroll around the grounds with a cigarette and he was ready for anything been here before and hed be here again where are the shelbones now she asked him finally gone to the police i imagine i told them the bloody kid wasnt here never had been here they werent convinced my own fault id antagonized them maybe a mistake cant believe they got you out again those people are frighteningly unbalanced look how about you come down to the house and have that drink mrs watkins is that your friend in there the very proper mrs hill its my other friend the very selfeffacing mr robinson boyfriend eh what a shame when youd gone yesterday i had a little fantasy about you in your cassock thirtynine buttons to undo one by one merrily said thats an old one you havent seen a couple of teenagers around boy and a girl i told you nobody here but me but youre a notorious liar allan i swear on my swiss bank account ok merrily got out lol too leaving the sidelights on locking the car whats he do then allan henry asked archdeacon he makes music he writes songs i think i feel one coming on now lol said be careful my friend allan henry said as if by instinct i dont just threaten i sue i always sue go for everything bleed dry its the only way layla unlocked the metal gate with a steel key she was wearing tight jeans and a black cotton top that finished three inches above her goldringed navel her tumbled hair was dyed black with a long streak of gold that seemed to have been spun from the moon jane could tell eirion was unexpectedly impressed hed gone very quiet you dont know about the barnchurch jane laylas voice was throaty almost gravelly it stood no more than twenty yards behind the gates all the ground around it had been cleared and a small mountain of sand had been dumped a few yards away it was a regular redbrick building with a slate roof there were brick steps up the outside tough grass sprouting between them it looked like well just a barn and not a very old one except that where the gable end was halflit by the security lamps you could make out where a gothic window had been bricked up just the ridge now like an old operation scar this welsh miracleworker used to preach here way back layla said sinners reborn the sick taking up their beds and walking out angelic visitations powerful stuff in fact the farmer here was so impressed he gave him this barn and all the local people helped turn it into a church and the miracles went on for a while and then i dunno the buzz died or the preacher fucked off back to wales or the miracles stopped happening or something and it became just a barn again and got forgotten about but hey once a holy place you know what im saying yeah jane said though it really wasnt much more than a breath imagine all that energy shut up with chickens and cows sacks of feed tractor parts throbbing away on its own for about a century and then allan buys the site and it wakes up again so much energy focused on the old barnchurch so much money banked up so many greasy palms so much desire that its become really charged again laylas face was radiant you go in there pow heavy shit jane this place really makes it where so many real churches are just old dust eirion said where is amy layla turned to appraise him boyfriend she walked right up to eirion gazed arrogantly into his eyes from about three inches away her breasts almost touching his chest eirion blinked jane tensed hey this boys had nooky tonight layla spun away from him was that with you jane jane said nothing wheres amy eirion said stolidly you want to keep this boy jane youd like to stay together i can actually fix that if you like i can show you kitanepen i fixed it for eagles and sigourney did you know ms riddock eirion said is amy shelbone with you shes probably in there in the barn shes got a key shes very trustworthy shes got a key to the main gate and a key to the barnchurch itself she comes on the bus isnt that sweet jane stared shes been here all the time just for a couple of nights approaching the full moon making things ready for justine you remember justine jane her mother murdered oh you know all that whove you been talking to kirsty jane said nothing there was a full moon the night amys daddy slaughtered amys mummy did you know that the moons great for that stuff it moves the tides and were nearly all water but youd know all that sure you want to go in and see talk to little amy jane looked back at the wiremesh fence and the bmw actually she didnt she wanted to go home after you eirion said to layla tell me something layla put the flat of a hand on eirions chest and spread her big fleshy fingers do you get asthma at all she didnt wait for an answer let her hand fall and walked away towards the brick steps big hips swaying the sliver of gold breaking up and reforming as she tossed back her hair eirion swallowed jane looked at him questioningly havent had an attack in years eirion said uncomfortably jane what i dont think it would be a good thing to annoy her do you they didnt make it to the house only as far as the vardo in its little clearing to one side of the drive allan henry noticed merrily looking at it shes not in there vicar believe me can i see anyway would you mind the holy of holies please what she needed was to get him talking about layla now while he was hypedup aggressive his back to the wall outside the gates hed picked up what looked like the plastic cover of a cars tail lamp and thrown it far into the bushes without comment allan henry tutted cant believe how amenable im being to everyone tonight there were two wooden steps up to the vardo the door was locked but he had a key she doesnt know i had this cut thing is i dont like there to be places i cant go specially not on my own property he went in first there was electricity a flicked switch turned on a couple of erstwhile victorian brass oillamps one on a dresser one on a wall bracket gosh merrily said its a complete little world it was beautifully kept but not like a museum although everything from the decorated and lacquered panels on the dresser to the vaulted ribs in the bowed ceiling was polished or at least shiny there was a used feel about the place a pan on the castiron stove a mortar and pestle on the dresser with powder scattered around it a silk scarf spread on a small camping table with a pack of marseilles tarot cards at its centre and books over a hundred on shelves floor to ceiling either side of a redandblackcurtained window merrily checked out a few of the titles a couple of dozen on gypsy lore but mainly general occultism one was laid horizontally on top of a row a manual of sexual magic how old is she coming up to eighteen allan henry said that means shes been a grown woman for five six years erm in what context are we talking here gypsy girls mature earlier by laylas age most of them are married with two kids by my age thered be a bunch of grandchildren like you say a different world which sounds like as good an excuse as any merrily looked at lol who was still standing out on the steps lols eyes narrowed however this is not really any of your business allan henry picked up the tarot pack and then dropped it quickly as if it was hot no blood relationship between me and layla dont even have the same surname ive never been a father to her she never wanted a father but like i say not your business reverend no its between you and layla and mrs henry mrs henrys well taken care of i bet he grinned she saw he was still wearing the wheel medallion representing wealth wheres layla now i wouldnt know shes a free spirit just i had a feeling you always liked to know where everything was where you could put your finger on it allan henry turned and glanced at lol before we go any further some things i dont talk about in front of a third party legal safeguard the lines either side of his nose were parallel like a ladder without rungs lol looked at merrily go for a walk shall i merrily nodded dont go anywhere you shouldnt my friend henry said over his shoulder the boy in the bungalows nervy tonight there was a victorian sofa opposite the castiron stove merrily sat at one end of it with her hands on her lap henry was at the other an arm flung over the backrest costly this little vehicle she said you wouldnt believe beats a wendy house but shes worth it is she layla youre not wired i suppose im certainly not going to invite you to check sometimes shes solid gold he said sometimes shes plutonium we had a big bustup after you left she drove out of here duringwhen my back was turned but i dont want to talk about that she gives you romany talismans to wear and decorates your house accordingly wheres the harm does it have any effect on a personal level he smiled you bet merrily glanced up the bookshelf a manual of sexual magic how long have you and she been longer than im ever going to admit to the likes of you my dear like i say they mature early and not only physically i have no guilt about this she made the running in the early stages she knew what she was doing and im a businessman not a teacher not a politician im not obliged to set an example to anyone but shes still at school and will be until she gets her four a levels its a changing world reverend thats all right by me you only have one life live it on the outside track he jabbed a finger at the window he famous that guy not especially too old to make it now nobody in that business sees firsttime action the wrong side of thirty what would you want with a loser hes not a loser he just doesnt make much money maybe youre the loser how do you figure that just my warped christian way of looking at things he shook his head irritably what do you want anyway not to help the shelbones nobody wants to help the shelbones and that would make me your enemy wouldnt it a fist clenched where do you get that from the mans got a chip on his shoulder the size of a fucking breezeblock his colleagues dont like him the council doesnt like him he wants to turn hereford into a museum how many jobs are there in a museum do you have any idea how much moneys riding on barnchurch how many people go down if it crashes its not going to crash because of one barn itll just have to be modified modified his face quite visibly darkened a fullconceptualized multimillionpound project that everybody wants has to be modified because of one mans whim let me tell you an outoftown location its got to be big to work we need the whole fucking space we dont need a prime plot right on the entrance clogged up with a useless pile of old bricks we arent even allowed to adapt if this works when this works it opens up the whole hereford bypass corridor and thats mega let me tell you that it makes sense in anybodys language to destroy one awkward cranky little family rather than spend a lot more money go for everything bleed dry its the only way thats a naive oversimplification he said and thats an admission merrily said total darkness at first amy layla called out are you there love then gradually a lozenge of light appeared high up in the furthest wall the old ventilation slit theyd come in from the door at the top of the steps into the loft where there must once have been pews jane figured amy there was a big echo it was a cathedral of a place but it didnt smell like a cathedral instead there was a crude blend of old hay and manure and engine oil and something sourish evidently not here layla said come on well go down youd better follow me no electricity im afraid eirion held janes hand he squeezed it encouragingly but this was all going so totally totally wrong layla riddock was supposed to be furious and devastated at being exposed as some kind of spiritual abuser not playing the affable tourist guide jane remembered with a wince her own excruciating cockiness earlier on now i can take the slag no problem the truth was she was feeling exactly the way shed felt that day in steves shed when she was just a mixedup little virgin and layla was a mature woman seventeen going on thirtyeight someone who didnt guess or fantasize someone who knew rites of passage what a load of bollocks it didnt make any bloody difference at all did it jane didnt even have as much going for her as little bloody sioned and little bloody lowri at least they had a culture around them like layla in fact a romany gypsy with all the powers that seemed to confer one hand on eirions chest and shed identified him as an asthmatic something even jane his girlfriend his lover didnt know where did that skill come from jane remembered reading somewhere that gypsies didnt tell each others fortunes because that was something they could all do no big deal no big deal wow if you werent part of an ethnic minority you were like nowhere these days the steps are quite steep layla called so youll need to go down one by one there used to be stairs when this was a church but they rotted away years ago ill go first wait at the bottom for you eirion said jane could hardly see her way to the steps which were wooden with gaps in between not much more than a wide ladder at the bottom there were stone flags she could see laylas dark form moving on confidently down what maybe was once an aisle you say your dad allan owns this place yeah hes going to flatten it in a couple of months were just getting some use out of it first we needed a church we needed to match that energy you follow not really where were we supposed to go steves shed i dont understand layla layla was squatting by a wall far above her was the ventilation slit the only light source it was a cold light and laylas silhouette was bluegrey they go through an identity crisis jane adopted kids especially when theyve got adoptive parents like hers weird old fucks but you saw them at our place obviously er yeah a match was struck yellowwhite light flared like the light in steves shed a fat candle im helping her to find herself jane very rewarding for both of us another match another fat candle two fat candles on an altar here she was little angel in a house full of religious prints bible at the bedside church twice on sunday is that normal jane thought about mum no not normal she could make out the altar now it was obviously not the original one it was supported on two rough pillars of old bricks but the top was quite a big thick piece of wood varnished and shiny as well as the candles it had a chalice on it a real churchy kind of chalice perhaps even silver layla was loaded layla could get hold of these things no problem and it wasnt amy was it layla said not the real amy whose parents got pissed and shot up what this is all about is letting the real amy come through this is what her mother wants i mean her real mother as layla stood up jane screamed and clutched at eirion a greywhite figure was standing behind the altar another round to the devil lol had walked twice up and down the drive once exchanging a wave with the nervous gardener through the front window of his bungalow when a police car nosed in no siren no fuss he waited for it near the gates this was slightly awkward but walking away wouldnt look good both coppers got out mr henry mr allan henry lol stood blinking in the headlight beams aware of another vehicle pulling in behind the police car the solicitor maybe arriving with henrys legal bulletproof vest er no lol said mr henrys back there in a gypsy caravan exchange of glances then they came slowly towards him one either side he leaned back against the gates arms loose no threat not part of this where was the gardener he should be handling it then who are you sir me im just mr laurence robinson as i live and breathe not the solicitor then this was a recently familiar figure with red hair and an expression of pleasant anticipation remember me mr robinson di bliss like there were several scouse accents in hereford division remind me lol said bliss laughed what a night that was eh he walked over car keys in his hand he looked like hed come out in a hurry he was wearing a dark suit jacket over a white tshirt and sweatpants and what a night this is turning out to be whats left of it what you doing here pal that your car is it on the road lol nodded he saw one of the uniformed men had a flashlight levelled at the ground tracking around looks like theres been something approximating to an rta in this vicinity boss does there really bliss nodded absently tell you what terry why dont you boys go and see if you can find mr henry and make sure hes in one piece ill have a chat with mr robinson here they leaned either side of the bonnet of blisss modest nissan lol was explaining as best he could covering up very little two nights bliss whistled thinly a fourteenyearold girl missing for two nights and no bastard tells us hang on lol said puzzled you knew this surely youve talked to the parents bliss looked genuinely blank i know nothing about any parents pal were just responding to a from a young girl sounded like everybody who ever bought an allan henry home was arriving to complain en masse i was in bed i had a call the magic name was whispered in me ear and as id always wanted to visit southfork i came ill be making the most of that in a minute young girl lol said i doubt it was this actual missing girl if thats what you were thinking let me get this right are you saying henrys stepdaughter knows where she is well thats what the kids parents thought ill give hereford a bell in a minute see if these parents have shown up hereford can handle it from their side me i feel much better knowing mrs watkins is on the case lol met his eyes sarcasm or a feedline i like that little lady bliss said she tries so hard she does allan henry mind that fellers something else again not harmed then not that i could see doesnt sound like it was worth getting out of me pit does it bliss stood with his hands flat on the car bonnet so anyone tell you about gerard stock then laurence lol nodded surprise you kind of cmon lol im not taking a bloody statement here bliss straightened up youre one up on me you knew the bugger before he was a murderer what ive learned in the past day or so tells me a bloke like that doesnt clam up then top himself now hes gone theres not much left for us to clean up but id still like to know what it was about really so what was it about youre asking me i am im asking you cause youve got no professional angle on this and also well our governor annie howe very busy little snow queen tonight shes probably still up in her office right now dont get me wrong good copper annie good thieftaker but limited vision and ill tell you now annies out to stick this on merrily bigtime why bliss blinked thats a good question i never gave it much thought to be honest why well shes no believer it offends her a bit working in a cathedral city seeing what it all costs being told by the chief that shes gorra stay on good terms with the church hierarchy and women priests not that she likes men priests either but i reckon she actually thinks women should be above that kind of superstitious rubbish women becoming priests is a sellout thats what i reckon anyway women like merrily are traitors to the cause thats a new one lol said yeh and i never told yer so go on why did gerard stock kill his wife and chop her head off i dont know i know you dont bloody know lol what do you think what does merrily think well nothing you could put in a police report bloody nora bliss gazed at the moon ill decide what can be made to fit into a report and it might not even need to be a report as such might be a whisper in the right ear at headquarters im trying to help here pal i was raised a catholic in liverpool me you said it was a long time before i even started to question whether the stuff in the jug at mass might possibly not have turned into the actual blood of christ still keeps me awake sometimes so what im saying im not gonna laugh you know well stock gave the impression he thought his place was haunted by the ghost of stewart ash but if you believe it was haunted maybe youre not looking at ash whose murderers were caught maybe youre looking at something that happened there a long time ago but that was never solved at all bliss blinked something else happened there should i know that maybe something was left that affected stephanie more than stock because she was a woman something that changed her personality youre suggesting mrs stock was possessed right i dont know if thats the right word tell me bliss said so lol actually told bliss about the lady of the bines about rebekah and conrad lake out here under a full moon it didnt sound entirely crazy while he was talking a mercedes drew up and a plump man with a pilots case walked past them to the gates without a sideways glance doesnt waste any time does he bliss commented right then youre saying that whatever the truth of the matter gerard stock notorious pissartist of this parish had every excuse for thinking his wife had been shall we say infected by the spirit of a woman whose murder had gone undetected not only undetected but undiscovered lol said this is not uninteresting laurence you think if i went back through the annals of the old herefordshire force i might find a reference to this missing gypsy not that im doubting your word but it might help to have that bit official i wish you would i will son no skin off my nose there that wasnt too hard was it i get very upset about how nobody wants to talk to us any more in case it gets taken down and used in evidence bliss patted lol on the shoulder see from merrilys point of view what would need to be shown was that stock wasnt just a dangerous mental case who only needed his blue touchpaper lighting by say an unwise exorcism carried out without due forethought et cetera et cetera but in fact an intelligent man forced by circumstances to grapple with possibilities to which hed not normally have given houseroom lol noticed merrily on the other side of the gate she was talking to one of the uniformed coppers she had her shoulder bag and her jacket draped over an arm looks like this is the bit where im called on to fence for a while with henrys foxy brief frannie bliss said um theres something else quick as you can lol its likely stewart ash had an unfinished manuscript suggesting conrad lake as rebekah smiths killer also some pictures photographs that lake took of rebekah naked with a hopbine wound around her the two most important elements in his life maybe or a sadomasochistic symbol of mr lakes dominance if she was tied up in the bine lol that too anyway we know stewart had them in his possession and that theyve disappeared be interesting to know if the smith boys did nick them and if they got a chance to pass them over to someone before they were arrested i mean how long after the killing were the boys brought in could they have hidden the papers and photos somewhere could that stuff still be found bliss nodded all right ill check it out might take a day or two and i might not be able to tell yer even if i do come up wid something but youll know the infos in good hands thanks son anything else you think of you know where to get me leominster or bromyard usually he moved towards the gates lol followed him so what exactly has howe got planned well it wont come from her will it itll come from the chief constable bliss stopped not a word ok you can tell merrily and thats it ok i mean it laurence i fuckn hate this politicking but im not gonna lose me job over it sure right this is it annies suggesting the chief puts out a press statement on the lines of if the church cant be relied on to police itself on matters of irresponsible exorcism without psychiatric backup and the like then it should be made far more open to legal redress words to that effect youre kidding i only wish it were so pal whats the bottom line the bottom line lol is that the chief constable of west mercia puts his name behind the suggestion that a priest who performs an exorcism that has unfortunate consequences should subsequently be held legally responsible for those consequences in this case for instance we could even be looking at manslaughter merrily came through the gate she looked worried she was digging in her bag for a cigarette lol said theyd want that she could actually go to prison thats extreme but bliss shrugged this could serve as an important precedent chances are nothingll come of it i mean they repealed the witchcraft act didnt they but itll certainly make everybody very nervous for a good while the church has no balls lol said no bishop in this country would ever sanction an exorcism again he watched merrily coming towards them the ruby glow of the cigarette between her fingers it wasnt the wider issue that worried him so much as what it would do to her prison ok unthinkable but being identified as the precedent would for merrily be immeasurably worse the pariah goodbye to the clergy obviously and then what hed never fully come to terms with the awesome concept of her as a curer of souls but exrev watkins the disgraced former priest the consequences of that didnt bear thinking about he couldnt tell her he had to do something as father flanagan used to say to us when we missed mass frannie bliss winked without humour acquired an irish accent dingding and theres another round to the devil witch trials there was a screen behind the altar in the barnchurch not a rood screen but the sort of concertina thing women used to toss their robes over in victorian bathrooms the greywhite figure was hanging from this screen like a giant moth jane stayed back the face was chipped and grotesque the face of a black dressshop dummy greasy white rings smeared around the eyes people touch her clothes usually layla riddock said weaving in the candlelight for healing jane recalled kirsty gypsies got their own virgin like a patron saint or a goddess the black virgin sara layla riddock said carelessly yes she helps amys had so much starchy religion pumped into her that we have to bring her down slowly saras the black virgin and you can view that two ways cant you a saint or an inversion or a semichristian mother goddess all ways she helps amys finding her true mother and through that her true self where is amy eirion said havent you taught him any other words yet jane layla tossed her hair jane was realizing for the first time how scarily intelligent she was watch my lips i dont know perhaps she went home perhaps shes walking the streets perhaps she let a rapist in dont jane shouted talk like that alk like at the walls sent back the echo this was a big empty place bigger than the average parish church layla seemed very much at home here your mother came to see allan she said and me what yesterday she was with another woman from the cathedral looking for amy didnt you know no thats funny because it sounded like someone had told her all about the steves shed experience so jane had backed up against something low and hard an old manger well that wasnt a very nice thing to do grass up your mates was it and it caused a nasty little row between me and allan making it difficult to get away tonight i arranged to meet amy here but im late and now shes pissed off anything couldve happened to her all because you had to blab what do you expect me to do my mum was in a hassle with the bishop because amy had laid it all on me because she was scared to put you in the frame what was i supposed to do layla shook her head in disgust the ring in her navel shone like the edge of a coin jane was bewildered and furious with herself how could she have let all this get turned around anyway she found herself saying petulantly it was you who set her up this is kirsty again yeah its the truth though isnt it you hated that family ever since her old man got your fortunetelling act pulled at the christmas fair layla smiled oh jane one forgets youre so young jane gritted her teeth caution cariad eirion whispered id go to all this trouble for that layla exploded for fucks sake what am i you predicted all kinds of bad stuff you sent old women home thinking they were going to die oh for gods sake i was pissed id spent a couple of hours in the pub with some guys then i go back to the school put on the clobber and i just couldnt bear to do all that youwillcomeintomoneyandgooverthewater shit so i just let it come through jane stared at layla in her black top and her black jeans standing next to the black virgin in her white robes and white headdress i can do this stuff the dukkering its a mixture of insight and scam you do the patter and sometimes the real stuff comes through but youre also observing judging what kind of a punter youve got and tailoring your predictions accordingly but i was pissed like i say i mean you wouldnt believe some of the people you get in there there was this old woman well dressed dripping with jewellery all she wanted to know was whether her friend who was in the hospice was going to leave all her money to her you think that age and all she cares about is more money i said yeah youll get the money but youd better spend it quick cause you aint got long yourself dearie silence jane looked at eirion there was a little smile twitching at his mouth layla chuckled in her throaty way the one i was a little sorry about afterwards but yeah i said it sure i said it was libby walker who used to do school dinners parttime you know libby shes about thirty and shes got about five kids all by different dads and everybody knows she just does it for a council house and the family allowance thats how thick and irresponsible she is and as soon as she came in the booth i could see shed got another one in the oven and i just lost patience and told her in this sinister voice that i could see a withering in her womb course the stupid bitch went bloody spare eirion made a little noise horribly suggestive of amusement which made jane blurt out you cursed mrs etchinson yeah layla sighed and fingered the hem of the robe of the black virgin yeah i did that i cursed mrs etchinson and mrs etchinson had got ms and we didnt know it and that was why she was so bloody ratty all the time im sorry what is this the salem witch trials layla eirion said the welsh coming out in his voice can we come back to the shelbone issue whatever you think about mr and mrs shelbone their dear little daughter has vanished and theyre worried sick and theyve been treated pretty abominably at your stepfathers house we saw this first they had their car smashed in by a man with an aggression problem who calls himself a gardener then your stepfather blatantly lied about it oh allans just a little boy layla said turns peevish if he doesnt get his own way forget all that hell get douglas hutton his lawyer to fix it money will change hands faces will be saved allans not a bad guy hes just a crook which everybody knows anyway he needs a gardener on account of so many people want to punch his lights out hmm eirion said jane wondered if dafydd sion lewis had a gardener too look layla said shelbones bonkers and hes the bane of allans life hes this kind of loose cannon puts the blocks on lucrative development thats necessarily bonkers jane said from allans point of view yes layla said patiently the situation was that allan had been after some dirt on shelbone for years unfortunately although hes out to lunch hes cleaner than the pope but some councillor knew about amys origins and allan told me and i admit i got so utterly tired of his constant ravings and his threats to have shelbones brakes seen to that i thought maybe if shelbone was already cracking up like everybody said maybe we could destabilize his life enough to push him into early retirement or something no real harm done so you admit it jane said yeah yeah yeah i admit it big deal i am a bad bad person but then my old man was a gypsy who conned his way into my mas pants and pinched her car and stuff so its in my genes its a hard and ugly world jane also amy was such a pompous little sod that for quite a while it was very much a pleasure i have to admit and i had kirsty whos this delightfully amoral creature with no sense of moderation it was all too funny but then layla went to sit on the altar between the candles she looked cool and exotic she didnt look at all worried about amy or anything else jane supposed that growing up in allan henrys household kind of emulsioned over your conscience but the really disturbing thing about all this was that the layla with the cutoff jumper and the navelring didnt really seem such a vicious evil person and this weird echoey halfchurch with the grotesque black virgin overseeing the proceedings wasnt the best environment for working out whether this was simply because she could be witchily enchanting and insidiously plausible or the word is youre quite interested in matters of the spirit yourself jane and i dont mean church er yeah kind of which of course was why i let you into stevies shed thinking you could be relied on thinking the last person you were going to tell was your old lady i couldnt know could i that she was going to get called in by the shelbones thinking their little girls possessed or something yeah layla tucked her legs under the altar thats what they would think me i just thought she was a pain i dont think any of us couldve known known what eirion asked layla glanced at him he ok with this stuff jane hes been around me for months layla smiled what none of us couldve known was that amy shelbone is the mostit blew me away what did shes a natural that kid is the most amazing natural psychic i ever encountered huh when we did the ouija and i know how to do this right i know how to move the glass and you would never know im doing it which was what i did i started it off and it was like the bloody internet i punch in justine and boom like a searchengine we have fortysix listings for justine you know what im saying all this stuff comes pouring through and i didnt have to do a thing the glass is moving like a bloody piston kirsty couldnt write fast enough she tell you this not the way youre telling it jane admitted ah shes in denial is kirsty it was just a scam to kirsty beyond that she wasnt interested all the time she wanted to think it was me swinging the glass i wanted to think it was me for a couple of weeks i did think it was me me as a psychic i got a little cocky then i did it with somebody else the ouija got squat layla looked down at her feet sodall embarrassing this was at the end of term next day i called amy picked her up when the shelbones were out and we came here she looked up jane what a blast we get into justine i ask a question the glass doesnt move wont move i couldnt push it i ask the question again amy starts speaking only its not her its not the little squeaky ill tell my mummy voice this is grownup its kind of raunchy and its got this brummy accent oh wow jane felt eirion squeezing her hand a warning he was telling her not to take all this as gospel he was reminding her that layla riddock was a notorious manipulator but like wow what im listening to is a detailed description of a killing little amy shelbone sitting there in her prim little summer frock and her mouths twisting spittle on her lips and this like slurred bitter voice going im gonna cut him this time i swear im gonna put him away for ever way for ever the walls sang jane dragged her hand away from eirions shoved it down into a pocket of her fleece so she like she really was possessed then mum got it completely wrong no layla shook her head briskly no way shes a medium its a different thing altogether the medium has control the medium can let the spirit come through and shut it off whenever jane i am psychic i get insights a lot of people are you know that its either in the blood or it isnt but its nothing i can control ive spent years trying to master it since i was about twelve read hundreds of books tried all kinds of stuff and im not a medium im just one of a million people who get insights she made me very jealous did little amy layla stood up lifted up the chalice sniffed the contents and put it back whatever eirion thought janes feeling was that this was the absolute unvarnished truth as layla saw it so what did you do i just marvelled jane i just wanted to understand the complete injustice of it i wanted to understand how come this obnoxious littleim going how longs this been happening to you you had experiences like this before you must have shes like what dyou mean did that mean she hadnt or she just didnt understand what you were talking about i still dont know for sure what i felt feel is that she hadnt or wasnt aware of having had any serious psychic experience quite often its something that doesnt happen until puberty but also shed been brought up in this strict religious household with the fear of the devil and all this stuff hanging over her and the bible on the bedside table she was surrounded by this big white wall of sterile puritanicalyou know what i mean yeah jane said excited now you kind of dislodged that you knew about her past you did the ouija thing you pushed out the block it all came flooding out and not only these awful suppressed memories but the whole the whole wall collapsed layla nodded the wall her parents the shelbones had thrown up around her maybe thinking they were protecting her i dont know but i think more likely they were just making sure she was theirs ive read about this loads of times often peoples psychic side gets awoken by some trauma like it could be physical a bump on the head or in this case something deeply emotional like you suddenly find out what your dad did to your mum no jane you remember what your dad did to your mum cause you were there and you saw it all this is incredible stuff jane said lets not eirion walked off into what she could now see was an aisle between not rows of pews but stalls and mangers lets not get carried away ladies doesnt this move you at all irene it makes me a little scared if you want the truth but then i come from a stiff puritanical religious but not so much any more no he said as if this was a cause for regret not so much any more so where do things stand now jane said to layla you tell me its all out now the shelbones are on the rampage i suppose the policell be out looking for the kid i mean i was excited sure but i also felt responsible for her still do obviously a person i dont even like but it was me that broke her through trying to help allan does that matter now seems so trivial money again hell go on piling it up and then hell die and you were going to meet her tonight eirion said here ive already said we were both excited hyped up for the full moon look its started to run away with itself bit like me when i first found out about my dad changed my whole world shes been rejecting the shelbones church for a while which is ok except she needs something to replace it and whats been replacing it is her justine jane said her own voice sounded hollow justine was real god wasnt i think she thought that tonight she was actually going to seeit nearly happened before i would swear it nearly happened what but jane was not sure she wanted to know it was just a haze a mist a fine grey mist but it was coming justine jane was shivering inside the fleece i think it was as if the cold was even getting to layla now she was hugging herself you want the truth im not sure how much i like justine she looked up towards the ventilation slit why doesnt the bloody kid come back she cant think ive deserted her just because i was late sometimes you could almost believe the stupid shelbones were her parents i think we should call the police eirion said if shes wandering the streets of hereford well its not the genteel country town it might once have been is it christ no layla said junkies out there muggers violent people like amys dad yeah give it a few minutes then call the police maybe its working out for the best after all maybe its better if she does go back into care maybe i let a bloody monster loose justine that name had a disturbing symmetrical sound for jane now she had to keep saying it layla looked up at the black virgin i lied about this lady shes my protection nothing to do with amy i always felt this affinity with sara the patron saint of gypsies but more than that like i said as long as shes up there watching over me i feel protected against whatever justine turns out to be more than i do jane confessed not that it was hard confessing anything to layla riddock any more it was as if in these past few minutes shed shed some age was far closer in years to jane look im sorry you know i got this badly wrong layla patted janes arm weve all got this wrong at some stage eirion watched them from a few yards away now that he said is something i find moving ill go out to the car and ring the police where follow the aisle and youll find a wooden door at the end its barred on this side hang on take a candle with you layla walked back to the flickering altar where the grotesque but evidently benevolent black virgin hung above it in her white robe as she reached the altar the black virgin fell with a slithering sound down from the screen in front of the candles oh god jane rushed back down the aisle shell catch light the black virgin rose up to meet her its white arms flapping which was kind of spooky but jane laughed and brushed the cotton robe aside and then layla fell into her arms oh jesus eirion cried out layla was coughing jane was aware of movement to her left but she was too intent on staying upright because layla was pretty heavy a big girl jane staggered back into the aisle under her weight her arms wrapped around layla who just kept coughing janes chin and neck were hot and wet now with what layla was coughing up vomit or bile oh gross it was when she became aware of the salty coppery tang that janes arms sprang apart in true horror one of the candles did set light to the robe of sara the patron saint of the romanies jane saw the flames suddenly leap and then in their light she saw the girl with straight blonde hair in a white dress it looked like a confirmation dress standing on the altar with the carving knife held high and dripping then amy shelbone leaped down from the altar and ran jerkily up the aisle and as jane stood there with laylas lifeblood on her throat and chest amy also stabbed eirion part four the healers role will lie not only in rescuing a lost soul but also in

person is addressed in terms of love and consolation in which the eternal forgiveness of god is emphasized martin israel exorcism retribution when they finally made it home the dawn was bleeding freely over ledwardine less than half an hour after going to her own bed jane appeared in merrilys bedroom doorway it was am the sun was well up now it was already somehow humid and airless cold jane said and slipped into bed beside merrily eventually merrily slept for almost an hour though it felt like four minutes all the time the phone was ringing downstairs or so it seemed at just after seven am she rose quietly jane was still sleeping merrily prayed in a desultory way had a quick lukewarm shower all the stored hot water had fallen on jane not so very long ago jane hadnt wanted to come out of the shower ever in towelling robe and slippers merrily went down to the kitchen and put the kettle on the phone was ringing again she didnt react to it she put out both wet and dry food for ethel the cat she made herself some tea outside it was as sunny as it had been yesterday morning and the morning before this would be the last day of the miniheatwave someone had said more little yellowgreen apples had fallen to the ochre lawn merrily felt like the world was in colour and she was in black and white and grey she felt like a ghost in the sculleryoffice she sat down in the usual sunbeam with her tea the phone was still ringing there were twentyfive messages on the answering machine which meant that the tape was full merrily unplugged the phone and forced herself to play every one there were calls from papers and radio stations shed never even heard of there was a call from a woman who even gave her name mrs fry said merrily was a smug ambitious little bitch who deserved everything she had coming to her merrily didnt recognize the voice there was a call from someone a man who just sniggered and hung up it was a vaguely familiar snigger quite possibly a church organist who had once exposed himself to her over a tombstone stocks death had been announced too late for most of the papers the sniggerer like mrs fry whoever she was had probably been inspired by something on the radio or breakfast tv what did it matter now a call from dafydd sion lewis in pembrokeshire began without preamble mrs watkins i consider myself a liberal parent and what my son does in his own time is for the most part his own business however merrily had already spoken to dafydd sion lewis awakening him at threethirty am because she didnt want the police to call him first the only useful message was from ds andy mumford at hereford mrs watkins thought youd want to know we found amy shelbone wandering near clehonger couple of miles from the barnchurch estate well be talking to her properly today and if we could see jane again that would be useful oh we still havent found the knife but were searching there were several calls she had to make she plugged in the phone and picked it up a mans voice said hello damn how could that happen is that merrily watkins yes she said the word didnt come out yes she decided at that moment that whichever paper this was she would answer whatever questions were put to her and she would tell the entire truth this would save a lot of time and in no way alter the final verdict this is simon st john at knights frome oh yeah im very sorry to bother you so early i was going to leave a message on your machine actually i understand from lol that youve had a stressful night so you may not want to be involved in this its just that ive been talking to the boswells oh and we decided that something needed to be done in relation to in relation to a particular area of ground and the building on its perimeter pardon me merrily said but werent you invited to attend to this particular problem a while ago approximately two deaths ago in fact she waited for him to hang up the way hed done with lol i can understand your bitterness he said at last wouldnt call it that exactly i really admire your ability to tell people with problems exactly where they can shove them i think its an enviable quality in a clergyman well he said if you do feel inclined to help well be meeting at the hop museum between ten and tenthirty tonight this morning it has to be done at noon what does al and i agreed this seems to require a more customized procedure theres a traditional romany form of exorcism i believe they have a word or phrase meaning soulretrieval but im buggered if i can remember it a shadow fell across the desk she turned in her chair eirion stood there oh he backed away i didnt sorry she waved to eirion that it was ok its all a bit of a rush isnt it she said to simon st john well it she picked up either crackle on the line or some agitation als in a state a bad way and i suppose im what time did you say midday why because it has to be al will explain we were planning to meet as soon after ten as possible i dont know if i can make that its ok he said i just thank you for your and now he did hang up lol grabbed the ringing phone hoping it was merrily hed given up trying to call her at the vicarage last nightthis morning hed forgotten to ask for her mobile number he hadnt been to bed he was rediscovering on the far shores of fatigue a state of heightened consciousness produced by a cocktail of body chemicals that he suspected was only rarely mixed it happened sometimes after a whole night in the studio afterwards the hangover would be awesome but right now he was floating on a luminous pool of awareness good morning laurence frannie bliss said briskly youre up then gorra pen not on me good dont get one there was the unmuffled sound of mainroad traffic bliss was clearly outside on a mobile some night then in the end eh quite a few added complications to this shelbone business sounds like whats merrilys take on it havent spoken to her for a few hours never mind not my case anyway lets leave that alone times short i got in early this morning couldnt sleep bloody full moon and i was thinking about what you were saying about mrs stock so i had another look in stocks computer we brought his computer in fascinating all the things a computerll tell you about its owner i got into his internet files you click on history and the computer very kindly tells yer all the web sites stock and his missus have been into the last months or so now what was the general subject that most interested one or the other or both of them over the past few weeks gypsies youre on the ball this morning son aye theres about ten files on the general subject of gypsies which i already knew about of course and no big mystery there because that was mr ashs main interest too but i did begin to detect another element coming through either stock or mrs stock was going back to the same sites following up particular angles gypsies and death was a popular one gypsy death rituals and gypsy ghosts and evil spirits the mulo exactly the living dead you wouldnt want one would you the female version might be all right at first but shed start to wear yer out after a while couldnt keep up could you go bloody mad especially if you were already having problems down there precisely now what would you do to get rid of it several suggestions came up on this one particular web site you could drive steel or iron needles into the heart of the corpse or a hawthorn stake through one of its legs or you could simply chop its head off isnt that interesting it is isnt it lol said soberly course this is corpses and i think we can assume mrs stock was not one of the walking dead but then if as you suggest the normally rational gerard had come to believe his wife had been taken over by one of these things and if she was making demands on him he was failing to satisfy and if hed got in an exorcist to sort her out and if the minute the exorcist had left the premises stephanie appeared to be unaffected or even go on perhaps even perversely stimulated by it lol thought maybe prayers focused on helping stewart ash didnt quite hit the spot he said but how was merrily to know that how indeed because stock wasnt telling the truth was he why break the habit of a lifetime you going to tell howe about this not yet anyway it might not have the desired effect coming from me shes the governor she decides what line we take she could tell me to leave the gypsy stuff alone and thats me silenced would she she might but lets talk about the disappearance of this gypsy girl in the autumn of sixtythree and the recent murder of stewart ash whats the connecting factor between these two events there is one there is my son long as we agree you never heard it from me sorry lol said who are you again good boy listen this is something i cant help you with beyond what im about to say might be something or nothing either way youll have to follow it up for yourself cherished reputations at stake i didnt go through official channels because you leave tracks that way but i did put in a call first thing to a former copper who i wont name who used to be based at bromyard and as it happened was one of the pcs involved in what you could describe as the lessthanintensive search for rebekah smith and who as a local man was well aware of all the rumours about the womanizing activities of the late mr conrad lake you with me all the way lol said merrily brought some tea over to eirion at the kitchen table how is it oh you know bit sore stiff couldnt sleep not really is there anything i can do well im supposed to go back and have the dressing changed this afternoon thats not quite what i meant no he said can we talk we can try merrily sat down the dressing was on his upper arm just below the shoulder the woman doctor in accident and emergency stitching up the gash had said the point of the blade didnt seem to have quite penetrated to the bone dafydd lewis had started saying hed come over at once take the boy back to withybush hospital at haverfordwest but eirion had insisted he wanted to stay here and see this through besides he assumed the police would want to talk to him again anyway i dont deserve any sleep he said to merrily if wed stayed out of it this would never have happened you should never say that perhaps something even worse mightve happened personally eirion said i really cant conceive of anything worse than what did happen hows jane sleeping shed put eirion in one of the bedrooms on the first floor janes in a bad way about this he said i know she thinks she was guilty of rather demonizing layla it was the first thing jane had said when merrily and lol had arrived at the barnchurch mum i got her deeply deeply wrong we started talking and gradually she was like really normal like a friend a mate oh god jane was looking like the time when as a very small girl shed found a pot of raspberry jam and got it all over her face and down her front only it wasnt jam this time and it was even in her hair so much of it that merrilyd panicked and thought she must have been stabbed too and hadnt bothered to tell the paramedics layla died mum i watched her dying i watched her heaving and shivering and struggling for breath oh jesus jesus jesus in fact layla had passed away in the ambulance multiple stab wounds at least one believed to have penetrated a lung it was eirion whod had to watch her die on the way to casualty the ambulance leaving as the fire engines came in the barnchurch had burned to a shell the flames had already been into the rafters when jane and the wounded eirion had brought layla out the kid must have been behind that screen the whole time he said now clutching her knife what was she doing with a knife well ii believe her mother justine used to take a kitchen knife with her as protection when she went to a local church to hide from amys father this was the knife he ended up using on her i couldnt believe the strength in her she was like a wildcat a puma or something the flames behind her that white party dress it was terrifying sort of elemental i was just shaking all over afterwards im sure im going to see her in nightmares for the rest of my life itll fade eirion i promise erm i know the police have asked you this but what do you think brought it on eirion drank some tea trying not to move his injured arm ive thought about it a lot more obviously since i talked to the police i suppose if you were looking for an ordinary rational explanation youd have to say it was because of what layla had been telling us she wasnt being particularly polite about amy one of the last things she said before it happened she called amy a monster and said perhaps it wouldnt be a bad thing if she was put into care merrily nodded mmm and if we werent looking for an ordinary rational explanation well earlier layla told us how the spiritualism thing had started with her stepfather allan finding out about amys history when he was looking for some dirt on mr shelbone because its ok i know about that and then layla got excited because she assumed she was doing it that it was coming through her but then the further they went with it the more they realized that it was actually amy amy layla said amy was this incredible natural medium it was amy who had raised her mother if you like eirion drank more tea i think layla had the idea that if she stuck with amy kind of supervising her progress then shed see some you know amazing things she said this is all a bit creepy for me mrs watkins but she said that it seemed like justine had been about to kind of you know manifest which was why they were here on the night of the full moon because thered been one the night justine died and layla was convinced amy was the real medium she said shed been trying to develop her own psychic side for years and suddenly here was this awful repressed little girl who was a natural she said she was quite jealous thats more or less what she said does this mean amy could be in some way possessed i dont know merrily was thinking back to the intense truncated night in her own church when an eighteenthcentury penny had supposedly given her gods spin on the problem no demonic possession in this case no possession by an unquiet spirit i suppose she said clutching another of those slender straws frequently offered to you by faith that mediumship and spiritual possession are separated by a degree of control the medium consents to open herself to the spirit knowing she can always close the door thats more or less what layla said except were not talking about betty shine here were talking about a fourteenyearold schoolgirl and a fairly archaic example of the species at that impressionable naive will she be charged with murder i dont see how they can avoid it she was momentarily haunted again by thoughts shed kept pushing away about the similarities between this killing and stocks murder of his wife in fact when you examined them individually the similarities were not so great since the romany element was peripheral to the shelbone issue to an outsider the strongest link between the two cases would be herself deliverance failed its tragic eirion said when you think about it its tragic for everyone layla riddock she was about the same age as me and she was there were tears in his eyes she was obviously incredibly intelligent and there she was one minute coolly analysing the situation the next coughing up all that blood and then in the ambulance what a terrible waste mrs watkins ive heard people say that so many times but when you actually eirion merrily said you really are a nice guy you risk alienating your family to pursue janes whim you no im not he stared at her blinking in agony i slept with your daughter his features slumped into comical dejection like a boxer puppys i see merrily said softly last night well evening it was the first time it was why we were so late getting to the shelbones we fell asleep you see thats another thing retribution if we hadnt been to bed wed have got there earlier and layla might still be alive its retribution i really dont think so suddenly she wanted to laugh shed often thought about what shed say in this situation and now she didnt know what she wanted to say except well thanks for telling me im sorry eirion said well you know its not i do love jane you see yeah thats er thats the impression i already had i mean it wasnt casual sex im a not a very casual sort of bloke no in fact this was the you know the first time you said no i mean for me for me too i see does jane know that well he said thats probably not the impression ive given her no i wont tell her then thats very good of you but just just take good care of her you know what im saying i think so i was only about three years older than you when i was pregnant so ive tended not to come on heavy with jane so as to avoid any mention of pots kettles and the colour black he smiled tentatively on the shelf beside the aga merrilys mobile began to bleep excuse me a sec sophie sounded as if she had a cold this was the sophie who never seemed to get colds not even in winter im afraid the bishops back she said good merrily lied carrying the mobile to the window a short time ago we took a call from the church of england press office which has learned of inquiries from west mercia police and also i understand from the crown prosecution service about the churchs guidelines on exorcism do you know anything about this merrily not a thing merrily stood looking out over the vicarage garden this was only their second summer here it seemed like half a lifetime the press office also understands there may be a statement from west mercia very soon expressing dismay at the way the church of england reacted to the stock case the upshot is likely to be a call for the church to be held more directly answerable for the effects of whats been described as irresponsible ministry but doesnt this preempt the result of the inquest isnt it usually the coroner who makes comments like that i think its more of a reaction from the police to an impending onslaught by the media it could be weeks or months before the inquests over anyway the diocese needs to prepare a counter statement so an emergency meetings been called at the bishops palace for this morning the bishop needs to hear your explanations in considerable detail to decide if any of its rational enough to repeat hang on you just said the crown prosecution service but stocks dead so theres no prosecution only the inquest why should the cps oh quite sophie said oh my god merrily went cold it doesnt necessarily mean anyones contemplating prosecuting either the church or or or me im very sorry to have to drop this on you merrily hardly your fault how could it have come to this the meetings at eleven am sophie said on the dot if i were you id sophie perhaps you could make my apologies pause she counted six seven eight nine little green cider apples on the lawn sophie said im sorry ive got another appointment thats all merrily lets be perfectly clear about this you do realize what your nonappearance would be taken to imply dont you things have happened dont suppose the news has reached the cathedral close yet news allan henrys stepdaughter layla you remember layla black kimono champagne glass layla was stabbed to death early this morning by amy shelbone who also injured eirion what sophies voice was faint and fractured like the crinkling of tissue paper thats actually not the reason i wont be able to make it to the meeting merrily said but i thought you should know lol picked up his keys locked the stables and drove the astra up the lane despite the window being wound all the way down the day was already too hot for him already he felt oppressed on his way through knights frome he spotted simon st john standing on the humpback bridge simon started flagging him down im sorry lol he was wearing a black shirt and a dog collar and very old jeans he was sweating and his hair looked like the leaves of a longabandoned house plant whatever i said to you the other night im sorry dont you remember whatever it was it was probably offensive and im sorry simon squinted the sun directly in his eyes but he made no effort to avoid it have you spoken to mrs watkins today not since first light lol i need her lol stared at him said nothing im in a lot of trouble simons eyes were glassy with sunlight and anxiety i phoned her and asked her to come over but im not sure shes going to tell me lol said he didnt have that much time but if this involved merrily he wanted to know about it its a priest thing simon started to laugh oh fucking hell why do you swear so much simon denial im a sick polluted priest in denial pity me lol were not exactly twin souls you and i but i guess weve been to some of the same places in my case complicated from time to time as you may have heard by a certain sexual ambivalence but then in the seventies and eighties an entirely heterosexual rock musician was considered a serious pervert thats not the pollution though is it lol said from his vantage point on the hill of no sleep what was the point of all this confessional stuff it was as though simon was desperate to convey sincerity openness oh no the vicar said physical pressures i can control he turned his head and stared at the bridge the church the roofs of the village this bloody place lol suddenly thought of isabel in the churchyard seemed such a nice boring place it did after wales no historical baggage no history at all that wasnt to do with hops perfect it was and now blood everywhere im horribly horribly sensitive lol simon said thats my problem like people with a skin condition who cant go out in the sun will you tell her that eirion saw she had other preoccupations and said perhaps hed take a walk around the village when hed gone merrily phoned huw owen over in the brecon beacons aye he said wondered if youd be calling one of these days we do get the papers up here not necessarily the same day mind anyroad say nowt thats my advice when the trial dates set well happen have a chat about it there wont be a trial he hanged himself last night who stock in his cell at the remand centre simplifies things huw said no it doesnt you can get yourself through an inquest you can tell the coroner why any comparisons with the taylor case are inappropriate no i mean yes all thats very much on the cards and im really trying not to think about it yet but to complicate things informed sources at knights frome are suggesting theres a remaining problem at this kiln place that the killing happened not because stock was in any way possessed but because his wife was by what a gypsy girl went missing back in the sixties theres reason to think she was imprisoned in the kiln and either strangled or choked to death on sulphur and then her body was burned in the furnace all i wanted to ask is have you had any dealings with or do you know anything about romany beliefs specifically specifically the mulo he didnt say he had he didnt say he hadnt how long you got to play with she told him expecting him to laugh he didnt walk away lass he said just take a holiday theres no shame in that avoiding the second death her hair fell not much more than shoulderlength but was bushed out maybe a little frizzy her nose was hooked her mouth small but fulllipped the sleeveless white blouse she wore was knotted under her breasts she had her hands clasped behind her head her face upturned smiling at the sun eating the world rebekah the black and white photograph was pinned to the wall above a small inglenook in the back room eating the world and then she choked it broke your heart thats not one of lakes merrily asked al mother of god no its a blowup of a picture she sent to tit bits or reveille you remember those old glamour magazines looking for a career as a pinup or a model it was found after she disappeared the family had copies made to show around to see if anyone had seen her they had to conduct their own search in the end thats ridiculous ah in those days as sally may have said to you people from ethnic minorities were not considered proper people his eyes were quiet this morning even the beautiful ones the back room of the hop museum was not open to the public because it also served as a workshop it ran the length of the main building and the two shorter walls were lined with racks of hand tools probably antiques in themselves there were a pair of elderly woodlathes and a bench with a bunsen burner attached to a liquidgas bottle guitar parts necks pine tops bridges hung from walls and beams there was a rich composite aroma of glue and resin and wood and hops of course the scent of hops was unavoidable in this place in a white waistcoat and a spotted silk scarf which merrily recalled from childhood was called a diklo al had welcomed her with a small bow and a kiss on the hand now he was moving around the workshop picking up guitar fragments and gently putting them down a sign down by the road had said museum closed all day they were still waiting for simon st john what do you want me to do merrily asked al im afraid i dont really have as much time as id have liked shed told him as much as she needed to of what had happened after she and lol had left knights frome last night and ill need to be there obviously when the police come to talk to jane al was nodding but she could tell he was somewhere else jane might sleep for hours yet eirion had kept insisting you go i can tell this is important and when she comes down weve got a lot to talk about havent we at least it wasnt far she could be back in just over half an hour if necessary if they could hold off the police until this afternoon that would help shed already called mumford asked if this was possible mumford had said weve found a knife by the way al was still nodding his goblin chin by one oclock it should be over by one well have done all we can do but are we trying for the same thing to bring her into the light al said but is it the same light light is light drukerimaskri you know that i suppose she didnt even know if he was a christian wheres sally gone for a walk coming to terms how happy is she about what youre proposing ah he picked up an unstained guitar neck only half fretted held it up to one eye and looked along it well she thinks we should have acted on this when we first suspected something was arising i tried i talked to stock way back told him to sell the place to lake take his wife away from here did you ah but stocks patting me on the shoulder patronizing like im this colourful old rural character perhaps i shouldve had more patience with stock told him i was boswell the guitarmaker but i didnt want him to know consequently perhaps i dont suppose he believed a word i was telling him he must have believed something in the end he went to simon st john and then he came to me poor simon he doesnt want to do this even now hes afraid for himself and for his wife hes afraid of what he might bring down on his wife merrily didnt quite understand but it was clear that nobody seemed to be entirely happy about this perhaps not even al himself then why today she asked him why the hurry its not a hurry for me drukerimaskri he put down the guitar neck ive had years to prepare why you because im the only romany left and because its always been my responsibility why al peered around the workshop as if to record every detail in his mind as if to hold a memory of it i think simons here he said the address frannie bliss had given him proved to be a threestorey victorian terrace on the main road out of leominster lol parked the astra half on the pavement from where he could see the numbers on the front doors the man he was looking for lived in the groundfloor flat at the far end of the terrace but he owned the whole building bliss had emphasized as if this explained something lol sat there for ten minutes the car slowly turning into a roasting tin around him he thought about simon st john who had once said this is the country lol in the country in certain situations everybody lies had simon himself really been telling the truth this time had he genuinely been too scared to attempt to exorcize stocks kiln in which case why hadnt he referred it directly to merrily instead of trying to claim stock was making it up lol concluded that in an irrational situation people acted irrationally how would merrily react would she help simon now despite everything stupid question no time for stupid questions as lol got out of the car the front door at the end of the terrace opened and a man in a light blue suit came out lol stayed close to the astra the man didnt look behind him or towards lol as he walked out of the entrance could this actually be the right guy wide shoulders stiff white hair stop him now accost him before he got into his car but the man didnt go to a car he walked briskly along the pavement when a woman passed him he said warmly how are you my dear glanced up into the sky make the most of it its due to break today i hear rich rolling local accent lol followed him to where the road widened and you could see a junction with fields beyond but before that there was a big safeway supermarket a commercial palace with a tower set well back behind its car park the man almost skipped down the steps towards the supermarket lol waited until hed reached the bottom and was strolling across the car park towards the entrance before following he watched the whitehaired man go through the automatic door hesitated was he supposed to challenge this guy across the fruit counter maybe block his trolley in one of the aisles lol went through the door through the porch past postman pat and his black and white cat in their van and on into the store he looked from side to side a dozen or so customers none of them a man in a blue suit maybe hed gone to the gents lol moved further into the store uncertain he felt conspicuous so he picked up a shopping basket from a stack he felt hollow he was hollow he couldnt do this the voice was very close to his left ear looking for me brother a clock made out of a breadboard with a sixpointed star on it put the time at tenfifteen am why noon merrily asked bluntly simon st john exchanged a glance with al al was sitting straightbacked on his stool determinedly defiant with his hands in the side pockets of his waistcoat simon st john however looked as wrecked as his jeans when we travelled al said we camped at night but we always stopped the wagons at noon the time of no shadows do you understand noon is the dead moment in time when the day belongs to the dead all the energy of the day sucked in sometimes for a fraction of an instant you can almost see it like a photograph turned negative everything is still everything the road the fields the sky belonging to the dead he means that noon is the time of the mulo simon said the only time youll see one by daylight no al tossed a guitar bridge from one hand to the other in most cases you wont see it at all merrily shrank from the melodrama the time of no shadows and yet you do know dont you that we did the deliverance in the kiln around midday stock wanted me to do it at night i said lets do it now in the full light of a summer morning lets not make it sinister you did know that and was this when the sulphur came to you at midday yes or very close al glanced at the photograph she could have had you you were lucky or protected and were you protected in the hopyard last night merrily felt herself blush it happened too quickly lucky al said what is she merrily asked i need to know you use these terms muli very sinister but what are we really talking about simon st john came over to sit down he had a glass of water all three of them were drinking water no alcohol no caffeine not today not quite a ghost simon said not possession either in the classic sense you could say its a question of borrowing the aura very much a romany thing al pointed out live lightly and borrow but the mulo doesnt necessarily give back simon said he kept rubbing his blackshirted arms as though they were cold this is true al accepted simon said when shakespeare talked about shuffling off the mortal coil he was probably close to it death appears to be a staggered process when the body dies the spirit exists for a while in the aura the astral body the corporeal energy field its normal procedure at this stage is to look for the exit sign and get the hell out but if the cycles incomplete al said if theres a need for justice for balance for satisfaction merrily thought about it this is about whats sometimes called the second death isnt it this is about avoiding the second death simon leaned forward i dont think its common not in our society i dont imagine its a common occurrence in the romany culture either i think its something theyve tended to blow up out of proportion over the centuries i bloody hope it is its an unpleasant state to be in al said because the mulois said to require lifeenergy to maintain its existence hence the term living dead there are tales of a mulo or muli sucking the blood of the living but he waved a long hand dismissively its all energy sexual mostly the victim may be the former lifepartner you get tales of people having sex with their dead husbands or wives or the person held responsible for the sudden death of the subject before their time in the stories they talk of a solid physical presence simon said but we prefer dreams or sexual fantasies youre selling it as psychology merrily asked doubtful its all psychology simon said that doesnt make it any less real it doesnt make it any less frightening his face was gaunt it was one of those soft pale faces which could alternate in seconds between looking youthful and prematurely aged the thought of rebekah or what she may have become leaves me cold withim sorry al stood up and walked over to the photograph it seems to me that our task is to separate the spirit of rebekah from whats formed around it the evil that grows like fungus around hatred and rage you follow drukerimaskri and lead it to god to the light and the evil simon said sourly where does that go my responsibility al walked to the door you two probably have christian things to work out im going to the place im going to talk to my father come when youre ready you wont disturb me al merrily touched his sleeve itll work out drukerimaskri he looked again at the picture of the young woman amateurishly pouting at the sun shes ripe shes swollen we cant delay he walked out without looking back councillor howe said small piece of advice brother robinson in case youre ever called upon to tail anybody again nobody comes shopping at a supermarket and parks half a mile away just a small point thanks lol took the two cups of tea off the tray along with charlie howes doughnut this time in the morning fewer than a quarter of the tables in the supermarket coffee shop were taken they were sitting at a window table just up from the creche i take it this ent council business then charlie howes brown leathery face was not remotely wary he bit into his doughnut dark liquid jam spurted charlie licked his fingers and youre not a newspaperman after my memoirs newspaper no lol said memoirs probably cost you boy bought you a doughnut charlie smiled that gets you as far as nothing much happened that year i was still a beat copper how about sixtythree young dc then still hadnt done my first murder what did you say you did for a living write songs his eyes were deepsunk in his craggy forehead like rockpools so thisd be the ballad of charlie howe then lol fought the urge to look away out of the window how about the ballad of rebekah smith charlie raised an eyebrow dont reckon thats a song would mean an awful lot to me maybe youd only be in the last verse lol said merrily lit a cigarette simon st john eased his stool a few inches further along the bench you always smoke before an exorcism sounds like that old joke merrily said do you always smoke after sex no only when what did he mean talk to his father his father the chovihano dead these twenty years didnt speak to al for the previous twenty because al came off the road married a gaujo cardinal sin punishable by lifelong curse sally once told me he and al have been communicating better in the past three years than the previous forty candidly merrily said do you believe that stuff why not they talk to the ancestors like we try to talk to god their own ancestors not anyone elses what about you i have a fairly strict rule i talk to living people and i try to listen to god anything else i see or hear nowadays i turn off the fucking set rapido youre saying youve seen and heard more than most of us he laughed and youve had a bad experience with that ive had a whole sequence of bad experiences mrs watkins ive had the living shit scared out me ive been afraid for myself for my friends and worst of all for my very dear wife my soulmate merrily said cautiously israel believes all exorcists should be psychic to a degree which i suppose means you could be a lot better at this than me he doesnt however say all psychics should be exorcists spare a cig sorry i assumed periodic vices all my vices have been periodic the worst kind look my view on suffering is simple you ask the question is anyone benefiting from this if not dont fucking suffer what about stock we couldnt help stock his only recourse was to get out and i told him that al told him that but stock was stock so why this now its for sally simon lit up holding the cigarette between finger and thumb like youd hold a joint sally didnt want al doing this on his own why does he have to do it at all ancestral ties who else is gonna do it al was trained for years in the romany mysteries and then backed off bit like me really but i only backed off to a place that looked safe nowheres really safe is it you ready now what are we going to do deal with this stupid bitch i suppose he went up to the picture of rebekah smith i meant what are we going to do those christian things simon turned back to merrily you ever sleep with lol no poor sod puts you on a pedestal he thinks youre a much better person than he is purer holier youre going to have to make all the running i fear people tend to underestimate lol merrily said where is he anyway id somehow expected him to be here nah this is a priest thing he drove off somewhere she stiffened where he shook his head dont worry about it he had another deep drag on his cigarette anyway im very grateful to you for coming im sure you are simon meaning what its a setup isnt it for instance why cant you and al do this on your own maybe we could no you bloody couldnt merrily said because you need a woman because of the nature of it there has to be a woman doesnt there its a female entity so it needs a womans energy a womans aura poor stephanie underlined that and who else who else before stephie simons eyes didnt move ok i suspect there was some similar impact on the second mrs conrad lake adams mother but she was wise enough to get out before too long and the hereford hookers sure and the working girls of worcester come back to my kiln my dear help me recapture some old memories each one of them acquiring however briefly the essence the destructive essence of rebekah smith i just hope none of them ever got into his car a second time i pray the psychological damage wasnt permanent he grimaced depends what fucking conrad did to them not much by the end id imagine i suppose the times he couldnt get himself fixed up hed potter along to the kiln and get autoerotic over his photographs and shed be there for him like a drug a craving yeah until he died how far you want to take this i dont know if its an infection like the wilt or a sporadic phenomenon i dont know whether its a wilful spirit or an imprint should i be poetic here should i say it came out of the kiln on the smoke of rebekahs cremation was it scattered with her ashes how the hell can we know until you present her with a womans aura to enter you probably wont she met his eyes and saw the fear behind the aggression you done this sort of thing before merrily that a serious question what i meant was theres nothing in the book on this one is there when she comes if she comes youll have to be fully aware of her and at the same time have a strong enough sense of your spiritual self to keep her out at that point youll be very much on your own i do hope not merrily said simon st john smiled tiredly he might see it as a little test for you just dont count on the parachute opening merrily looked into simons light blue eyes for flecks of bullshit saw only the faded sorrow of experience drukerimaskri charlie sat back with his hands on his knees and his tea going as cold as anything could in this weather his smile was constant and condescending although he wasnt looking directly at lol most of the time lol felt under intense study if this is poker charlie said at last you better show me some cards boy ron welfare hesitantly lol brought out the only name hed been given by frannie bliss pc ronald welfare hed have been one of your old colleagues dead charlie said with contempt ron welfare talked to a bloke who saw a woman closely resembling rebekah smith going over to the kiln and the door opening and a man closely resembling conrad lake standing there in the light before the woman was admitted charlie made no comment there were probably other witnesses but most of them would have had some family members still employed by lake this was a chap from outside the area whod gone to visit his mother nearby howre you terry charlie called out to a man leaving the coffee shop dont forget to get that application in before september now lol pressed on he realized no ordinary former copper would even be talking to him by now but charlie howe was a prominent local councillor a friend to the people an open book and maybe his ward was a marginal and also they were in a public place and you couldnt tell whether charlie was worried now or just curious ron welfare was so convinced he was on to something that he even worked on it in his spare time lol said but no police were going to risk grilling lake because he was the emperor of frome and he owned half the valley and rebekah smith was considered the lowest of the low could be youre a journalist charlie said thoughtfully but i dont think so you dont talk like a journalist when ron eventually reported it to his superiors a detective was assigned to check it out by this time ron had put some more stuff together reports of the kiln furnace being fired for two days or more even though the hop season was well over not unusual charlie said furnaces can be used for more than drying hops you dont talk like somebody works for some gypsyloving civilliberties charity either did you never have the furnace checked out for lol struggled to keep the ignorance out of his eyes i dont know fragments of bone or whatever were there any forensic tests no need boy waste of resources wouldve been seeing as the hunt was called off that very night now i wonder if youre simply someone with a grudge against the lake family the witness didnt stand by his story in the end suddenly he said he couldnt be sure or maybe somebody made it worth his while to drop it or perhaps its me youre after perhaps you or some mate of yours is trying for the council but that dont make a whole lot of sense you wouldnt come and face me up with some halfarsed story less you got a little cassette recorder on you but you ent even wearing a jacket no charlie leaned back its a puzzle but for the record that girl probably left home like a lot of young gypos did sick of a life of squalor and ducking and diving and the gypos never ones to miss an opportunity made out she was missing presumed dead to get back at brother lake for kicking them off his land whole bunch of em shouldve been charged with wasting police time rebekah smith shes probably a suburban granny now keeping very quiet about her origins but ron welfare never forgot and he never did make cid his career kind of stopped right there for some reason ron welfare left the force years back ron welfare was a secondrate copper and a sick and bitter man however lol said the dc who went with him to question lake he did really well he was a sergeant by the end of the year and he never looked back at all did he the condescending smile was history well now charlie leaned forward his face close up to lols eyes like knucklebones you wouldnt by any chance be suggesting this detective was corrupt would you brother point of no return lol wondered briefly if he hadnt been set up by bliss no fan of annie howe to stir an old pot he made himself meet charlie howes bruising gaze lake was a very powerful figure locally influential so conrad was buying off witnesses and bribing policemen to look the other way isnt that how it was in those days a strong squirearchy and senior policemen expected to be in the masons ill ask you once again boy are you suggesting this particular detective was bent i dont know because another alternative about you that occurs to me would be attempted blackmail of course only a very stupid person would attempt to blackmail an expoliceman but then smalltime blackmailers often are very stupid people lol shook his head and shy charlie howe said theyre often a bit shy and hesitant bit timid see a real criminal hed go and hold up a bloody garage but your smalltime blackmailer he ent got the bottle hes quite often someone on the small side of average maybe unsuccessful in his career a misfit a social inadequate with a personality defect would that be you brother robinson charlie sneered aye that could very well be you two elderly ladies brought their trays to the next table and charlie broke off to smile pleasantly at them raise a hand so piss off boy he muttered out of the side of his mouth take your fortyyearold cobbledtogether nonsense somewhere else and dont try and play with the pros lols hands were gripping the sides of his chair and for about half a second he seemed to be looking down on himself and the whitehaired man with the leathery face that condescending smile returning to it right youve done it now brother howe surprised at how calm he sounded im going to tell you exactly why im here just so youll know that its nothing to do with money absolutely the reverse in fact and theres nothing you can ever do to scare me off charlie howe blinked just once it was the first time lol had noticed him do that and also why he went on if i ever find out you did take money or favours or even benefit from a word from the emperor of frome in the right chief superintendents ear or that your old mate andy mumford slipped you some pictures and a manuscript he took off the smith brothers when he nicked them for murder if i find out any of that im going to hang you up to dry so high that from where you are i really will look very very small the old ladies were looking across charlie howe smiled and it was not lol noticed with immense relief an entirely comfortable smile my place next i think mr robinson he said at precisely merrily and simon st john drove over to prof levins studio left the volvo on the back forecourt and walked down the track through the meadow the hay lay like stilled waves either side of a causeway there were still traces of heat haze over the malverns merrily saw the frome valley as an airless spectral netherland where the real and the unreal wrestled in an amorphous tangle of threshing limbs she was afraid not yet eleven on a wonderful summer morning the kind of morning that dissolved fatigue the kind of morning from which the uncanny was banished but she was afraid her stomach felt weak her throat was dry and sore walk away huw had said no shame this would probably be her last deliverance job bit of an occasion in the museum shed put on her light grey cotton alb and a large pectoral cross for the aura a holy cross is supposed to condition it isnt it the aura so i believe simon said just as ordination does and regular prayer the celebration of the eucharist all protective simon smiled in a halfhearted way felt in a hip pocket of his jeans and brought out a heavy gold cross on a chain slipped it over his head what about al merrily said i doubt it im sorry al wont be looking for protection why not because gypsies believe in destiny and al believes this is his i dont understand oh i think you do merrily theyd arrived at the bridge over the frome she stopped and stared down into the dark water of lols river she supposed shed known since last night its the unspoken isnt it the first mrs lake there you are then does everyone know not quite everyone but the frome valley people are rather like the frome itself secretive protective sally is her actual first name sarah caroline lake she was very young when she married him of course it wasnt exactly an arranged marriage but fairly close her father was a wealthy enough guy but nothing compared with the great lakes when she went off with al its hard to know which family was more appalled simon unsnagged a hanging twig from the chain of his cross at the divorce she took only a small settlement far smaller than someone in her position would expect today and distributed it among a number of charities considering this the only way of laundering in the oldfashioned sense conrads tainted money and when conrad died she and al were able to return shes the lady of the bines the thought made merrily absurdly happy she wrote her own story and gave it to a ghost rather lovely i always thought simon said it crossed my mind of course it did al virtually told us and now you can forget it just like the rest of us have well sure they followed the path towards the line of poplars and her flare of happiness faded but going back to als destiny think about it simon said i have the gypsies genuinely believed lake took rebekah because his own wife had gone off with a romany some of them still believe it simon said sombrely and after all it may be true its certainly why als father never spoke to him again while alive why al became an outcast a pariah cursed als profile in the glow of candles in bottles you want to know the truth of it im still paying back he seriously believes hes cursed dont underestimate the weight of that tradition merrily he seriously knows hes cursed charlie howes highceilinged whitewalled sitting room was more than half office a rolltop desk a crowded flattop desk a wooden filing cabinet a bookcase full of box files and a computer there was also a tv set with satellite box and a blackleather recliner placed in front of the screen right now charlie didnt seem in the mood for reclining he sat on the deep window sill the reverend merrily watkins he said my latest weak spot you bastard brother robinson are you two lol shook his head but you live in hope i imagine were you there last night by any chance when this shelbone child lol nodded cant beat that for bitter irony can you allan henry gets his biggest wish in all the world the bloody barnchurch burns down at a cost and what a cost whats he gonner do now will he build on the very spot where his stepdaughter died my guess lol said would be a layla riddock memorial plaque on a side wall of debenhams charlie howe laughed and pointed at him one eye closed dead right brother by god you must be very fond of mrs watkins last time anybody threatened me like that in public he but then i must watch my tongue in front of you mustnt i you really were going to try and blackmail me werent you persuade you good word often used it myself persuade me to do what just to get your daughter off merrilys back shes trying really hard to make sense out of an impossible job and your daughters going to turn her into a demon or a martyr and the church of england doesnt like either so we all know what that means this is the kiln murder yes and thats what put you on to lake he scratched his head fact is i hadnt even realized this was the same bloody kiln well im going to be dead honest with you must you robinson half a lifetime in the police force and a good few years mixing daytoday with councillors i ent comfortable with honesty well lol shrugged the truth is i havent a hope in hell of proving the police had good reason to suspect lake of killing rebekah smith and then pulled back because lake was who he was ive got even less chance of proving that somebody in the police confiscated whatever the smith boys nicked the night of stewarts murder all i know is that mumford made the arrest and mumford and you were always close despite the disparity in rank absolutely correct my friend salt of the earth andy solid as a bloody rock and he presumably holds you in similar esteem and he wouldnt like to see your reputation impugned by something that happened forty years ago when you were a youngster and perhaps had to choose between turning a blind eye to something and seeing a promising career go down the tubes and anyway hes coming up to retirement so he doesnt have much to lose see i cant prove anything but i can think of one or two papers even tv programmes charlie came down from the window sill were not in a cafe now brother i could knock your bloody head off sure i bet you know all the ways of working suspects over in the cells without leaving a mark but youve got to remember when i get up ill be back on the case you can take a lot of bruises and broken bones and ruptured spleens for love charlie howes expression didnt change and whats anne gonner do exactly lol told him about the proposed statement on exorcism and responsibility as outlined by frannie bliss charlie sniffed not a chance you been led up the garden path brother no chief constable certainly not this one would put his name to something that could get him in bother with the church they dont need that kind of conflict ent like you get one of these every day or even every year is it the chiefll tell anne if she wants to say that stuff she can get out there and say it herself you think she wouldnt charlie finally went over and collapsed into his recliner you want the truth i think she would the truth bloody hell you got me going now have a drink no thanks i was up all night im already running on reserve you want more truth i dont think itd do anne any more good longterm than it would for merrily a detective with a big mouth has a limited career span in the service anyway might get a job on there he pointed the toe of his shoe at the tv screen and i thought shed got over all that all right he sat up ill talk to her thanks dont think this is a victory for you brother i ent finished with you yet and im not saying shell take any notice but ill talk to her lol said any chance you could make it a priority thing ill see if shes free tonight charlie stood up went over to the phone i ent finished with you though i surely bloody ent he didnt need to look up the number dci he said into the phone aye this is her ol man if you dont know the voice he waited then he said colin how you doing boy where is she really what time would that be then aye i know that boy but where can i find her now he blew some air down his nose all right thank you boy not there gone off tying up the ends of the stock case charlie said as you might expect the ends and therell be at least one tv crew up there filming for the news shes agreed to do interviews early this afternoon on site shell use that as the opportunity wont she she might charlie conceded you going back there lol nodded might follow you charlie said shed wondered halfhopefully if by day especially on a day like this it might look innocuous even friendly shed half expected to feel on arriving here faintly stupid never before having been asked to exorcize a field so it came as a shock the deadness of it the yellowness of the grass on what was supposed to be deep loam the black alleys of poles with their crosspieces looking like some battlefield arrangement from the first world war so that you expected to encounter occasional corpses leaning against the poles tatters of uniforms and flesh hanging from grey bones but there was only al she didnt see him at first he was sitting immobile between two distant poles a white thing like a chalk megalith stay here simon said hell be in some kind of trance not that wed disturb him a romany shaman could go into trance between checkouts at tesco at their spiritualhealing sessions its pandemonium everybody talking and laughing drums violins its the way they are i just suspect call me an old reactionary that we shouldnt necessarily become involved with his current ambience stay at this end then i think so merrily looked up at the sky through an irregular network of wires how long to noon shed come out without her watch simon looked at his then took it off fiftyone minutes he laid the watch on the parched grass near the base of a pole stood there in his dog collar and his ruined jeans with his fair hair looking almost white and as dead as the grass and his hands on his hips over to you he said drukerimaskri every evil haunting and phantasm charlie howe clearly knew the tv cameraman greyhaired bloke crouching near the sign saying knights frome getting the church into shot the old jaguar pulled in next to him and charlie leaned out of the window bawling out jim lol brought the astra up behind the jag as the cameraman turned in irritation then saw who it was and grinned lowering his camera knew theyd never be able to manage without you charlie come to take over the inquiry is it charlie poked a finger out of the window now dont you go saying that to anne boy jim said he wasnt that brave and they laughed and then charlie said talking of whom you seen that girl at all lol spotted a slender woman walking through the churchyard about two hundred yards away he thought it was sally boswell with someone else a child it looked like from where he was he got out of the car as the cameraman said nobody here yet charlie only me shooting wallpaper till the reporter shows what you doing with yourself now creating the new hereford most of the time charlie told him so annes due when two oclock outside the pub thats what i was told lol ran past them towards the churchyard sally wore a faded yellow dress and a straw sunhat and it wasnt a child with her but isabel st john in her wheelchair isabel looked defiant her crimson top began just above her nipples laurence sally pulled off her hat her misty hair was pushed back over her ears and her skin was pale as moth wings she tucked the hat under an arm drew a tissue from her sleeve and blew her nose hay fever isnt it ridiculous havent suffered in years lol thought shed been crying isabel glanced back almost disparagingly at the church been trying to do our bit isnt it supportive prayer sally said though im afraid i dont particularly feel any closer to the deity in there isabel raised her eyes shouldve said out heres all right a red admiral butterfly landed on an arm of her wheelchair and stayed there as though it had been sprayed with lacquer wheres al lol said the air seemed hushed and heavy not only around the church but over the whole valley he wasnt aware of any birds singing he could see charlie howe walking towards them but couldnt hear his steps al said sally dont you know als with simon isabel said and your lady chasing the gorgeous pouting rebekah dredging her up from the slime her voice had gone harsh with distress didnt you know now today for noon theyre doing it now sally put a hand on his arm her fingers felt like lace dont interfere laurence it does have to be done im afraid al and i quarrelled over it i didnt want she half turned away he believes he has no choice he believes hes responsible for her thats all there is to it what about merrily whos she res you want to concentrate more on your music lol isabel said form a new band employ simon get him out of this crappy job the butterfly still hadnt moved isabel looked as if she wanted to swat it nobody needs this in their lives we can deal with it if we have to when were dead where are they lol said leave it sally told him whatever has to happen will happen while we get to wait on the shore isabel put on a pair of very dark sunglasses keep the bloody home fires burning the butterfly finally took off fluttered to a nearby grave lol said why do they need merrily why couldnt they have done this in the first place i cant believe simon was scared what do you know lol isabel said with venom what do you know of what hes been through over the years you think it isnt a terrible bloody burden for a priest to be psychic im sure it is but if he thinks merrily can come in and shoulder it nobody can shoulder it he has to face it on his own then why do they need merrily is it because rebekah will only come to a woman stop it sally said both of them are christians neither of them is part of the tradition if anything happens to anyone she opened her bag took out a parchmentcoloured eggshaped label and handed it to lol i found this when i came back he recognized it at once it was what you saw when you peered down the soundhole of a wellloved guitar with the sacred name boswell printed quite small sally said its the price you pay for preserving the balance what you borrow must be repaid if not in itself then in kind sometimes with interest below the name was an inner oval in which the serial number of each instrument would be stamped in this space was handprinted my love dont burn the vardo the hopframes were constructed from nowfaded creosoted poles ten to fifteen feet high and leaning inwards the crosspieces of some were fixed below the top forming two actual crosses joined merrily took this as significant and she and simon each stood under a cross close to the entrance of the alley al boswell sat at the far end seventy or eighty yards away his head was bowed dead bines hung limp from several frames with the airline bag at her feet merrily laid the lords prayer on the still already humid air when shed finished there was a strange silence in the yard that seemed close to absolute no birds was what it meant she decided there seemed to be nothing here for them to feed on the hopyard and adjacent fields were almost in a bowl of earth the landscape curving up to wooded hills only the highest ridge of the malverns visible and only one building the one with the witchshat tower should i say it came out of the kiln on the smoke of rebekahs cremation was it scattered with her ashes what came out what was at the core of this as simon had pointed out there was no agreed ritual for this situation merrily glanced up the alley towards al boswell his hands were raised now in supplication and he seemed to be chanting though she couldnt hear anything was als consciousness down there in the lower world home of the ancestors and the dead bargaining with his father the chovihano for the soul of rebekah what was he offering what did he expect to pay she felt scared for him because he came from a culture which was in essence unbending she also felt an agitation and a tension emanating like cold steam from simon st john she banished it closed her eyes and tried to concentrate on her breathing without changing its rhythm in her hands she held a slim prayer book into her mind came the image of rebekah in her sleeveless white blouse no earrings the girl wouldnt have wanted to look like a gypsy for the picture editor at tit bits poor kid poor rebekah brazen hussy of blinded by her own sexuality as if shed like to seize the whole world in her teeth eating the world and suddenly choking merrily sensed how dense and dark the fleshsmelling smoke from the kiln would have been made noxious by all the psychic bacteria that fed on the detritus of violent death remnants here too of conrad lake his greed his ultimately murderous cruelty this was about separating rebekahs soul from all of that and guiding it to the light merrily opened her eyes consulted the book and said quietly remember not lord our offences nor the offences of our forefathers and do not condemn us for our sins lord have mercy lord have mercy simon echoed from across the alley christ have mercy christ have mercy she visualized rebekah smith in the kiln doubled up the beautiful features blotched and reddened and distended by coughing and retching and wheezing heavenly father have mercy on her while the sulphur rolls burned blue and the few remaining hopcones yellowed on their loft jesus redeemer of the world have mercy on her rebekah screaming inside as the fumes took her i watched her heaving and shivering and struggling for breath merrily broke off from the litany the air felt dense and weighted she suddenly felt desperately tired and she was scared to close her eyes again in case she fell asleep on her feet oh christ simon murmured she looked across at him he was aglow with sweat he said youve brought someone with you havent you he had his eyes closed now his fists clenched youre carrying the weight of someone merrily began to pant bleeding simon said shes bleeding merrily whispered jesus redeemer of the world have mercy on her her rebekah in her white blouse her layla riddock in her black kimono have mercy on them simon cried out sweat dripped down merrilys cheeks holy spirit comforter have mercy on them holy trinity one god have mercy on them from all evil deliver her it all came out in a rush now and they were working together a unit from anger hatred and malice from all the deceits of the world the flesh and the devil good lord deliver them the cotton alb was fused to merrilys skin if she had an aura it felt like liquid like oil the air was very close there seemed to be a different atmosphere here between the poles a separate density of air between the wires the sun was like a hole in the sky lamb of god you take away the sins of the world have mercy on her simon said yes merrily said she felt that rebekah was very near but resistant to the idea of being guided towards the second death it came to her suddenly that layla had somehow been sent as an intermediary allan henry layla love excuse me but these ladies would like to know if you have much contact with the dead she prayed for guidance but she couldnt see the blue or the gold and her pectoral cross felt as heavy as an anvil the cross was the cross preventing she touched it please god what shall i do the cross felt cold she longed to give herself away as she had in church on the night of the coin in true and total submission so that her lifeenergy her living spirit might be used as a vessel of transformation for the tortured essence of rebekah smith a sacrifice she turned to simon but he seemed a long way away she closed her eyes was aware of an intense pressure in her chest as though she was about to have a heart attack she let the prayer book fall and used both hands to slip the chain and the cross up and over her head simon had both arms around the pole with the wooden cross at the top hugging it like a sailor whod roped himself to the mast in a storm his body seemed to be in spasm she was aware of a foetid fog between them she heard a cry from the end of the alley oh mother of god which had become like a tunnel now a tunnel through the middle of the day and then there was a wrenching sensation from above as though the crosspiece linking her pole with simons pole was under sudden severe stress dont look but of course she had to her body was held inert by damp dread but her eyes followed the leaden loaded creaking to the cross pole from it hanging like a lagged cistern between her and simon st john the corpse of gerard stock was turning slowly tongue protruding white and furry between the rosebud spittled lips merrily sobbed and sank slowly to her knees flaunting him failure too strong for them too strong for her stock swung from side to side like a swaddled pendulum dont really know what the fuck youre doing waste of time merrily heard you were a political appointment merrilys hands fumbled at the airline bag closed on the flask of holy water begone she sobbed in pain and fear and ultimate despair begone from this place every evil haunting and phantasm be banished every delusion and deceit of satan in the name of the living god in the name of the holy god in the name of the god of all creation how empty it sounded how hollow she was on her knees with the flask of holy water and she couldnt get the bloody top off she would have fallen forward then into her own shadow but there wasnt one it must be noon hed gone of course he had he was never there nothing dangled from the crosspiece there was only simon with his face in his hands merrily came to her feet mine simon croaked what my projection his face was greysheened projection of defeat merrily leaned against the pole nothing to say there was no fog no stock and the air in the alley was the same air that lay heavy on the whole of the frome valley she swallowed it hurt when did it ever go right when did it ever work through the overhead wires the midday sun was splashing its brash soulless light over the whole of the sky go out losing what better way nothing to look back on no foundation for thoughts of what might have been sodden with weariness she put away the flask picked up her airline bag simon didnt move merrily heard a crumbly rustling that her tired mind dispiritingly translated into brittle hopcones fragmenting on mummified bines almighty god simon said numbly gazing beyond her please dont do this ghost eyes the first sound merrily was aware of was the vibrating of the wires overhead it wasnt much if thered been a breeze it would have sounded natural if these had been electric wires it would have seemed normal it was a thin sound with an almost human frailty a keening that somehow didnt belong to summer the rustling overlaid it as if all the wires were entwined with dried bines this other sound belonged to winter it sang of mourning loss lamentation the sounds came not from their alley but the one adjacent to it and as merrily went to stand at its entrance she noticed that it seemed oriented directly on the tower of the kiln the poles bending at almost the same angle as the point of its cowl merrily stood there with sweat drying on her face edging past the fear stage to the part where she knew she was dreaming but it didnt matter she waited she would not move she fought to regulate her breathing for here was the lady of the bines approaching down the abandoned hopcorridor drifting from frame to frame and the sky was white and blinding and the lady moved like a shiver simon st john came up behind merrily what am i seeing simon he didnt reply she could hear his rapid breathing whose projection now she said surprised that she could speak at all whose projection is this she blinked several times but it was still there this slender white woman pale and naked and garlanded with shrivelled hops merrily put on her cross christ be with me christ within me the bine thick with yellowed cones was pulled up between the legs over the glistening stomach and between the breasts wound around and around the neck covering the lower face petals gummed to the sweat on the cheeks christ behind me christ before me the head was bent as though she was watching her feet wondering where they were taking her she was not weaving as lol had described his apparition but almost slithering through the parched grass and the weeds and she couldnt be real or else why was she affecting the wires when she was maybe ten yards away the head came up merrily went rigid the lady swayed her eyes were fully open but hardened like a painted dolls under a thickly smeared lacquer of abstraction they were a corpses eyes a ghosts eyes the end of the bine was stuffed into her mouth brittle cones crushed between her teeth and those petals pasted to her cheeks grotesque like one of the foliate faces you found on church walls she put out her arms not to merrily but to simon but he stepped away stay back for christs sake dont touch her keep a space the womans hands clawed at the air as though there was something between them that she could seize her breath was irregular and came in convulsions her body arching parched petals dropping from her lips like flakes of dead skin dont go within a foot of her simon rasped its all right merrily said softly and she reached for the clawing hands and waited for the cold electricity to come coursing up her arms all the way to her heart love first noon the dead moment in time all the energy of the day sucked in sometimes for a fraction of an instant you can almost see it like a photograph turned negative everything still everything the road the fields the sky belonging to the dead but these people clustered in the base of the bowl under the midday sun they were not the dead the severely beautiful elderly woman weeping and the sharpfaced whitehaired man with an arm around her and the plump woman in a wheelchair and the leatherfaced crewcut man demanding an ambulance surely somebody had a bloody mobile phone and lol standing apart from the others looking thoughtful and the pale naked woman under the hopframe lying with the padded airline bag under her head not even she was dead keep her here would that contain it for how long how long merrily looked up at the sun simon st john understood get back please just a couple of yards please simon was ok he was in the clear the woman was not dead had not been dead when she walked under the wires simon was all right with this wasnt he yes the woman agreed irritably just keep back im all right ill be all right she coughed her head thrown back over the airline bag a bubble of saliva and a halfmasticated hoppetal in a corner of her slack mouth ill be with you in just give me give me a moment give me a bloody minute merrily looked up at simon he nodded towards the woman the hopbine was still curled around her legs yellowed petals crumbled into her pubic hair simon said you know her oh yes merrily knelt down was immediately enclosed in a dense aura of sweat and hops annie listen to me were you in the kiln were you in the kiln just now cordon it off the eyes were still blurred we need the fire service theres probably yes merrily said gases an escape of gases or sulphur i dont i got out of there but i must have lost put somebody on the door dont let anybody go back in there it may be i think i lost consciousness just for a moment you she seemed to register merrily for the first time what the hell are you im going back to the village charlie said we need an ambulance dont be ridiculous annie howe tried to sit up thats whos he simon demanded the woman in the wheelchair had made it from the path breathing hard from her struggle across the baked ground simon was holding her hand her father merrily told him charlie shes right forget the ambulance but she met his eyes his coppers eyes now hard as nuts theres something else we need to do and we need to do it now im not kidding charlie weve got a problem here you must be able to see that and possibly a solution simon st john said dad annie howe struggling to sit up what the hell are you stay where you are girl charlie said softly everythings all right he looked down at merrily she been attacked not in the way you think no in the way i think do you know what im saying i dont know merrily her clothes lol was there i think its pretty obvious she took them off herself charlie the things we saw strewn across ill fetch them sally boswell said merrily came to her feet charlie i swear to god i swear to you that this is not some scam she was in the kiln just now on her own the wrong place at the wrong time charlie it all comes down to that place i was simply annie shook her ashblonde head in irritation taking a final look round before we handed the keys back to she looked vague for a moment before we handed over the keys to sstocks solicitors is there some water if i can just have some water merrily said charlie i dont have time to explain you have got toplease trust me look annie howe said wheres the fucking car she finally sat up get these people stay where you are anne charlies jaw was working from side to side youre naked girl what are you annie howe rose up suddenly and charlie howe stepped to one side so that annie was in the full sun there was a moment of silence and then she started to scream her head tossed back eyes squeezed shut against the blast of light her spine arched in a spasm her white breasts thrust towards the sun her mouth opening into a big hungry smile as if in the instant that the screaming turned to laughter merrily was down by annies side both hands on her burning forehead the eyes opened once a flaring of panic and outrage under the sweatsoaked whiteblonde hair it wasnt all sweat though the top must finally have come off the flask inside because the airline bag where annies head had lain was soaked now with holy water rebekah merrily said calmly somewhere deep inside herself listen to me for an instant hugging the lady of the bines in all her persons absorbing their coarse racking sobs she found the core or maybe the core found her the coin spun in the air and stayed in the air caught in a confluence of sunbeams and kept on spinning bright new copper she could do this st paul said put love first that simple bypassing fear and revulsion the heaving aside of a great concrete slab of personal resentment ignoring even the stunning irony behind her simon st john stood quietly made the sign of the cross in the air above them love is patient love is kind and envies no one love is never boastful nor conceited love keeps no score of wrongs there is no limit to its faith its hope and its endurance merrily felt her hands becoming very warm warmer than the skin beneath she was in a void an emptiness that was infinitely vast and yet also movingly intimate she didnt understand she didnt have to understand at some point the words came automatically from the final verse of the old celtic anthemic prayer let them not run from the love that you offer but hold them safe from the forces of evil on each of their dyings shed your light one love lightly two prof levin said over the phone let me get this right youre showing me two songs tomorrow the legendary producer was returning home for a few days tom storeys slow disembowelling of the blues he said was making everyone close to clinically depressed they needed a break this was costly sure but if storey had any real need to worry about expense hed be recording at knights frome lol sat on one of the packing cases in the kitchen it was almost dark the sky was lime green in the north and there were great banks of cloud a storm was coming on and it was very humid i suppose if i was being honest he admitted because this was a night for complete honesty id have to say the last verse of the first one needs rewriting and i might have to dump the second one altogether on account of it maybe it wasnt my place to write it not really there was a long silence prof said so basically just half a song correct hopefully im really sorry prof and he was he should feel ashamed he had a lot of work to do its that bloody boswell guitar prof said i knew it would be cursed oh no lol said quickly no curse i dont think so probably no curse after all no need surely for the burning of the boswell vardo to become any kind of issue although al had told lol that maybe tomorrow maybe the day after he would not be oversurprised to wake up in the lower world with a whole lot of explaining to do he insisted he was taking nothing for granted he would be grateful for each fresh day with sally and the ponies and stanley the donkey he was grateful too obviously to the drukerimaskri if hed had to borrow a place in which to be found dead he hadnt particularly wanted to borrow it from adam lake so lol wondered had he actually encountered rebekah as he sat in the hopyard under the midday sun had he in fact journeyed to the lower world these were not questions that a gaujo had any right to ask al had said sternly but well if the little priest had managed to retrieve the romany soul of poor rebekah he would not deny having performed a little essential groundwork al smiled gypsies lied ive been thinking about you lol hed said finally leaning on the fence around his paddock watching stanley browse the buttercups you and this thing about the frome this rootlessness this having no home as you may have gathered we romanies prefer to see this as a benefit no estates no cities no cathedrals but im a gaujo lol pointed out in which case al kept on smiling consider it the first stage in your personal development walking away in the sunset lol had observed sally coming down from the museum to meet al she wore a long white dress embroidered around the bosom wide and flouncy at the hem and at least forty years out of fashion prof said the other thing and i want the truth here laurence no placatory bullshit has that insane bastard been near the place who who stock of course the impossible creep who claims hes being haunted out of his home if you recall around the time i was suggesting you should be thinking about producing at least four fresh songs i also gave express instructions that stock should not be admitted to the premises while i was gone yes lol sighed you dont read the papers much do you prof when youre working i dont read the papers at all i dont read the mail i dont read menus either because when im working with my stomach the way it is these days i dont even eat no i dont read the sodding papers evidently not lol agreed he moved through the silent studio where the boswell guitar in all her quiet beauty sat on the stand where the preliminary and possibly final tape of the cure of souls still occupied the deck after a lot of noise it was very quiet now a thousand questions still echoing just a few answers gomer parry had brought jane and eirion across to profs and eirions dads secretary had arrived in the bmw shed come up to hereford by train with a spare set of keys to pick up the car from the police station where it had been accommodated overnight and to collect eirion jane had considered her options for a while before getting in the car with them cant let the poor dab face this alone this was after the police had been and gone frannie bliss with ds mumford dci howe had left it was presumed with her father shell deny any of it happened merrily had said to lol afterwards as they waved the kids away to pembrokshire especially to herself shell have had someone tell the press she was called away on another case and shell never talk about it not even to her dad and shell hate me worse than ever but thats the price you pay lol said what would have happened to her if you hadnt merrily had just shrugged and lol had conjured then dismissed nebulous images of a hungry promiscuous annie howe darkening into corruption like her old man you think merrily had asked him i dont really know he went out of his way to tell you about allan henry and the corruption he wasnt involved in i just dont know he told me you were going to blackmail him merrily said to keep annie off my back you see he told you that it doesnt fit with him having something to hide does it i bet he does though oh yeah merrily said no doubt at all would you have blackmailed him i never even thought of it that way ive never done anything like that before hed blushed maybe i dont deserve it merrily said i dont deserve any of you sophie jane dont ever tell her i said that i just flounder about from one irrational scenario to another making a balls of things coming to false conclusions appealing to god apologizing to god being terrified of coming one day to reject god i mean before all this began i was supposed to recruit a backup team i dont know where to start simon forget simon lol said like you dont have enough problems he came through today though you dont know what hes like tonight i do have a situation he could help with if hed be willing to talk to someone with the same kind of sensitivity problem amy shelbone either she represses it and it goes on causing trouble or she gets advice from the wrong kind of people and becomes something monstrous she wont get sent to a detention centre but she might get put into the psychiatric system and whos that going to help not amy and certainly not any other patients she comes into contact with psychiatric medicine doesnt allow for people like that lol said no use talking to simon though hell only say hed screw her up even more how about i talk to isabel and she talks to simon would he talk to the shelbones too do you think as a psychic and a clergyman but not in those jeans lol had said merrily had yawned and asked if it was ok to go up to her cell in profs cottage and lie down for a while there was no need to show her to the room she knew the way and anyway prof had rung then it was evening now with a premature darkening of the sky probably the coming of the longforecast storm lol sat down in the booth with the boswell fingered the opening chords of the river frome song he needed to sleep didnt think hed be able to he thought about the boswell romany philosophy live lightly and love lightly he couldnt love lightly didnt think al boswell could either he found himself wondering not for the first time what would have happened if al and sally hadnt found them in the hopyard last night decided he wasnt going to think about that ever again or about gerard stock hanging in his cell why did he have to kill himself merrily had said so many things nobody will ever know everyone said he wasnt the suicide type circumstances can change the kind of person you are lol said wolverhampton experience i hed hesitated suppose he had a prison visitor merrily had said huw owen uses the term visitor to describe the appearance of a relative or close friend a comfort thing usually maybe i mean burglar maybe thats not logical where would it find female energy in the remand centre if theres one thing ive learned in the past year merrily said its that human logic doesnt often come into it but there might be absolutely no paranormal context to stocks death i mean i might have to operate on the basis that the unseen permeates everything but society functions well enough if a little colourlessly without it lol padded up the steps along the minstrels gallery and into his loft as the first thunder sounded from the west he took off his round brassrimmed glasses and popped them into their case on the plywood onion box serving as his bedside table a vivid mauve light filled the skylight above him it was open a little and the loft was filled with the rich caramel smell of ripened hay from the meadow lol felt inexplicably upset well perhaps not that inexplicably he let himself fall back on to the camp bed but it wasnt there he came down on hay he looked up at the blurred purple square of the skylight huh was he so overtired hed climbed up to the wrong loft he reached for his glasses on the onion box a hand closed around his wrist with so little sleep in two days theyd both been beyond exhaustion but this had somehow made it both more intense and more nebulous maybe the fatigue was responsible also for that sense of beenherebefore if only in dreams and lol had been afraid to sleep in case this should turn out to be another one it was the storm that awoke him creamy lightning in the skylight and he jumped up to close it against the inevitable rain climbing on the camp bed which shed folded up before spreading the hay and straw and the duvet on top of it she said shed dreamed of stock the carcass turning slowly from side to side you see what you get sleeping with me merrily said they made love again under the thunder and then she lay on her back and the rain began to hit the skylight in long slow drops as if each one had been calculated two strung up midmorning merrily went back to the vicarage and then she planned to go and visit the shelbones or try to lol wanted to go with her and then thought no love lightly dont seek to possess he went into the studio to think about creating a new song before prof arrived back any new song he knew it wasnt going to be a problem the sky was washed clean the boswell guitar felt like a living thing it was around eleventhirty when di frannie bliss phoned from leominster hope you dont think i lied to yer about that press statement lol but its not happened has it and now the lovely snow maidens gone on a few days leave which was unexpected its god frannie god looks after key personnel you didnt talk to anybody yourself then never really got chance in the end ah well pause merrily wouldnt be there would she gone to work i mean shes at work presumably only with the boss skiving off the pm report on stocks arrived on my desk with no little controversy we were talking about stock earlier a lot of people are talking about stock again this morning its what he wouldve wanted we were still trying to think why he did it hanged himself its a mystery frannie bliss said and not the only one can i give merrily a message bliss thought about it sighed bugger it he said this is tormenting me a bit stock strung himself up with his shirt right thats what we heard the pm report says the severe ligature marks found on his neck are what you might call inconsistent with that according to the home office pathologist and the forensics lab we should be looking for a length of rusty wire maybe seven or eight millimetres thick probably multistranded there was no sign of any such wire in stocks cell we can be fairly sure he did not bring any in with him and it was certainly not around his neck when he was cut down needless to say the remand centre is being searched no doubt even as we speak strange it is isnt it there was also an impression on the side of his neck strongly suggestive of a hook being attached to the wire one of my lads who was a farmers boy had an idea what this might be lol said youre talking about hopwire arent you
