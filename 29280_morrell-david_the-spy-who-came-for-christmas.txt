david morrell the spy who came for christmas a flower bloomed in the middle of a cold winters night a rose that mary gave us a small child who dispels the darkness relieves our sorrows and saves us from sin and death paraphrase of a fifteenthcentury german hymn the christmas rose in the middle ages councils debating confidential matters hung a rose from the ceiling and swore not to reveal what they discussed sub rosa under the rose this association of a rose with secrecy dates back to a greek myth in which the god of love gave a rose to the god of silence bribing him to stay quiet about the sins of the other gods to this day the rose remains an emblem of the spy profession from the cambridge encyclopedia of espionage part one the city of holy faith carolers sang it came upon a midnight clear but it wasnt yet midnight and it wasnt clear snow whispered down a cold powder that reflected colorful lights hanging on adobe buildings beyond an intersection ahead even the traffic lights appeared festive what a perfect christmas eve a woman marveled proceeding with the crowd on alameda street the spanish word alameda referred to the poplars that had rimmed the street years earlier when it had been only a lane although cottonwoods had long since replaced those poplars the street remained narrow the sidewalk barely accommodating the crush of people coming from mass at st francis cathedral or from the ice sculptures in santa fes fourhundredyearold wooded square known as the plaza you think the lights in the plaza are something the womans companion told her waitll you see canyon road a mile of decorations youll be glad you came to visit for the holidays people travel from all over the world to see santa fe at christmas you know what it means dont you santa fe at the hotel i heard somebody call it the city different thats just its nickname santa fe was settled by the spanish the name means holy faith its perfect for this time of year peace on earth goodwill to men moving with the crowd the man in the black ski jacket didnt care about peace or goodwill he was fortyfive but the effects of his hard life had made him look older he had big shoulders and creased features and he saw with the tunnel vision of a hunter so that objects on each side of him registered only as blurs for him sounds diminished as well the carolers the cathedral bells the exclamations of delight at the holiday displaysall of these lessened as he focused solely on his quarry there were only fifteen people between them the target wore a navy parka but despite the falling snow he had the hood shoved back allowing a cold layer of white to accumulate on his head the pursuer understood a man on the run couldnt allow the sides of a hood to obstruct his view of what lay on each side desperate to find an escape route the fugitive saw differently than a hunter not with tunnel vision but with an intense awareness of everything around him the killer kept his hands in the pockets of his ski jacket inside the pockets were slits that made it easy for him to reach the two pistols he had holstered on his belt under his jacket each weapon had a sound suppressor one was a millimeter glock chosen because of its power and because the rifling in glock barrels blurred the striations on bullets fired from them as a consequence crimescene investigators found it almost impossible to link those bullets to any particular gun but if everything went as planned the force of the glock wouldnt be necessary instead the second pistola berettawould be chosen for its subtlety even without a suppressor the smallcaliber gun made little noise but with a suppressor and with subsonic ammunition designed for santa fes feet of altitude the was about as quiet as a pistol could be equally important its lesser power meant that the bullet it fired wasnt likely to jeopardize the mission by going through the target and hitting the precious object hidden under his parka to hear the angels sing at the intersection the traffic light changed to red as the snow kept falling the crowd stopped and formed a dense barrier that prevented the hunter from moving closer to his target suddenly a mans voice blurted from an earbud concealed beneath the black watchmans cap that the hunter wore over his ears melchior status the angry voice demanded the hunters name was andrei his employer a former kgb interrogator had given him the pseudonym melchior to sanitize the teams radio communications in case an enemy accessed their frequency the seemingly nonsensical choice had puzzled andrei until hed learned that according to tradition melchior was one of the wise men whod followed the christmas star to bethlehem and discovered the baby jesus a microphone was concealed under the skilift tickets attached to the zipper on andreis coat tickets that were commonplace in this mountain resort to avoid attracting attention when he replied he pulled his cell phone from a pants pocket and pretended to talk into it his breath was white with frost although his origins were russian his american accent was convincing he pressed the microphone to transmit his message hey uncle harry i just walked up alameda street im on the corner of paseo de peralta the spanish name meant walkway of peralta and referred to santa fes founder a governor of new mexico in the early s canyon roads across the street ill pick up the package and be at your place in twenty minutes do you know where the package is the gruff voice made no attempt to conceal its russian accent or its impatience right in front of me andrei pretended to say into his cell phone the christmas decorations are amazing our clients will be here any second get it back as soon as my friends catch up to me balthazar caspar status the voice demanded the unusual pseudonyms were the names that tradition had given to the remaining wise men in the christmas story almost there another accented voice said through andreis earbud breathing quickly when you grab the package well block anybody who gets in the way good tomorrow well watch football andrei said into the microphone see you in a bit uncle harry he wore thin leather shooters gloves that provided only brief protection from the cold as the traffic light changed to green he returned the phone to his pants pocket then shoved his hands back into his fleecedlined jacket warming his fingers the crowd proceeded across the street continuing to shield the target who was about six feet tall slender but with surprising strength as andrei knew firsthand from missions theyd served on together and from what had occurred fifteen minutes earlier dark hair of medium length rugged yet pleasant features that witnesses otherwise found hard to describe in his early thirties andrei now realized that these details were the extent of what he knew about the man the thought intensified his anger until tonight hed believed that he and his quarry were on the same sideand more that they were friends youre the only person i trusted pyotyr how many other lies did you tell i vouched for you i told the pakhan that he could depend on you if i dont get back what you stole hell have me killed the man reached the opposite side of the street and turned to the right passing starshaped lights strung along the windows of an art gallery andrei shifted a little closeronly thirteen people away nowavoiding sudden movements doing nothing that would disrupt the flow of the crowd and cause his prey to look back although the mans gait remained steady andrei knew that his left arm was wounded it hung at his side shadows and trampling footsteps concealed the blood he left on the snow youll soon weaken andrei thought surprised that he hadnt already red and blue lights flashed ahead making andrei tense despite the holiday surroundings it was impossible to mistake those lights for christmas displays reflected by the falling snow they were mounted on the roofs of two police cars that blocked the entrance to canyon road large red letters on the cars white doors announced santa fe police andreis shoulders tightened are they searching for us have they found the bodies two burly policemen in bulky coats stood before the cruisers stamping their boots in the snow trying to keep warm stiff from the cold they awkwardly raised their left arms and motioned toward oncoming headlights warning cars and pickup trucks to keep going and not enter canyon road ahead in the crowd a woman pointed with concern why would the police be here something must have happened maybe wed better stay away nothings wrong her companion assured her the police form a barricade every year christmas eve cars cant driven canyon road only pedestrians are allowed there tonight andrei watched pyotyr walk around the cruisers and enter the celebration on canyon road taking care to avoid eye contact with the policemen they paid him no attention looking bored yes theyre only managing traffic andrei decided thatll soon change but by then ill have what i need and be out of here he wondered why pyotyr hadnt run to the police for help but after a moments thought he understood the bastard knows we wont allow anything to stop us from taking back what he stole with their weapons holstered those two cops wouldnt have a chance if we rushed them staring ahead he noticed how the increasing narrowness of canyon road made the crowd even denser santa fe was a small city of about people before beginning his assignment andrei had reconnoitered the compact downtown area and knew that canyon road had few side streets it reminded him of a funnel things will happen swiftly now he thought ill get you my friend whoever you are andreis vision narrowed even more focusing almost exclusively on the back of pyotyrs head where he intended to put his bullet pretending to marvel at the christmas decorations he passed the flashing lights of the police cars and entered the kill zone the man who called himself pyotyr saw with intense clarity all of his senses operating at their fullest taking in everything around him canyon road was lined with mostly singlestory buildings many of which boasted pueblorevival architecture their flat roofs rounded edges and earthcolored stucco so distinctive that visitors marveled the majority of the buildingssome of them dating back to the eighteenth centuryhad been converted into art galleries hundreds of them making this street one of the most popular art scenes in the united states tonight their outlines were emphasized by countless flickering candleswhat the locals called farolitos that were set in sand poured into paper bags and placed next to walkways some of the candles had been knocked over accidentally the paper bags burning but most remained intact their shimmer not yet affected by the settling snow bonfires lit each side of the road their occasional loud crackles causing him to flinch as if from gunshots the wood they burned had been cut from pine trees known as pinons and the fragrant smoke reminded him of incense your minds drifting he warned himself trying to ignore the pain in his arm forget the damned smoke pay attention find a way out of here his real name was paul kagan but over the years in other places he had used many other names tonight hed decided to become himself the left pocket of his parka was torn open the result of someone grabbing for him when hed escaped he recalled the shock hed felt when hed reached for his cell phone and discovered that it had fallen out something had seemed to fall inside him as well without a way to contact his controller he was powerless to summon help kagan wore a fleshcolored earbud so small that it was almost impossible to notice in the shadows a miniature microphone was hidden on his parka but all communication had stopped fifteen minutes earlier he took for granted that his hunters had switched to a new frequency to prevent him from eavesdropping while they searched for him doing his best to blend with the crowd he strained to be aware of everything around him the carolers the twinkling lights on the galleries and the trees the art dealers offering steaming cocoa to passersby he searched for an escape route but knew that if the men chasing him managed to follow him to a quiet area he wouldnt have a chance nor would the object he held under his parka he felt it squirm fearful that it might be smothered he pulled the zipper down far enough to provide air it might be making sounds but the carols and conversations around him prevented him from knowing for sure those same distractions prevented the crowd from hearing what he hid under his coat we three kings of orient are yeah they came from the east all right kagan thought in his weakened condition the incenselike smell of the bonfires reminded him of the gifts the three magi had brought to the baby jesus frankincense for a priest gold for a king and myrrh an embalming perfume for one who is to die but not whats under my parka kagan thought by god ill do anything to make sure it doesnt die paul we have a new assignment for you hows your russian its good sir my parents were afraid to speak it even in secret but after the soviet union collapsed all of a sudden it was the only language they spoke around the house the urge to use it had built up during the years they were in hiding i needed to learn russian so i could understand what they said your file says they defected to the united states in thats right they were part of the soviet gymnastics team sent to the summer olympics in montreal they managed to slip away from their handlers reached the american consulate and requested political asylum interesting that they chose the us instead of canada i think they worried that canadas winters would be as cold as those in their former home in leningrad i was hoping youd tell me they admired the american way of life they did sir especially florida where they went to live and never felt cold again florida i had an assignment there one christmas all that sun and sand the mood didnt work they never felt cold i assume you mean except for the cold war yes sir the soviets never stopped searching for defectors especially ones whod made international headlines despite the new identities the state department gave them my parents were always afraid theyd be tracked down their original names were irina and vladimir kozlov correct changed to kagan yes sir gymnastics was their passion but they soon realized they could never compete again the risk of discovery was too great they didnt even dare go into a gymnasium and practice their moves they knew they wouldnt be able to resist doing their best and if people saw how amazing they were word would have spread perhaps to the wrong people my parents were too terrified to take the chance suppressing their talents broke their spirit that was the price of their freedom they could have won gold medals almost certainly but they defected because of me relationships between male and female gymnasts were strictly forbidden but somehow they managed to find time to sneak away and be by themselves perhaps if the opportunity hadnt seemed so rare they might not have well in any case when my mother realized she was pregnant she knew that the soviets would insist she have an abortion to keep her in competition she was determined not to let that happen only teenagersthey grew up fast they were so paranoid about kgb agents grabbing us in the middle of the night that they raised me to be suspicious of everyone to study everything wherever i went and to watch for anybody who seemed out of place as i grew up i thought it was a normal way to live always keeping secrets so it was natural for you to become a spy coles been throwing up the man said into the telephone taking care not to make his words sound forced some kind of stomach bug im afraid we cant come to the party yes im sorry too its an awful way to spend christmas eveill tell him thanks he pressed the dialtone button then picked up a hammer from the counter and smashed the phone into piecesjust as hed done with the phone in his office and the one in the master bedroom chunks of plastic flew across the kitchen there the man said unsteadily he dropped the hammer opened a womans purse that was lying on the counter and took out a cell phone shoving it into his coat pocket that takes care of everything he crossed the kitchen and yanked open the side door the motion so violent that it sucked snow into the house while the flakes settled over the woman lying on the floor he raged outside and slammed the door behind him pressed against a kitchen cupboard the boy was so stunned that for a moment he couldnt speak finally he found his voice mom tears burned his eyes are you okay he moved toward her although the heel on his right shoe was higher than the one on the left it didnt fully compensate for his short right leg giving him a slight limp he knelt and touched her arm feeling dampness where the snow that had blown in was already melting on her im his mother took a deep breath and found the strength to raise herself to a sitting position im going to be all right her right hand touched the side of her cheek causing her to wince get me some ice cubes would you sweetheart put them in a dishcloth moving quickly despite his limp the boy grabbed a dish towel from the counter and went to the sidebyside he tugged the freezer door open reaching in the ice cubes chilled his fingers while his mother groaned making the effort to stand he wrapped the ice cubes in the towel and hurried back to her youre always a help she murmured i dont know what id do without you she put the ice pack against her cheek blood from her lips smeared the cloth music played in the background a jolly man singing here comes santa claus in the living room logs crackled in the fireplace lights glowed on the christmas tree colorfully wrapped presents lay under it they only made the boy feel worse should i call the hospital he asked the phones are broken i can go down the street and try to find a pay phone or ask a neighbor dont i want you to stay close but your cheek the ice is helping the boy frowned toward the nearly empty whiskey bottle on the counter he promised yes the woman said he promised she took another deep breath well she stood straighter mustering determination we cant let him ruin our christmas eve ill she searched for an idea but the look on her face told the boy she had trouble concentrating ill make us some hot cocoa mom you ought to sit down im fine all i need are some aspirins let me make the cocoa still holding the ice pack to her cheek she studied him yes i dont know what id do without you when she smiled the effort hurt her injured cheek and she winced again she peered down my dress its green had blood on it id better put on something else cant spend christmas eve looking like this the boy watched as she wavered into the living room along the hallway and into the bedroom on the left the music changed to frosty the snowman cole limped into the living room and stared at the christmas tree he turned to the right toward the big picture window and peered out toward the falling snow behind his eyeglasses tears blurred what he saw nonetheless he was able to distinguish the footprints in the snow where his father had crossed the front yard and opened the gate the lane beyond the fence was deserted the cheerless lights from the christmas tree in the living room reflected off the inside of the window he promised the boy thought he promised andrei moved closer through the crowd only ten people away now the snowfall persisted dimming the candles that burned in the paper bags along the street deepening the shadows providing cover almost perfect he thought music drifted from an art gallery carolers singing oh little town of bethlehem again andrei heard the accented voice coming from the earbud under his watchmans cap the pakhans angry tone was loud enough to hurt andreis eardrums we need to assume pyotyrs a mole pyotyr andrei thought bitterly of course given what had happened that surely wasnt the targets real name it was a measure of the pakhans anger that hed stopped speaking in euphemisms the son of a bliatz probably belongs to law enforcement or american intelligence but after everything we made him do to prove himself i dont understand why he waited until now to make his move why this assignment maybe there were other times andrei thought he recalled the failed missions and suddenly wondered if pyotyr had been responsible for them the voice raged at least you found his cell phone if help hasnt reached him by now he probably doesnt have a way to send for it yes youre on your own my friend andrei thought ten more steps and ive got you this is your fault the pakhans voice roared make it right andrei thought back to when pyotyr had arrived in brighton beach ten months earlier able to speak only russian the newcomer had kept to himself earning money no one knew how always distrustful of outsiders andrei had followed him one night and watched as pyotyr had used a pistol to rob a liquor store in the bronx beating a customer who resisted the next night andrei had seen him mug two drunks outside a bar in queens the night after that hed watched pyotyr hold up an allnight convenience store in brooklyn and pistolwhip a clerk so hard that blood spattered the window reporting this information to his pakhan andrei had been ordered to warn the newcomer that he couldnt do any job without permission and that the pakhan wanted a percentage pyotyr had been furious demanding to meet this allpowerful man who told everyone what to do i worked away from the neighborhood its none of his business it will be if the police follow you here i dont make mistakes nice to meet someone whos perfect listen to me i got along all my life on my own i dont take orders from anybody in that case the pakhan told me to kill you andrei said matteroffactly you can try very amusing i mean it try i wont let that yebanat give me orders thats what i said when i first came to brighton beach but i didnt have identity papers and you dont either if i wanted to stay in the united states i needed the pakhan to help me and that meant i needed to go along with whatever the pakhan told me to do there are other russian communities where i can hide and where other pakhans enforce the same rules youre willing to stand up to me thats rare so ill give you some valuable adviceits easier to do what he says than to force me to kill you save me the trouble take the jobs he hands out youll earn more than you do holding up liquor stores even after i pay him his cut once he takes his cut and shows whos boss hes generous enough to buy loyalty why else do you think i work for him i dont like him any more than you do the pakhan had tested pyotyr on small jobs and found his ferocity to be so impressive that hed begun pairing andrei and pyotyr on major assignments for the past six months the two had spent long hours in vehicles and alleys had shared motel rooms and had eaten more breakfasts together than andrei had ever eaten with his wife there was something about pyotyr that impressed andrei perhaps because the younger mans determination and stubbornness reminded him of what he had been like at an earlier time in colombia if not for you pyotyr that drug lord would have killed me what the hell happened tonight nobody turns against us viktors dead because of you the assignments at risk because of you damn it i invited you into my home i introduced you to my family i trusted you when i never trusted anyone be careful andrei warned himself dont make this personal thats how mistakes get made ill punish him yes ill punish him but right now hes just a target remember that or he wont be the only one whos punished pyotyr doesnt matter whats under his coat thats what matters a teenager nestled a paper bag into a sling attached to a large balloon a candle glowed inside the bag as the balloon was released and floated upward despite the snowfall carolers sang oh star of wonder suddenly a heavy man wearing a santa claus hat bumped against kagans left arm the intense pain that shot through his wound almost made him groan for an instant he feared he was being attacked but the clumsy man whod knocked against him plodded on through the crowd still it wouldnt be long before a real attacker reached him kagan knew he sensed his hunters drawing closer tightening the trap with a determined effort not to look frantic he scanned the people in front of him and the gaily lit galleries on each side his senses stretching wider he shivered from the snow on his unprotected head and wished he could pull up the hood on his parka but he didnt dare restrict his vision cant risk missing a possible escape route he thought need to find cover a lane appeared on the left leading to a cluster of galleries their christmas lights haloed by the falling snow kagan kept moving forward a street opened on the right narrow like canyon road almost as crowded flanked by bonfires feeling the cold spread beneath the partially open zipper of his parka he almost headed to the right the object under his coat squirmed no kagan decided thats not the street i want we wont be safe there we need to find another way we the weight of the word struck him guide us to thy perfect light wincing from the pain in his arm he sheltered the baby under his parka and carried him through the snowfall paul your file says your parents became martial artists a substitute for gymnastics eventually they earned black belts in karate given their fear of the soviets it was a good skill to develop of course they never competed again there was too much danger of publicity meanwhile the state department bought them a small house where they wanted to live in miami yes sir they moved there after taking an intensive englishlanguage course even years later they never quite got rid of their russian accents as a consequence they seldom spoke to outsiders if anyone asked where they came from they used the cover story the state department had invented for them and claimed they were the children of russian immigrants i cant imagine how foreign everything must have seemed to them how confusing and terrifying all because my mother wouldnt let the soviets abort me think of itthey were only eighteen obviously they couldnt afford to own the house we lived in so they claimed they were renting it if anyone asked why theyd married so young they told a version of the truth and said that my mother had gotten pregnant before they were married that theyd been forced to get married of course theyd really wanted to get married but putting it that way was embarrassing enough to make people stop asking personal questions my parents had no skills apart from gymnastics so the state department did the best it could and got my father a job at a landscaping company when i was a baby my mother stayed home with me during the day at night my father watched me while my mother cleaned offices the american dream paul your file says that they took you with them to the martialarts classes you earned a black belt by the time you were fifteen thats correct like my parents i didnt compete i didnt want the attention a good instinct for a spy how were you recruited the state department maintained contact with my parents to make sure there werent any problems evidently its intelligence arm saw potential in me because i was good at sticking to the cover story and playing the role id been given why didnt your parents tell you the same lies they told everyone else youd never have known their real background you wouldnt have been forced to play a role they said they needed an extra set of eyes and ears to guard against threats but i think they had another reason i think they needed someone with whom they could share their secrets it was a lonely life for them my last year of high school an intelligence officer came to our house and offered to pay all my expenses if i agreed to be educated at the rocky mountain industrial academy outside fort collins colorado that was a big deal my parents couldnt afford to send me to college i was promised a job after i graduated was the recruiter forthright that this was an espionage school and that he was asking you to become an intelligence operative he couldnt have been more direct his approach was that i could help stop the sort of repression that had caused my parents to live in terror even after they came to the united states an excellent pitch im impressed he was a firstrate recruiter he understood how much i felt indebted to my parents after all theyd risked everything for me it was a house of fear i grew up hating the soviets and any other group that made people feel as afraid as we did the recruiter was right to approach me from that angle he asked me if i wanted to get even he asked me if id like to make a better world so you went to the rocky mountain industrial academy i taught there twenty years ago that brings back a lot of memories he promised i wouldnt be bored the boy stood at the living room window watching the snow fall behind him the music changed to jingle bells but the normally cheerful song only reinforced how empty he felt as he took off his glasses and wiped his eyes he heard footsteps behind him his mother leaving the master bedroom and coming along the hallway to the living room when he turned he saw that her right hand continued to press the ice pack against her cheek she wore a red dress now its cloth was shiny and smoothlooking the bottom part was long and spread out its red emphasized her blond hair and made him think of an angel ornament that hung on the christmas tree it looks very nice he said youre always a gentleman limping he followed her into the kitchen for the cocoa they heated rice milk instead of cows milk because he couldnt digest the latter there was just enough to fill two mugs his mother put marshmallows on the steaming liquid see we can still have a party i wont let him hurt you again cole vowed dont worryhe wont she squeezed his hand i wont allow him a second chance to do it well pack tonight and leave she gave him a searching look are you okay with that with leaving your father i never want to see him again not the best christmas huh who cares about christmas im sorry she peered down at the table and didnt speak for several seconds he has the car keys well need to walk i can do it we could leave right now but with canyon road blocked and so many people crowding the street we wont be able to get a taxi she looked at the smashed phone on the counter and we cant call for one either canyon road isnt open to traffic until after ten thats when well set out well find a pay phone somewhere but even then if the snow keeps falling a lot of other people will want taxis we might need to wait a long time and since its christmas eve the hotels will be full i dont know where well stay she tried not to look at his short right leg cole are you sure you can manage a long walk i wont slow us down i promise i know you wont youre the strongest son a mother could ever want it all makes sense now andrei thought advancing through the crowd only eight people away from his target the disguised containers of sovietera rocket launchers that customs officials managed to discover being smuggled through the newark docks the middle eastern visitors who were intercepted by the coast guard before they could be brought ashore one moonless night on long island most assignments had gone as planned there hadnt been any pattern to the failures and pyotyr had been so fierce on every job doing whatever he was toldno matter how brutalthat no one had suspected him certainly i didnt andrei thought although his wafflesoled boots were insulated he felt cold seeping into them but the discomfort was nothing compared to the frigid pain caused by the inferior snow boots hed worn while on winter marches in the russian army our unit was spetsnaz he thought with pride and bitterness elite we deserved better treatment the snow fell harder carolers sang away in a manger focus andrei told himself objectify this isnt pyotyr this isnt the man who betrayed my friendship the man i cant wait to punish this is simply a target who needs to be eliminated moving nearer he prepared to draw his soundsuppressed pistol from beneath his ski jacket to hold it low against his side where the crowd wasnt likely to notice it when he was close enough he would raise his arm and place the suppressors barrel near the soft spot behind pyotyrs right ear the smallcaliber guns report would be so muted like a snapping sound from one of the bonfires at the side of the road that even people nearby wouldnt react to it the mushroomtype bullet would expand within pyotyrs skull bursting into fragments as pyotyr fell andrei would seem to try to help him but would actually be grabbing the infant from beneath his parka his two teammates would block anyone who tried to interfere in a rush he would call for transport and use one of the few side streets to reach an area where traffic was allowed responding to his directions a van would make its way through the snow to take him and the package out of the area reflexes primed andrei followed the target through a fourway intersection the next branching street was far ahead now the funnel truly began despite his narrowly focused vision even andrei was aware that the most spectacular display on canyon road had come into view on the left dozens of tall trees bore lights and lanterns the falling snow making them glisten past an open gate evergreen shrubs twinkled with strings of bulbs that formed the outlines of giant candy canes candles and nutcracker soldiers it looks like a holiday card a woman in the crowd marveled used to belong to glenna goodacre another woman explained she designed the vietnam womens memorial in washington and the dollar coin that shows the indian woman who helped lewis and clark her daughter modeled for victorias secret didnt she the first woman replied married harry connick jr only five people separated andrei from his objective now he thought while the crowds distracted suddenly a bearded man approached with two german shepherds a boy reached out to pet one the dog snapped at him the boys mother screamed his father shouted people stopped to see what was happening others surged against andrei attracted by the commotion abruptly the crowd became a wall cursing andrei shoved through and encountered smoke from a bonfire shadowy figures moved beyond it pyotyr where the hell are you kagan didnt plan it under his parka he felt the baby kick adrenaline shot through him at the same time he heard a disturbance behind him a dog growling a woman screaming a man shouting again the baby kicked harder sensing death on his heels kagan responded to an overwhelming impulse and charged ahead through the crowd buddy watch where youre going a man yelled smoke from a bonfire formed a thick haze that kagan ran through shoving people aside he darted toward an opening on the right trying to hide by hurrying along a walkway that led between galleries ahead a laughing woman stepped from a side door a drink in her hand her eyes widened at the sight of kagan charging toward her about to slam into her with a gasp she spilled her cocktail glass and lurched back inside the gallery he sped into a courtyard startling a man and woman who held gloved hands and admired a display of santas reindeer the display was outlined by flickering lights surprised by kagans sudden arrival the woman jerked back and almost fell onto santas sled hey the man shouted watch it kagan spotted a lane that led straight from the rear of the gallery as he raced down it the snow fell colder and faster now that he was away from canyon road he realized how noisy it had beenthe countless overlapping conversations the singing the laughter the crackle of the fires in this lesstraveled area a hush enveloped him behind him the lights of the galleries and the decorations became a faint glow all the while he held the baby securely under his parka on his right a murky lamp over a garage provided enough light to show that other people had gone in this direction and trampled the snow good he thought one set of footprints would attract attention especially if theyre widely spaced from someone running he saw a shed and was tempted to hide behind it with the hope of ambushing his hunters but there was too great a risk that he wouldnt see them in time to react hitting a target in the chaos of a gunfight was difficult enough during the day let alone at night amid the falling snow plus under the circumstances how well could he shoot using his injured arm to try to hold the baby under his coat he would need to fire onehanded the cold might make him tremble throwing off his aim in addition there were bound to be several targets could he hope to surprise all of them yes ive got plenty of reasons to keep going he decided on his left he saw a walkway that extended between low buildings feeling the baby kick again he veered in that direction but at once he reached a wooden wall frantic he pawed along it and found a gap that was wide enough for him to squirm through as he crawled his knees felt the hard edge of a board under the snow the moment he was safely on the other side he raised the board and covered the hole finding himself in a courtyard that was eerily lit by the citys ambient light he studied the low adobe walls that surrounded him a few snowveiled lamps glowed in partially glimpsed houses hazy shrubs were strung with christmas lights the falling snow made the night seem blue reflecting just enough illumination to reveal a few footprints that came from some of the houses kagan kept moving he reached a lane where he encountered yet another choice of which way to go he had the impression of being in a maze the baby must have sensed his agitation when he looked to the right he felt it kick again and he headed in that direction on each side of the lane faintly glimpsed decorations glowed beyond fences made from upright wooden tree limbs wired to horizontal poles from the santa fe newspaper kagan had learned that the locals called them coyote fences in the old days their purpose had been literally to keep out coyotes and even today coyotes were a common sight on the outskirts of town kagan thought of predators hunters but it would take more than a fence to keep these particular hunters out paul what do you know about brighton beach its next to coney island in brooklyn sir its also the us home of the russian mafia thats correct in a lot of russians immigrated there to escape the revolution in the s so many more russians went there after the soviet union collapsed that they started to call it little odessa quite a few were gangsters who used to belong to the kgb or the soviet military where they learned skills that make them especially dangerous its possible to romanticize italian mobsters to the point that we think of them as marlon brando and al pacino in the godfather but russian gangsters are in a class of their own sociopathic doesnt begin to describe them they have no scruples no shame no code of honor theyll do anything for money theres no line they wont cross and no limit to their brutality an italian gangster might suddenly feel patriotic and refuse if say middle eastern terrorists offered to pay to get a bunch of rocket launchers or a dirty bomb into the united states but russian mobstersll take the money do the job and just get out of the way when the explosions start cole watch the window the boys mother said warn me if you see your father coming back obeying the boy stared into the semidarkness christmas lights outside the front door reflected off the snow and revealed that the lane was empty he heard his mother pulling suitcases from under the bed in the master bedroom he listened as she opened drawers and removed clothes cole pushed his glasses closer to his eyes working to keep his vision focused tension nauseated him even if he did see his father returning home what good would that do he wondered he could shout to warn his mother so what the doors were locked but his father had a key in the end they wouldnt be able to stop him from getting inside how would his father react when he saw the suitcases filled with clothes i wont let him hit her again cole thought he limped to the rear of the living room and turned right to go down the hallway at the end of the hall he peered to the left into the master bedroom where his mother leaned over the bed she was too busy packing to notice him he turned to the right and entered his own bedroom where he reached behind the door and gripped the baseball bat that his father had given him for his birthday in september not that the gift mattered lately his father seldom found time to play with him quiet he returned to the living room opened a closet next to the front door and took out his coat its zipper made a clacking noise against the side of the closet cole his fingers cramped on the coat what is it mom the suitcases are packed im a little more tired than i thought we wont be able to leave for an hour or so until cars are allowed on canyon road im going to lie down are you okay i just need to rest let me know when its ten oclock or if you see him coming back cole tightened his grip on the baseball bat dont worry mom im here raging andrei charged through the smoke of the snowsmothered fire people gaped toward the commotion behind him the second german shepherd was growling now the boy crying the parents and the dog owner arguing loudly the bystanders formed a wall that andrei rammed through he made no pretense of using his cell phone if people thought he was talking to himself it no longer mattered that he attracted attention the targets gone he shouted into the microphone hidden under his ski jackets zipper gone the accented voice bellowed through andreis earbud the crowd shielded him he ducked away andrei stared furiously ahead but he didnt see any disturbance in the crowd no sign of anyone shoving people aside or rushing forward pyotyr where did you go he thought urgently the package the voice yelled everything depends on getting it back this is your fault you vouched for him you assured me i could trust him you hooyesos bring back what he stole andrei bristled no one insulted him from his earliest years on the streets of grozny hed learned that disrespect could never be tolerated if anybody other than the pakhan had called him that breathing quickly he scanned the buildings on the left side of canyon road they formed a wall but to his right several galleries had walkways between them that was the only escape route his two teammates ran up behind him over there andrei yelled too hurried to recall the code names theyd been given mikhail take the first walkway yakov take the second ill take the third they rushed forward ignoring the alarmed looks people gave them as the snow kept falling andrei raced along the third walkway christmas lights blinked in a gallery window he passed a side door that was open hearing a woman complain almost knocked me over whats the matter with people this is the one night we ought to slow down its christmas eve for gods sake andrei ran into a back courtyard where a man and woman stood in front of a flickering display of santas reindeer and sled they looked angry about his intrusion as if this wasnt the first time theyd been startled tonight im with the police did a man run through here that way the woman pointed toward a lane scared the hell out of us andrei hurried into the lane behind him muffled footsteps raced between the galleries mikhail and yakov joining him those other routes are dead ends mikhail reported they assessed the lane there wasnt much activity since most people preferred the attractions on canyon road responding to their military background they spread out andrei took the middle position and replaced his beretta with the powerful millimeter glock he moved slowly carefully straining his eyes to study everything through the haze of the falling snow yakov spoke in a low voice too many footprints we cant tell which are his at least not yet andrei murmured searching for blood he might try to ambush us mikhail said in that case weve got him andrei replied the way were spread out he cant take all of us before we return fire but im not worried about an ambush he wont risk putting the child in danger not while he still has strength to try to get it out of here andrei was reminded of something a soldier one of his mothers numerous boyfriends had taught him when theyd gone on a hunting trip the soldier had hoped the expedition would impress andreis mother the soldiers unit was one of the first to be sent to afghanistan in and andrei had never seen him again but because he and his mother had lived near a soviet military base thered been many other soldiers to replace the man whod left and they were the only fathers andrei had known andrei had never forgotten that particular hunting trip the soldier had taught him something that had turned out to be a life lesson a wounded animal keeps running until weakness forces it to go to ground only when its cornered will it fight in what seemed increasingly to be a labyrinth kagan plodded through the snowfall its muted whisper made him feel as if something were wrong with his hearing as if he were trapped in a snow globe because he still couldnt risk raising his hood and impairing his peripheral vision he allowed the snow to accumulate on his head periodically he brushed it off nonetheless his scalp felt frozen on the ground in front of him the footprints were becoming less frequent branching off to warmlooking homes behind fences and walls soon his would be the only footprints remaining he prayed that the snow would fill them before his hunters figured out which direction hed taken as the baby squirmed under his parka he shivered and thought i risked my life for you i could have walked away and disappeared god knows i was ready ive been through more than anyone could imagine i found terrorist threats no one would have dreamed of but to maintain my cover i did things no one should have been forced to do he thought of the clerk hed pistolwhipped while robbing an allnight convenience store in brooklyn his purpose had been to demonstrate his ferocity to andrei whohe knewhad followed him and was watching from across the street the clerk had spent two weeks in a hospital he thought of the restaurant owner whose front teeth hed pulled out with pliers when the pakhan had wanted the man punished for failing to make a loan payment somehow the mans screams hadnt prevented kagan from hearing the clatter of the teeth when hed dropped them to the floor he thought of the legs hed broken and the homes hed burned the cars whose brakes hed caused to fail and the water faucets hed opened in the middle of the night flooding businesses whose owners had refused to pay protection money again and again hed been compelled to prove himself to the pakhan to be increasingly brutal in order to gain admission to the inner circle and search for connections between middle eastern terrorists and the russian mob he recalled how adamantly his mission controllers had refused to pull him out there was always something bigger something more dangerous that they needed him to pursue they seemed determined to involve him in the mission forever no matter how deeply he descended into hell not any longer kagan mentally told the baby its finished i ended it because of you did i blow my cover because i wanted out or because youre worth the price his weariness was such that when the baby twisted against him he almost believed it was assuring him that hed done the right thing lord help me i hope so he thought in the blue haze of the snowfall he peered down and noticed that there was only one set of footprints ahead of him now worse they came in his direction and they were half full my tracksll be obvious he thought feeling a deeper chill suddenly his dizziness from blood loss threw him off balance feeling the baby kick under his parka he held it firmly with his good arm and jerked out his injured one to balance himself he groaned from the pain but managed not to fall rapid clouds of frosted breath came from his mouth the cold mountain air made his tongue dry he moved forward again parallel to the footprints hoping to make it appear that someone had left home to look at the decorations on canyon road and had recently come back that the two sets of prints belonged to the same person leaving and returning still dizzy he reached a gate on his left beyond it the faint footprints came from the side of a onestory adobe house its support beams projected from the flat roof in the manner of native america pueblos a covered porch stretched from one side of the house to the other but they dont call it a porch here a hotel clerk had told him its called a stop losing focus kagan thought in dismay his sense of being trapped in a snow globe had become so strong that it seemed as if the rest of the neighborhood no longer existed that this house was the only place in the world as he stared it began to resemble a holiday postcard a pinebough wreath was on the front door a row of colored lights hung above it to the right a window revealed a dark living room illuminated by a fire in a hearth and lights on a christmas tree he smelled the peppery fragrance of pinon smoke coming from the chimney the only house in the world dont i wish he thought the baby moved under his parka and kagan wondered if it sensed how exhausted he was that he would soon collapse that this house was their only chance he stepped closer to the upright cedar limbs of a coyote fence straining to see if there was any movement in the shadows beyond the main window to the left a light glowed behind another window this one small kagan saw a suggestion of cupboards and concluded that the light was in the kitchen but he still didnt notice any activity the place seemed deserted maybe the tracks belong to someone who lives here alone kagan thought maybe he or she went for a walk and turned the kitchen light on to make it appear that the house is occupied but misgivings made kagan frown would someone have gone out and left a fire in the hearth its not something id do he decided no i cant assume the house is deserted he directed his weary gaze farther to the left where he saw a snowobscured shed and a garage i can try to hide there he thought maybe itll appear as if the tracks belong to someone who returned to the side door of the house he glanced behind him worried that his hunters would suddenly appear phantoms racing through the snowfall guns raised overwhelming him continuing to use his good arm to secure the baby under his parka he reached his wounded one toward the gates metal bolt he bit his lip in a useless effort to distract himself from the pain then he tugged the bolt to the side and pushed the gate open paul youll spend a month in a russian prison in omsk thats in siberia the official records will indicate that you were a prisoner there for thirteen years russian prisons are notoriously overcrowded the inmates seldom get a chance to mingle it wont be suspicious if inquiries are made and none of the prisoners remembers how long you were really there well put russian prison tattoos on your chest barbed wire with thirteen prongs indicates the number of years you supposedly were in prison a cat and a spider within a web indicate that youre a thief a candlestick indicates that youre dangerous that youre not afraid to put out someones light well give you a blood thinner before youre tattooed the increased bleeding will make the tattoos look old and faded we have a source wholl teach you details of omsk at the time you supposedly were taken off the streets your story is that youre an orphan born there a street kid who moved around a lot running from the authorities until they put you in prison hard to disprove a month in that prison ought to be enough for you to be able to answer questions about details only someone who served time there could know after that weve arranged for you to escape and take a black market route out of russia youll make the traditional criminal pilgrimage to brighton beach where youll go through the inevitable rites of passage to be accepted paul youve worked undercover before the drill remains the same the big difference is that this time youll be doing it longer and that the people im trying to fool are more dangerous exactly how much longer is the assignment we dont know the rumors were picking up indicate that something big is set to happen between the russian mob and al qaeda in the next twelve months maybe its a suitcase bomb the mob took from one of those nuclear bases that were left unguarded when the soviet union collapsed theres a strong chance youll prevent an attack much worse than what happened on andreis right hand felt cold its thin leather glove didnt provide enough insulation against the grip of his pistol he pulled his left hand from his skijacket pocket switched the glock over to it and shoved his right hand into the jacket flexing his fingers warming them in the dim illumination from snowhazed lights he and his companions followed prints in the snow they came to a wall andrei aimed to the right toward a fence and the windowless side of a house there wasnt any indication that someone had gone in that direction he swung to the left toward a walkway between two rows of small buildings a halfdozen sets of footprints led toward entrances he hurried along seeing the prints become fewer and fewer until only one set continued past the buildings ive almost got you andrei thought abruptly he came to another wall inexplicably the footprints didnt turn around they just ended andrei stared at them mystified he stepped closer to the wall it was made of upright boards that looked to be about ten feet high pyotyr you couldnt have climbed them not with one arm wounded not holding the baby under your coat so where the hell did you go baffled andrei stepped even closer and touched the surface he exhaled quickly when a board fell away revealing a low gap that was wide enough for a man to crawl through clever are you waiting on the other side ready to shoot us as we squirm into sight the pakhans voice blurted from the earbud under andreis cap have you found the package our clients will be here any moment even if i give back the money theyll demand someone be punished for failing to deliver what they need it wont be me theyll hunt you ill help them crouching studying the gap in the wall andrei murmured to the microphone on his ski jacket were close he lied you see pyotyr its too risky to talk hell hear me you govnosos get the package andrei felt the insult as he would a slap dont call me that ill do whatever i want you incompetent kachok andrei struggled to keep his fury from distracting him chest heaving he stared toward the gap in the wall he shifted to the right and left using various angles to assess the area beyond the footprints seemed to go straight ahead but that didnt prove anything andrei knew pyotyr might have veered to the side and doubled back to ambush them as they crawled through were wasting time my friend i wont let you make this even worse for me he reached under his ski jacket and pulled the radio transmitter from his belt it was black plastic the size of a deck of cards he switched the dial to the frequency the team had used earlier and listened for some indication of what pyotyr might be doing what he heard was deep fast labored breathing the sound of someone on the move then youre not waiting on the other side andrei thought you made us suspect a trapto make us stop while you kept going outraged he squirmed through the gap as mikhail and yakov followed and spread out andrei examined his surroundings keeping his gun ready he was in a courtyard with colorfully lit adobe houses on each side bending to examine the footprints he noted that their stride wasnt as long a hint of blood trailed next to them pyotyr weve almost got you he spoke into the microphone it doesnt need to be like this my friend return the package well forgive you andreis earbud was silent then pyotyr surprised him replying say it again this time with conviction ah andrei said to the microphone all the while following the footprints so youre not too injured to be able to speak its good to hear your voice i bet pyotyr said breathing hard i meant what i told you return what you stole well pretend this never happened well even get you medical attention and what about viktor pyotyr asked i killed him youre willing to forget that he was new i hardly spent any time with him your loyaltys touching you have the jaitsa to talk to me about loyalty i made you look bad in front of the pakhan i apologize prove it return the package pyotyr didnt answer all andrei heard was the sound of his forced breathing you know well catch you andrei said you can try listen to reason youre losing strength theres only one way this can end save yourself more pain surrender the child and everything will be like it was before ill let you go you have my word of course pyotyrs labored breathing indicated that he kept walking damn it tell me why the child is so important to you andrei demanded if youre a spy why would you blow your cover because of this its christmas eve i guess i got carried away by the holiday spirit is being sentimental worth your life is chasing me worth yours i always liked your attitude but given the way you sound i doubt thisll be much of a contest abruptly andrei came to a spot where the footprints joined a number of others in a lane that went to the right and left someones coming yakov warned on the right two couples emerged from the snowfall prompting andrei and his companions to tuck their weapons into their coats no youre wrong chevy chase made the funniest christmas movie one of the approaching men insisted to his companions national lampoons christmas vacation is that the one where chevy brings home a christmas tree with a squirrel in it yeah and his dog drinks the water in the trees dish the tree gets so dry it bursts into flames and burns the squirrel a woman objected you think thats funny no it jumps on chevys back the second man replied its really just this cheesy stuffed squirrel that a prop guy sewed to his sweater but his family screams and runs away when they see it on him then chevy screams and runs not realizing that the squirrels on his back and voices dwindling the couples continued down the lane soon their figures were obscured again by the falling snow andrei and his companions removed their pistols from their coats pyotyr andrei said into his microphone all he heard was forced breathing we can solve this problem andrei assured him you just need to be reasonable pyotyr refused to answer very well ill see you soon my friend andrei said he switched the transmitter back to the frequency the team was now using then he put the unit under his ski jacket and rehooked it to his belt mikhail pointed toward the ground we need to hurry all these tracks will soon be filled with snow andrei glanced to the left where this new lane led back toward canyon road he might have rejoined the crowd yakov said possibly andrei agreed but he seems to be losing more blood he might be afraid that someone will notice and cause a commotion that will tell us where he went would he risk attracting our attention instead of going to ground somewhere debating the possibilities andrei peered to the right away from canyon road there were fewer footprints headed in that direction go left check the crowd he told mikhail and yakov ill go this way kagan stepped through the open gate and studied the area in front of the house as the snowflakes thickened he saw the outline of a bench and an evergreen shrub on the right two leafless trees stood to his left their white trunks were difficult to distinguish in the snowfall he stared at the main window but still didnt see any movement except for the flicker from logs in the fireplace at once his vision wavered almost in imitation of the dimly glimpsed flames its just the snow blurring my eyes he thought his legs felt frozen as did his chest where the zipper on his parka was halfway down providing air for the baby hurry he thought he turned to close the gate and secure the metal bolt ignoring a twinge of pain in his wound whence redirected his attention toward the house his vision again wavered under his parka the baby moved aware that he needed to find shelter soon he took one step then another the flakes came faster renewing the hope that his tracks would soon be filled i have a good chance of getting this trick to work he thought still he couldnt help imagining the emotions of the man to whom hed spoken just now the man hed fooled into believing they were friends the man whoeven if he failed tonightwould never stop hunting him kagan moved nearer to the house but something he saw in the snow to the left of the front door made him worry that his vision had definitely been compromised he was sure he saw a plant it had a dense cluster of dark leaves the contrast against the snow was the reason he noticed it but it seemed impossible how could a plant grow in this weather moreover it seemed to have flowers a halfdozen large ones the white of which was as difficult to distinguish as the trunks of the aspen trees and yet he was sure he saw their blur flowers in winter im hallucinating kagan thought some kind of snow mirage or maybe the blood loss is making me see things unsteady he followed the halffilled prints toward the side of the house keep going he thought im almost there if i can get into the shed or the garage i can rest for a while catch my breath try to stop the bleeding he put one boot in front of the other maybe therell be a tarpaulin or an old blanket i can crawl under he hoped try to get warm try to warm both of us he silently promised the baby he felt more responsible for the child than hed ever felt for anyone else in the world maybe could wrap you up and put you someplace safe in a corner that would give me a chance to try to protect us but whatever you do he mentally pleaded just dont cry im sure youre hungry ill try to find you something to eat i dont know how but ill do my best please dont cry youve been good so far the greatest theres only one way you can be better for gods sake please dont cry he shivered violently wiping snow from the top of his head he reached the side of the house away from the christmas lights that stretched above the front door and the ceiling light that shone from the kitchen he paused in the shadows trying to let his untrustworthy eyes adjust in the hiss of the falling snow everything seemed closer as if it were condensing around him sudden movement dissolved the illusion a figure lunged toward him and kagan was absolutely certain the shock from his wound had made him hallucinatebecause the figure was a boy maybe twelve years old and the boy had a baseball bat he was about to swing with it and the intensity of the expression on his face was startling even if kagan saw it only for an instant his vision doubled his knees bent before the boy could strike him he dropped sickened feeling his eyes roll up and his mind drift he did his best to topple onto his side to keep the weight of his body from crushing the baby dont cry he silently pleaded whatever you do dont cry but now the baby did cry jolted when kagan landed the infant wailed beneath the parka its cry went on and on rising pausing only when the baby took frantic breaths then it swelled again a cry of helplessness and fear of pain hunger and despair of all the sorrow and desperation in the world paul you shouldnt have risked calling youre supposed to use the dead drop is this an emergency i need you to bring me in you told me it wouldnt last this long tonight i can barely hear you tonight to prove i was part of the team they forced me to i still cant hear you you need to get off the line youre jeopardizing the mission if you dont bring me in ill walk away no youd make them suspicious wed never get another man in there give us time to think of a believable reason for you to disappear soon think of it soon the quickest we can learn as much as possible there are rumors about a shipment of plastic explosive being smuggled through the jersey docks thats odessa territory if semtex is being smuggled in the russians are involved just bring me home for gods sake bring me home part two the christmas rose kagan heard a faint choir singing silent night holy night it took him a dazed moment to realize that the soft music came from a radio or a cd player but not in the room where he lay on his back on the floor a woman loomed over him as did the boy who had nearly struck him with the baseball bat kagans eyes hurt from the glare of the overhead light orienting himself in a panic he saw the gleam of stainless steel a stove a refrigerator im in a kitchen he realized he tried to raise himself but his strength gave out and he sank back onto what felt like a brick floor youre hurt the woman said dont try to move the baby he murmured anxiously even dazed he was alarmed by the sound of his voice for almost a year hed spoken so much russian that his english had an accent he worried that it would be one more thing to unsettle the woman here i have him in my arms she said the baby remained wrapped in a small blue blanket kagans vision cleared enough for him to see the woman holding the infant protectively against her chest from his perspective on the floor the ceiling light shone down through her long blond hair giving her a halo she was in her midthirties thin perhaps more than was healthy kagan noted desperation focusing his mind his life depended on what he could learn about this woman in the next few minutes she wore a red flared satin dress as if for a party al though it hung askew on her shoulders making him think shed put it on hastily and there was something wrong about her face which she kept turned toward kagans left she stared at the crimson stain on the left sleeve of his parka why are you bleeding she asked her forehead creased with concern why were you carrying the baby under your coat were you in an accident turn off the lights what kagan strained to minimize his accent the lights please do they hurt your eyes phone the police kagan managed to say yes you need an ambulance holding the baby the woman continued to tilt her face to kagans left selfconscious about something whats wrong with her cheek kagan wondered but i cant phone for help she told him im sorry the phones are broken while kagan worked to order his thoughts melting snow dripped from his hair he realized that the zipper on his parka had been pulled almost completely open sweat from his exertion soaked his clothes heat drifted up from the bricks a sensation that made him think he was delirious until he remembered a bellhop telling him about the underfloor radiant heatinghot water through rubber tubesthat warmed the hotel where he was staying broken he drew a breath the snow brought down the phone lines no not the lines the phones are the woman kept her face to the side and didnt finish the sentence smashed the boy said bitterness tightened his voice he had a slight build almost to the point of looking frail but that hadnt stopped him from attacking kagan with the baseball bat he was around twelve years old with glasses and tousled hair blond like his mothers talking about the smashed phones made his cheeks red the baseball bat kagan abruptly realized is he still holding it with relief he saw that the boy had leaned the bat against a cupboard kagan didnt understand why the boy had attacked him but there wasnt time for questions dizzy he tried to sit up he remembered the microphone he wore the woman or the boy might say something that would tell andrei where he was hiding under the pretense of rubbing a sore muscle he reached beneath his parka and turned off the transmitter it was the first time since hed taken the child that his hands had been free to do so to his left he saw the small window over the kitchen sink please he worked to neutralize the accent hed acquired his voice sounding more american youve got to pull the curtain over that window turn off the lights the baby squirmed in the womans arms kicking crying again do it kagan urged turn off the lights the woman and the boy stepped back evidently worried that he might be delusional as weak as i am you can see im no threat to you threat the womans eyes reacted to the word men are chasing me what are you talking about they want the baby youve got to turn off the lights so they cant see us some men are trying to kidnap this baby the womans face registered shock she held the infant closer defending it now the blue blanket was enveloped by the arms of her red dress slow down kagan warned himself this is coming at her too fast she needs time to adjust he inhaled slowly held his breath then exhaled each time counting to three as he would before a gunfight working to calm himself making his voice gentle he asked whats your name the woman looked surprised unprepared for the change of tone she hesitated still keeping her face angled to the left the baby whimpered in her arms and its wizened face seemed to urge her to reply meredith she finally said thank god kagan thought she gave me something he noticed a nightlight next to the stove across from him if youre concerned about being in the dark with me turn on that nightlight the glow wont attract attention from the street its the bright lights we need to worry about then i promise ill explain why im injured why i have the baby meredith didnt respond listen to me kagan mustered the strength to keep talking i didnt intend to bring trouble to you i planned to hide in the shed or the garage things didnt work out im sorry i involved you but that cant be changed now those men will do anything to get their hands on this baby youve got to help me stop them from thinking hes here thats the only way you and your son will get out of this if meredith hadnt been holding the baby kagan was certain shed have grabbed the boy and fled from the house but the baby made all the difference seeming to prevent her from moving you can see how helpless i am kagan said whats the harm if you close the curtains over the sink and use the nightlight it wont hurt you but it might save the baby meredith kept hesitating her strained features showing the confusion she felt and it might save you and your son kagan emphasized youve got a known situation in here a baby who needs help a man whos injured but you have no idea of the trouble outside when the baby whimpered again meredith looked down at its unhappy face and debated she stroked its dark wispy hair then frowned toward the window reluctantly she told the boy cole do what he wants but do it she said firmly then added gently please the boy looked at her his gaze questioning then moved toward the window thank you she told him when cole nodded kagan didnt bother trying to conceal his relief the boy surprised kagan by limping slightly as he crossed the kitchen he stretched nervously over the sink to close the curtains then he turned on the nightlight which had a perforated tin shield that looked like a christmas tree and reduced the glow watching cole walk unevenly toward an archway that led into the living room kagan subdued a frown when he saw why the boy limped one leg was shorter than the other the heel on his right shoe rose two inches higher than the one on the left even so kagan couldnt help silently urging the boy to hurry cole flicked a switch on the wall and turned off the main kitchen lights apart from the glow of the nightlight the only illumination came from the fireplace and the lights on the christmas tree in the living room kagan allowed himself to hope okay you said the phones in the house arent working but dont you have a cell phone no meredith answered uncomfortably dont you kagan thought of the coat pocket that had been torn open when hed escaped lost it he took my mothers phone cole said he kagan crawled painfully toward a wooden chair at the kitchen table neither of them answered in another part of the house a mans voice sang away in a manger no crib for a bed kagan was surprised that he took the time to identify it as bing crosbys damn it concentrate he thought a man took your cell phone kagan felt hed achieved a small victory when his right hand touched the chair you promised to tell us why they want the baby meredith demanded i made a mistake i dont know why i brought you inside you brought me inside because you heard the baby crying kagan fought for energy because you couldnt leave the baby out there in the snow he took a deep breath because youre a decent person and this is the one night of the year you cant refuse to take care of someone whos hurt with effort kagan pulled himself onto the chair his gaze drifted toward a wall phone next to the nightlight across from him at least it had once been a phone someone had used a hammer to smash it into pieces the hammer lay on the counter is the man who took your cell phone the same man who did that kagan pointed toward the debris from his new position he had a better view of the side of merediths face even in the dim illumination provided by the nightlight it was obvious that her cheek was bruised and her eye was swelling shut she had dried blood on the side of her mouth is he the same man who beat you kagan asked the question filled him with bitterness to prove himself to the russian mob hed been forced to beat many people often the pakhan had ordered him to punch women in the face to knee them in the groin and knock them to the floor kicking their legs and sides to make husbands fathers sons and brothers do what the pakhan wanted his mission controllers had been delighted by how effectively such tactics had earned kagan access to the mobs inner circle but each night kagan had suffered nightmaresand each morning hed been filled with shame now his shame reinforced his outrage at what had been done to meredith his powerful emotions started adrenaline flowing giving him energy if you dont tell me why those men want this baby cole and i are going for the police meredith threatened no kagan blurted you dont dare go outside it isnt safe the baby squirmed in merediths arms its tiny face shriveled and prompted kagan to fear it was about to cry again we cant let it make noise he said its hungry youve got to feed it and change it can you do that can you help the baby anything to stop it from crying again the baby whimpered pushing against meredith cole kagan said urgently would you like to help your mother and me is there a bedroom that faces the front of the house does the bedroom have a television the boy looked puzzled mine go in there and turn on the television close the curtains but leave just enough space so the glow from the television can be seen through the window we want them to think everythings normal in here cole wrinkled his brow then go into the living room and look out the window pretend youre admiring the snowfall kagan told him if you see anyone out there dont react just peer up as if youre waiting for santa claus im too old to believe in santa claus of course i dont know what i was thinking obviously youre too old to believe in santa claus just fool anyone who might be watching admire the snowfall pretend youre a spy would you like to learn to be a spy is that what you claim you are meredith asked dismay crept into her voice yes kagan slumped on the chair exhaustion overwhelming him god help me yes im a spy andrei followed the various tracks along the lane taking note as some of them angled toward houses behind chesthigh walls presumably evidence of someone returning home or thats what im supposed to think isnt that right pyotyr andrei decided but maybe one of these sets of tracks belongs to you solitary footprints went through a gate on the right andrei peered through the falling snow toward a living room window next to christmas lights on a hearth a man held up a treat while a dalmatian looked up patiently and waited for its master to reward it andrei returned the glock to his right hand and put his left hand into a coat pocket warming his fingers in the thin shooters glove he continued along the tracks studying them but he no longer saw with the tunnel vision of a hunter on the verge of catching his prey his perspective was now wide taking into account the trees and shadows to the right and left on guard against an ambush earlier with mikhail and yakov flanking him hed been confident that pyotyr would keep running but with only me for a target he wondered pyotyr will you t ake the chance of attacking me if im alone something flashed the air became filled with an acrid smell andrei spun almost pulling the trigger as a burning object fell with the snow at once he realized that it was a plastic garbage bag shaped like a hotair balloon inside attached to an xshaped platform of balsa were rows of burning candles the hot air they created had given the bag its lift but not any longer the candles had set the bag on fire when it crashed sparks flew the flames dwindling smoke forming in the snow andrei refused to allow the surreal event to distract him he pivoted aiming toward the shrouded area around him urgent questions crowded his mind did it make sense for pyotyr to go this way wounded with the baby to concern him out here away from the crowd pyotyr was helpless if he fainted from blood loss he and the baby would freeze to death maybe im wrong andrei thought maybe he believes he has a better chance among the people on canyon road or maybe thats what he wants me to think andrei reached for the radio transmitter under his coat and switched the frequency to the one the team had used at the start of the mission the one that had enabled him to speak to pyotyr earlier he hoped that the sound of pyotyrs breathing would tell him whether or not he was still moving or whether he had stopped and set up an ambush but this time there wasnt any sound only dead air did you shut off your transmitter to keep the sounds you make from revealing where you are andrei wondered well it wont do you any good ill find you my friend he switched the transmitter to the new frequency the team was using all the while he scanned the hiding places that flanked the lane ready with his pistol he followed the dwindling tracks thank you for inviting me to your home andrei its an honor to have dinner with your wife and daughters the honor is mine pyotyr i owe you my life but youd have done the same for me thats what friends are forto watch each others back yes to watch each others back the pakhans other men ran youre the only one who helped me out of that trap and the bastard actually gave you hell for taking the risk he gladly would have let me die to keep the rest of his men from being killed quite a life we chose chose pyotyr do you honestly believe we made a choice we stay here dont we where else would you go and not attract attention with your fake identity card do you think you could be an accountant or a realestate agent in some place like omaha how long do you think it would take for government agents to show up at your door but not before the pakhan sent men to slit your throat to keep you from telling the government what you know about him believe me andrei i wasnt complaining of course you werent feel how cold it is look at the ice on the beach the tv weatherman says well get another six inches of snow even then i dont know why anybody grumbles brighton beach is nothing compared to spending a winter in the russian army or in a prison in siberia perhaps we should go back inside and have dessert your wifell think we dont like the oladi she made in a moment first we have business to discuss thats why i asked you to come out to the porch why are you scowling andrei is something wrong i swear i wasnt complaining hahgot you i just wanted to make you worry so your surprise would be all the greater i have very good news my friend youre being promoted promoted the pakhan likes what i say about you and what hes seen he likes the intensity you bring to your work he likes the results dont make plans for christmas you and i and some others including the pakhan are going to santa fe wheres that new mexico the desert good i wouldnt mind a warm christmas drinking rum and coke next to a swimming pool its not the kind of desert youre thinking of pyotyr this is high desert pine trees cold and probably snow its near a ski area in the sangre de cristo mountains sangre de cristo i googled the name its spanish it means blood of christ apparently thats what the explorers thought the sunset on the snow looked like andrei i dont understand why the pakhan wants to go on a holiday where its cold were not going there for a holiday were going for a baby a spy merediths voice rose i should never have brought you into the house leave get out the baby its the baby you wanted to help i made a terrible mistake go if my husband finds you here when he comes back is your husband the man who beat you the question caught meredith off guard kagan turned toward cole is your father the man you wanted to hit with the baseball bat in the glow of the nightlight cole pushed his glasses onto the bridge of his nose i wasnt going to let him inside so he could hurt my mom again the snow landed on my glasses you were blurred i didnt think anyone else would be coming but you stopped when you realized i was a stranger if youd been him id have used the baseball bat i swear id have used the bat i believe you would have kagan put his hand reassuringly on the boys thin shoulder the baby started crying rooting its mouth against merediths chest please kagan told meredith do something if the men outside hear him how do i know youre not the one whos dangerous she demanded even though her attention was directed toward kagan she instinctively rocked the baby her raised voice made its tiny hands jerk with agitation do i look like i want to hurt you kagan felt blood dripping from his arm onto the brick floor he needed to take care of it soon before he lost so much blood that his strength was gone do i look like im even capable of hurting you so much is happening my husband wont hit you again kagan said i promise that made an impression meredith became very still fixing her gaze on him she no longer averted her face even in the dim light it was obvious that her cheek was more purple her eye more swollen than when kagan had first seen her the split at the side of her lip was larger than it had first appeared but despite everything he had a sense that shed once been an attractive woman shes that thin because shes nervous he realized wont hit me again merediths voice dropped i wish i could believe that hey its christmas wishing will make it come true if you do something to ted hell only take it out on me later thats his name ted dont worry i wont do anything that would make him want to hurt you then how would you get him to stop hey dont you like surprise presents help the baby and i promise ted wont hit you again kagan couldnt remember anyone staring at him harder somehow she said you make me believe you the baby cried kicking against merediths arms she reached under its blanket the diapers soaked but i dont have anything to a dish towel she realized she held the baby with one hand and pulled two towels from a drawer lets see if i remember how to do this she spread one of the towels on a counter and folded the other then she set the baby down on the first towel and eased its head onto the makeshift pillow of the second as she unzipped the babys blue sleeper kagan saw that cole still hadnt done what hed asked again he urged the boy go into your bedroom turn on the television go to the window in the living room see if anybodys watching the house if they are fool them the way i told you but what if somebody is watching the house cole wondered his eyes looked large behind his glasses they wont try to get in right away for one thing they wont know for sure that im here you think somebodys going to break in coles voice wavered movement made kagan turn toward meredith as she pulled the baby from its sleeper the infants legs curled toward its chest emphasizing its vulnerability immediately it jerked its arms and whimpered they wont try to break in unless they hear crying kagan said im doing the best i can meredith snapped with only this nightlight its hard to see no thats not what i meant he said in a hurry please i apologize what meredith looked at him in surprise i guess i sounded disapproving i didnt intend to you probably get plenty of disapproval as it is the baby cant ask for more than your best she studied him as if seeing him for the first time then the babys squirming required her attention and she tugged open the adhesive strips on the diaper cole remained in the kitchen ive got to engage him kagan thought he unclipped the tiny microphone hidden under the skilift tickets on his parka he put it deeply in one of his pants pockets where the scratch of the smothering fabric would prevent it from transmitting voices then he removed his transmitter from under his coat and gave it to the boy whats this cole asked curiosity mixing with suspicion kagan took out his earbud cleaned it on his pants and handed it to him theyre part of a twoway radio setup thats the transmitter and this is the earpiece the onoff switch is at the top of the transmitter the volume dial is on one side the channel dial is on the other do you play video games of course cole seemed puzzled by the question as if he took it for granted that everyone played video games then you ought to be good at multitasking while you watch for movement out the window i want you to hold the receiver to your ear and listen while you keep changing the frequency on the transmitter maybe youll find the channel the men outside are using maybe we can hear what theyre planning cole studied the objects in his hands make it seem like youre listening to an ipod kagan told him right an ipod the boy examined the equipment and nodded i can do that he mustered his courage and limped into the living room throughout their conversation kagan sensed that meredith was watching him then the baby squirmed and she removed the diaper a boy she murmured he doesnt look more than four or five weeks old five weeks good guess kagan said if hed waited a little longer hed have been a christmas present meredith dropped the diaper in a trash can under the sink i forgot how tiny a baby is look he has a birthmark on his left heel it sort of reminds me of a rose the child of peace what kagan realized hed said too much isnt that what babies mean this time of year like the christmas carol says peace on earth goodwill to men its sexist i suppose but the sentiment still works again meredith studied him then she returned her attention to the baby he isnt anglo anglo kagan asked what the locals call white but he doesnt look hispanic or native american either his skin is like cinnamon he looks middle eastern kagan stood and wavered managing to steady himself he went to the kitchen sink and peered cautiously past the curtain on the window i dont have any safety pins big enough to close this dish towel and make it work as a diaper meredith said wincing kagan eased off his parka freeing himself of the weight of the gun in his right pocket when meredith had opened the coat and taken out the baby she hadnt pushed the flaps to each side and thus hadnt felt what was there he set the parka on the kitchen table taking care to cushion the impact of the gun against the wood and avoid a sound that might attract questions do you have any duct tape he asked duct tape yes that would work instead of safety pins but what made you think of that duct tape has all kinds of uses where is it the bottom drawer to the left of the sink we had a leak under the drain kagan opened the drawer and pulled out the roll of duct tape he tore off two pieces and pressed them where meredith held the folded dish towel around the babys hips then he tore off several more stripslonger onesand stuck them to the edge of the counter for now i wont need those meredith told him theyre for something else kagan said he turned his back then unbuttoned his shirt and gently pulled it free he didnt want meredith to be alarmed by the russian prison tattoos on his chest despite the sweat that slicked his skin he shivered in the glow from the nightlight he managed to confirm that the bullet had passed through the flesh of his upper left arm the wound was swollen but as far as he could tell neither bone nor the artery had been hit well thats the good news about the bad news he thought he braced himself for what he needed to do you can manage this he told himself fighting the pain behind him meredith evidently got a look at the injury to his arm what happened to you kagan didnt answer is my god is that a bullet wound were you shot when i rescued the baby repressing his dizziness kagan leaned over the sink and soaped the wound do you have a firstaid kit he tried not to grimace when he rinsed blood away with warm water merediths mind seemed paralyzed a firstaid kit she was so overwhelmed that she appeared to have trouble understanding the concept firstaid the next drawer up kagan pulled it from the drawer and opened it pleased to find antibiotic cream while he gingerly rubbed it over his wound he looked through a crack in the curtains above the sink the snow kept falling he stared past the two trees toward the coyote fence and the lane no one was in sight maybe well get lucky he thought sure we will he noticed a dry cloth next to the sink biting his lip he pressed it to his wound and used the strips of duct tape to stick it to his skin sweat beaded his face while he wrapped several layers of tape tightly around his arm making a pressure bandage he waited hoping that he wouldnt see any blood leak out the baby whimpered when kagan looked over his shoulder he saw it trying to suck one of its fists what are we going to feed him meredith said do you have any milk babies arent supposed to be fed regular milk the world health organization has an emergency recipe for diluting it with water and adding sugar we dont have any milk cole cant digest it we had rice milk but we used the last of it earlier then put a half teaspoon of salt into a quart of water salt add a half teaspoon of baking soda and three tablespoons of sugar are you making this up its something the mayo clinic developed kagan shoved a finger into the bullet hole in his shirt he tugged at the hole ripping the sleeve open to make room for the added bulk of the pressure bandage as he put on the shirt he told meredith warm the water until the salt baking soda and sugar dissolve world health organization mayo clinic since when do spies know about feeding babies i once escorted a medical team in somalia that was close enough to the truth to be believable kagan decided the country had actually been afghanistan and he hadnt been an escort instead his assignment had been to pretend to be part of the medical team while he tried to get information from afghan villagers about the location of terrorist training camps knowing how to save a babys life could buy a lot of cooperation the babies were starving kagan explained the doctors told me what to do it felt good to be able to help reinforcing kagans point meredith held the baby against her chest the mixture isnt a substitute for food all itll do is give him electrolytes and keep him from dehydrating kagan went on he needs twelve ounces in the next twelve hours but after that hes got to have formula twelve hours kagan thought if were not out of danger by then it wont matter if the baby gets fed or not someones coming cole said from the living room wary of the shadows on either side andrei followed the tracks the falling snow had accumulated until it was above the ankles of his boots the footprints ahead were rapidly becoming faint impressions two sets veered toward a house on the right farther on two other sets angled toward a house on the left the pairs of prints were next to each other and showed no sign of scuffling but andrei suspected that if pyotyr had used his gun to force someone to take him into a house he would probably have done so with the gun pointed toward the persons back in that case one set of prints would be in front of the other also the prints in front would be unevenly spaced evidence that the person in front was being shoved as andrei kept walking faint light reflecting off the snow now revealed only one remaining set of fresh tracks he noted that they paralleled some almostfilled prints that came in andreis direction apparently from a house farther down the lane do these fresh prints belong to you pyotyr he hoped have i almost caught you or maybe youre leading me into a trap andrei slowed scanning the snowy haze before him the cold made his cheeks numb but that only took his mind back again while in the russian army he had once marched twentyfour hours in a blizzard in that period he hadnt been able to drink or eat anything the weather having frozen his water and rations we do this to make you tougher his officers had told him well those bastards accomplished their goal andrei thought bitterly no one can be tougher or harder pyotyr youre about to learn what that means ahead the remaining footprints turned to the left toward the upright cedar limbs of a coyote fence the prints reached a gate andrei carefully observed that the other tracks the ones that were almost obliterated by the snow came from that same gate they belong to someone who went to see the christmas lights and then returned andrei concluded the excitement of the hunt dimmed in his chest ive been following someone who lives in the neighborhood i wasted valuable time i should have stayed with mikhail and yakov and continued searching the area near canyon road wait dont jump to conclusions he warned himself continuing along the lane he concentrated harder on the two sets of tracks the old ones came from the left side of the house the new ones went in that direction disappearing into an area of darkness that andrei assumed concealed a side door peering intently he managed to see a shed and a garage over to the left switching his gaze toward the house itself he noted that it had the distinctive architectureflat roof rounded corners earthcolored stuccothat hed seen almost everywhere in santa fe christmas lights hung above a wreath on the front door immediately to the left a pale light glowed behind a curtain over a small window in what was probably the kitchen to the right of the door a large window showed a living room murky except for a dwindling fire in a hearth and lights on a christmas tree farther to the right in another room a curtained window revealed the flickering illumination of what seemed to be a television determined to be thorough andrei glanced toward the roof the dim reflection of the frontdoor lights allowed him to see snow accumulating on a satellite dish he didnt study the house in an obvious way instead his trained eyes took in everything as he walked past seeming to admire the picturesque winter scene the hiss of the snow almost muffled the sound of his footsteps after twenty seconds the house was no longer in sight which also meant that he could no longer be seen from it with no more footprints to follow there wasnt any point in continuing down the lane again disappointment took hold of him stopping he assessed the situation his initial guess had probably been correct he reluctantly decided the tracks belonged to the same person but if someone had recently come back to the house wouldnt there be more lights inside was it reasonable to believe that the person who lived there had gone to bed early on christmas eve a night most americans obsessed about because of gifts they were eager to receive what time is it andrei pushed back the sleeve of his ski jacket and exposed the face on his digital watch obeying a habit from the military he was careful to shield the watch with his hand before he pressed a button that caused its red numbers to glow quickly he released the button and extinguished the glow the numbers showed if whoever lived in the house was elderly it wouldnt be out of the question for him or her to go to bed early on christmas eve andrei decided the flickering light from the television suggested that someone was in bed perhaps watching one of those sugary holiday movies like its a wonderful life the title of which always made andrei scoff a wonderful life the only true parts of that movie were the old guy losing the banks money and the rich guy wanting to control the bank so he could charge high interest rates and take peoples homes if the story had been true to life the herowhats his name james stewartwould have succeeded in killing himself when he jumped into the halffrozen river and why was he so damned skinny andrei thought did he starve himself only in america where theres so much food do people starve themselves so they can be skinny go fight rebels in chechnya on the half rations we were given youll soon change your mind about wanting to be skinny without warning the pakhans angry voice shouted through the earbud under andreis watchmans cap did you find him not yet andrei murmured into the microphone concealed on his jacket keeping his voice as low as possible when the clients learn we dont have what they paid for were searching as hard as we can if im forced to return the money i swear ill help them track you down so you told me earlier i havent forgotten ive never been disloyal to you andrei thought ive always done more than you asked i just need a little extra time he said into the microphone concealing his bitterness koshkayob you dont seem to grasp how little time you have andreis stomach hardened he resented the insult as much as he hated being threatenedbut nowhere near as much as he was furious that the pakhan had chosen to support the outsiders against him i cant talk any longer anger more than necessity made him end the transmission abruptly he turned and faced the snowhazed lane along which hed searched as he went back the way hed come he knew he needed to hurry to rejoin mikhail and yakov to search other places to make up for the time hed squandered but some instinct kept him from rushing the house appeared again this time on his right again he studied it as he passed moving closer so hed be able to see through the gloom the flickering light from the television the christmastree lights the lessening flames in the fireplace the coming and going footprints the gate the gate there was something about it something that nagged at him but he couldnt decide what it was he kept walking until once more he was out of sight from the house he stopped turned and crouched making sure his head was below the top of the fence he crept toward the gate taking pains to stay down in his stooped position the back of his neck was exposed to the chill of the falling snow nonetheless he barely registered the sensation so intent was he on the gate he shifted closer and the upright cedar limbs became larger before him there was something about them something out of place something he couldnt leave without checking reaching the gate he sank to his knees in the snow ignoring the cold that seeped through his pants he brought his face close to the gate and the bark on the limbs he gazed up toward the snow that had accumulated on their sawedoff tops some of the snow had fallen dislodged by the motion of the gate that was to be expected whoever had opened the gate might even have brushed against the snow on the top causing more to fall off brushed against the gate andrei thought he strained his eyes in the pale light that was reflected by the snowfall the gate swung inward to the left it wouldnt be unusual for someones left side to brush against the gate when going through concentrating he found a dark smear near the bolt that secured the gate excitement built in him the smear was at the level of a mans arm he had barely noticed it and almost dismissed it when hed walked past attributing it to a discoloration in the wood now electricity seemed to shoot along his nerves when he touched a gloved finger to the smear and found that some of it stuck on the leather darkcolored it was semisolid liquid on its way to being frozen in the shadows andrei couldnt distinguish the color but he had no doubt that this was blood islamic terrorists thanked allah when they found the russian mob paul in middle eastern countries alqaeda radicals dont look any different from the people around them who just want to be allowed to lead their lives in peace but if they leave their native countries and try conducting operations in the west they stand out before they could move freely among us we welcomed visitors we were innocent now middle eastern terrorists know theyll be profiled if they do anything thats even the slightest bit unusual so they need somebody else who can do the blood work for them someone who blends finding westerners to cooperate with them used to be nearly impossible after all even the most callous criminal still has an instinct not to foul his nest im not talking about love of country paul that concepts too noble for the element were talking about but nearly everyone no matter how corrupt will refuse to do something that endangers his own tiny corner of the worldhis neighborhood his street his house or apartment its basic selfpreservation except for the odessa mafia paul theyre so detached from their adopted country that they dont even care about their homes if they get paid enough to plant a dirty bomb in manhattan a bomb thats guaranteed to spread radioactive fallout to where they live in nearby brighton beach theyll just pack up and move before they detonate the bomb pay them enough and theyll do anything and its not only alqaeda theyll work for theyre also taking money from hamas theres a man outside the house cole said kagan froze in the middle of buttoning his shirt in the faint glow from the nightlight he doubted that he could be seen through the curtains that covered the kitchen window even so he moved deeper into the room his normal pulse rate was sixtyfive beats per minute he now estimated that it was one hundred and ten and getting faster chest tight he picked up his parka from the kitchen table and felt the reassuring weight of the gun in the right pocket he stopped at the archway that led into the living room what do you see a man coles voice was faint only one kagan thought no thered be more then the idea occurred to him that his hunters might have split up to cover more area or maybe this is a false alarm cole remember dont seem to pay any attention to him just keep showing interest in the snowfall im not at the window he doesnt know im watching him what do you mean im sitting in a chair thats away from the fireplace and the lights on the tree its dark here he cant see me youre sure hey im only a little kid nobody pays attention to a little kid scrunched down in a chair but i dont know how he could see me whats he doing just walking past its like he was looking at the christmas lights and the snow now hes gone maybe he is just enjoying the lights and the snow could be he lives around here we moved here at the start of the summer i dont know all the neighbors but i havent seen him before maybe hes visiting someone describe him i couldnt see him clearly hes talli saw that much big shoulders he has a cap pulled down over his ears its shaped like his head its called a watchmans cap kagan felt the shadow of death passing by what color is his coat it has snow on it but i think its dark what about his cap is that dark too its got too much snow on it i cant tell dont let the boy sense what youre feeling kagan thought thats the right thing to say cole always admit if you dont have an answer a spy once wanted to keep his job so much that he told his bosses what they wanted to hear instead of the truth it caused the world a lot of trouble which direction did the man come from the right from canyon road kagan thought cole spoke again a darkwhat did you call itwatchmans cap does one of the guys looking for you wear one wait a second here he comes again from the left now hes going back the way he came kagan wanted desperately to step into the living room to crouch and try to get a look through the window but he didnt dare risk showing himself he seems in a hurry this time cole said kagan understood whoever was out therealmost certainly andrei given coles descriptionhad followed all those footprints until the final set led him to this house but kagans trick had worked and andrei had decided that the same person had made both sets coming and going now hes angry that he wasted time hes gone again cole said thats good but keep watching in the background judy garland sang have yourself a merry little christmas the only other sounds were the crackle of a log in the fireplace and the whimper of the baby need to keep him from crying careful to hide his tension kagan turned from the archway and faced the kitchen where meredith held the child hows that mixture coming he asked meredith stood a careful distance from a pot on the stove holding the baby away from the flame im heating it but how do i feed him i dont have a bottle with a nipple on it do you have a shot glass somehow i think i can find one her voice had an edge to it kagan noticed that she frowned toward a whiskey bottle on the counter the bottle was almost empty a shot glass sat next to it i see what you mean i hope youre not going to start drinking she said not to worry kagan took the glass and stayed to the side of the sink away from the window while he used hot water to rinse the alcohol from the glass a baby can sip from something small like this no when cole was born his pediatrician told me not to offer him a cup until he was four months old actually a baby can sip from a tiny container soon after birth youve got to be making this stuff up meredith said do you really expect me to believe this is something else you learned from the world health organization it works the trick is how you do it kagan went to her and pretended to put a hand behind the baby demonstrating the technique tilt him slightly back like this keep a hand behind his head to protect his neck hold the shot glass against his upper lip dont pour thatll make him gag if you let him control how much he sips hell do fine after a wary glance toward the window kagan went over to the stove and stirred the mixture dissolving the sugar and salt the spoon scraped against the pot cole any sign of movement out there despite kagans outward calm he estimated that his pulse rate was now one hundred and twenty his arteries felt the pressure that expanded them no the boy said youre doing a good job keep watching the baby squirmed as if it might start crying kagan quickly used the spoon to dribble some of the mixture on the inside of his wrist slightly warm its ready he turned off the stove and spooned the mixture into the shot glass i filled it to the oneounce mark we can measure how much the babys drinking meredith held the baby the way kagan had shown her protecting his neck from tilting too far back here we go little fellow she took the glass from kagan does he have a name kagan didnt reply sorry she said i guess its not something i should know actually i was never told his name although kagans instinct was to avoid revealing information in a way it no longer mattered if the men outside got their hands on meredith the outcome would be brutally the same whether she knew anything about the baby or not he changed the subject youre dressed like you were going to a party the parents of a boy cole goes to school with invited us to their house meredith sounded weighed down by thoughts of what might have been will you be missed kagan asked quickly will they wonder what happened to you if they cant reach you on the phone maybe theyll become concerned enough to before ted smashed the phones he called them and claimed cole was sick ah kagans tone went flat teds a clever man yes a clever man meredith took a deep breath and looked down at the baby id forgotten what it feels like to have something this helpless in my arms thats right little fellow keep sipping i bet youre thirsty dont worry weve got plenty and its all for you not quite kagan said dehydrated from bleeding he was terribly aware of his own thirst he reached into the first aid kit opened a container of tylenol and shoved four tablets into his dry mouth crouching to prevent his silhouette from showing at the window he went back to the stove tested the saucepans handle to make sure he wouldnt burn himself and poured some of the mixture into a glass he found next to the sink he took two deep swallows and got the pills down he tasted the salt and the sugar instantly his stomach cramped aggravating the nausea produced by his wound he waited then took another swallow feeling his mouth absorb the warm fluid see anything cole it really looks like he went away the boy said from the living room keep watching anyhow it never hurts to be cautious spies cant take anything for granted i keep changing the channel on the radio you gave me but i dont hear anything maybe im not doing it right if you play video games im sure you can work that receiver the microphone in kagans pants pocket was too far from his mouth to transmit his voice if andrei happened to be listening on the frequency the team had first used those men wont talk unless they need to theres only a slight chance that youll turn to the frequency theyre using at the moment they happen to be talking but weve got to try everything youre doing fine kagan switched off the nightlight noting that meredith trusted him enough now that she didnt object concealed by the deeper shadows he opened the curtains a couple of inches through the falling snow he was able to see the upright poles of the coyote fence he watched for movement in the shadows beyond it meredith describe the layout of the house andrei crawled hurriedly through the snow along the bottom of the fence his breathing quickened as the heat of the renewed hunt dissipated the cold on his cheeks when he was far enough down the lane that he felt safe to stand he did so and peered up at a utility pole two wires led from it toward the house in the faint reflection off the snow he strained his eyes and saw that one of them was attached to an insulator on the polethat was for electricity the other wire was either for telephone service or for cable television then he remembered the satellite dish hed seen on the roof and decided that the remaining wire must be for the phone in adequate conditions his marksmanship was exceptional but now it took him four shots before a bullet connected with the thick wire at the pole and blew it apart because of the falling snow the sound suppressor on his gun was even more muffled than usual and the sound of hitting the wire wasnt enough to attract attention immediately he removed the partly empty magazine slid it into a pants pocket and shoved a full fifteenround magazine into the pistol only then did he speak to the microphone his voice an urgent whisper i found him through the earbud under his cap he heard an abrupt exhale thank god the pakhans taut voice said andrei thought it ironic that his leader who had also been raised in the atheistic soviet union would use that expression our clients are here now the pakhan said ive never seen anyone so furious how soon can you deliver the package i dont know andrei answered what pyotyr took cover in a house i need to figure how to get to him dont let him escape again the pakhans voice warned not this time hes ours i dont give a govno about him deal with him quickly the package just get me the package it troubled andrei that the pakhan felt so threatened normally he was content to provide barely adequate service if clients complained he ordered someone like andrei to set fire to their homes people who needed to employ the odessa mafia were desperate to begin with the pakhans attitude was that they ought to be grateful for any help they received but these clients were another matter the three million dollars theyd paid for a weeks workat a resort city no lesshad been too tempting for the pakhan to resist at the time hed called it easy pickings they made all the arrangements they bribed the necessary people they learned the targets schedule exactly when and where the job can be done it should have been easy for them but they cant carry out the actual mission they need us because we can blend with the santa fe crowd while theyd be spotted right away so i charged those damned arabs as much as possible accustomed to causing fear rather than being the subject of it the pakhan now understood the penalty for going into business with clients who were even more ruthless than he was andrei stepped off the lane toward a fir tree that provided a hidden vantage point from which he could watch the house did the rest of you hear he murmured to his microphone yes yakovs voice came through the earbud where are you follow the lane i took a few minutes later when he saw two heavyset men hurrying through the falling snow andrei said to the microphone im to your right by a fir tree the men paused looking in his direction there you are mikhail murmured good we wouldnt want to shoot you by mistake grinning at the joke he and yakov took cover behind the tree and assessed the house how many people are inside yakovs question could barely be heard no way to tell andrei replied softly someone walked off and made footprints earlier but those are pyotyrs footprints that go through the gate toward the house how do you know blood on the gate ah theres lightprobably from a televisionin the room on the far right andrei pointed maybe theres someone in the house someone who isnt aware that pyotyr snuck in or maybe the house is empty and pyotyr turned on the television to make it seem the place is occupied a lot of maybes mikhail said he lost his cell phone but if hes in there hell use the land line to call the police i shot the telephone wire andrei told him he could have phoned before you did that or maybe theres a cell phone in the house then why havent the police arrived why dont we hear sirens yakov shrugged its christmas eve on canyon road the crowd would make it difficult for police cars to reach here but we cant just leave or rush the house because we think the police might be coming andrei insisted if we screw up wed better run and keep running wed never be able to stopbecause we know our clients and the pakhan will never stop hunting us and my family andrei thought if the pakhan cant find me hell go after my wife and daughters then what do you suggest mikhail wanted to know well approach the house from three sides andrei decided pyotyr cant defend it from every angle at least two of us are bound to get in those are pretty good odds as long as im not the one who gets shot yakov said pyotyrs wounded and weak from blood loss andrei countered his aim will be affected theres a high probability that all of us will get out of this alive high probability doesnt fill me with confidence whoever goes in from the front takes the greatest risk how do we decide who the two of you sound like old women ill take the front andrei said irritably they stared at him pyotyr knows im the one he has the most reason to fear ill show myself in front of the house hell be distracted that gives the two of you a better chance to get inside from different directions if we synchronize the attack precisely we have company yakov warned andrei pivoted toward the lane at first he worried that police were arriving but the figure he saw was alone plodding through the snow a man wearing a buttoned palegray coat and a hat with builtin earflaps he walked with his head so low that he looked weary the holiday blues andrei wondered or maybe hes just protecting his face from the snow a further thought occurred to him maybe this is a policeman putting on some kind of act if so he wont be alone hell be setting up a trap andrei thought of the pakhan of the clients of pyotyr of his wife and daughters the man trudged closer angling toward the opposite side of the lane toward the gate ill take the risk andrei decided were going to santa fe for a baby yes pyotyr for the child of peace i dont understand dont you read the newspapers dont you watch the news on television the news bah everything they tell us here is propaganda the same as it was back in russia then youve never heard of ahmed hassan is that the childs name the fathers hes an obstetrician andrei my english isnt hassan delivers babies hes a surgeon who once specialized in treating palestinians who were shot in gunfights with israelis over the years he operated on two thousand combat patients but nothing got better he said so he changed his specialty and became a baby doctor thousands of children are in the world because of him far more than all the gunshot patients he treated as he tells his followers he chose life instead of death hope instead of hate his followers you make hassan sound like some kind of religious leader in a way he is although he doesnt have any religious authority his speeches are so impassioned that a great many people are inspired by his sheer presence he speaks like a prophet and attracts more disciples every day they believe he has a vision he preaches that war between palestinians and israelis will destroy the region and the rest of the world with it manythose who are tired of the decades of killing and destructionagree with him the children hassan reminds them think of our children if we truly love them if we treasure them as much as we claim to well give them a future and create a lasting peace peace you used that word to describe the baby yes pyotyr the child of peace hassans child his enemies are paying us three million dollars to steal it for them the layout of the house meredith sounded troubled why do you need to know that in the shadowy kitchen kagan saw her outline sit tensely straighter as she held the tiny glass to the babys lips no special reason he answered just a standard precaution a way to fill the time precaution so i can anticipate anticipate what you heard cole the mans gone probably the thing is its always a good idea to have a backup plan in the meager light kagan couldnt see merediths eyes but he was certain that she studied him nervously the silhouette of her head nodded toward a dark archway next to a recessed sidebyside refrigeratorfreezer at the back of the kitchen the furnace and laundry room are through that arch she said theres also a small bathroom just a toilet and sink any windows back there no kagan was grateful for that small blessing what about the rest of the house cole said his room is in front yes in front theres the living room a bathroom and then coles room what about in back teds office is behind the living room the master bedroom is next to that across from coles room yes at the end of a hallway that divides that part of the house how many outside doors do you have kagan noticed that merediths voice wavered as the logic behind his questions became impossible to ignore three the front door the side door here in the kitchen and one through teds office it leads to a back garden what about an outside entrance to the basement there isnt a basement most santa fe houses are built on slabs another thing not to worry about kagan thought attic not with the flat roof the door in teds office is it wood or sliding glass wood at least they cant break through easily kagan thought is it locked yes i checked it when i thought we were leaving the house to go to the party then i checked it again after ted left what about the other doors kagan went over and examined the one in the kitchen confirming that it was secured after ted lost his temper believe me all the doors are locked kagan took another wary look out the kitchen window he wasnt always like this meredith said how so kagan encouraged her to keep talking in the hope that it would distract her he knows he has a drinking problem when we moved here from los angeles he was determined to make a new start in fact thats why we came here last spring he visited santa fe for a business conference the night he returned all he could talk about were the mountains and the light and how the airs so clean you can see forever he kept saying the states called the land of enchantment i understood we definitely needed some magic so you moved here kagan prompted her two months later in june we were living in this house on the fourth of july i remember there was a pancake breakfast on the plaza thousands of people enjoying themselves we sat under the trees and watched musicians playing bluegrass songs on the bandstand people were dancing having a wonderful time ted looked at me with a big smile and said its independence day i promise twice a week he went to alcoholics anonymous meetings we spent a lot of time as a family we hiked in the ski basin we drove across the valley to los alamos to see where they invented the atomic bomb we explored the cliff ruins in bandolier canyon spanish market indian market fiesta it was the best summer of my life in september ted had some business pressures that stopped him from spending time with us i didnt complain the bills need to be paid i did my part and got a job at one of the museums at thanksgiving he brought home a bottle of wine i must have looked upset because he said hey its not even red wine its white its nothing ive been working seven days a week whats a turkey dinner without a little white wine and now a month later kagan said letting his voice trail off new location same old problems i guess theres no such thing as a fresh start after an awkward pause meredith changed the topic the babys asleep she set the glass on the kitchen table and carried the child through the dark archway next to the refrigeratorfreezer kagan heard her groping around back there and wondered what she was doing something scraped on the floor merediths shadow reappeared he saw her backing into the kitchen dragging a wicker hamper this was in the laundry room i put towels inside it she said its almost as good as a crib she set the baby in the hamper and covered him with one of the towels in the laundry room is there space in a corner behind the washer and dryer kagan asked with room enough for you to crouch yes meredith sounded puzzled if something happens take the baby and hide there the metal on the appliances might protect you protect me from kagan turned toward the archway to the living room cole are you listening yes protect me from bullets meredith asked its a bad idea for everyone to stay together kagan said that makes you all one target cole if something happens is there a place where you can hide the boy was silent while he thought about it theres a big television cabinet in here i think i can squeeze into the space behind it his voice was unsteady if youre forced to do that lie on the floor you need to visualize what i want you to do if you see it in your mind if you rehearse it in your imagination and understand what you need to do you wont be confused when the time comes if something happens im not afraid good i was scared when my dad hit my mom but now yes now i feel numb from his vantage point behind the fir tree andrei watched the man plod through the falling snow his shoulders were hunched his head was down within moments the man was close enough for andrei to conclude that his first impression had been correcthe looked weary as if the weight of the world were on him he glanced up only once just enough to get his bearings and angle left toward the fence and the gate sir andrei stepped from the shadows and intercepted the man before the two of them could be seen from the house im a police officer police the man looked startled he was thin about six feet tall his hands were crammed into his coat pockets the faint light reflecting off the snow made it difficult for andrei to gauge the mans age any closer than midthirties he had a mustache an oval face and a haggard expression his breath smelled of whiskey but not strongly any drinking hed done had been a couple of hours earlier what are the police doing here the man came out of his gloomy mood straightening with concern do you live in that residence andrei pointed yes but whats your name sir brody ted brody whats this all about whats going on theres been an incident in the neighborhood incident do you know how many people are in your house mr brody my wife and son why do you my god has something happened to them mr brody please just answer my questions how old is your son twelve but describe the house for me draw a diagram in the snow diagram i dont understand the rooms the windows the outside doors thats very important show me the location of every outside door jesus are you telling me someone broke in brody pushed past heading for the gate andrei clamped a strong hand on his shoulder and tugged him back down the lane stop that i need to brody struggled that hurts get your hand off me keep your voice down andrei warned you dont want to let him know were out here him andrei hauled brody farther back dont raise your voice we were chasing a fugitive he entered your house before we could stop him then i need to get in there i need to andrei stepped in front of him and grabbed both his shoulders he spoke forcefully but at a low register his face close to brodys pay attention mr brody if you go inside youll only give the fugitive another hostage dont put your family at greater risk but andrei cut him off the best thing you can do is help us do you have a cell phone if not ill lend you mine cell phone why theres a chance the fugitive doesnt know we followed him i want you to call your wife and try to learn whats happening in there what room she and your son are in any details that might help the swat team when it gets here even though andrei knew the phone line wasnt working he needed to find out if there was a cell phone in the house swat team brody moaned why did i let this happen what have i done i should never have left my family calm down mr brody ill rehearse the phone conversation with you we need to assume that the fugitive will be listening when your wife talks on the phone ill teach you to ask questions in a way that wont alarm him weve got to know where he is in the wait a second brody stared past andrei whats wrong those men over there who are they brody pointed toward the fir tree the other officers on the team detectives hardy and grant mikhail and yakov each held up an arm in greeting doing their best to look like they belonged there about the call youre going to make its very important that you seem natural that you dont let your voice indicate how worried you are andrei explained the best thing to do is dont bother its useless pardon me theres no point in calling no point in but why the phones arent working brody said andrei felt his muscles tense did he notice the telephone wire i shot down he prompted brody for more information theyre not working what do you mean theyre broken you mean the snow broke the telephone lines no i mean the phones brody seemed annoyed that andrei couldnt grasp some obvious concept every phone in the house how could they all be broken brody wiped snow off his mustache but didnt answer avoiding the question sir we cant afford a delay andrei said the safety of your wife and son depends on you how did the phones get broken i did it what are you talking about i smashed the phones with a hammer brody sounded exasperated andrei couldnt help expressing surprise just when he thought hed heard everything someone came up with something he could never have imagined why on earth would you smash the phones so my wife couldnt call you call me andrei shook his head in bafflement you the police brody stared down at his boots i lost my temper the last word was tinged with despair my wife and i had an argument i cant remember what it was about probably my drinking i but why were you afraid shed call the police because i hit her brody kept his gaze down his shame made him whisper ah andrei said so this wasnt something unimaginable after all its the first time that ever happened after i realized what id done i spent the last couple of hours waiting to get sober enough to come back and beg her to forgive me brody suddenly looked up this is all my fault if i hadnt left the house id have been there when the guy broke in id have been able to but dont you see that gives you a natural excuse to call her what do you mean you can tell her youre sorry and find out whats happening its so obvious an excuse the fugitive wont be suspicious are you sure you smashed all the phones doesnt your wife have a cell phone i took it her phones in my pocket does your son have a phone no andrei tried not to show his elation there wasnt any need to worry that pyotyr might have been able to summon the police before the telephone line had been shot down with no way to make a call pyotyr was completely isolated draw the diagram of the house pyotyr hassans rivals tried to kill him several times the last thing they want is peace theres too much money to be made setting off car bombs in markets and sniping at israeli soldiers on patrol paper bags of cash are distributed weekly from donations made around the world millions collected from sympathizers who think this is about land or religion when its also about men who have a very specific occupationto cause violence and death for decades its been the only profession theyve known if there were peace where would their paper bags of cash come from even with hassans amazing effect on his followers its far from certain that he can achieve peace nonetheless his rivals fear the astonishing growth of his influence and want to guarantee his failure when he learned that his wife was pregnant hassan became so afraid for her safety that he sent her to the united states since july shes lived secretly in santa fe which has a small muslim population loyal to hassans cause in november he made a secret trip here to monitor the last stages of her pregnancy and to deliver the baby but he regretted sending his wife into hiding he realized that he couldnt ask his followers to make sacrifices if he and his family werent prepared to make them as well as soon as the baby is strong enough to travel hassan plans to return to the gaza strip he plans to stand in front of his followers and hold up his child as a symbol of hope he plans to call it the child of peace and to say that every parent has a child of peace his rivals want their weekly payments of cash so much that theyll do anything to stop him from gaining more sympathizers in the darkness kagan searched a cupboard under the stove and found another pot he filled it with water put it on the stove and turned on the gas burner why are you boiling water meredith wanted to know theres still enough mixture for the baby sometimes boiling water comes in handy for what does your wound need cleaning again do you have any tin foil he asked why would you need looking baffled meredith gave up and pointed toward the left side of the stove the middle drawer kagan opened the drawer pulled out a box tore off two pieces of tin foil and crumpled them slightly what about quickdrying glue he asked despite her confusion this time she didnt question him but merely said one drawer down thanks kagan pulled out the drawer and was pleased to find a large plastic tube of glue almost full he went over to the microwave which sat on the counter to the right of the stove that counter was next to the kitchens side door he opened the microwave put in the two crumpled pieces of tin foil set the tube of glue between them and adjusted the timer for two minutes wait meredith warned it isnt safe to start the microwave with those things inside just leave it like that with the timer set kagan pivoted the microwave so that it faced the side door his parka lay on the counter he took his gun from the righthand pocket the inside of which hed partially sliced open to accommodate the sound suppressor on the end of his weapon even in the shadows it was obvious that meredith stared kagan imagined how the gun appeared to her the cylinder attached to the barrel making the weapon look grotesque you had that with you all the time she asked there didnt seem a right moment to tell you you could have killed us whenever you wanted the fact that i didnt threaten you with it ought to tell you theres a big difference between me and the men outside if theyre even out there any longer meredith said kagan let her take refuge in that thought i dont like guns she told him im not crazy about them either but on occasion they can be helpful in fact we could use another one does your husband have a hunting rifle or a shotgun teds not a hunter some people keep a gun in the house in case of a breakin not us no guns especially with cole in the house meredith started to say something else and not with kagan imagined what she had almost said not with teds drinking problem he reflexively reached toward the left pocket of his parka but all he touched was torn fabric hed started the night with two spare ammunition magazines in there but along with his cell phone theyd fallen out when the pocket had been ripped open during his escape all i have is the ammunition in the pistol he thought fifteen rounds in the magazine plus one in the chamber not much where are your aerosol cans he asked window cleaner furniture polish anything like that again meredith didnt ask questions the cupboard above the refrigerator kagan opened the cupboard and took down four pressurized cans he set two of them next to the kitchen door the baby whimpered holding the two remaining cans kagan went over to the laundry hamper and peered down tensely hoping the baby wouldnt start to cry hes just dreaming meredith said babies dream didnt the world health organization tell you about that kagan looked at her sorry she said averting her gaze humors always welcome its good for morale again kagan peered down at the baby weird how the mind plays tricks tricks on canyon road when i was running from the men outside the baby kicked me from time to time i was lightheaded enough that i almost had the sense he was guiding me telling me which way to go like he wanted me to come here as you said you were lightheaded in the background rosemary clooney sang ill be home for christmas kagan drew a breath guess id better get to work he shoved his gun under his belt stooped and crept into the living room the fireplace was on the left its southwestern design similar to one in the lobby of kagans hotel the hearth was a foot off the floor the firebox had an oval opening and curved sides the flames in it had dwindled to embers making it less likely that hed be seen his gun digging into his right side he glanced to the right in the middle of the shadowy room a large leather chair faced the window how are you managing cole its hard staring at something this long the boys voice came from the other side of the chairs back i still cant get anything on the radio youre doing a great job ill take your place soon the christmas tree stood against the far wall staying low kagan went over and unplugged the lights its late enough he decided turning off the tree wont seem unusual the front door was to the right of the window he crept over and made sure it was locked then he set the other two aerosol cans next to it he turned toward the rear of the living room the rosemary clooney song came from an open door to the right of the fireplace inside an office he found three computer monitors and keyboards on a table in front of him matching computer towers were under it despite the darkness he had the impression of many shelves filled with electronics meredith why is there so much equipment ted designs websites for corporations sometimes he has three different layouts showing simultaneously kagan felt a spark of hope then we can access the internet we can send emails to get help no ted put an electronic lock on the internet access i dont have the password kagans excitement turned cold ted thinks of everything he saw an ipod connected to a docking station and a set of speakers that was the source of the music now rosemary clooney was singing that she might only be able to dream about going home for christmas when he turned off the speakers the house became silent except for the crackle of embers in the fireplace and the faint noise of the television in coles bedroom down the hallway at the back of the office kagan confirmed that the outside door was locked the curtains were shut concealing him as he shoved a table against the window the table extended partway against the door and provided a barricade his wounded arm aching he picked up a chair and set it next to the monitors on the table intruders could break the window and get past the obstacles but not quickly not without making noise and not without the risk of injuring themselves as kagan worked he couldnt keep from worrying that if meredith still distrusted him she might use this opportunity to take cole and run from the house at this moment she and the boy might be opening the side door he leaned from the office and glanced to the right toward the kitchen but merediths silhouette remained in view she was looking down at the baby in the hamper maybe shell do it in a little while he thought if im out of sight long enough she might find the nerve to take the boy and run and the babyshell probably take the baby he could only pray that she wouldnt surrender to her fears and get all of them killed i could do it now meredith thought in the darkness of the kitchen the only light came from the flame on the stove and the clock on the microwave oven she thought of how the stranger had angled the microwave toward the side door how hed put two pieces of crumpled tinfoil in there along with the tube of quickdrying glue she still had a vivid mental image of the grotesque longbarreled gun hed shoved under his belt it made her shiver table legs scraped in teds office for some reason the stranger was moving the furniture blocking the window she wondered while hes busy i can do this i can get cole i can grab the baby we can run i dont know anything about this man maybe he stole the baby from its parents maybe the men looking for him are the police maybe whoever shot him was a policeman i can do it she repeated to herself i can do it now peering down at the baby she imagined how she could go into the living room and put her finger over her lips to warn cole to be quiet she could motion for cole to follow her in a rush she could pick up the baby open the door and run with cole into the night there wouldnt be a chance to get coats in the falling snow she could hold the baby against her using the blanket to shield him she wouldnt be able to risk stopping to ask a neighbor for help that might give the stranger time to catch them she and cole would need to run all the way to the crowd on canyon road wed be safe there she thought can cole run that far maybe we wont be able to move quickly enough she wondered if the stranger would shoot the thought made her flinch as she imagined the agony of a bullet slamming into her back or maybe she wouldnt feel anything maybe the bullet would kill her no she decided the one thing she knew for certain was that the baby was important to this man the way he talked about it the way he looked at it he wouldnt do anything to put it in danger did it seem logical then to think he was a kidnapper she heard him making other noises in teds office cutting at something but what as the cutting sounds persisted she thought nows my chance she took a step toward the living room preparing to cross to where cole watched the window but then she remembered the way the man had looked at her and said i promise ted wont hit you again thered been something about the steadiness of his eyes the reassuring tone of his voice the firmness of his expressiontheyd convinced meredith that he meant what he said dont you like surprise presents the man had asked help the baby and i promise ted wont hit you again he hadnt said help me hed said help the baby no the man would never do anything to injure the baby meredith decided we can run without fearing hell shoot in teds office the cutting sounds were now almost sawing sounds this is our chance meredith thought but what if hes telling the truth what if there really are men outside wholl do anything to get the baby if cole and i leave the house we might run into them i cant risk it i cant put coles life in danger i promise ted wont hit you again as much as she was certain that the stranger meant to keep that promise she was certain about something else because of coles short right leg adults sometimes treated her son as if he wasnt smart or as if he wasnt even in the room with them but the stranger had looked cole directly in the eyes and had spoken to him as if he were much older than twelve hed trusted cole to watch the window hed trusted him to listen for voices on the twoway radio the respectful way he treated cole left meredith with no doubt that he would do everything in his power to make sure no one hurt her son kagans pistol wasnt the only weapon he carried on the outside of his right pants pocket a black metal clip was hardly noticeable against the black fabric the clip was attached to an emerson folding knife concealed inside his pocket an arrangement that made it easy for him to grip the knife without fumbling when he pulled it out a hook on the back of the blade was designed to catch on the edge of the pocket and swing the knife open as hed learned too well there were numerous occasions when the ability to open a knife with only one hand could save his life he went over to a lamp on the office table unplugged it and pressed the blade against the electrical cord he had no trouble slicing the rubber sheath but the copper wires resisted and he needed to press down hard sawing more than cutting he ignored the pain in his wounded arm from the effort of holding the wire against the table after he freed the cord he tied it to the leg of a chair and stretched it calfhigh across the office securing it around a heavy box on the bottom of a shelf fortunately the cord was dark if an intruder broke through the window and shoved past the obstacles on the table hed be so fixated on the open door to the living room that he might not notice the trip cord in the shadows meredith you said there was a back garden when kagan heard her voice in the kitchen he was relieved to know that shed remained in the house a small one the dry air at this altitude makes it difficult to grow things without a lot of water is the garden easy to get to are there gates to the side no someone could just walk around to the back or climb a neighbors fence kagan grasped at a thought maybe the neighbors would notice a prowler and call the police not tonight meredith said for christmas eve the family to the left is visiting a sick relative down in albuquerque the couple to the right loves to play blackjack they went to one of the indian casinos kagan remembered driving north to santa fe from the big airport in albuquerque it had seemed that there was an indian casino every twenty miles the blackjack dealers are probably dressed as santa claus but somehow i doubt the pit bosses think its better to give than to receive he said he hoped the attempt at a joke would help calm merediths nerves then his concern about the garden in back made him remember his hallucination when he approached the house meredith i thought i saw a flower growing in the snow outside you did see a flower in winter kagan worked to keep his tone casual to relax her hows that possible why didnt it freeze its called a christmas rose i never heard of it feeling pressure in his temples kagan crouched stepped from the office and turned to the left shifting along the hallway he passed a bathroom on the right then opposite coles room he entered the master bedroom despite the darkness he managed to see two windows one straight ahead above the bed the other to the right of it the curtains were closed shadowy suitcases lay on the side of the bed planning to go somewhere kagan asked away from my husband as soon as canyon road was opened to traffic tonight i bet you wish youd gone earlier then id have missed all this christmas eve fun yeah this is quite a party he set a chair on the bed then put a side table and two lamps next to the suitcases adding obstacles that might holdback someone who broke through the window above the bed he pushed a high bureau in front of the other window partially blocking the glass making it difficult for someone to climb through next he went to the remaining lamp unplugged it and sawed its electrical cord free he attached it to the leg of a cabinet next to the door and stretched it across to a dressing table rigging another trip cord in a bathroom off the bedroom a nightlight revealed a pressurized can of hairspray and another of shaving soap leaving the bedroom he set the cans at the end of the corridor when he crept into coles room a small television showed bing crosby crooning white christmas to soldiers at an inn while a back wall opened and snow fell on a bridge across a stream a horsedrawn sleigh went past everyone looked happy kagan switched off the television coles room had only one window facing the front of the house kagan pushed a bureau in front of it but the bureau wasnt as tall as the one in the master bedroom and he needed to put the television on top in order to block the window he rigged a third trip cord then he pulled drawers from coles bureau and set them along the bedroom floor he took the drawers from the bureau in the master bedroom and did the same he took the drawers from the dressing table and placed them along the hallway in an uneven pattern kagans gun dug harder into his side as he crept back into the kitchen the flame under the pot of water provided a minimal amount of light you said it was a christmas rose approaching the limits of his strength kagan eased onto a chair and took several ragged breaths are you all right meredith asked couldnt be better he lied tell me about the christmas rose you really want to know believe me i wouldnt ask if i didnt well its a type of evergreen meredith said kagan nodded encouraging her to continue in europe some areas grow it easily in winter it adjusts to the cold and often blooms around christmastime clumps of large white flowers then i wasnt hallucinating theres even a legend about it tell me a little girl saw the gifts that the wise men had given the baby jesus gold frankincense and myrrh and kagan wanted to keep her talking the little girl wept because she didnt have anything of her own to give then an angel appeared brushed snow from the ground and touched the exposed soil the little girl noticed that where her tears had fallen white flowers grew now she had something to give the baby a christmas rose kagan gathered the energy to stand keeping a careful distance from the kitchen window he looked for shadows moving in the falling snow white flowers thats what i saw in los angeles i liked to garden meredith continued id heard about christmas roses but id never been able to grow them when we moved here that new start i told you about was on my mind and i decided to try again a clerk at a local plant nursery said i was wasting my time because theyre not suited for the thin rocky soil we have here but i guess i thought that if i could get one to grow it would be a sign something to show that ted and i really had put our troubles behind us not exactly a miracle but kind of and the christmas rose really did bloom it merediths voice dropped im sorry kagan said i guess its just a stubborn flower tomorrow cole and i will move out the significance of the word seemed to strike her tomorrow allow her to hope kagan thought in the morning ill help you as snow kept falling brody bent forward and used a gloved finger to draw the diagram of the house coles room is in front on the right theres a bathroom next to it he indicated a door in a hallway then theres the living room andrei mikhail and yakov stood next to brody studying the shadowy lines in the snow and in back andrei prompted him master bedroom on the right brody said it has a bathroom you can reach only from the master bedroom then theres my officein back of the living room the kitchens on the left as i face the house whats behind it andrei asked a laundry room and another bathroom lots of bathrooms andrei thought even after having lived in the united states for ten years he still hadnt gotten used to all the bathrooms when he was a boy he and his mother had shared one with six other families show us where every window is brody did so in the back andrei said is there anything one of our team can stand on to look inside the house he might be able to get a sense of whats happening in there brody indicated the middle of the back of the house theres a brick patio with an overhang we have a barbecue grill and a metal table with metal chairs someone could easily move a chair to a window and stand on it good now show us where every outside door is brody added to the diagram when the swat team gets here theyre not just going to charge in i hope if theres shooting meredith and cole might dont worry our men are professionals they dont shoot randomly they make sure theyve got the correct target and even then they dont shoot unless its absolutely necessary if anything happens to my wife and son what did this guy do he held up a liquor store you mean hes got a gun please keep your voice down mr brody yes we suspect hes armed brody groaned if i hadnt lost my temperif i hadnt left them alone a thought made him straighten maybe hell listen to reason maybe you can negotiate and stop this from getting out of control thats hard to do without a phone but there might be another possibility brody stepped toward him what its risky tell me what it is it could be that i was wrong andrei began what do you mean wrong about what not letting you go inside brody shook his head in confusion but you said that if i went in there i wouldnt do any good id just become another hostage that was before you told me the phones arent working we need to negotiate with him and youre the perfect person for that youve got every reason to walk up to the house when your wife explains who you are the gunman wont suspect youre working with us detective hardy will equip you with a miniature microphone and earbud earbud a tiny earplug that works as a radio receiver the microphone will allow us to hear everything you say in there and maybe what the gunman says through the earbud ill be able to give you instructions about what things i want you to notice by now he probably rigged some kind of defense system booby traps it would be natural for you to show surprise if you saw anything unusual your questions wouldnt arouse his suspicion thatll give the swat team an idea of what to expect if they need to go in go in brody looked alarmed again you mean theyll break down the doors and maybe it wont come to that andrei spread his hands in a reassuring way seeking to calm him youre a smart man you might be able to persuade him to allow you and your family to leave brody let the thought work on him yeah he sounded hopeful i can try to make him listen to reason exactly but what if he wont agree i always have a backup plan in that case if he wont let you and your family go the microphone and the earbud will give me a chance to negotiate directly with him brody seemed paralyzed by the dilemma finally he asked you really think this can work the suspect has numerous arrests for robbery but hes never shot anyone i dont know why hed be stupid enough to start now theres a good chance to bring this to a successful conclusion the question is are you willing to do your best to save your wife and son my best to save them hell im the reason theyre in danger if i hadnt gotten drunk and lost my temper wed all behaving a good time at a party andrei put a consoling hand on brodys shoulder then maybe its time to make things right pyotyr the day after christmas hassan his wife and his newborn son will use a private jet to fly back to the middle east as a present to his wife thoughthe last luxury shell have for a long timehes arranged for his family to spend four days in a suite at a hotel on santa fes plaza the baby has three bodyguards and a nursemaid with the child well protected the wife will perhaps feel less nervous about leaving the hotel and going out to view the famed seasonal decorations in the city santa fe is the capital of new mexico at eight pm on christmas eve hassan and his wife will be driven to a reception at the governors mansion fifteen blocks away there amid numerous television cameras hell make an impassioned speech about his goals in the middle east even though hes a muslim hell use christmas eve to argue for mutual understanding and tolerance hell use his exceptional speaking ability to talk about the child of peace who happens to be his son but who represents every palestinian child hell tell the world that hes taking the newborn baby back to the middle east as a symbol of his hope for the future of all children in the region hell argue passionately that if people truly love their children theyll do everything possible to demand a lasting truce pyotyr what hassan doesnt realize is that although the infants bodyguards are loyal the nursemaid works for his rivals who havent the faintest interest in peace all they want is to stay in the violence business that makes them so very much moneymore than you or i could ever imagine at tomorrow evening the nursemaid will free the dead bolts on two of the suites doors shell tape a strip of plastic against the side of each door so that the latches cant seat themselves in the door frames and act as further locks while hassan and his wife are away at the governors mansion well enter the suite shoot the guards and grab the baby kagan gripped the kitchen table and pushed himself to his feet cole ill take your place now he drank more of the mixture that meredith had prepared tasting the salt and the sugar the nowtepid fluid trickledown his dry throat his stomach absorbed it without the nausea hed experienced earlier just give me enough strength to keep functioning he thought not sure to whom he directed the words in the dark living room he crept to the leather chair when coles thin form slid away kagan eased into it the leather creaking he set the pistol on his lap felt its comforting weight and studied the window the christmas lights over the wreath outside the front door illuminated some of the area beyond the two leafless trees the coyote fence was vaguely visible its waisthigh cedar posts contrasting with the snow but past it the lane was hard to distinguish if not for the threat that lurked out there the view would have been comparable to what kagan had noticed a little while ago on the television in coles room bing crosby singing white christmas while snow fell on a beautiful scene he suddenly realized that the boy had remained standing beside him is he staring at the gun in my lap is it making him more afraid i need the boy sounded selfconscious to go to the kagan relaxed slightly thankful that the boy wasnt panicking because of the gun better use the toilet near the laundry room he said i boobytrapped the hallway it might be hard to get to those other bathrooms kagan couldnt remember when hed last relieved his bladder that he didnt feel pressure in it troubled him his wound had dehydrated him more than he realized when youre finished come back to the living room okay you bet the last thing i want is to be by myself bring your baseball bat hang on to it kagan noticed a bigscreen television cabinet in the left front corner cole had referred to it earlier keep imagining how youll crawl behind that cabinet and stay low if anything happens maybe i wont need to cole said thats what im hoping things are beginning to look in our favor but as i said spies never take anything for granted it could be could be what i dont think i want to be a spy cole said at the moment i dont want to be one either kagan listened to the sound of the boys uneven footsteps as he went across the brick floor and entered the kitchen meredith yes her voice came softly through the archway please bring the baby in here and sit on the floor next to him be ready to rush him into the laundry room if you hear anyone trying to break into the house if she said but maybe they wont come thats right maybe well have just a quiet christmas eve all the while kagan spoke he kept his gaze on the view beyond the window concentrating on the fence and the lane he thought of the man out there with whom hed pretended to have a friendship did i fool you andrei are you searching for me near canyon road when you dont find me will you return here to take another look i was a frequent guest in your home many times i ate dinner with your wife and daughters you invited me to help celebrate your wifes birthday once when you were drunk you called me brother even the guns we carry are identical millimeter glocks that were part of a load of weapons the pakhan sent us to pick up from a gun dealer in maryland we testfired them at the dealers range we kept tying each other for the number of head shots we scored because i betrayed you because i made a fool of you i know youll never stop hunting me if not tonight then tomorrow or another day youll find me that much im sure of kagan remembered the many missions he and andrei had conducted with renewed selfloathing he recalled the violence hed been forced to inflict on his victims in order to win andreis confidence because of the secrets hed learned and the plots hed uncoveredmissile launchers plastic explosives infectious materials and other terrorist weapons being smuggled into the countryhed saved many innocent lives but he couldnt shut out the memory of the clatter of the teeth hed pulled from the restaurant owner and dropped on the floor of the homes hed burned of the women hed beaten while andrei and the pakhan had watched meredith and cole are as innocent as any of the other people i saved theyre in danger because of me if anything happens to them kagans thoughts were interrupted by the flush of a toilet behind the kitchen it sounded loud in the stillness he heard cole limp into the living room and sit on the floor next to the nowdark christmas tree the baseball bat scraped against the floor when he set it down do you like to play baseball cole i cant with this leg then why do you have the bat my dad gave it to me for my birthday he hoped id grow enough that i might be able to adjust to my leg and play after a while he stopped trying but i like to imagine a different scrape came from the wicker basket as meredith pulled it into the living room and sat next to it kagan heard her settle against a wall the baby made another whimpering noise and became silent again good baby kagan thought please dont cry cole i saw presents under the tree i guess so is there anything special youre hoping for for my dad to stop drinking well when we get out of this ill talk to him the when was deliberately chosen a projection into the future a further way to make them optimistic he wont listen the boy said youd be surprised im a very persuasive guy when i mentioned the presents i thought maybe there was something special that youd like to open this is a holiday after all what do you think meredith she didnt respond for a moment yes open something cole she said quietly theres no reason to wait but cole didnt reach for anything cole kagan prompted i guess im not in the mood sure i understand well if you change your mind despite the apprehension that coursed through him kagans eyelids felt heavy the exhaustion caused by his wound was taking its toll meredith maybe you could make some coffee caffeinated if you have it with sugar i can use the sugar he heard her crawl into the kitchen cole did i see a creche on a table next to the tree a creche a manger scene little figures of jesus mary and joseph donkeys lambs and other animals that would be in a stable the shepherds yeah theres one on that table cole said the three kings you forgot to mention them theyre next to the shepherds the three kings yes i mustnt forget them theyre hardly mentioned in the gospels but theyre more important than most people realize in the dark kagans fatigue settled over him at the same time his heart pounded at an unnerving rate hammering in his ears draining more energy it was all he could do to stop his lungs from heaving in a desperate need to take in air ever deeper and faster wearing him down further he used the gunfighters rhythm of holding his breath for three counts inhaling slowly for three counts holding his breath for three counts and exhaling slowly for three counts the irony was that hed soon need the coffee hed asked meredith to make that without a stimulant hed eventually run out of adrenaline and crash cant let meredith and cole know whats happening to my body need to keep distracting them he thought the three kings his memory took him back fourteen years to the rocky mountain industrial academy the covert espionage training facility hed attended in the mountains outside fort collins colorado he was reminded of something hed learned from one of his instructors robert mccaddam a legendary spymaster who according to rumor had once been a jesuit priest mccaddam who was seventyfive at the time enjoyed finding implications of espionage in all sorts of situations around christmas he was fond of standing next to a fireplace lighting his pipe and teaching what he called the true story of the season cole id like to tell you a story will you listen itll put us in the christmas spirit what kind of story cole sounded doubtful that anything could put him in the christmas spirit its about the three kings kagan bit his lip to ignore the pain in his stiffening arm but the first thing you need to understand is they werent really kings then what were they youll be surprised part three the magi he stared out the window looking for movement in the falling snow cole did you ever read the nativity story in the bible the boy was silent or maybe you heard someone reading that part of matthews gospel out loud in church kagan suggested im afraid its been a long time since we went to church in the kitchen meredith kept her voice low as she made coffee well it cant be any longer than when i went to church last kagan replied that wasnt the truthhe said it only to keep bonding with them that afternoon hed spent an hour in santa fes cathedral studying a manger display his mind in a turmoil trying to decide what to do the reference to the socalled three kings is very small just a couple of dozen sentences thats amazing when you consider how much has been written about them ever since to understand what the kings really were you need to realize that matthews gospel was written in either hebrew or greek over the years it was translated into a lot of other languages changes crept in in english the word kings didnt show up until centuries later when language experts try to get a sense of the original words the most likely translation is astrologers or magi his mouth dry from stress and dehydration kagan listened to meredith pouring water into a coffeemaker in the kitchen to call them astrologers makes sense because they claimed to be following a star but i prefer to call them magi does that word sound familiar to you cole not exactly the words magic and magician are related to it as kagan heard cole breathe with the beginning of interest he leaned forward concentrating on something that seemed to shift in the haze beyond the fence but he decided it was only his imagination or hoped it was the gospel says they came from the east if you look at a map and consider what was happening at that time the country they likely came from was persia these days its called iran have you heard of iran cole sometimes when mom and dad watch the news on television its a country thats had a lot of influence on history today theres plenty of tension and violence associated with it two thousand years ago the situation wasnt much different basically persia wanted to control the area around it and that included israel the country where jesus would soon be born the reason the persians didnt invade israel was that the roman empire claimed israel as one of its territories to attack israel was the same as attacking rome and that was a bad idea the persians sometimes crossed the border and raided villages trying to make roman soldiers chase them to lure them into an ambush but the persians didnt have the resources for an allout assault so they tried another tactic the oldest and most reliable much more effective than a battle they sent in spies spies cole asked again kagan frowned toward what seemed to be a shadow moving within the snowfall but the moment he focused on that area beyond the fence the shadow dissolved like a mirage the magi were priests with tremendous political influence the modern iranian word for magi would probably be ayatollahs thats a name you hear a lot in the news although in ancient times the magi were supposed to have secret powerful knowledge that amounted to magic matthews gospel doesnt mention a specific number of magi who crossed into israel traditionally there are three because in the gospel they bring three gifts to the baby jesus under the circumstances it would have been foolish for more than three to go on this journey the smaller the number the better they didnt dare attract attention kagan smelled the coffee brewing in the kitchen the aroma brought moisture to his mouth apart from the manger scene cole what image comes to you when you think of the magi well on tv or in drawings ive seen theyre on camels and theyre heading toward a big bright star in the distance right some people theorize that it was actually a comet or perhaps planets in a cluster which happens sometimes causing a brighter light than normal or perhaps it was an actual star one that was exploding whatever it might have been do you see any problem with trying to follow it cole considered the question the stars move youre very observant i never noticed when we lived in la there were so many streetlights that i couldnt see the sky but here the skys so clear i can see all kinds of stars my favorite constellations orion the one with stars lined up like a sword but at different times hes in different places correct except for a few socalled fixed stars one of which is the north star heavenly bodies shift across the horizon in fact the magi probably used the north star to guide their way across the desert but they couldnt depend on a comet or a cluster of planets or an exploding star to show them the way because the bright light wouldnt have stayed in the same place all through the night it would have drifted at various times it might have been overhead or even in the opposite direction from where they wanted to go theyd have wandered in the desert until they died only a miracle could have kept the light in the same place and showed them the way im not saying there couldnt have been a miracle but thats not what this storys about so the question is cole the magi must have had a different reason for crossing the desert at night what do you think it was to avoid the heat of the day good answer but in school weve been studying weather patterns ice ages and stuff like that to learn if climate change is real or not our teacher says that back then some deserts might not have been as hot as they are now i read the same thing kagan concentrated on the snow falling beyond the window so lets suppose traveling across the desert in daylight wouldnt have been as dangerous as it is now whats another reason the magi would have wanted to travel at night on camels for at least a month it would have been difficult to keep the camels from stumbling in the dark and breaking their legs that definitely would have been dangerous so whats the advantage of the night cole didnt have an answer suppose this is a war story kagan suggested maybe they were trying to keep the roman soldiers from seeing them cole you should think twice about not wanting to be a spy youre right the magi traveled in the dark because they were on a secret mission and they didnt want the soldiers to see them the microphone has a pin on the back andrei said i attached it under your coat collar its set so youre broadcasting all the time ill hear everything you say and most of whats said around you on occasion ill give you instructions through this earbud andrei placed the device in brodys left ear but wont the gunman see it brodys voice was unsteady from more than just the cold keep your hat on and your earflaps down as long as possible eventually youll need to take the hat off but the earbuds small and fleshcolored hard to see even in the daytime hes got the lights off i guarantee he wont turn t hem on even the christmas tree lights and the television are off now mikhail said watching the house from the cover of the fir tree the microphone and the earbud have tiny batteries andrei told brody theyre boosted by this transmitterreceiver youd normally wear on your belt but if the suspect searches youwhich i assume he willhes bound to find it even in the dark so we need to hide it on you the best place is in one of your gloves take them off as you approach the house set them someplace as soon as youre inside i dialed your equipment to its own channel that way you wont be distracted when i talk to headquarters now lets find out if everything works detective grant walk down the lane and say something into your microphone as yakov left them andrei heard a voice through his own earbud but it didnt belong to yakov the pakhans voice was sharp our clients believe i took their money without any intention of delivering the package they insist im lying they claim im planning to sell the baby to someone else in the background something crashed a man with an arab accent shouted would you like me to cut off your thumbs your ears your balls another accented voice threatened well make you eat them thats what we do to people who cheat us andrei looked at brody but gave no sign of what he was hearing i have a call coming through excuse me because brody knew about the microphones it wasnt necessary to go through the charade of pretending to talk to a cell phone as andrei had done earlier among the crowd on canyon road but now he had a different reason for pretending to use his cell phone he took it from a pocket and opened it at once he intentionally fumbled with it and let it fall into the snow damn continuing the pretense he pawed in the snow his thin leather glove barely protected his fingers from the cold when he found the phone it was covered with flakes he wiped them off made a show of pressing a button and frowned at the screen somethings wrong your phone doesnt work brody asked snow must have got into it here lend me yours when brody handed it over andrei pressed numbers and walked a short distance away pretending to talk on the phone while he actually spoke to the microphone on his ski jacket did you just try to call me what was that about the pakhan demanded through andreis earbud he sounded furious something i needed to do ill explain later did you hear what i said our clients claim i cheated them but i wont take the blame because you screwed up ill make sure they know who to punish andrei barely held his anger in check tell them theyll get the package before midnight you guarantee that when we deliver demand a bonus answer me do you guarantee delivery in the cold andreis cheeks felt hot somehow he managed to keep his voice low and maintain control almost damn it yes now let me do my work with that he pretended to shut off the phone whats the matter brody asked youve got family problems so do i down the lane andrei heard yakov murmur testing one two three four in response brody pressed a finger to the object in his left ear i hear him when yakov returned andrei asked detective grant is mr brodys microphone working did his voice come through your earbud clearly excellent amid the distraction andrei slipped brodys cell phone into his pocket brody didnt notice okay andrei said now lets practice what youre going to do snow clung to their coats as they left the stairwell passed the elevator and walked along a hotel corridor to the security door there were five of themandrei kagan yakov mikhail and viktor a lanky man kagan had met only a halfdozen times newly arrived from russia andrei slid a creditcardshaped hotel key into a slot making a slight metallic sound the lock electronically opened andrei wore his leather shooters gloves so he wouldnt leave fingerprints when he turned the doorknob coordinating their movements via their earbuds and hidden microphones he and the others had gone into the hotel through separate entrances to avoid attracting attention theyd lowered their heads when passing security cameras they did the same now as they stepped under the last camera they needed to be concerned about closing the door they entered a continuation of the corridor numbered rooms stretched along the wall to the left in this exclusive part of the hotel an attractive welldressed female receptionist smiled at them from a desk and pointed toward the melting flakes on their coats i see it hasnt stopped snowing a picturesque night for a walk andrei replied have you been to canyon road the redhaired woman asked very impressive its the big attraction on christmas eve all yearround in fact im glad you didnt miss it is there anything i can get you thank you no you must have checked into the hotel when i wasnt on duty i dont recall seeing you before i dont recall seeing you either we only came back to our rooms to pick up some presents were taking to a party have a good time we intend to as expected on christmas eve no sounds came from any of the rooms the guests having gone out to dinner to enjoy the sights or perhaps to attend mass in the nearby cathedral but even though there was virtually no risk of being interrupted speed was essential while andrei spoke to the receptionist mikhail stepped behind her and stuck a hypodermic into her neck pushing its plunger hey what do you the fastacting poison made the woman shudder five seconds later she slumped across her desk the other men took off their outdoor gloves revealing latex ones in a carefully rehearsed sequence mikhail grabbed the receptionists pass key off the desk returned to the start of the corridor and used the key to open a door to a custodial area kagan and yakov picked up the dead woman and carried her through the open door setting the corpse inside when they returned to the corridor they pulled the door shut automatically locking it meanwhile andre and viktor went up a curved staircase and faced the three doors that led to the targets suite the others joined them andrei looked at his watch and nodded everything was proceeding as planned six minutes earlier at pm theyd stood amid the snowfall on the touristcrowded plaza watching hassan his wife and four protective escorts get into a limousine bound for a reception at the new mexico governors mansion at hassan was scheduled to step before television cameras and deliver the first of many rousing speeches about his newborn child of peace and his hopes for the middle east but just before the speech hassans wife would receive a call on her cell phone she would answer because the number displayed on the phone belonged to her babys nursemaid the voice would belong to a man however it would explain in vivid detail what had happened to the baby it would emphasize that if hassan loved his child he would cancel the speech and never make another one kagan stared through the window straining to distinguish shadows from illusions in the falling snow one of them will try to distract me in the front he thought probably andrei i set up enough ambushes with him thats how he thinks meanwhile mikhail and yakov will attack from the sides but wouldnt they have made their move by now kagan wondered maybe i did fool them its been a while maybe nothings going to happen maybe theyre back on canyon road the baby whimpered meredith kagan said hes just restless probably having another dream doesnt sound like a happy one i put my little finger to his lips hes sucking on it hes quiet now you cant let him cry hes a good baby he wont cry kagan never looked in merediths direction with the gun on his lap he focused intently on the window he continued with the story working to keep cole and meredith calm hoping it would overcome his fatigue and keep him alert in those days the capital of israel was jerusalem the man in charge was a roman puppet named herod who called himself the king of the jews he was seriously paranoid forty years earlier a rebellion had chased him from israel the romans had hit back viciously using thousands of battlehardened soldiers to return herod to power thereafter he squashed the slightest sign of a rebellion even to the point of killing one of his wives her mother and several of his sons now suddenly at dawn the guards on the eastern wall of jerusalem reported three strangers coming out of the distance approaching on camels their confident bearing identified them as men of importance when they reached the gate they announced that they were priests on a sacred mission and asked to pay their respects to herod what do you suppose his reaction was cole he wouldnt have liked them surprising him like that you bet especially when the magi came from israels biggest closest enemy he was furious and demanded an explanation from his security team how had the magi traveled all the way to jerusalem without being detected why had the roman soldiers failed to intercept them what sort of protection did he have if foreigners could pass through the desert as though they were invisible i told you that the magi had a reputation for being a secret group with magical powers now when they were brought before herod they described an amazing star that had led them to jerusalem herod was astonished a star he asked what kind of star the magi answered a star that announces the birth of the new king of the jews kagan heard footstepsmeredith bringing the coffee he started to tell her to keep low but he didnt need to she made him proud by crouching beside him staying beneath the level of the window thanks keeping his right hand on the gun in his lap he ignored the pain of using his stiff left arm to raise the cup to his lips he blew on the steaming liquid then sipped inhaling its fragrance tasting the sugar the water you put on the stove is boiling meredith said good keep it boiling add more water if it gets low kagan never removed his gaze from the window he listened to meredith as she crawled across the floor and sat next to the baby where was i cole kagan didnt need reminding but he wanted to keep the boy answering questions herod and the star right again the spymasters words came back to him from years earlier all through the jewish and roman world at that time there was a growing belief that ancient prophecies were about to be fulfilled that someone special would soon be born and the course of history would change in the old testament book of daniel which is set hundreds of years earlier daniel had a vision about a sign in the heavens bringing a mysterious leader who would establish a new everlasting dominion there were many similar predictions even contemporary roman historians like suetonius and tacitus mentioned prophecies about a man from israel who would rule the world one of the great roman poets virgil predicted that a child would descend from the heavens possibly from the constellation virgo or virgin and establish a golden age sounds like he was talking about the virgin mary cole said puzzled or maybe theres another explanation maybe virgil was trying to impress someone of influence a politician perhaps whose wife was about to give birth and whom virgil was praising for her virtue presumably the child would be the divine creator of peace that virgil predicted in his poem he might even have been referring to the roman emperor there can be all sorts of explanations for those prophecies but thats not the point what matters is that two thousand years ago people believed themreally believed them herod certainly did when he heard about the magical star he went berserk and summoned his priests demanding to know what they thought of the magis claims a star indeed exists in many of the prophecies the priests agreed herod shouted but do the prophecies say where the new king will be born the priests answered yes they quoted an ancient text that said and you bethlehem are by no means insignificant since from you shall come a leader of israel bethlehem herod murmured now remember cole this was a powerhungry sociopath who killed his own sons because he suspected they were plotting against him what would he do if he believed a new rival threatened his throne he was in his seventies and terrified of losing control even though hed probably be dead by the time the child was old enough to threaten him the childs followers were another matter if a revolution was being planned herod needed to stop it with every means possible cole what do you suppose was actually going on i dont understand the magi were spies what do you think their mission was they arrived as if by magic and told a story about an amazing star and a newborn rival what was the point of telling him it sure made him angry and draw a conclusion maybe that was the pointto make him angry you definitely have the instincts of a spy using prophecies along with their reputation for secret knowledge that supposedly enabled them to predict the future the magi set forces in motion to destabilize herod and his government destabilize make it fall apart from an espionage point of view the tactic was brilliant if herod ordered all his men to root out every sign of an imagined rebellion if the mysterious child was reported everywhere throughout the kingdom hero wouldnt be able to focus on ruling the country persia could intensify its attacks on israels border while herods defenses became so chaotic that the country collapsed from within the roman empire wouldnt know how to retaliate because the fall of israel would have been caused by herod himself its like you said cole sounded impressed what they did was more powerful than fighting a battle if the plan had worked but herod showed how clever he was and why hed been able to stay in power for so many years his instincts warned him about the potential for a trap not that he suspected the magi even his own priests admitted that the newcomers had the authority of the prophets no it was bethlehem that bothered him only eight miles south of jerusalem the town lay in a rich agricultural area where the inhabitants had ample money to organize a revolution it was nestled among hills that would be easy to defend and difficult to attack its proximity to jerusalem made it all the more suspect since raids on the capital would be easy to stage from there in his rage herod almost ordered his army to ransack bethlehem until they found the child and killed him but he feared he might cause the rebellion he wanted to suppress so he decided to try a different approach and the idea he came up with was so unexpected that even the magi were caught unprepared he tried to recruit them as his own unwitting spies the child you came looking for has a magnificent destiny he told them continue your journey go to bethlehem find the savior that the star predicted worship him then come back here and tell me where the child is so that i too might go and worship him how classic the magi were so convincing that herod didnt realize who his true enemies were they became what intelligence experts call double agents spies pretending to work for one side when theyre actually working for the other they must have been terribly pleased as they traveled south to bethlehem now that they had herods trust they could tell him anything they wanted to and hed believe them more than theyd originally hoped their madeup reports would cause herod to order his soldiers back and forth across the kingdom fatally weakening his defenses as he chased a phantom but something remarkable happened in bethlehem something that changed everything what was that cole asked they began to believe that the disinformation theyd given herod was in fact the truth you understand what youre supposed to do andrei asked brody learn as much as you can talk about it as naturally as possible so the suspect doesnt realize were listening were particularly interested in any defenses he set up yes brody said but are you having second thoughts you dont want to help your wife and son you dont want to make up for beating her honest to god ive never regretted anything more in my life then prove it to them maybe you can convince the suspect that were not out here that hes safe and he can let your family go but andrei cut him off okay if you dont want to help your wife and son fine i can understand why you dont want to risk your own neck its human nature to look out for number one when the swat team gets their snipers set up ill figure another way to handle this snipers for heavens sake no mr brody i dont have a lot of alternatives all right all right ill go in there youre sure no second thoughts i said ill do it keep your voice down the suspect might hear you sorry this is all too andrei put a steadying hand on brodys shoulder your familyll be proud of you thats what matters now there are just a couple of other details give me your keys my keys why is there a vehicle in your garage a range rover the suspect might try to escape in it canyon road should be open to traffic by now he might be tempted to take the chance brody gave andrei the keys but if canyon roads open to traffic now why hasnt the swat team gotten here its been a long time good question ill call headquarters and find out andrei pulled out brodys cell phone opened it started to press numbers and again deliberately lost his grip as he intended it fell in the snow damn andrei said i wish id worn thick gloves my hands are so cold i can barely hold anything he reached into the snow groped and pulled out the phone he brushed snow from it and pretended to try to use it shit now this phones not working either he didnt want brody going into the house with a phone pyotyr would no doubt find it and use it to get help im awfully sorry about this youd better lend me your wifes phone lend you brody tensed whats going on here dont worry the police department will get you a new one andrei promised what did you say your name was i didnt its detective parker you told me your microphones and earbuds allow you to communicate with headquarters so why do you need my wifes phone this is somethings wrong let me see your badge badge all of you let me see your id i told you to keep your voice down andrei warned my identifications under my coat he brushed snow from the front do you really want me to freeze just so you can brody backed away what are you doing mr brody as brody turned to run down the shadowy lane andrei shoved him hard knocking him into the snow he bent down braced a heavy knee on brodys back and rammed his face down into a drift andreis powerful hand kept brodys features submerged in the snow brody struggled gagging but andrei ignored his efforts and pressed his face down harder into the drift listen to me andrei whispered close to brodys left ear youre going to do what i want or ill smother you do you feel the snow clogging your nostrils some of its melting youre inhaling the water soon youll be choking pinned in the drift brody started coughing the sound was muffled by the snow his back archedor tried to his chest heaved are you listening andrei asked quietly applying more weight to his back do you want to die in a snowbank on christmas eve or would you like to spend the holiday with your wife and son brody choked as he tried to speak under the snow at once andrei reached under brodys hat grabbed his hair and jerked his head up brodys cheeks were covered with snow he strained to clear his nose and mouth but andrei pressed a glove over his face to diminish the sound what are the names of your wife and son andrei murmured he took his hand from brodys mouth while he pressed his glock to brodys right temple snot clung to brodys mustache meredith my wifes name is meredith my son my son is cole nice names i bet theyre wonderful people are they yes do you love them ted the tip of the sound suppressor on andreis glock made an indentation in brodys skin andrei imagined how hard and cold the metal felt love them brody managed to answer of course prove it ted prove that you love meredith and cole prove how much you wish you hadnt punched your wife this is your chance to be a hero save them save your family ted yes brody trembled ill do anything for them then nothings different youll go in that house youll notice whatever defenses have been set up youll ask about them well hear you talking well know what to expect meredith and cole we take care of people who cooperate ted i just thought of something andrei felt a sudden terrible doubt is there a computer in your house could the man in there have emailed for help i use a password lock andrei breathed out releasing some of his tension good he said before we go into the house ill tell you were coming youll have plenty of warning all you need to do is get your family down to the floor as soon as we teach a lesson to our friend in there and retrieve something he stole from us well leave you and your wife and son can have a nice life god dont i wish what he stole from us is crucial i want you to make sure we get it back alive alive its a baby a whats a baby doing in there thats not your concern ted just talk about the baby when you see it tell me where it is when we go inside i want to make sure it isnt injured but what about my family i told you just get them onto the floor i promise you and your wife and your son will be safe an hour from now thisll be over well be gone your family will owe their lives to you youll be a hero to them your wife wont have any choice except to forgive you for hitting her do you understand ted is everything clear kagan stood with andrei mikhail yakov and the new man viktor in the corridor outside the three doors beyond the middle door he heard the muffled sound of a television the only noise in the corridor all the other guests were probably away from their rooms enjoying the holiday festivities as adrenaline surged through him kagan heard just enough of the television program to be able to determine that a little girl was asking someone if he was really santa claus the voice of an elderly man said that he was that middle room was where the three bodyguards were based concentrating to control his breathing kagan watched andrei take his cell phone from his pocket it was set to the vibrate mode and what andrei waited for was a call from the nursemaid in the suite not that andrei would answer the call all he needed was to feel the vibration through his glove he also needed to verify the callers number it would signal that the nursemaid had rigged the door to the left pressing a strip of plastic against the springcontrolled latch preventing it from sliding into the door frame and locking the door she had done the same with the door on the right by now she would have taken the baby into the bathroom where the two of them would be lying in the bathtub the bathtub wasnt sturdy enough to keep bullets from penetrating it but shots werent likely to go in that direction as a precaution however hassans rivals had bribed the nursemaid to lie sideways with her back to the closed bathroom door holding the baby on the other side so that if a chance bullet did come into the bathroom the baby would have a human shield andreis phone made a faint buzzing sound he looked at the screen to view the callers number he nodded to the team put the phone away and drew the glock from his coat pocket kagan and the others pulled out their weapons a sound suppressor projected from each barrel each man eased back the slide on his pistol just enough to assure that a round was in the firing chamber theyd performed this precaution several times prior to starting the mission but no matter how often theyd already done so they felt compelled to do it yet again an obsessive habit of gunfighters kagans hands were sweaty in his latex gloves andrei nodded a final time the team separated kagan and mikhail going to the door on the right beyond which theyd been told the nursemaid rested when hassans wife took care of the baby yakov and viktor proceeded to the door on the far left while andreiwho liked frontal distractionswent to the middle door andrei knocked loudly on the middle door no doubt startling the bodyguards beyond it kagan pressed a hand against the door on the right at the exact moment yakov did the same to the door on the far left for an urgent second kagan met resistance and wondered if the nursemaids strip of plastic had in fact kept the latch from engaging but then andrei knocked louder on the middle door and when kagan pushed his door came open mikhail immediately aimed past him making sure the room was unoccupied andrei pounded on the middle door a third time saying housekeeping in a loud voice while kagan and mikhail hurried into the room on the right as the nursemaid had promised the connecting door was open kagan pretended that the bed was in his way allowing mikhail to charge ahead and crouch firing upward toward chest and head level in the middle room mikhails sound suppressor made the shots barely audible amid the smell of burned gunpowder kagan hurried next to him and fired upward his bullets striking bodyguards who were in effect already dead in the opposite open doorway yakov and viktor crouched and also fired upward the angle of their aim preventing them from being caught in a crossfire blood spurted from the three bodyguards groaning they fell in a cluster one of them landing on the other two mikhail stepped into the room and shot each man in the head kagan ran back through the bedroom toward the door hed shoved open he leaned into the corridor and motioned for andrei to enter the moment andrei hurried past him kagan tore off the plastic strip attached to the side of the door allowing the latch to function again he shut the door and turned the dead bolt then followed andrei into the middle room where the coppery smell of blood was now strong they stepped over the bodies and joined the rest of the team in the third bedroom the outer door to which yakov had closed and locked andrei knocked three times on the bathroom door twice then once completing the allclear signal after a pause the door was unlocked as it came open kagan saw a palestinian woman her veil made it difficult to tell how old she was or what she looked like but she had dark expressive eyes that communicated her nervousness she wore a black head scarf and a modest loose black dress she held an arab baby in her arms the child wore a blue sleeper and was wrapped in a blanket frightened the woman looked past andrei and his men toward the middle room its finished andrei said she knew enough english to understand andrei held out a thick envelope heres the remainder of what youre owed give us the baby the woman frowned at the envelope as if wishing that shed never agreed to be part of this take the money andrei said you earned it go far away the woman hesitated viktor andrei said get the baby from her viktor did what he was told the infant sensed the less comforting grip and squirmed the woman looked troubled dont worry hell be fine andrei assured her as she took the envelope yakov shot her twice in the chest and once in the head she toppled back landing on the white tiles of the bathroom floor yakov stepped over her blood and yanked the envelope from her hand the next part of the story isnt in matthews gospel kagan said its in lukes where were told that the roman emperor issued a census decree he swallowed coffee needing the energy it provided he felt his dry mouth absorb the hot liquid his right hand remained on the pistol in his lap the census was important for a lot of reasons it established a population base on which rome could demand taxes from israel but it also forced the jews to travel sometimes far and thus reminded them that they were at the emperors beck and call why were they forced to travel cole asked because each family had to register according to the tribewhat they called the housethat the husband belonged to to do that they needed to go to whatever town was originally associated with that tribe this is where mary and joseph get involved they lived to the north in nazareth but joseph belonged to the house of david and the town associated with david was bethlehem seventyfive miles to the south it was a difficult journey over several deep canyons to complicate matters mary was far along in her pregnancy which meant that they needed to be careful taking even longer than usual to get there as a consequence when they finally reached bethlehem a lot of people had arrived sooner and there werent any places for them to stay no room at the inn as lukes gospel says in the darkness kagan finished the coffee and leaned down ignoring the pain in his wounded arm as he set the cup on the floor but he never took his eyes from the window now the snow fell so thickly that the fence was a blur mary and joseph were reduced to sleeping in a stable mary gave birth there and the only spot to put the baby was a manger thats a trough from which animals eat if you ever go to bethlehem cole youll find a cave thats advertised as the place where jesus was born maybe its true bethlehem has a lot of limestone slopes and in those days people carved stables into the limestone i like the idea of a cave its more defensible than a mere stable the creche next to your christmas tree has the magi in the stable greeting mary joseph and the newborn jesus but that wasnt the case matthew says the magi entered a house where they found jesus and his mother similar details suggest that the magi arrived some time after jesus was born the moment they got to bethlehem they did what herod expected asking about newborn children and whether there were any unusual circumstances about the birth if you want my opinion the last thing they anticipated was to find evidence supporting their story their purpose was to give disinformation to herod and back it up by any means possible so when they heard about a birth in a stable they probably decided it was the kind of detail they could usea great king born in humble conditions the contrast with herods greed would drive him crazy but as the magi checked further trying to manufacture an elaborate hoax to continue fooling herod they heard about something else that was unusual about the birth and that changed everything for them what was it cole asked something that involved the other group in the creche next to your christmas tree you already mentioned them the shepherds yes word had spread through bethlehem about something weird that had happened to the shepherds the night the baby was born they were out in a dark field tending their sheep when a mysterious figure suddenly appeared surrounded by a blazing light the figure told them to rejoice to go into bethlehem and look for a newborn baby in a stable for this baby was special a savior abruptly other brilliant figures appeared to the shepherds announcing glory to god in the highest peace on earth then they all vanished leaving the shepherds alone in the dark frankly cole if that had happened to me i think i might have had a heart attack but the shepherds were made of stronger stuff they adjusted to their shock and were so curious that they decided to go into bethlehem to see if what the mysterious figure had told them was true just as predicted they found the baby in the stable thats what the magi heard the villagers talking about immediately they asked where they could find the shepherds and were given directions to the field where the vision had supposedly happened there they got the story firsthand it was exactly the sort of event that would have held their attention remember the magi believed in magic intrigued they asked where the stable was where they could find the baby but as matthews gospel indicates by then mary and jesus were in a house its interesting that the gospel doesnt mention joseph at this point i have a theory about him but ill save it until later for now the important thing is that the magi were experts in elicitation i dont know what that is cole said its the art of making people trust you so much that they volunteer information they normally wouldnt feel comfortable revealing by subtly imitating speech patterns and body movements even the way people breathe you can make strangers feel as if theyve known you for a very long time the magi were so skilled at it that they persuaded mary to tell them some very personal details among other things she described how visions had come to her similar to the apparitions the shepherds had seen in the field she explained that when she and joseph were engaged to be married meredith how frankly can i talk about the pregnancy cole answered for her if you mean sex and virginity and stuff like that i guess i know enough that you dont need to be embarrassed me kagan asked embarrassed its okay meredith said i have a feeling hell know what youre talking about she almost sounded amused good kagan thought theyre distracted he stared out the window and managed to find the words to continue joseph was engaged to mary but before they became husband and wife mary told him she was pregnant because joseph knew he wasnt the father he naturally assumed shed been with another man but mary swore that shed been faithful she said that an angel had come to her and announced that even though she was a virgin shed conceived through the holy spirit so what was joseph to do he could accuse mary of infidelity and cast her aside or else he could take her word that an angel had spoken to her about a miraculous conception it was a difficult painful choice joseph felt betrayed but at the same time he loved mary with all his heart distraught he considered one option and then the other weighing them unable to decide anger versus love emotionally exhausted he fell asleep and all of a sudden he had a dream in which a brilliant figurean angelappeared before him the angel told him the exact same thing that mary had insisted an angel had told her that the holy spirit was the father the dream is significant because the house of david to which joseph belonged had a tradition of believing in the truth of dreams and of being able to interpret them but surely joseph must have wondered if his tortured thoughts had caused the dream or if an angel really had come to him it all amounted to thiswas he willing to reject the woman he loved because she was pregnant with a child that wasnt his in the end he chose to believe in his dream he swallowed his pride and proved his love by marrying her the baby whimpered meredith his diapers still dry maybe hes thirsty again ill bring more of that mixture as the babys voice rose kagan heard meredith hurry into the kitchen he heard the scrape of the saucepan as she poured what was left of the mixture into the shot glass she rushed back and sat on the floor lifting the baby into her arms a moment later the baby was quiet hes drinking but hes awfully restless meredith said are you sending me a message kagan wondered is this the same thing that happened when you kicked me and i thought you were guiding me here he shook his head get real he thought im still off balance from being wounded so joseph married her kagan said his temples felt the pressure of his urgent heartbeat there was a problem though marys pregnancy would soon start to show too soon like nosy people everywhere the good folks in nazareth would start asking questions and you can bet they wouldnt believe what mary said about the angel the scandal would make her an outcast thats when mary learned that one of her relatives elizabeth also was pregnant elizabeth lived a distance away in a town called judah and mary decided to go therein haste lukes gospel says she stayed three months helping with the household until elizabeths baby was born but then it was time for mary to return to nazareth where the townspeople would certainly have noticed that she was more pregnant than she should be when mary and joseph heard about the roman census decree they realized they had a perfect excuse to leave town required by law to go to bethlehem and register they wouldnt have taken long to pack over a period of time the magi elicited this account from mary it was an amazing match to what the shepherds had told them about being visited by angels the parallels were astonishing and these priests who believed in dreams and magic wouldnt have dismissed them on the contrary the magi would have investigated in greater detail questioning the people in bethlehem looking for inconsistencies and contradictions anything to cast doubt on what was being said but after all their efforts the magi concluded that the stories were genuine that the disinformation theyd fed herod in an effort to destabilize his government was in ways too mysterious to understand the truth i was with a group of spies when i first heard this interpretation of the christmas story kagan said for a moment he felt nostalgic hed been eighteen the first time hed heard it fourteen years ago kagan thought and now im an old man one of those spies said he could make a case that the magi themselves were victims of disinformation what do you mean cole asked their sudden appearance in jerusalem would have been widely reported herods furious reaction to what they said about the star and the newborn king would have been widely reported as well herod was an unpopular ruler his fears about a rebellion were justified perhaps a rebel spy in herods court learned that the king was sending the magi to bethlehem to search for the child the rebels could have arranged for the shepherds and mary to tell the magi a story that elaborated on what the magi had told herod perhaps the magi were deceived just as they had deceived herod deceived meredith asked the rebels couldnt have known that the magi were foreign spies they couldnt have known that the magi wanted to destabilize herods government so they told the magi stories that they hoped the magi would take back to herod further unbalancing the king perhaps the shepherds and mary were rebels perhaps they wanted the same thing the magi did but neither side realized they were working toward a common goal makes my head spin meredith said thats what the spy world is like a us spymasterwho might actually have worked for the sovietsonce called espionage a wilderness of mirrors but i dont want to believe that mary and the shepherds were pretending neither do i kagan replied and as far as im concerned the rest of the story proves they werent the baby made a sound kagan tensed hes more restless meredith said kagans apprehension strengthened id better finish youre sure the same house key fits all the doors andrei asked yes brody answered good then this doesnt need to be difficult go into the house act surprised when you see the intruder ask the natural questions about whatever traps you notice hes arranged find out where the baby is but the guyll see that im nervous brody said he might suspect that im working for you of course hell see that youre nervous thats the beauty of the situation you beat up your wife youre terrified that shell leave you you come to beg her to forgive you then you discover theres a stranger in the house who wouldnt be nervous hell never guess whats really going on just do what we rehearsed tomorrow morning you and your family can open your christmas presents tonight will be just a bad memory i hope to god youre right andrei gave brodys arm an encouraging squeeze youll do this perfectly i have faith in you he watched brody walk uneasily through the falling snow toward the gate the moment brody was too far away to hear what he said andrei turned to his companions yakov as soon as brodys inside go to the left side of the house mikhail go to the right use one of the metal chairs brody told us about and position it under a window in the master bedroom because you gave brody your earbud and microphone you and i will stay in contact via our cell phones while yakov monitors the radio conversation after we learn where the baby is and where the booby traps are ill say merry christmas to brody thats my signal to both of you a second later ill shoot out the front window and attack through there at the same time mikhail youll stand on the metal chair and go through a window in the back bedroom the noise will keep pyotyr from hearing yakov turn the key in the side door and charge in well be shooting from three different directions therell be so much disruption pyotyr wont know where to turn first plus all those people will be in the way screaming panicking interfering with his aim when i picked up the cell phone pyotyr lost i also found his spare magazines they must have been in the same coat pocket without enough ammunition to fight all of us what chance does he have you dont want brody and his family injured mikhail asked on the contrary they cant be allowed to tell the police anything i want them all dead except the baby we cant attack until we know where the baby is the coppery odor of the nursemaids blood filled kagans nostrils he watched yakov draw his thumb across the cash in the thick envelope hed taken from the womans corpse andrei held out his hand what yakov asked our clients might want the bribe money returned to them andrei said give it to me and if they dont remember to ask for the money then the pakhan will want his cut surprising kagan it was viktor who spoke next not yakov always the pakhan the gangly newcomer said holding the baby andrei ignored him yakov i want the envelope with a sigh yakov gave it to him after the pakhan takes his cut ill divide the money evenly andrei promised well make sure you do viktor tightened his grip on the squirming baby andrei turned toward him youre new viktor youre still learning how things work here so ill make an exception just this once but never challenge me again viktors eyes became fierce yakov challenged you also give him shit the same as you do me yakov challenged me i dont think so viktor glowered whatever you say now youre getting the idea whatever i say the baby whimpered in viktors arms the soundand the helplessness it conveyedstirred something in kagan give the package to mikhail andrei said but i can handle it viktor objected it doesnt like you do as we rehearsed and give the baby to mikhail before you make it cry kagan watched andrei step close to the baby and concentrate on its small unhappy face an odd emotion seemed to cross andreis own face a feeling he apparently found so unusual that it baffled him as viktor gave the struggling baby to mikhail andrei shook his head giving the impression that he forcibly subdued the unfamiliar emotion he stuffed the envelope into an inside pocket of his ski jacket then pressed the microphone that was hidden under the skilift tickets on the jacket this is melchior we have the package were leaving the store two minutes viktor and yakov opened the bedroom door and checked to make certain the hallway was deserted before stepping out of the room they put their weapons in their coats and motioned for mikhail to follow with the baby kagan and andrei went last concealing their pistols making sure the door was locked behind them as theyd rehearsed kagan hung a do not disturb sign on the doorknob the television continued to murmur in the suite the elderly mans voice still maintaining that he was santa claus they went down the curved staircase and walked along the carpeted hallway passing the desk where the receptionist had greeted them before mikhail had killed her viktor opened the security door that isolated this exclusive group of rooms from the rest of the hotel keeping mikhail and the baby in the middle the group passed the elevator opened a fire door and went down a harshly lit concrete stairwell as they descended they took off their latex gloves and put on their outdoor ones the babys whimper echoed amid their scraping footsteps this is melchior one minute till arrival andrei said to his microphone three floors down they reached the street level here a security camera was aimed at the corridor they kept their heads down and tightened their twoonetwo formation partially shielding mikhail in the middle so the camera couldnt see the baby in his arms through a glass doorthe side exit from the hotelkagan saw snow falling past murky streetlights warmly dressed people walked past the window beyond vehicles parked along the curb a dark van suddenly stopped i cant do this kagan thought that afternoon for a long time hed knelt in the nearby cathedral and stared at a manger scene trying to tell himself that his controllers were absolutely right that the innocent lives hed saved were all that mattered bring me home hed begged them in deaddrop messages during the past three months sometimes hed managed to slip away from andrei and risk phone calls but there had always been some reason his controllers couldnt bring him in he was too well placed theyd insisted no one could ever hope to penetrate the russian mob so deeply if he disappeared the russians would realize he was a spy making it more dangerous to try to infiltrate another operative into the heart of their organization then fake my death kagan had urged them the russians wont suspect i was a mole if they think im dead but his controllers had talked of new rumors about plastic explosives handheld missiles and biological weapons being smuggled in via ports controlled by the odessa mafia theyd reminded him of all the innocent lives he had an obligation to save meanwhile hed obeyed the pakhans orders to burn homes break arms and legs yank out teeth and beat up women more of his soul had disintegrated viktor and yakov stepped from the hotel and looked both ways staring at pedestrians in the shadowy snowfall with a nod they signaled to mikhail to carry the baby outside andrei and kagan followed kagans cheeks felt cold his stomach felt colder too much he thought no more the group passed between snowcovered cars parked along the curb headlights glowed in the street reaching the van viktor pulled its side door open yakov scrambled in mikhail approached with the baby andrei and kagan followed the baby squirmed in mikhails arms i wanted to make the world better kagan thought the baby cried mikhail held it with one arm while using his free hand to grip an armrest in the van and climb in dont drop it andrei warned i wanted to fight the kind of men who made my parents afraid for so many years kagan thought the baby struggled as mikhail sat next to yakov opposite the side door and now im no different from the people i set out to fight kagan let andrei climb in next with the middle seat occupied andrei was forced to squeeze toward the seat in the back ive beaten ive tortured ive killed kagan thought but by god this is one thing i wont do he leaned into the van as if to reach for an armrest and climb all the way in his heart pounding he pointed in feigned alarm what happened to the baby its bleeding what mikhail asked where he opened his arms to examine the child kagan grabbed it surged back from the open door felt viktor behind him and swung something tugged violently at his coat but only for a moment with both arms gripping the baby kagan focused on his right elbow he pivoted with such force that when the tip of the elbow struck viktors nose he felt the bones crack they shattered and propelled inward with such power that kagan knew theyd pierced viktors brain hearing shouts of alarm coming from the open van he charged up the street veered between cars at the curb reached the sidewalk and shouted for pedestrians to get out of his way all at once his left arm jerked then became numb hed been hit by a bullet the sound suppressor on the gun that had fired it prevented bystanders from knowing why glass had shattered in front of him thats the last shot theyll fire he desperately hoped andrei wont take the chance of a stray bullet hitting the baby as he hurried through the crowd kagan used his nowawkward left arm to pull down the zipper on his parka the numbness changed to searing pain imagining andrei yakov and mikhail scrambling from the van he shoved the baby under his coat and pulled up the zipper to provide warmth andrei would immediately chase him kagan knew yakov and perhaps mikhail would drag viktors body into the van before the pedestrians could realize what had happened and start a panic then the two killers would join the hunt andreis voice shouted through his earbud pyotyr what the hell are you doing kagan increased his speed shouldering past people on the sidewalk pyotyr bring back the package instead of answering kagan took deep breaths and rushed toward the cathedral that towered at the end of the narrow street the baby nestled against him warm and surprisingly calm against his stomach ill protect you he silently promised ill do everything in my power to keep you safe he looked for a police car tempted to ask for help but immediately he realized that during the time it would take to explain andrei and the others would catch up they would shoot kagan and the policeman in the head and take the baby phone for backup he told himself desperate to contact his controllers he used his stiffening arm to reach for the cell phone in the left pocket of his coat he felt dizzy when he discovered that the pocket was torn open that his cell phone was missing along with his spare ammunition he remembered something tugging at the side of his coat someone must have lunged to try to stop him and snagged that pocket have a plan a backup plan and then a backup plan after that kagans instructors had hammered that into him visualize what youre going to do rehearse it in your mind even if you cant rehearse it physically never do anything without knowing your options but kagans decision to take the baby had been made on the spot even though hed agonized about it that afternoon in front of the cathedrals manger he hadnt made up his mind until the moment hed leaned into the van and told mikhail the babys bleeding where am i going kagan thought in desperation ahead he saw a crowd on the street to the right of the cathedral hundreds of people walked with purpose under his parka the baby kicked him as if urging him to follow pyotyr andreis angry voice pierced through kagans earbud i found your cell phone youre on your own you cant get help bring back the package breathing hard wincing from the pain that now swelled his left arm kagan kept rushing trying not to lose his balance on the slippery sidewalk he heard someone in the crowd talk about christmas lights on canyon road the baby kicked him again pyotyr you wont like what i do to you andrei swore the baby whimpered dont cry kagan murmured im doing my best to calm him meredith insisted i know kagan answered gently muscles tightening he continued to stare out the window toward the falling snow he couldnt suppress the suspicion that somehow the baby was warning him as crazy as that seemed did i lose more blood than i realized am i so lightheaded that im imagining things the baby became quiet again but kagans muscles didnt relax the rest of the story might not be suitable for christmas eve kagan said hoping to keep the boy intrigued he added parts of it are what cole would call gross then i want to hear it the boy insisted kagan licked his dry lips okay but dont say you werent warned the magi felt overwhelmed by what the shepherds and mary had told them the startling similarities to the story they themselves had told herod brought them to an extraordinary decision they violated a primary rule of spy craft and exposed their mission confessing to mary that they were foreign operatives pretending to work for herod we wanted to drive him insane searching for an imaginary newborn king of the jews they explained but now we find that the story we invented is true you cant stay here soon herod will wonder why we havent reported to him if he learns about your baby from another source his soldiers will come here and kill you all what happened next proves that mary and the shepherds werent part of a rebel scheme if theyd been rebels theyd have realized that the magi were on their side theyd have admitted they were rebels and tried to join forces with the magi to weaken herod but they didnt instead the two groups separated and fled the magi chose a new route eastward toward home and acted as decoys meanwhile joseph hurried with mary and jesus southwest toward egypt he claimed that hed had another dream this one urging him to take his family and run a spy would argue that the dream was a cover story to protect the magi in case joseph was caught and questioned it was believable because as i mentioned the house of davidto which joseph belongedhad a tradition of respecting dreams and acting on them for the same reason the magi claimed that they too had experienced a dream that urged them to return home if questioned they could maintain that they werent being disloyal to herod but were simply responding to the same dictates of their faith that had told them to follow the star whether herod would have believed either of these stories is debatable but at least they had a backup plan matthews gospel notes that joseph mary and jesus fled by night something the magi would have urged them to do teaching them how to cross the desert in the darkness the magi themselves disappear at this point as good spies should but the man who told me this version of the christmas story believed that the magi eventually rejoined jesus mary and joseph in egypt teaching them the tricks of tradecraft such as how to spot signs that they were under surveillance how to recruit operativesor what the gospels call disciplesand how to detect double agents the last part makes me certain that jesus knew judas would betray him indeed perhaps jesus ordered judas to betray him in order to fulfill a prophecy the spy world is a complicated place but this is a christmas story not an easter one cole interrupted him you said you had a theory about why joseph wasnt with mary when the magi talked to her yes given his immense responsibility joseph became more a protective agent than a husband and father while the magi spoke with mary joseph watched the street outside on guard against herods soldiers in the future he would spend increasingly less time with mary and jesus because he was always arranging for their security like the magi he soon disappears from the gospels completely as a good security officer should nowhere in the gospels is he quoted directly he hovers invisibly in the background but you said there were gross parts cole objected several they all involve herod contrary to what the magi hoped he didnt chase the phantom accounts that popped up here and there all over the country his erratic behavior didnt destabilize israel instead he did something so disturbing that no one could have predicted it even taking into account his past actions when herod realized hed been tricked his fury prompted him to send his men to bethlehem and the other villages in that area the soldiers obeyed his orders and slaughtered every male child who was two years old or less herod couldnt be certain when exactly the new king had been born by choosing the wide margin of two years he felt certain hed eliminated the threat every boy who was two years old or less cole sounded shocked yet fascinated i heard about that but i never realized how many boys did he kill perhaps as many as a hundred tradition says it was a far greater number but the population of the area that included bethlehem wasnt large enough for there to be thousands of children even so the mass murder of a hundred children would have felt like thousands the effect on the region was catastrophic if a revolution was indeed being planned this slaughter of children was so startling that now no one dared move against herod how can you fight someone so psychotic that in his will he had made arrangements for several hundred men to have their throats slit at his funeral he gave that order because he wanted tears to be shed at his death it didnt matter if the tears were for him or for the slaughtered men all he cared about was that his subjects would be griefstricken so from one point of view the magis plan went terribly wrong they hoped to destabilize herods government and instead they caused a slaughter but from another point of view that mass murder had an unintentional positive effect by killing every other male child around bethlehem herod insured that the baby jesus was the only surviving child born when and where the king of peace was prophesied to appear the census turned out to be crucial it not only brought mary and joseph to bethlehem to fulfill the prophecy but it also provided written proof that jesus was born there as for herod after the children were slaughtered a mysterious illness overcame him an eyewitness reported that the king felt consumed with fire he convulsed his legs swelled with water his bowels developed ulcers his penis rotted and developed worms worms on his ewww gross cole said i warned you the historical records say that the king breathed with violent quickness exuding a terrible odor his agony lasted for a long time which i confess gives me satisfaction after he finally died the officials in charge of his funeral refused to obey his edict so no men were murdered when he was buried but what killed him the boy asked one theory is that he had chronic kidney disease another says he had a raging type of skin cancer my own belief is that he suffered from whats called the flesheating disease basically he was devoured by his own bacteria it couldnt have happened to a more deserving person his evil consumed him but what interests me is how did it happen to him was it bad luck was it gods will or do you suppose a spy had something to do with it touching herod with a contaminated cloth that caused the disease well never know when an espionage mission is successful we never realize what was actually involved but i like to think herod was assassinated with what we now refer to as a biological weapon kagan paused and thats the spys version of christmas suddenly the baby cried out one moment it was silent the next it wailed as if struck by all the pain and fear in the world and this time kagan was absolutely sure its beginning he said morrell david the spy who came for christmas part four the child of peace morrell david the spy who came for christmas cole get behind the television cabinet meredith take the baby into the laundry room as the babys wail persisted kagan sank from the leather chair and gripped his pistol with two hands ignoring the pain in his left arm although he realized the notion was crazy every instinct told him that the baby was telling him something crying out to warn him he hadnt survived these many years without relying on his instincts and right now they were clanging like alarm bells andreill come from the front he reminded himself pulse racing hell try to distract me while the others attack from the sides his usual method the same as at the hotel he knows ill expect it but that doesnt matter its the best tactic for this location nonetheless while kagan stared through the window toward the falling snow and the barely visible coyote fence he didnt see anyone stalking forward maybe im imagining things he hoped maybe they really went away but he knew that if they were watching the house for sure they could hear the baby now his ears hurt from the wail how can i listen for somebody breaking in the wail ended as abruptly as it had begun kagan heard a scraping sound it came from meredith desperately pulling the wicker basket into the shadows of the laundry room where she would try to conceal the baby behind the washer and dryer the house became unnaturally still maybe i let my nerves get the better of me kagan thought although he couldnt bring himself to believe it it could be that the babys crying only because he needs his diaper changed at once kagan saw a hint of the gate being opened and closed a figure emerging from the snowfall kagan raised his gun compensating for the weight of the sound suppressor as he aimed does andrei think the snow hide him i can shoot him now then i only need to worry about but the light above the front door reflected off the snow revealing that the figures coat was pale gray and not the black of andreis ski jacket instead of andreis watchmans cap the man wore a billed cap with earflaps the figure was andreis height but thinwithout andreis broad shoulders when the man came closer kagan saw that he had a mustache meredith what hurry into the living room somebodys coming does your husband have a mustache is this him kagan heard her footsteps on the brick floor as she scurried through the darkness again he didnt need to remind her to stay low i she stared out the window a breath caught in her throat yes thats ted the front door was to the right of the window kagan shifted to the left remaining in the shadows pressing himself close to the window he stared along the front of the house he didnt see anyone hiding there not that he could see the entire length of the house but he saw enough to take a chance the angle the man followed would lead him to the side door and kagan didnt want him entering from that direction there wasnt a window kagan didnt have a way to check for anyone hiding beyond that other door it would be easy for someone to rush in behind ted meredith open the front door tell him to come in that way she studied kagan even in the shadows he saw the contour of the swelling bruises on her cheek and the side of her mouth he wont hit you again i promise meredith nodded ending her hesitation she twisted the dead bolt and opened the door the outside light exposed her as cold air streamed into the living room she called out ted come in over here meredith the voice was unsteady perhaps from alcohol are these footprints out here the snow almost filled them but they seem to go toward the house did someone show up while i was gone get inside meredith told him firmly did i hear a baby cry a few seconds ago ted for heavens sake its cold get in here ted approached the door meredith im begging you to forgive me he said the worst thing i ever did in my life was hit you id give anything to take it back i cant tell you how sorry i am snow flurried in ted took off his gloves and stepped through the door he cast a shadow from the outside light those footprintswho made them meredith quickly shut and locked the door in a rush kagan knocked teds legs from under him dropped him chest first on the floor pressed the glock against the back of his head and told him put your hands behind your neck whats going on is that a gun put your hands behind your neck and link your fingers who the kagan gripped teds hair and rapped his forehead on the bricks ouch do what youre told meredith keep looking out the window she took kagans place in the chair trembling ted obeyed kagans orders and put his hands behind his neck linking his fingers his breath smelled faintly of whiskey but his speech wasnt slurred making kagan think that he hadnt drunk any alcohol in a couple of hours what the hell is going on pay attention kagan ordered is anybody out there what do you mean whod be kagan rapped teds forehead on the bricks harder this time hey youre hurting me thats the whole idea ted whos out there its christmas eve for heavens sake plenty of people are out there in the lane no on canyon road i asked about the lane its deserted this far from canyon road there arent many decorations why would anybody be in the lane who the hell are you hold still keeping his pistol against the back of teds neck kagan used his injured arm and painfully searched him he started at teds right ankle moving up his leg probing his hips and groin hey ted objected kagan ignored him checking his left leg and then the rest of his body he didnt find any weapons he did feel a wallet but not what he was searching for the cell phones kagan said if he could get his hands on one of them he could call for help you left here with two cell phones yours and merediths how did you know that why do you care about where are they stolen what on canyon road ted answered somebody knocked against me and kept going through the crowd then i realized that my coat felt lighter i reached in my pockets the cell phones were gone somebody took the cell phones but not your wallet in my coat pocket they were easy to get but my wallets under my coat meredith who is this guy how did he get in the house shut up while i decide if i believe you kagan told him why wouldnt you believe me i dont know who you are buddy but this is between my wife and me okay kagans instincts told him to let ted keep talking on the chance that he might inadvertently say something useful ted looked imploringly at his wife meredith i swear ive never been sorrier for anything in my life whatever this guy wants you and i can deal with him but we cant solve anything if you dont forgive me after what i did to you i walked and walked i felt so bad id have stepped in front of a truck if canyon road hadnt been closed to traffic you can come to your hands and knees kagan said everybody was enjoying the carolers and the christmas lights but all i wanted was to kill myself teds voice was strained as he glanced around the murky living room i dont know what made me notice it but i saw an old adobe building with a sign that said the friends it struck me as some kind of come to your knees kagan ordered put your hands in your coat pockets ted obeyed shifting his knees to avoid the folds of his coat awkwardly stuffing his hands into the pockets he kept talking the entire time think about it meredith the one night of the year i surely needed a friend somebody to straighten me out and heres this sign kagan remained at the side of the living room away from the window you can stand now in the shadows ted rose unsteadily almost losing his balance because his hands were in his coat pockets he seemed too nervous to stop talking i went in and there were people sitting on benches along the walls of a big room nobody said a word they had their heads down i didnt understand until i saw a plaque on the wall the religious society of friends ted paused again he looked around the living room they were quakers meredith i remembered reading in the newspaper that the quakers have a meeting hall on canyon road the people with their heads downthey were praying i sat on one of the benches and realized that it had been years since id prayed id almost forgotten how to do it and god knows i had lots to pray for you cole the strength to quit drinking ted kept looking around the living room although kagan couldnt say why there was something about teds behavior that made him uneasy after a while they raised their heads and began talking with each other their voices were so peaceful their faces almost glowed they looked at me as if i was the most welcome person in the world one of them brought me a cup of coffee they didnt pry but i knew they understood the pain i was in thats where ive been all this time meredith waiting to get sober enough to come home i couldnt help asking myself where my life was going and what i was doing to you and cole and cole where are you son are you okay im here coles muffled voice came from a corner of the living room behind the television cabinet what are you doing back there hiding from what did this guy hurt you if he no meredith insisted cutting him off he didnt hurt us then somebody tell me whats going on three men followed me kagan said followed you what are you talking about just shut up and listen theyre tall heavy toughlooking in their midforties one of them has a face like its been chiseled from a block of wood thick eyebrows a scar on his left cheek a strong jaw youre sure you didnt see someone who looks like that out there i told you the lanes empty i didnt see anybody after i left the crowd on canyon road hey put the gun down its making me nervous its supposed to keep your hands in your pockets its too dark in here i cant see your face meredith turn on some lights no kagan said three guys followed you what do they want ted paused seeming to focus his thoughts im sure i heard a baby crying where is it ted stepped to the back of the living room glancing left and right his eyes adjusted to the shadows why are all these drawers lying in the hallway outside the bedrooms kagan followed as ted moved toward the kitchen he grabbed teds hand when he reached to turn on a light switch ted spoke again his voice louder why are you boiling get back in here kagan yanked him into the living room something bothered kagan about what hed found or rather hadnt found when hed searched ted no weapons not surprising a wallet but no cell phones the explanation for the missing cell phones made a degree of sense christmas eve was a perfect time to be a pickpocket crowds confusion items in an outside pocket were easy to steal compared to a wallet underneath the coat but there was something else that troubled kagan it nagged at the corner of his mind something missing something every man carried in his pants pocket ted where are your keys what when i searched you i didnt find any keys how did you expect to get back in the house my keys i didnt a gain ted paused as if focusing his thoughts i guess i was so drunk i forgot them no meredith said you had them in your pocket you wanted to take the range rover but i insisted that you were too drunk to drive thats when you hit me i told you canyon road was closed to traffic and you hit me again but i guess you finally got the messagebecause you walked off instead of driving i told you im sorry meredith ill keep saying it as often as i need to i was wrong you had every reason to try to keep me from driving ill never take another drink and i swear to god ill never hit you again stop changing the subject kagan said where are your keys for a third time ted paused the pickpocket he must have taken them i must have been too drunk to realize it the thief managed to lift two cell phones and your car keys but not your wallet the keys were in my coat pocket with the cell phones i remember now they wouldnt have been hard to get for a fourth time ted paused then he spoke again loudly i know i heard a baby crying why are you speaking like that ted cocked his head the cry seemed to come from the kitchen no the laundry room why do you keep pausing i have no idea what youre talking about i just want to know whats going on youre giving me a bad feeling ted the laundry room a very bad feeling those men outsidedid you lie about them why would i did they promise theyd let you and meredith and cole go free that they wouldnt hurt you if you helped them i told you nobodys out there ted protested the sudden deeper unsteadiness in his voice made kagan more apprehensive theyre killers ted whatever they told you isnt true they have a strict rule about not leaving witnesses meredith turned from crouching near the window ted dear god did you lie to us of course not are they out there are you helping them im not helping anybody ted answered much too fast on your knees again kagan ordered my knees you keep pausing while you talk are you listening to someone why is your hat still on kagan kicked the back of teds legs and dropped him to his knees he yanked off teds hat with the earflaps gone he probed teds right ear but found nothing hey ted objected trying to twist away kagan probed teds left ear his stomach turning when he found something that blocked it sick he pulled out the earbud wheres the microphone microphone kagan whacked his gun barrel against the side of teds forehead you stupid fool give me the damned microphone ted groaned raising a hand to his head the microphone kagan hit him again with the gun barrel where is it under my coat collar kagan found it and pulled it free wheres the transmitter in one of my gloves when you knocked me down i shoved it under that chair grabbing for it kagan shouted meredith you know where to go hurry cole he told them youre hiding behind the television cabinet youll need to find another spot but they promised they wouldnt hurt us ted insisted his voice rising id never put my son in danger thats exactly what you did no all i care about is protecting my family meredith i was only trying to help you and cole surely you understand that pay attention kagan demanded who are you going to believe your wife and son who trust me or those men outside wholl do anything to get their hands on the baby i promise you they wont think twice about killing us all they never leave witnesses all i wanted was for gods sake shut up and help your family crouching in the living room kagan listened as meredith hurried toward the laundry room where shed hidden the baby he had no idea what new hiding place cole had chosen and he didnt dare ask aware that andrei would hear through the microphone hed taken from brody he was about to shut off the transmitter or relieve his anger by hurling the microphone onto the brick floor and smashing it but suddenly he realized he had a use for it he shoved the earbud into his left ear and spoke into the microphone andrei regrets my friend the voice sounded bitter i warned you how this would end instinctively kagan directed his words toward the front window there are computers in the house i emailed for help the police are on their way no pyotyr when i rehearsed things with my notsogood spy he told me his computers have password locks password locks kagan repeated staring at ted ted seemed paralyzed by confusion abruptly he murmured ill fix that he crawled across the living room squirmed over the drawers at the end of the hallway and entered his office give me the package and my offer still holds andreis acid voice said through the earbud you can walk away why dont i believe you kagan said into the microphone then consider this your foolishness has involved other people youre responsible for everything that happens to the family in there their deaths will be your fault kagan couldnt help glancing behind him first toward the shadows of the laundry room where meredith hid with the baby and then toward a glow in teds office presumably caused by a computer screen he heard teds fingers clicking at a keyboard wheres cole he wondered but if you give me the package andreis voice said ill let the family live even though theyre witnesses only the man saw us but ill make an exception and allow him to live along with his wife and son well be out of santa fe before the police get organized i dont risk much by letting the family survive its my gesture to you pyotyr because i valued your friendship even though you didnt value mine give me the package accept your punishment since you apparently have a conscience at least youll know that others wont suffer because of you its a baby andrei not a package if i do as you ask what happens to him our clients will keep it to use it to pressure hassan into rejecting his cause and going back to being a doctor thats a better way than assassinating him and turning him into a martyr in his speeches hassan promises his followers that hell be tireless in his pursuit of a lasting peace when he swears ill never let you down thousands flock to him if he quits his followers will be so disillusioned that his cause will wither and a year from now two years from now what happens to the child then kagan demanded hassan and his wife will be allowed occasional secret visits theres a birthmark on its left heel yes shaped like a rose proof that its still alive that there hasnt been a substitution to keep anything from happening to it hassan and his wife wont dare to take up the cause again you keep calling the baby it not it andrei he a person pyotyr you know there are only objects if youd remembered that you wouldnt be having this problem whats your real name kagan ignored the question he had an urgent one of his own hassans enemies will they raise his child yes until hes old enough to be trained as a suicide bomber the statement felt like a blow to kagans stomach something in him went numb only after a moment did he realize that andrei had referred to the child as he not it whats your real name andrei repeated train him to be a suicide bomber kagan felt sickened unable to speak ted crawled from his office and reached kagan who tapped the microphone against his leg to prevent andrei from hearing what ted whispered i have phone capability on my computers but when i tried the santa fe police all i got was a busy signal the snow must have caused a lot of accidents i sent an email to people i know in santa fe telling them to contact the police and get a swat team here kagan nodded doing his best to look optimistic still he couldnt help thinking its christmas eve is this the one night of the year when people wont check their email or will their phone calls only jam the phone circuits more how many hours might it take before the police arrive the glow from teds office made him feel exposed he whispered to ted the light from your monitors shut them off immediately he stopped tapping the microphone and said to it my real name its what i told you its pyotyr i didnt lie about everything our friendships real of course and your last name andreis voice asked you know i wont tell you that i need to protect my family your family andrei sounded indignant you mean you have a wife and you didnt tell me no how could i work undercover this long and be married dont you think i want a wife and children like you do dont you think i envy you my mother and father theyre my family kagan said it with a subdued wave of grief his parents were in fact deadthe victims of a drunk driver whod hit their car headon two years earlier but he needed to try to make andrei relate to him as a person and parents who were still alive gave him a sympathetic reason not to reveal his last name and you work for american intelligence yes you admit it finally some truth andrei remember the day we drove down to the gun dealer in maryland to pick up that load of weapons the pakhan wanted we made the dealer add our glocks as a bonus we spent the afternoon on the firing range testing whos a better shot and my glock will be the gun that kills you listen to me in the last few years i cant recall a better afternoon kagan said he concentrated on the kitchen door ready to shoot if someone charged in i am your friend andrei i was honored to be invited to your home i felt privileged to be with your wife and daughters theyre the family i never had remember when i saved your life in colombia dont make too much of that pyotyr kagan shifted his attention to the shadows in the hallway listening for someone breaking in that drug lord was seriously pissed off when he realized the sovietera submarine youd sold him would sink the first time he tried to use it to smuggle cocaine into the united states im the one who spotted the ambush in that parking garage you were ahead of me and the other men i could have left you and run like the others did but i got you out of there when no one else tried and as thanks ill make your death instantaneous some things cant be faked andrei our friendship is one of them youd have sensed immediately if i was playing a game i never told my controllers about anything that you were personally involved in i never did anything that put you at risk except when you stole the baby kagan noticed that andrei said the baby and not the package that gave him a reason to hope no one is more ruthless than our clients andrei insisted if i dont deliver what they paid us to get theyll never stop hunting me the pakhan too will never stop hunting me theres an alternative kagan kept pacing checking the kitchen door and the hallway i cant imagine what it could be come over to my side your side work for us defect andrei made the concept sound outrageous just pretend its the cold war join american intelligence and you make this proposal on a radio frequency to which my comrades are listening is this the quality of tradecraft your controllers taught you its the only way i have of talking with you listen to me andrei working for my side is better than stealing babies dont you have a personal low a point beyond which youd despise yourself isnt there ever a time when you feel ashamed worse than that disgusted andrei fell silent thats what ive been feeling for a very long time kagan continued selfdisgust i do whats necessary for business andreis voice replied but there are other ways to earn a living your wife doesnt have any idea how many people youve killed to pay for that nice house near the beach your daughters dont know how much blood it took to earn their tuition at that wonderful private school they attend how do you suppose theyd react if they found out what you really are one day government agents will pound on your door or else one night rival gangsters will go to your home and shut up andrei you once said we didnt have a choice about our lives well now im giving you a chance to take control join me wouldnt it be great to tell your wife and daughters the truth about what you do and to know its honorable my people will relocate them kagan said into the microphone youll all receive new identities your wife and daughters will be protected you wont need to be afraid for them kagan hoped it was true he couldnt help recalling the fear with which his parents and he had lived despite the best promises of the state department youll earn an honest salary doing good for a change kagan said wouldnt it feel wonderful to give the child of peace a chance to fulfill his destiny destiny andrei mocked you sound like a politician when i was running from you tonight i felt as if the baby was trying to communicate with me to tell me where to go and warn me when you were close your wound made you hallucinate but i believe the baby does have a destiny andrei his fathers amazing a powerful inspiring leader who preaches hope instead of hate imagine how much more amazing his son can be maybe our destiny is to guarantee that he fulfills his why dont we make sure the baby gets back to his parents then the clients and the pakhan would hunt down both of us neither our deaths nor those of my family would be quick that wont happen if we hunt them first andrei we can make them sorry they ever thought of raising the baby to be a suicide bomber who was the monster who had that idea hows that for somebodys personal low lets show them were better than that lets show them were human beings kagan paused turning his head toward the outside entrance to the kitchen did i hear something a key being slid into a lock again he tapped the microphone against his leg so that andrei couldnt hear what he whispered to ted theres a pot of boiling water on the stove put it on top of the microwave when i shout now push the microwaves start button the timers already set kagan was close enough that even in the shadows he saw teds forehead tighten in confusion i dont have time to explain ted for meredith and cole just do it theyre depending on you ted hesitated then surprised him by nodding whatever you want ive got a hell of a lot to make up for staying low ted hurried into the kitchen kagan stopped tapping the microphone against his leg he clipped it to his shirt andrei are you still there the snow must be interfering with the radio transmission all i heard was interference im afraid its a little late for me to pretend to be a human being pyotyr andreis voice responded is the baby somewhere safe again kagan noted that andrei said the baby and not the package he kept hoping hed gotten through to him yes hes somewhere safe i think ted was right when he said the laundry room merry christmas there was something about the firmness with which andrei said the last two words abruptly the baby cried out in the laundry room bullets punched holes in the front window spraying shards of glass into the living room the shots were silent by contrast the crash of the glass and the impact of the bullets against the back wall were shockingly loud but not so loud that kagan didnt hear a window shatter in the master bedroom someone was breaking in theyll come from three directions now ted now he yelled turn it on in spite of the babys wail he heard the hum of the microwave as ted stayed low and rushed back into the living room a crackling sound came from the kitchen kagan saw periodic flashes through the archway the crumpled tinfoil in the microwave arcing like miniature lightning the door to the kitchen banged open a hunched silhouette charged in shooting at everything before him his bullets walloping walls and cupboards the soundsuppressed shots themselves inaudible in the commotion suddenly a loud crack was accompanied by a blinding glare in the microwave the heated glue burst from its plastic tube the arcs from the tinfoil igniting its highly volatile vapor as the microwave exploded in a fireball kagan saw the oven door rocket toward the gunman at the same time that the pot of scalding water catapulted off the oven spraying over him smoke from the explosion filled the kitchen hearing screams kagan ran through the archway saw a figure writhing in agony on the floor and shot him twice in the head the gunman was yakov in the confines of the kitchen kagans soundsuppressed shots made noises like muted snaps from a nail gun he rushed to the kitchen door slammed it shut and twisted the lock the smoke thickened he saw flames licking the cupboard above where the fireball had erupted from the microwave are you all right ted yelled from the living room his voice sounded farther away because kagans ears rang from the explosion the kitchens on fire kagan shouted back their voices overlapped as ted yelled someones in the master bedroom i heard something falling eyes watering from the smoke kagan crouched next to the archway that opened into the living room he wiped his sleeve across his eyes and aimed along the corridor that led to the other end of the house behind him the flames grew now the smoke reflected it the illumination making him feel exposed air brushed past his head again again bullets someone was shooting from the end of the corridor the noise barely audible the gunmans sound suppressor hid the muzzle flashes too making it difficult for kagan to judge exactly where to aim he squeezed off two quick shots toward the master bedroom he hated to use the ammunition on a target he couldnt see but he needed to make the gunman stay in the bedroom ted youll soon hear another explosion when it happens dont hesitate run into the kitchen and try to put out the fire ted didnt answer ted kagan shouted he heard what you told me to do hell wait for me to run hell shoot when he sees me in the light from the fire just trust me do what i say again ted didnt answer the only sound was the crackle of the flames growing on the cupboard door kagan tried desperately not to cough he felt another streak of air sweep past him and shot toward the end of the corridor simultaneously three bullets shattered more glass in the living room window someoneprobably andreiwas shooting from the front the baby wailed ted kagan yelled the only way meredith and the baby can leave the laundry room is through the kitchen youve got to put out the fire before theyre trapped i promised ill do whatever you want just tell me when get ready kagan squeezed the trigger again and again his bullets were directed toward the floor at the end of the hallway toward the pressurized cans of hair spray and shaving soap hed placed there they were thirty yards away difficult targets even in daylight as the fire grew behind him all he could do was keep shooting he assumed that the gunman having been warned would duck back from the master bedrooms doorway and take cover thatalong with the bursting cansshould provide ted the protection he needed to get into the kitchen kagan hoped taking one more shot he flinched as a sharp bang assaulted his ears a can exploded spraying the end of the hallway with chunks of metal and pressurized liquid now ted now but ted was already in motion racing past him into the kitchen he stumbled over yakovs corpse grabbed the kitchen table to catch his balance and veered toward the sink the force of his movement parted the smoke and brightened the flames that wavered up the cupboard next to the kitchen door almost out of ammunition kagan thought he heard water running in the sink the clatter of a saucepan water splashing into it steam hissed as ted hurled the water against the burning cupboard the light from the flames diminished again water splashed into the saucepan again ted hurled it against the cupboard its out he yelled the thickening shadows told kagan the same thing yakovs gun he thought if i can reach it he risked switching his gaze from the hallway and focused on the corpse next to him but the bright flames had hurt his night vision and he couldnt adapt to the dark again to see the gun more bullets snapped past him but this time they were directed behind him toward the floor kagan realized that the flames must have illuminated the pressurized cans hed placed next to the kitchen door the gunman was imitating his tactic ted get over by the sink the sharp bang with which one of the cans exploded felt like hands slapping kagans ears in agony kagan tried to recover from the shock aiming along the hallway he saw a figure lunge from the master bedroom he knows im down to my last few rounds the gunman had mikhails bulky silhouette he must have put in a fresh magazine kagan realized because he kept shooting as if he had an endless supply of ammunition having been warned about the drawers that lay on the floor mikhail veered this way and that the zigzag movement confused kagans aim as mikhail kept shooting kagan fired once twice but then his gun was useless its slide locking back its magazine empty certain that he was about to die he rolled frantically toward yakovs body next to him searching for the gun but his wounded arm was so stiff that it restricted his movement doubly certain that he would die he felt a bullet strike the brick floor spraying fragments over him he kept pawing for yakovs gun but couldnt find it without warning mikhail stumbled sprawling facedown onto a drawer something about the way he fell struck kagan as strange but there wasnt time to think about it as he unclipped the knife from his pocket and surged up the hook on the back of the knife levered against his pocket and pulled the blade open charging he saw mikhails shadowy figure peer up from the floor and raise his pistol kagan slashed the back of mikhails wrist causing him to drop the gun but as kagan slashed again mikhail used his uninjured hand to grab his ankle and yank him off balance kagan fell heavily when he hit the floor he crunched across broken glass managing to come to his feet at the same moment that mikhail rose and dove forward despite their injured arms they grappled viciously sliding on the shards of glass kagan fought to stab his opponent while mikhail struggled to get the knife away from him kagans heart sped so wildly that the precise movements necessary for martialarts combat became impossible he and mikhail were like two large animals colliding with each other mikhail was heavier able to make his weight a weapon he used his uninjured hand to squeeze kagans knife wrist spinning him then he curled his bloodslick arm around kagans neck strangling him from behind kagan felt increasing pressure against his larynx something crashed andreis breaking through the front window kagan thought but the crash was accompanied by a blow from behind that sent mikhail lurching forward ted hit him with something in a frenzy kagan squirmed free of mikhails grip he tried to slice with the blade but again mikhail grabbed that wrist the force of their struggle knocked kagan against the back wall of the corridor his head smashed the glass of a picture hanging there jolted from the impact he tried to knee mikhail in the groin but succeeded only in striking a thigh as the russian pinned him against the wall straining to get the knife away from him kagan stomped down hard on a foot and heard a groan to the right he sensed the open door to teds office and used all his strength to pivot with mikhail thrusting him through the doorway the trip cord caught behind mikhails ankles kagan added to the russians backward momentum by shoving when they hit the floor kagan was on top his impact knocking the air from mikhails lungs the russians grip loosened enough for kagan to yank his knife hand free screaming with fury he plunged the blade into mikhails throat all the way to the handle and felt the russian thrash he worked the knife back and forth widening the hole grating against bone feeling the hot blood gush over his fingers mikhails mouth gaped in a desperate effort to breathe his arms fought to push kagan away he gasped the blood causing a rattle in his throat his arms lost strength kagan kept twisting the knife at last mikhails hands fell away trembled and lay still only then did kagan let go of the knife andrei he thought frantically dizzy from his frenzied breathing he scrambled toward where mikhail had dropped his pistol he grabbed the gun hurried into the living room crouched and aimed toward the bullet holes in the front window huge chunks of glass had fallen into the room the snow was drifting in where was andrei kagans ears rang painfully from the laundry room the baby kept crying its wail seeming to come through cotton batting but kagan noticed something oddinexplicably the window was broken only at the top half every bullet had been directed upward where the least possible harm would result what the look out ted shouted behind him spinning kagan saw a dark figure lurch from the office mikhails throat gaped wheezing spewing blood the knife was no longer embedded there it was in his hand and as he thrust the blade toward kagan ted surged from the kitchen crashing into him the impact sent ted and mikhail toppling onto the floor raging mikhail swung the knife at ted who kicked and fought to squirm away the knife grazed teds cheek making him groan but he was far enough away that kagan could shoot without fear of hitting him he put two bullets behind mikhails right ear and when the russian collapsed this time kagan had no doubt that he was dead andrei wheres andrei kagan whirled again toward the front window he was drenched in sweat his breathing was frantic he knew that barely two minutes had elapsed but the intensity of the fight had made the passage of time seem much longer the baby kept wailing then suddenly it stopped at once kagan heard andreis voice but this time it didnt come from the radios earbud instead it came faintly from the area outside the house although kagan had the sense that andrei was shouting the explosions had traumatized his ears enough that he had to strain to hear what was being said pyotyr the voice called dont say a word shut off your radio transmitter wary kagan didnt respond do you hear me andrei shouted shut off the transmitter whats he up to kagan wondered tense he did as he was asked okay its off kagans words seemed to come from inside a tunnel i figured you were the one who survived otherwise yakov or mikhail would have opened the door its nice to know you have confidence in me more than you can imagine andrei said by the way i shut off my radio transmitter also the clients and the pakhan cant hear us what are you doing kagan aimed toward the halfbroken window more snow flurried through it all your shots were aimed high if youd continued the attack from the front id have been killed you mentioned destiny i figured id let mikhail and yakov decide it for me if they won then the child was meant to be delivered to our clients i thought you didnt believe in destiny kagan kept aiming through the window of course i do im russian tell me why you held back things happened tonight pyotyr yeah it was a busy christmas eve the pakhan called me certain names andrei said names hooyesos govnosos kachok koshkayob thats a lot of disrespect he sided with the clients against me he threatened me worse he threatened my family and nobody threatens your family believe it pyotyr suppose i do defect where do you think i should ask for my wife and daughters to be relocated you know anna what would she like considering tonights weather i think someplace warm kagan was reminded of why his parents had chosen miami or perhaps shes tired of living near water and would enjoy a change of scenery thats something youll need to discuss with her as soon as we finish here andrei said from the front of the house you and i have hunting to do if im going to switch sides i cant leave my enemies alive to come after me and my family kagan heard a voice behind him it belonged to ted who was saying something urgently then kagan realized that ted wasnt speaking to anyone in the house and that hed done something remarkable andrei he said through the shattered window ted turned out to have more nerve than we imagined he risked his life to save his wife and son now he searched one of the bodies to get a cell phone hes talking to the police how he got through ill never know but he did i mention that in case you have a surprise planned you think im not telling the truth i think that if this is a trick to grab the baby youve got less than five minutes to make your move what kind of friends dont trust each other andrei chided actually youre the one who has less than five minutes if were going to make this work we need to get out of here right away when i gave yakov the key to the house i kept the car keys i used them a few minutes ago to back the range rover out of the garage i dont hear it i wouldnt expect you to given what those explosions must have done to your ears what caused them the big one was a microwave i blew up always resourceful im sure yakov and mikhail were startled enough to lose their momentum for certain yakov did the bastard shouldnt have run away when that drug lord tried to kill me in colombia pyotyr make up your mind if you want me to defect you need to get out here and help me do whats necessary the snowfall was now so thick that kagan could hardly see anything beyond the window is he trying to fool me into showing myself he wondered andrei do you know what santa fe means someone in the crowd mentioned it tonight holy faith i guess its time to have some faith of my own anything for the baby kagan thought i need to keep andrei occupied i need to keep him away from the house all right im coming out he turned toward ted who lowered the cell phone and told him a swat team and an ambulance are on the way thank god meredith said she stepped from the laundry room appearing through the smoke that lingered in the kitchen the lights outside provided enough illumination to show kagan that she held the baby are you all right he asked scared sick she glanced nervously toward yakovs body then quickly away and the baby he isnt hurt kagan felt a momentary relief that was suddenly broken wait a minute wheres cole cole teds voice was stark where are you son cole meredith looked around desperately kagan almost panicked fearing that the boy had been shot but then he heard a faint voice im here cole said he limped from the shadowy hallway dragging his baseball bat he made his way unsteadily among the drawers on the floor even in the shadows mikhails body was obvious it made cole stop cole can you see me ted asked keep your eyes on me dont look down son im coming to get you broken glass scraped under teds shoes as he walked over he picked up his son and lifted him over the corpse when ted set him down kagan put a reassuring hand on coles shoulder hed been puzzled by something that had happened during the gunfight but now he understood cole when i told you to find a new hiding place where did you go kagan asked you came from the hallway were you in the bathroom yes cole sounded as if he was in shock i was lying in the bathtub the second man charged from the master bedroom kagan continued but i was out of ammunition the only thing that gave me time to grab my knife was that he tripped of course meredith said he tripped on one of the drawers you set down no he knew about the drawers kagan told her and he was moving confidently i dont think it was a drawer that tripped him then what happened ted asked why did he fall youd better ask cole i dont understand what are you talking about tell them cole kagan said your mother and father should know how brave you are brave ted sounded baffled the boy hesitated i had to help with all the noise the man didnt hear me crawl out of the bathtub when he ran past i stuck out my bat you tripped him meredith asked in amazement cole fidgeted with the baseball bat i didnt know what else to do meredith spoke softly my dear brave boy hes more than a boy kagan said i hear sirens cole said looking up with little time remaining kagan stepped toward meredith and the baby she held he put a finger on the tiny forehead the child of peace lord i hope so grow strong and healthy little guy make me believe that its possible to have peace on earth and goodwill to all andrei yelled from outside there was nervousness in his voice now the sirens pyotyr kagan looked at ted your left cheeks bleeding what ted jerked a hand to his face and touched the blood might have been flying glass or no the knife did it its deep im afraid youll have a scar thats good i dont understand itll remind me of what i almost lost ted turned toward meredith and cole kagan did the same meredith did anyone ever tell you how beautiful you are she glanced down in embarrassment if the lights had been on kagan was sure hed have seen her blushing ted dont you think shes beautiful very much tell her every day kagan went into the kitchen and pulled on his parka concealing mikhails blood that covered his shirt he shoved mikhails gun and his own glock into the right pocket of the coat he picked up yakovs gun and reloaded it with a remaining magazine he found on the corpse meredith tell the police everything that happened dont hold anything back you dont know anything that can harm me just say the truth and cole dont forget the story about the magi the spys version of christmas the boy sounded dazed what story is that ted asked your son will tell you pyotyr andreis voice warned from outside the police we dont have much time ted walk with me they moved to the front door when i fought with the second man i felt something crash against him did you hit him from behind kagan asked with a lamp blood dripped from teds cheek there might be hope for you yet have you ever fired a gun no you point the barrel and pull the trigger there are refinements but basically thats it is there a reason you want me to know this take this gun the man you spoke to the one with the creased face and the thick eyebrows if he tries to come inside the house dont let him you think he might break his word you think you might be walking into a trap its been known to happen kagan looked behind him cole whats a major rule of being a spy cole spoke numbly dont take anything for granted whats another rule always have a backup plan im proud of you kagan studied the boys father ted can i rely on you to stop that man if he tries to get inside anything to protect my family keep remembering that to protect your family you have my word if you ever forget if you ever hurt your wife and son one day ill come back and remind you of this conversation you wont need to ted held out his hand kagan shook it noting that despite everything that had happened teds grip was firm i believe you at the front door he looked back at the baby snuggling contentedly in merediths arms are you sending me another sign he wondered that everythings going to be okay enjoy your roses meredith thank you for saving our lives no need to thank me im the one who put you in danger we wouldnt be alive if all of you hadnt been strong kagan pointed toward cole ive known some professionals who arent as dependable well thank you anyway she said for keeping your promise she looked at ted and then back at kagan you gave me a christmas present as kagan gathered his resolve and reached for the doorknob she added you never told me your name the man outside called you pyotyr does that mean peter is that your name thats what he calls me meredith thought about it and nodded i understand whoever you are she replied merry christmas kagan opened the door and exposed himself to the overhead lights if andrei meant to shoot him this was his chance but nothing happened everythings an act of faith he thought shivering he stepped from the house and walked through the falling snow toward the gate he heard the faint rumble of an engine as he reached the lane he saw the dark shape of a range rover when i open the door thats when itll happen kagan thought snow pelting him the passenger window descended pyotyr you promised youd help i cant defect if the clients and the pakhan are hunting me and my family the last time theyll be together is tonight this is my only chance it might be a trick kagan thought but at least i saved the child from now on there wont be any lies he said hanging back my real name isnt pyotyr imagine that what a surprise its paul kagan stepped toward the door he hoped that his tone made andrei realize he was telling the truth ill never get used to calling you that then keep calling me pyotyr are you thinking about shooting me through the window andrei asked actually i was thinking about you and me doing some good kagan replied his hearing had improved sufficiently for him to realize that the sirens were nearer than he liked doing some good andrei thought about it and shrugged why not its better than stealing babies when kagan opened the passenger door he saw that both of andreis hands were placed firmly on the steering wheel nows the time if you want to shoot me andrei said im helpless kagan got in from the cold i cant imagine you ever being helpless kagan shut the door andrei put the range rover in gear and drove along the lane the deep snow crunched under the high vehicles tires a short time later he turned right onto canyon road where a few cars were now in motion do you hear that andrei asked kagan strained to listen the sirens the cathedral bells andrei said its midnight christmas the word made kagan think of his dead parents and the christmases he would never spend with them look behind us andrei said kagan turned the range rovers window had a heating element that melted the snow landing on it in the distance he saw the hazy red and blue flashing lights of police cars doing their best to move up canyon road the flashes reminded him of lights on a christmas tree then the snowfall strengthened obscuring them when andrei steered left onto another road the range rovers tire tracks blended with others he drove over a small bridge reached a stop sign waited for the lights of a car to go past and followed it to the left a few seconds later the lights of another car came along the street behind them andrei peered into the rearview mirror theyll be looking for a blue range rover downtowns only a couple of blocks away well find a parking lot and abandon the car it shouldnt be hard to find something else to steal no onell notice its gone until the morning sounds like a plan andrei pointed at twinkling lights on houses they passed where i grew up there wasnt any such thing as christmas after the soviet union collapsed and i snuck into the united states i was amazed by all the decorations only the decorations what about the christmas spirit since you appear to have developed a conscience maybe you can teach me you already have a conscience kagan said dont make me regret it andrei reached for something under his ski jacket for a moment kagan feared that andrei had fooled him and was drawing a gun he almost lunged to defend himself but then he realized that andrei was turning on the radio transmitter that was hooked to his belt this is melchior andrei said to the microphone on his coat i have the package he paused listening to his earbud as he drove through the slowmoving traffic its safe and ready for delivery the mudak is no longer in business andrei listened some more yes it was a pathetic attempt to persuade me to join his corporation in the end i made sure he realized what a fool he was the only person im loyal to is you again andrei listened the main thing is i corrected my mistake tell the clients i meant what i said when i deliver the package i want an apology along with a bonus well be there in half an hour oh and tell room service to deliver vodka for us andrei pressed a button on the transmitter turning it off a half hour that gives us time to prepare mudak thats a tough thing to call me kagan said its better than what the pakhan called me is your name truly paul im trusting you with it paul andrei tested the name no it wont do pyotyr after you help me defect perhaps you can spend next christmas with me and my family itll be a pleasure to see them again the babys safe kagan kept thinking nothing else matters i saved the baby i can bear sitting here trying to make jokes with andrei while we drive to a gunfight i can tolerate helping him whatever way he wants as long as the babys safe perhaps here in santa fe perhaps this is where anna and the girls would enjoy living andrei said a little too close to business dont you think i know how to blend you do indeed kagan admitted the mountains the light the quiet there are many things here theyd enjoy quiets a good thing kagan agreed thank god the babys safe he kept thinking his ears recovered sufficiently that he could now hear the cathedral bells do you have enough ammunition andrei asked my glocks empty i have a partially full magazine in mikhails pistol heres a spare magazine for the glock kagan watched warily as andrei reached into his ski jacket but when his hand came out it held only the magazine hed promised pyotyr maybe you can explain something to me whatever you want to know i told you that from now on ill be completely honest have you seen the movie its a wonderful life kagan overcame his confusion and answered many times my parents watched it every year im surprised you could watch it even once it mystifies me why do people like it so much dont you think that fat angel looks stupid and whats with james stewart hes too skinny he should have stuffed himself with more christmas dinners if he stuffed himself hed look just like the angel kagan said i didnt say he should stuff himself that much but the character he played was so trusting its a wonder he wasnt cheated out of everything he owned someone needs to make sure that doesnt happen to people kagan said the bells rang louder merry christmas andrei whatever that means andrei thought about it the same to you pyotyr merry christmas
